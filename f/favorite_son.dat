5|$|In the 1824 presidential election, Sharp alienated {{some of his}} {{constituency}} {{by supporting}} his former House colleague John C. Calhoun instead of Kentucky's <b>favorite</b> <b>son,</b> Henry Clay. When {{it was clear that}} Calhoun's bid would fail, Sharp threw his support behind Andrew Jackson. He served as secretary of a meeting of Jackson supporters in Frankfort on October 2, 1824.|$|E
5|$|The reforms enacted during Powell's term as {{governor}} gave Kentucky {{one of the}} top educational systems in the antebellum South. He also improved Kentucky's transportation system and vetoed legislation that he felt would have created an overabundance of banks in the Commonwealth. Powell's election {{as governor}} marked the end of Whig dominance in Kentucky. Powell's predecessor, John J. Crittenden, was the last governor elected from the party of the Commonwealth's <b>favorite</b> <b>son,</b> Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending {{to go to the}} convention with his Maryland delegation as a <b>favorite</b> <b>son,</b> uncommitted to any of the main candidates.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, {{he had to come}} down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In so doing, he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's <b>favorite</b> <b>son,</b> Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|Humphrey {{first entered}} presidential {{politics}} in 1952 {{running as a}} <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> candidate in Minnesota. In 1960, he mounted a full-scale run, winning primaries in South Dakota and Washington D.C., but ultimately lost the Democratic nomination to future President John F. Kennedy. In 1964, Humphrey was tapped as the running mate of President Lyndon Johnson, {{who went on to}} win in a landslide victory over Republican Barry Goldwater. As Vice President, Humphrey oversaw turbulent times in America, including race riots and growing frustration and anger over the large number of casualties in the Vietnam War. President Johnson's popularity had plummeted as the election grew closer.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy {{fought it}} out with McCarthy in the primaries, as Humphrey used <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> stand-ins to help him win delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Kennedy was assassinated, leaving Humphrey as McCarthy's main challenger. But Humphrey's {{organization}} was too strong for McCarthy to overcome, and his anti-war campaign was split after the late entrance of Senator George McGovern of South Dakota {{just ahead of the}} Democratic National Convention. Despite winning the popular vote, McCarthy lost to Humphrey at the convention amidst protests and riots.|$|E
50|$|The {{race was}} {{primarily}} a contest between Woodrow Wilson and Champ Clark. John Burke and Judson Harmon also ran, but they were <b>favorite</b> <b>sons</b> with little appeal outside of their home states.|$|R
50|$|On Feb. 12, 2010, the State of Oklahoma honored {{one of its}} <b>favorite</b> <b>sons,</b> James “Quick” Tillis of Tulsa. Gov. Brad Henry {{signed a}} {{declaration}} making Feb. 12 James “Quick” Tillis Day in Oklahoma.|$|R
50|$|One of Duplin's <b>favorite</b> <b>sons,</b> John Miller, was a {{postmaster}} and merchant in Duplin. He {{migrated to}} Leon County, Florida, with other North Carolinians in the 1830s-1840s {{and established a}} successful cotton plantation called Miccosukee Plantation.|$|R
5|$|Béla's <b>favorite</b> <b>son,</b> Béla, died in {{the summer}} of 1269. On 18 January 1270 the King's {{youngest}} daughter, the saintly Margaret, also died. In short order, Béla fell terminally ill. Before his death, he requested King Ottokar II of Bohemia, Princess Anna's son-in-law, to assist his wife, daughter and partisans in case they were forced to leave Hungary by his son. Béla died on Rabbits' Island on 3 May 1270. With his death at the age of 63, he exceeded in age most members of the House of Árpád. He was buried in the church of the Franciscans in Esztergom, but Archbishop Philip of Esztergom had his corpse transferred to the Esztergom Cathedral. The Minorites only succeeded in regaining Béla's remains after a long lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{was opposed}} in his {{re-election}} bid by Democratic Congressman Virgil M. Chapman, {{an ally of}} Earle C. Clements, who had been elected governor in 1947. As {{one of only a}} few Democrats who had voted in favor of the Taft–Hartley Act, Chapman had lost the support of organized labor, a key constituency for the Democrats. The Democratic-leaning Louisville Times endorsed Cooper, but the presence of Kentucky's <b>favorite</b> <b>son,</b> Alben Barkley, on the ballot as Harry S. Truman's running mate in the 1948 presidential election ensured a strong Democratic turnout in the state. Both Barkley and Clements stressed party unity during the campaign, and although Cooper polled much better than the Republican presidential ticket, he ultimately lost to Chapman in the general election by 24,480 votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Paoli {{received}} La Cruz de Alfonso II from Alfonso XIII, King of Spain, and {{was declared}} ’’Honor Singer of the Vatican’’ by Pope Pius X. In 1910, he was honored {{with the title}} of Hijo Predilecto de España (<b>Favorite</b> <b>Son</b> of Spain), while in 1911, Wilhelm II, Kaiser of Germany, declared Paoli ’’Kammer Sanger of the Empire’’, and in 1912, Paoli received a protocol-breaking standing ovation from the Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph when Paoli sang Lohengrin in Vienna. In 1920, the tenor was knighted by Vittorio Emmanuelle III, King of Italy, making him Cavaliere De La Corona Italiana and Commendatore Dell Popolo Romano (Knight of the Italian Crown and Commandant of the Roman People).|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the delegates}} at the {{convention}} continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined. On the second ballot of the day, a Pennsylvania delegate named W. A. Grier cast a vote for James Garfield. However, the Garfield support remained with that one delegate's vote {{for most of the}} day. The delegates cast eighteen ballots before taking a recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, {{and the rest of the}} votes were split between <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> candidates like William Windom and George F. Edmunds.|$|E
5|$|Two {{candidates}} {{stood with}} rather less support. William Ralls Morrison of Illinois {{had served in}} Congress since 1873 and was best known for advocating tariff reductions despite hailing from a protectionist district. He commanded little support outside his home state, and was seen as only a <b>favorite</b> <b>son.</b> Justice Stephen Johnson Field of the United States Supreme Court was better known, but still an unlikely victor. The only candidate from the Far West, Field was respected as a scholar of the law, but had greatly diminished his chances with {{his home state of}} California by striking down anti-Chinese legislation in that state in 1879. Even so, some observers, including Edwards Pierrepont, considered Field a likely choice for the nomination.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about a running mate, Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, the 100th {{anniversary of}} Schubert's birth was marked {{in the musical}} world by festivals and {{performances}} dedicated to his music. In Vienna, there were ten days of concerts, and the Emperor Franz Joseph gave a speech recognizing Schubert as {{the creator of the}} art song, and one of Austria's <b>favorite</b> <b>sons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Coles {{formed the}} southern/hard rock band The Organ Thieves with Brown Brigade band-member Dave Baksh and former Cauterize band-member Matt Worobec. Coles sings lead vocals, plays lead guitar, and writes {{most of the}} lyrics and guitar melodies for the band. The Organ Thieves {{released}} their first EP, God's <b>Favorite</b> <b>Sons,</b> in March 2009.|$|R

5|$|Colbert {{confirmed}} his presidential ambitions on his October 16, 2007 show, stating {{his intention to}} run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms, but only as a <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> in his native South Carolina. In an interview with Larry King he revealed that, as his running mate, he would consider Mike Huckabee (who himself jokingly offered Colbert the vice presidential position). He also speculated {{on the possibility of}} a Colbert-Putin or Colbert-Colbert ticket. Colbert abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary. On November 1, 2007, it was announced that he would not appear on the Democratic primary ballot either, after being deemed ineligible by the South Carolina Democratic Party executive committee. Several days later he announced that he was withdrawing from the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{left office}} as {{governor}} in January 1896. In February, Harrison {{made it clear}} that he would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's home state of Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president privately found unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had little luck in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed had serious candidates like Senator Allison. The <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> candidacies of Minnesota Senator Cushman K. Davis and former Nebraska senator Charles F. Manderson fell victim to the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith. Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|One year later, the feudal {{families}} of the Sasanian Empire, who were tired of war against the Byzantines and Khosrow's oppressive policies, freed Khosrow's son Kavadh, who had been imprisoned by his own father. The feudal families included: Shahrbaraz himself, who represented the Mihran family; the House of Ispahbudhan represented by spahbed Farrukh Hormizd and his two sons Rostam Farrokhzad and Farrukhzad; the Armenian faction represented by Varaztirots II Bagratuni; and finally the Kanarang. In February, Kavadh, along with Aspad Gushnasp, captured Ctesiphon and imprisoned Khosrow II. Kavadh II then proclaimed himself as king of the Sasanian Empire on 25 February, and {{with the aid of}} Piruz Khosrow, executed all his brothers and half-brothers, including Khosrow II's <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> Mardanshah. Three days later, he ordered Mihr Hormozd to execute his father. With the agreement of the nobles of the Sasanian empire, Kavadh then made peace with the Byzantine emperor Heraclius; under the terms of this peace, the Byzantines regained all their lost territories, their captured soldiers, a war indemnity, along with the True Cross and other relics that were lost in Jerusalem in 614.|$|E
50|$|Thus {{followed}} an exciting race between Kennedy and McCarthy, but Vice President Humphrey swept the caucuses and two <b>favorite</b> <b>sons</b> who already endorsed him had won primaries in Ohio and Florida, {{giving him a}} substantial lead by the time Senator Kennedy was murdered by Sirhan Sirhan {{on the day of}} the California primary.|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} {{was as much}} a contest of <b>favorite</b> <b>sons</b> as it was a conflict over policy, although positions on tariffs and internal improvements did create some significant disagreements. In general, the candidates were favored by different sections of the country: Adams was strong in the Northeast; Jackson in the South, West and mid-Atlantic; Clay in parts of the West; and Crawford in parts of the South.|$|R
50|$|In 1287, Kublai Khan {{this time}} sent {{one of his}} <b>favorite</b> <b>sons,</b> Prince Toghan to lead another {{invasion}} campaign into Đại Việt with a determination to occupy and redeem the previous defeat. The Yuan Mongol and Chinese forces formed an even larger infantry, cavalry and naval fleet with the total strength estimated at 500,000 men according to the an original accounting of a source or book original Viet history.|$|R
5|$|Several <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> {{candidates}} had delegates {{interested in}} their nomination, although they were seen as having less of a chance of gaining the nomination. Alexander Campbell had represented Illinois in the House of Representatives several years earlier. He {{was seen as a}} pragmatist who represented the Greenback Party's more conservative members. Henly James {{was the head of the}} Grange in Indiana and had served in the state legislature there, but attracted little support outside his own delegation. In the Wisconsin delegation, many favored Edward P. Allis, an industrialist who owned the Reliance Iron Works. Allis was a longtime supporter of soft money, but had no experience in elected office. Finally, Solon Chase of Maine had some support from the New England delegations. Chase was a publisher of a Greenback newspaper, Chase's Inquirer, and had narrowly lost a House election in 1878. Chase was among the most radical of the Greenbackers, attracting support from the party's left-wing members.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{was born}} in 1843 in Niles, Ohio. After service as an Army officer in the Civil War, he became a lawyer and settled in Canton, Ohio. In 1876 {{he was elected to}} Congress, and he {{remained}} there most of the time until 1890, when he was defeated for re-election in a gerrymandered district. By this time he was considered a likely presidential candidate, especially after being elected governor in 1891 and 1893. McKinley had incautiously co-signed the loans of a friend, and demands for repayment were made on him when his friend went bankrupt in the Panic of 1893. Personal insolvency would have removed McKinley as a factor in the 1896 campaign, but he was rescued from this by businessmen who supported him, led by his friend and political manager, Mark Hanna. With that obstacle removed, Hanna built McKinley's campaign organization through 1895 and 1896. McKinley refused to deal with the eastern bosses such as Thomas Platt and Matthew Quay, and they tried to block his nomination by encouraging state <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> candidates to run and prevent McKinley from getting a majority of delegate votes at the Republican National Convention, which might force him to make deals on political patronage. Their efforts were in vain, as the large, efficient McKinley organization swept him to a first ballot victory at the convention, with New Jersey's Garret Hobart as his running mate.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, John Kerry won the state's four {{electoral votes}} {{by a margin}} of nine {{percentage}} points with 54% of the vote. Every county supported the Democratic candidate. In 1964, <b>favorite</b> <b>son</b> candidate senator Hiram Fong of Hawaii sought the Republican presidential nomination, while Patsy Mink ran in the Oregon primary in 1972.|$|E
50|$|In January 2009, {{the band}} entered The Boom Cave, a {{recording}} studio in Oshawa, Ontario, owned by Chuck's former Cauterize bandmates Jesse Smith and Jason Bone, to record the band's first EP.
