40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role and}} influence of <b>fathers</b> and <b>father</b> <b>figures</b> {{in the lives of}} African American adolescent girls (N= 302) from a representative sample of poor and low-income families. Sixty five percent of the adolescents identified a primary father, of whom two-thirds were biological fathers and one-third were <b>father</b> <b>figures.</b> Adolescent girls reported more contentious and less close relationships with biological fathers than with <b>father</b> <b>figures.</b> Multivariate regression analyses indicated that fathers' emotional disengagement predicted greater depressive symptomatology and behavioral problems for adolescents, while fathers' level of positive engagement was not predictive of youth outcomes. Moreover, fathers' emotional and physical disengagement had an additive detrimental link with adolescent functioning, with the most problematic emotional and behavioral functioning apparent in girls whose fathers were both emotionally alienated and physically absent from their lives.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of dysfunctional <b>father</b> <b>figures</b> in numerous works of William Faulkner makes his struggle to relinquish his animosity for his father, Murry Falkner, a significant theme in his fiction. The dysfunctional <b>father</b> <b>figures</b> play the {{pivotal role in}} the social, financial, and psychological decline of their families as the children struggle to escape their father 2 ̆ 7 s influence and their dismal fate. The real-life events and situations of Faulkner and his family members serve {{as a source for}} Faulkner 2 ̆ 7 s fiction, and the constant disgust several of his characters have for their <b>father</b> <b>figures</b> resembles Faulkner 2 ̆ 7 s own feelings towards his father. By documenting real situations of Faulkner and his family that appear in his fiction, the reality of his dislike for his father and his attempt to express this feeling through his writing becomes apparent...|$|R

5|$|Æthelwig's {{relationship}} with Wulfstan, when Wulfstan was {{acting as the}} abbot's diocesan bishop, {{appears to have been}} tense, for on the only recorded visitation by Wulfstan to Evesham during Æthelwig's abbacy, Æthelwig was not there. Although in legal matters Wulfstan and Æthelwig were in conflict, personally, Æthelwig is said to have regarded Wulfstan as a <b>father</b> <b>figure,</b> and as the abbot's confessor. The fact that the Evesham's house chronicle appears to have been reworked after 1100 to gloss over embarrassing incidents of the abbots submitting to the bishops of Worcester makes evaluation of Æthelwig's relations with his episcopal superiors more difficult.|$|E

He was the son of Toshizo Abbe, who was the local school's {{headmaster}} and a kendo instructor, and his wife, Kote Abbe.

2500|$|Austen's heroines often incur {{a cost to}} {{themselves}} during this social integration. Feminist critics have highlighted {{the ways in which}} her heroines accommodate themselves to masculine power by sacrificing their own creativity. Elizabeth and Emma search for replacement <b>father</b> <b>figures</b> in ways that suggest [...] "why female survival depends on gaining male approval and protection". These <b>father</b> <b>figures,</b> who are often also mentors, show Austen's connection to the 18th-century novel, which includes many such figures. Gilbert and Gubar argue that Austen's heroines often have a fragmented self—the private and the public—pointing to Mansfield Park as the most dramatic example.|$|R
5000|$|The poem, by {{not giving}} a {{definitive}} {{answer to this}} question, {{stresses the importance of}} respect of religious and <b>father</b> <b>figures</b> (whether real <b>father</b> <b>figures,</b> or authority figures in the feudal system), while reminding the young nobles who are the public of the tale to associate themselves only with other nobles. Very baroque in composition and esthetic, Alexandre de Bernay's version of the poem is the basis of Alexander's myth in the French literature to come with many continuations depicting mainly the vengeance of the [...] "douze pairs" [...] or shedding a different light on the life of the conqueror.|$|R
