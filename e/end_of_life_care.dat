2500|$|In September 2010 Mullen {{introduced}} {{the first ever}} Private Members' Motion in the Oireachtas dedicated {{to the issue of}} hospice care. The motion focused primarily on facilitating personal choice on dying at home and also on making end-of-life care a core hospital competence. The motion was based on the Irish Hospice Foundation's Audit of <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Care.</b> The audit documented that over half the 1000 patients profiled died in multi-bed rooms, only 20-30% of persons received specialist palliative care, and that as many as 25% may have died alone. Speaking to the motion Mullen claimed that [...] "implicit sometimes in our thinking on this issue is the view that policy focus should centre on those with the majority of their lives ahead of them; that dying is a taboo subject better skirted around for the sake of avoiding awkwardness and offence; and that as people gradually lose memory, consciousness, bodily control and even hope, they also lose their dignity".|$|E

The aim of this research was to determine the current status of such an emphasis in programmes in the United Kingdom (UK). A mailed survey in 2006 to the 66 undergraduate (pre-registration) nursing programmes in the UK (return rate of 79 %) determined that <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and palliative <b>care</b> {{play a significant role in}} these programmes. Forty-five teaching hours on average were devoted to these topics. All of the schools have some provision on <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and palliative <b>care,</b> and over 95 % of students participated in these courses. A nurse was usually the primary instructor, although non-nurses were sometimes used. Attitudes toward dying and death and communicating with terminally-ill patients and family members were emphasised. By highlighting dying and death in the curricula, nursing schools appeared to be giving nursing students an opportunity to face the issue of death, thus helping them to be better prepared to help their patients and their families to do so...|$|R
40|$|There {{have been}} {{changes in the}} way that NICE evaluates medical {{treatments}} for patients who are in the last stages of their lives. If medicines fulfil some criteria to be considered “end of life” NICE considers if QALYs gained under these circumstances should receive an extra weight. In this paper we provide evidence about the social support that this policy may have. We present the result of three surveys conducted in the Spanish general population (n= 813). Survey 1 compared increases in life expectancy for patients at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their lives with health gains from temporary health problems. Survey 2 compared health gains for temporary health problems with health gains from <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> palliative <b>care.</b> Survey 3 compared increases in life expectancy with palliative care in both cases for <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> patients. Preferences were elicited with Person Trade-Off and Willingness to pay techniques. Our results suggest that QALYs for <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> treatments have a higher social value than for temporary health problems. However, we also find that people discriminate between different ways of health gains within <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Life</b> treatment.
