5|$|The 19th {{century was}} a {{turbulent}} time for Spain. Those {{in favour of}} reforming Spain's government vied for political power with conservatives, who tried to prevent reforms from taking place. Some liberals, in a tradition that had started with the Spanish Constitution of 1812, sought to limit {{the power of the}} monarchy of Spain and to establish a liberal state. The reforms of 1812 did not last after King Ferdinand VII dissolved the Constitution and ended a short-lived liberal government with French royalist military assistance. Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874. There were several attempts to realign the political system to match social reality. Until the 1850s, the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture. There was little development of a bourgeois <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> class. The land-based oligarchy remained powerful; a small number of people held large estates (called latifundia) as well as all the important government positions. The landowners' power was challenged by the industrial and merchant sectors, largely unsuccessfully.|$|E

The science of friction and lubrication is called tribology. Lubricant technology is when lubricants are mixed with the application of science, especially to <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> objectives.|$|E

25|$|While {{trademark}} law {{seeks to}} protect indications {{of the commercial}} source of products or services, patent law generally seeks to protect new and useful inventions, and registered designs law generally seeks to protect the look or appearance of a manufactured article. Trademarks, patents and designs collectively form a subset of intellectual property known as industrial property because they are often created and used in an <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> context.|$|E
25|$|In an {{electric}} power system, a load {{with a low}} power factor draws more current than a load with a high power factor {{for the same amount}} of useful power transferred. The higher currents increase the energy lost in the distribution system, and require larger wires and other equipment. Because of the costs of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical utilities will usually charge a higher cost to <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> customers where there is a low power factor.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} no way to {{guarantee}} that a reactor will always be designed, built and operated safely, the nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed safer reactor designs, though many of these designs have yet to be tested at <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> scales. Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at Fukushima in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake. According to UBS AG, the Fukushima I nuclear accidents have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety. Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.|$|E

25|$|The school {{offered the}} first 4-year degree (B.S.) {{in the field}} of {{industrial}} and labor relations. Originally, students had ninety-seven of the required 120 hours prescribed for them. The first two years consisted of many social science classes such as American history and government, sociology, psychology, economics, and law. Students were required to take English and public speaking courses as well as courses in accounting and statistics. The last two years of coursework were the technical core: classes that were expected to provide the students with the technical skills and competencies which enable them to develop professional expertise with{{in the field of}} industrial and labor relations. Examples of these courses include: history of labor and labor-union organization and management, business organization and management, and corporate finance. Beyond the classroom, students were expected to gain applied experience. This was achieved primarily through a required summer work-training program. To fulfill this expectation, students would spend three of their summers working in the field for each of the following types of organizations: <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial,</b> government, and labor.|$|E
500|$|It {{was also}} agreed that [...] "any post-war {{advantages}} of an <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> nature" [...] would be decided {{at the discretion}} of the President. The Quebec Agreement established the Combined Policy Committee to control the Manhattan Project, consisting of Henry Stimson, Bush and Conant from the United States; Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Colonel J. J. Llewellin were the British members, and C. D. Howe was the Canadian member. Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir Ronald Ian Campbell, who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, in early 1945. Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission and {{as a member of the}} Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement on 19 September 1944 extended this cooperation to the postwar period.|$|E

500|$|Damage was {{greatest}} in Connecticut, where floods affected {{about two-thirds of}} the state. It was the largest flood on record in the state's history. All major streams and valleys were flooded during the storm, including hundreds of tributaries, and 30gauges in the state reported the highest level on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached the third-highest level on record at the time, cresting at , or [...] above flood stage. Although there was rural damage, the city of Hartford was spared from flooding due to previously constructed dykes. The Naugatuck River had significant flooding that damaged or destroyed every bridge across it and did extensive damage in Ansonia. In Waterbury, the river washed buildings and railroad girders into a bridge. In the city, 30people were killed, including 26 in 13houses that were washed away in one block. The Quinebaug River flooded the city of Putnam {{at the same time that}} a major fire originated at a magnesium plant. Much of the commercial district of Winsted was destroyed by the Mad River, which reached [...] deep; the floods destroyed most buildings on the south side of the town's Main Street, and carried away several cars from a car dealership. The local newspaper reported that 95% of businesses were destroyed or severely damaged in Winsted. High rivers destroyed historical sites and buildings, and statewide Diane destroyed 563houses. There were 77deaths in the state and $350million in damage. Most of the damage in the state was <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> damage.|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{wastewater}} treatment covers the mechanisms and processes {{used to treat}} wastewater that is produced as a by-product of <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> activities. After treatment, the treated industrial wastewater (or effluent) may be reused or released to a sanitary sewer or to a surface water in the environment. [...] Most industries produce some wastewater although recent trends {{in the developed world}} have been to minimise such production or recycle such wastewater within the production process. However, many industries remain dependent on processes that produce wastewaters.|$|E
2500|$|Measure 49 {{passed by}} {{an even greater}} margin than Measure 37 had. [...] The impact {{of the law is}} as follows. [...] The measure no longer authorizes {{challenges}} to restrictions on <b>industrial</b> <b>or</b> <b>commercial</b> uses of property. [...] In addition, claimants must prove their losses by presenting appraisals of the property one year before and one year after the enactment of the regulation. [...] For land use restrictions enacted before 2007, the restriction may only be waived to permit the claimant to build one to three homes on their land, or up to 10 homes if the property is not high value agricultural land and they can show that the waiver is necessary to restore the appraised value of the property.|$|E
