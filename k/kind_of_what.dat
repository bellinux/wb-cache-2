[...] Hemby also admitted that the song was written for Lindsay Chapman because the song's genre fit Chapman's musical direction at that time.

500|$|... "When I Look at You" [...] {{was written}} by Hillary Lindsey and John Shanks.

The song was initially to be included on Cyrus's 2010 album Can't Be Tamed; however, it was decided to include it on The Time of Our Lives as well as The Last Song because it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", she thinks of family and love. [...] "It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> this movie is all about", she said.

500|$|Crime Cutz {{has been}} {{described}} by Lily Moayeri of Under the Radar as an EP that strongly showcases the nu-disco side of the duo. The music of the EP was influenced by records by Russian jazz musicians that were released in the 1970s and 1980s but were never distributed in the duo's home country; these musicians attempted to copy the disco style of American and French acts such as Chic. Frankel, who was sent mp3 files of these tracks by a Russian record dealer on eBay, said that their failure to mimic the style of the popular songs they wanted to recreate due to their different synthesizer sounds is what made the songs unique: [...] "I guess that's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Nick and I do ... We find a sound we like, try to make it and fail, but in the process we make something new." [...] The rhythm of each track was developed first before writing the melodies and lyrics, given that the main goal of the EP was for it to be [...] "instantly rhythmically gratifying", as member Nick Millhiser described. In addition to its disco element, Crime Cutz features exaggerated arrangements and childlike R vocals that gives it a 1980s-esque atmosphere. Consequence of Sound's David Sackllah noted Crime Cutz to be Holy Ghost!'s cleanest-sounding release to date. As for the lyrical content, Frankel wanted the songs' seductive lyrics to be [...] "phonetically fun" [...] as with most other disco records.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it needed to be.

Wyman continued in a different interview with the Los Angeles Times that [...] "Noirs traditionally are morality tales, and that's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> we're doing. We felt that that was a great way to get across Walter's mind frame and where his head is at right now, with his son missing". Other cast members also praised the added music. John Noble wrote [...] "It really deepened and blew the episode out even further in the direction we were already taking. We get [...] fractured take on the world and his condition now that Peter has left. The music really supports the storytelling". He added, [...] "It is like a mind-trip of Walter's. It is Walter trying to grapple with the fact that his son is gone". Jasika Nicole continued: [...] "I have a musical theater background, so I've been waiting for some moment in some realm of where I am in TV and film for this to happen and, you know, of course, when Glee came on the air I was like, 'Great, that was my chance,' and I'm in this show, which I love this show, but I'm never going to sing and dance in this show.

Later in July 2015, American singer-songwriter Eric Bellinger re-wrote and recorded {{a new version of the}} track for his album Cuffing Season. He simply called his version [...] "Creep" [...] and invited Watkins to contribute vocals for a new verse. [...] "When I heard [...] flip I immediately knew I had to at least try to get T-Boz on it since that was her solo song with ! Luckily when she heard the record she loved it! Hopefully the fans will too!," [...] Bellinger said in a statement sent to MTV News. In the track, its new content finds Bellinger making promises to never cheat on his lover.

[...] {{was written by}} Dr. Luke, Claude Kelly, and Jessica Cornish. The song was not originally meant for Cyrus to perform, but, once it reached Cyrus, the writing team reworked the lyrics, intending to write an accompanying theme for the clothing line. In order to please audiences, Dr. Luke, Kelly, and Cornish fixated on composing a fun, upbeat song that narrated reflections of Cyrus' personality. To write his contributions to the song, Kelly said he tried to mimic Cyrus' songwriting: [...] "It’s the same song from {{a different point of}} view, you just have to find that unique perspective." [...] Cyrus was pleased with the song and selected it partially due to the need for tracks to appear on The Time of Our Lives. [...] "When I Look at You", written by Shanks and Hillary Lindsey, was initially to be included on Cyrus' succeeding album; it was eventually chosen to promote the 2010 film The Last Song after Cyrus recognized that it fit the film's concept well. According to Cyrus, when she sings [...] "When I Look at You", she thinks of family and love. [...] "It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> this movie is all about", she said. The title track, [...] "The Time of Our Lives", was composed by Dr. Luke, Kelly, Kesha Sebert (known as Ke$ha), and Pebe Sebert.
