25|$|Flight 5719 {{was cleared}} {{for a landing}} on runway 31 at Hibbing, but the flight crew {{requested}} an approach to runway 13 instead {{because there was a}} tailwind on the approach to runway 31 and 31 was covered with precipitation. The flight crew initiated the approach procedure by joining the HIB 20 DME arc from the HIB VOR and intercepting the localizer at 8000 feet MSL.This delayed the start of the descent and thus required an excessive rate of descent. The aircraft descended at 2250 ft/min and was 1200 feet above the minimum altitude when overhead the KINNY <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> <b>fix.</b> The Jetstream BA-3100 was not equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System that was required on larger aircraft.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} algorithmically synthesizing turn-constrained routes that minimize exposure to hazardous weather. Such a problem is suitable to air traffic management automation and aircraft flight management systems. Our algorithm synthesizes routes that aircraft may follow from a specified start to finish location. Example applications include synthesizing routes (1) from airport metering fix locations to runway <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> <b>fixes,</b> and (2) from sector boundary crossing locations to airport metering fix locations. The algorithm takes into account aircraft dynamics limits on velocity and acceleration, pilot and controller workload considerations (e. g., the number of turn maneuvers), and other constraints (e. g., utilizing arrival vs departure corridors or avoiding special use airspace regions). The solution approach is based on searching in an appropriate discretization of a geometric model of the airspace using a dynamic programming algorithm for optimal paths having a bounded number of turns.

40|$|A {{model of}} the pilot as a monitor of {{instrument}} failures during automatic landing is proposed. The failure detection model consists of two stages: a linear estimator (Kalman Filter) and a decision mechanism {{which is based on}} sequential analysis. The filter equations are derived from a simplified version of the linearized dynamics of the airplane and the control loop. The perceptual observation noise is modelled to include the effects of the partition of attention among the several instruments. The final result is a simple model consisting of a high pass filter to produce the observation residuals, and a decision function which is a pure integration of the residuals minus a bias term. The dynamics of a Boeing 707 were used to simulate the fully coupled <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> in a <b>fixed</b> base simulator which also included failures in the airspeed, glideslope, and localizer indicators. Subjects monitored the approaches and detected the failures; their performance was compared with the predictions of the model with good agreement between the experimental data and the model...|$|R
40|$|Accidents due to engine failure, pilot {{disorientation}} or {{pilot incapacitation}} occur far {{more frequently in}} general aviation than in commercial aviation, yet general aviation aircraft are equipped with less safety-enhancing features than commercial aircraft. This thesis presents the design of an emergency autoland system that includes automatic landing site selection, guidance to the selected landing site and guidance along the <b>final</b> <b>approach,</b> {{in addition to the}} automatic landing capability provided by conventional autoland systems. The proposed system builds on the capability of a general aviation autopilot, flight management system and GPS/WAAS augmented, integrated navigation system. The system provides this automatic landing capability without the use of automatic throttle control and without the use of a radar altimeter, which are essential to conventional autoland systems, but are typically lacking on general aviation aircraft. The design addresses the challenge of no automatic throttle control by utilizing only two simple power settings: cruise power and zero power. The lack of radar altimeter is addressed by appropriate flare planning and placement of the target touchdown point. The approach from the point of autoland initiation, to the <b>approach</b> <b>fix</b> at the the landing site, is performed at cruise power, provided that power is available. The <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> from the <b>approach</b> <b>fix</b> to touchdown, is performed at zero power. Control of the touchdown point location during the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> is achieved through adjustment of the length of the trajectory, whenever the aircraft’s glide performance deviates from the expected performance. The aircraft’s glide performance is measured online as the aircraft tracks the planned trajectory. The performance of the final design is evaluated in simulation in terms of touchdown point dispersion, sink rate and attitude on touchdown. Avidyne, Inc...|$|R

40|$|The {{operating}} environment {{of an air}} transport crew is characterized by multiple interrupting tasks, these tasks being composed of a mixture of purely physical control and purely mental planning processes. Measurement of crew workload is thus d difficult undertaking due to the necessity to resolve workload contributions imposed by several sources. These sources include physical efforts, mental efforts, random task interruptions, and emotional disturbances. A multiattribute, subjective opinion rating scale is presented for usa as an effective measure for this air transport cockpit environment. An analysis is performed which indicates that {{a major component of}} workload is induced by the federal air traffic control system. Mechanizations of this loading inClude speed and altitude restrictions imposed by regulation, confinement and restraint imposed by the structure of the National Airspace System, and loads induced by a stochastic interruption process associated with ATC voice communications, In fact, the analysis of a routine transport arrival into Boston's Logan airport indicates that the (primarily system induced) workload levels in the terminal area, may be higher than the (primarily aircraft induced) workload levels on <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> A <b>fixed</b> base, Boeing 707 simulator was employed to investigate the consistency, sensitivity, and acceptability- of the 31, subjective rating scale. Four airline pilots and four general aviation, IFH pilots flew a series of routine, MI 2 arrivals from high altitude cruise into Boston's Logan airport, each arrival terminating with a standard instrument approach. Consistent ratings were achieved across the airline subjects for all segments of the arrivals. In general, all subjects seemed receptive to the subjective assessment methodology.

50|$|At 23:10, Columbus Approach Control was contacted. The captain {{advised the}} {{controller}} that the aircraft was descending through 13200 ft to 11000 ft. The controller assigned a 285-degree heading to intercept the ILS for runway 28L and cleared Flight 6291 to 10000 ft. An updated weather report was at 23:15, reporting a cloud overcast 800 ft above the ground, visibility 2.5 mi in light snow and fog with wind 300 degrees at 4 knots.

50|$|At a {{controlled}} airport, {{air traffic control}} will direct aircraft to the localizer course via assigned headings, making sure aircraft do not {{get too close to}} each other (maintain separation), but also avoiding delay as much as possible. Several aircraft can be on the ILS at the same time, several miles apart. An aircraft that has turned onto the inbound heading and is within two and a half degrees of the localizer course (half scale deflection or less shown by the course deviation indicator) is said to be established on the approach. Typically, an aircraft is established by at least 2 nmi km prior to the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> <b>fix</b> (glideslope intercept at the specified altitude).|$|E

50|$|A <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> over an upsloping terrain {{with a flat}} runway, or to {{an unusually}} narrow or long runway may produce the visual {{illusion}} of being too high on <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> The pilot may then increase their rate of descent, positioning the aircraft unusually low on the approach path.|$|R
50|$|The Outer Marker, which {{normally}} identifies the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> <b>fix</b> (FAF), is {{situated on the}} same course/track as the localizer and the runway center-line, four to seven nautical miles before the runway threshold. It is typically located about 1 NM km inside {{the point where the}} glideslope intercepts the intermediate altitude and transmits a 400 Hz tone signal on a low-powered (3 watts), 75 MHz carrier signal. Its antenna is highly directional, and is pointed straight up. The valid signal area is a 2400 ft × 4200 ft ellipse (as measured 1000 ft above the antenna.) When the aircraft passes over the outer marker antenna, its marker beacon receiver detects the signal. The system gives the pilot a visual (blinking blue outer marker light) and aural (continuous series of audio tone morse code-like 'dashes') indication.|$|E
50|$|The MDA {{states the}} minimum {{altitude}} in MSL to safely fly above any obstructions or terrain {{in the final}} approach flight-path before visual contact with the runway is made. Unlike a DA in a Precision Approach, an MDA requires that after crossing the <b>Final</b> <b>Approach</b> <b>Fix,</b> the pilot is to descend and maintain MDA until the non-flying pilot reports that the runway is in sight, allowing the pilot to safely complete the landing visually. In contrast to the ILS approach, which displays lateral and vertical position, the VOR/DME approach only shows the lateral position of the aircraft and its range to the runway. Due to increased azimuth error {{associated with the use}} of VORs and lack of vertical guidance (Glide Slope), the MDA is therefore much higher than a DA (Decision Altitude) for an ILS.|$|E
5000|$|When used on {{approach}} to landing, VNAV follows a calculated approach path from a <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> <b>fix</b> or waypoint to the runway, i.e. waypoints within the FMS navigation database. The path {{can either be}} based on stored database altitudes as displayed on the altimetry system ("baro VNAV"), or as corrected within more advanced FMS equipment for temperature errors: significantly low temperature otherwise causing a shallow approach. During final landing approach, altitude must be controlled more accurately than heights referenced to mean sea level (MSL) as barometric altimetry provides. An ILS glide slope signal originating from the landing point provides needed vertical alignment down to the final 100 ft. Commercial pilots rely on visual cues, and a down-looking radar altimeter annunciator that calls out above ground level (AGL) height ("50", [...] "40", [...] "30", [...] "20", [...] "10"), in order to time the flare seconds before touchdown.|$|E

50|$|This {{accident}} was blamed {{entirely on the}} bad judgment of the Captain, Gale C.
