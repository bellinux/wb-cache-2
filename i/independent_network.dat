[...] The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service.

In 1990 he became a national talk-show host on the ABC Radio Network, which was {{trying to build a}} group of nationwide talk shows at the time. Lynn Samuels was forced to share her local WABC show with Farber which led to on-air confrontations, and resulted in her departure from the station. [...] ABC's project later was abandoned, and Farber, Michael Castello, and Alan Colmes got together and quickly formed their own <b>independent</b> <b>network</b> called Daynet. He is now on CRN Digital Talk Radio, weekdays, and on the Talk Radio Network, hosting a one-hour weekend show and filling in for TRN's weekday hosts, most commonly on The Laura Ingraham Show.

2500|$|With Rollins, Black Flag {{began work}} on their first {{full-length}} album. The sessions for the album (chronicled in Michael Azerrad's book Our Band Could Be Your Life) were a source of conflict between the band and engineer/producer Spot, {{who had worked with}} the band and the SST label since their early years. Spot had already recorded many of the Damaged tracks with Dez Cadena on vocals (as well as Keith Morris and Ron Reyes) and felt that the band's sound was ruined with the two guitar line-up (these versions can be heard on the albums Everything Went Black and The First Four Years). Whereas the earlier four-piece versions are more focused and much cleaner sounding, the Damaged recordings are more akin to a live recording, with little stereo separation of guitars, and somewhat muddy. When asked about the lo-fidelity production, Spot has said [...] "They wanted it to sound that way." [...] However, the artistic content and expression on the album showed the band pushing punk or hardcore music to a new level, with deeply personal and intensely emotional lyrics. As such, Damaged is generally regarded as Black Flag's most focused recording. One critic has written that Damaged was [...] "perhaps the best album to emerge from the quagmire that was early-'80s California punk ... the visceral, intensely physical presence of Damaged has yet to be equaled, although many bands have tried." [...] Damaged was released in the fall of 1981, and the group began an extensive tour in support of it, forging an <b>independent</b> <b>network</b> for touring independent music acts that would form a cornerstone of the independent music scene for the decade to come.|$|E
