5|$|Despite the RIRA's renewed activity, the {{organisation}} was {{weakened by the}} arrest of key members and continued infiltration by informers. McKevitt was arrested on 29 March 2001 and charged with membership of an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation</b> and directing terrorism, and remanded into custody. In July 2001, following the arrests of McKevitt and other RIRA members, British and Irish government sources hinted that {{the organisation}} was now in disarray. Other key figures were jailed, including the RIRA's Director of Operations, Liam Campbell, {{who was convicted of}} membership of an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation,</b> and Colm Murphy who was convicted of conspiring to cause the Omagh bombing, although this conviction was overturned on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Umbridge finally sacks Professor Trelawney, the Divination teacher; However, she is outraged when Professor Dumbledore {{undermines}} {{her power}} by allowing Trelawney to continue {{living at the}} school, and hires Firenze, a centaur, to take her place, in spite of Umbridge's prejudice against part-humans. Soon after, Umbridge is given a tip-off about Dumbledore's Army by Marietta Edgecombe, who in doing so unwittingly activates a curse set by Hermione which disfigures her face. Despite Dobby's warning, the gang are caught and get into trouble with Fudge. When Dumbledore takes responsibility for the <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation,</b> he is forced to leave the school and go into hiding. Dolores Umbridge becomes headmistress, and Fred and George cause pandemonium around the school in revenge.|$|E

25|$|All {{levels of}} the {{organisation}} were entitled to send delegates to IRA General Army Conventions (GACs). The GAC was the IRA's supreme decision-making authority. Before 1969, GACs met regularly. Since 1969, there have only been three, in 1970, 1986, and 2005, owing to the difficulty in organising such a large gathering of an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation</b> in secret.|$|E
25|$|Orwell {{served as}} a private, a {{corporal}} (cabo) and—when the informal command structure of the militia {{gave way to a}} conventional hierarchy in May 1937—as a lieutenant, on a provisional basis, in Catalonia and Aragon from December 1936 until June 1937. In June 1937, the leftist political party with whose militia he served (the POUM, the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification, an anti-Stalinist communist party) was declared an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation,</b> and Orwell was consequently forced to either flee or face imprisonment.|$|E

25|$|The {{dramatic}} increase of emigration (Republikflucht, brain drain) {{in the first}} half of 1953, already high since the establishment of the GDR, constituted a serious economic and social problem. Another factor that contributed to an already complicated political situation was the high number of political prisoners in the GDR. Suppression of the <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation</b> Junge Gemeinde (Young Congregation), wrongly perceived as the central youth organisation of the Evangelical Church, played a role here. Numerous trainee pastors were imprisoned (e.g. Johannes Hamel and Fritz Hoffmann). Ecclesiastic recreation centres were closed and taken over by the FDJ (e.g.: Schloss Mansfeld and Huberhaus Wernigerode). High school students who belonged to a church were often expelled by the school authorities, sometimes even shortly before school graduation.|$|E
25|$|Collins refused {{clarification}} when RTÉ {{asked for}} advice on what this legal instruction meant in practice. RTÉ interpreted the Order politically to mean that spokespersons for the Provisional and Official IRA could no longer appear on air. In 1972 the government sacked the RTÉ Authority for not sufficiently disciplining broadcasters the government accused of breaching the Order. RTÉ's Kevin O'Kelly had reported on an interview he conducted with the (Provisional) IRA Chief of Staff, Sean MacStiofáin, on the Radio Éireann This Week programme. The recorded interview was not itself broadcast. MacStiofáin's voice was not heard. However, he was arrested after the O'Kelly interview and charged with membership of the IRA, an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation.</b> Soon afterwards at the non-jury Special Criminal Court O'Kelly was jailed briefly for contempt because he refused to identify a voice on a tape seized by the Gardaí as that of Mac Stiofáin. Mac Stiofáin was convicted in any case. On appeal by O'Kelly to the Supreme Court a fine was substituted as a means purging O'Kelly's contempt. The fine was paid anonymously and O'Kelly was released.|$|E
25|$|The ACA {{changed its}} name to the National Guard under O'Duffy and adopted the uniform of black berets and blue shirts, using the {{straight}} armed salute, and were nicknamed The Blueshirts. They were outwardly fascist and planned a march in August 1933 through Dublin to commemorate Michael Collins, Kevin O'Higgins, and Arthur Griffith. This march struck parallels with Mussolini's march on Rome (1922), in which he had created the image of having toppled the democratic government in Rome. De Valera revived a military tribunal, which had been set up by the previous administration, to deal with the matter. O'Duffy backed down when the National Guard was declared an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation</b> and the march was banned. Within a few weeks, O'Duffy's followers merged with Cumann na nGaedhael and the Centre Party to form United Ireland, or Fine Gael, and O'Duffy became its president. Smaller local marches were scheduled for the following weeks, under different names. Internal dissension set in when the party's TDs distanced themselves from O'Duffy's extreme views, and his movement fell asunder.|$|E

25|$|From the outset, West Germany did {{not accept}} the {{legitimacy}} of the East German state, and for many years regarded the East German government as an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation</b> intent on depriving Germans of their constitutional rights. It had not been freely or fairly elected, and the creation of East Germany itself was a fait accompli by the East German Communists and their Soviet allies. This had important consequences for the inner German border. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as unitary, applying equally to East and West German citizens alike. An East German who escaped or was released to the West automatically entered into full enjoyment of those rights, including West German citizenship and social benefits. A would-be immigrant from another country who could get to East Germany could not be barred from entering West Germany across the internal border, which had great significance in later decades. West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East; violations of human rights in East Germany could be prosecuted in the West. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive to move to the West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E
500|$|The Real Irish Republican Army or Real IRA (RIRA), is a {{dissident}} Irish republican paramilitary organisation {{which aims to}} bring about a united Ireland. It formed in 1997 following a split in the Provisional IRA by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's ceasefire that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the RIRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original Irish Republican Army and styles itself as [...] "the Real Irish Republican Army" [...] in English or Óglaigh na hÉireann in Irish. It is an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation</b> in the Republic of Ireland and designated as proscribed terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E
500|$|In the end, Mahathir's camp [...] "won" [...] {{the court}} case {{when it was}} held that as the party was an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation</b> under the Societies Act due to some of its {{branches}} not being formally registered, the plaintiffs' case was invalid; an illegal society could not hold new elections for its leaders. Mahathir immediately set up [...] "UMNO (Baru)" [...] (New UMNO), transferring all of old UMNO's assets to the new party. Most of his supporters also joined UMNO (Baru), and eventually the [...] "(Baru)" [...] was dropped, making it, {{for all intents and}} purposes, the same as the old UMNO. When the Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal on the case, the government suspended and later sacked Lord President Salleh Abas and five other Supreme Court judges, triggering the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis. The new Supreme Court later dismissed the case.|$|E

The Authority did not find that any money had actually {{made its way to}} <b>illegal</b> <b>organisations.</b> Aon qualified for a 30% discount on the fine {{as a result of its}} co-operation with the investigation.

500|$|A large Real IRA {{explosives}} dump {{and arms}} cache {{were discovered in}} Dunleer, County Louth by Gardaí in October 2010, following a weekend of searches and arrests in {{the east of the}} country. In addition, two Real IRA men were charged in Dublin's non-jury Special Criminal Court of membership of an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation.</b> The Real IRA claimed responsibility for kidnapping and shooting dead of one of their members, Kieran Doherty, for alleged drug dealing. Further significant seizures of Real IRA arms and explosives were made by the Gardaí during 2012 and 2013, leading to the arrest of over a dozen persons. In 2011 Michael Campbell, brother of Liam, was found guilty in Vilnius, Lithuania, of trying to purchase arms and explosives and was sentenced to twelve years in prison. In October 2013 Campbell was freed on appeal, only to have the Supreme Court of Lithuania order a retrial in June 2014. Campbell has maintained his innocence, accusing British intelligence of attempting to frame him. In June 2013 Gardaí arrested eight people after a Real IRA meeting and uncovered a massive haul of the plastic explosive Semtex in two raids in Dublin. In October 2013 the Real IRA claimed responsibility for [...] "executing" [...] an alleged leading cocaine dealer in north Belfast.|$|E

2500|$|Muwalo and Gwede {{were closely}} {{associated}} with the implementation of repressive policies against political critics and even those seeking political neutrality, like Jehovah's Witnesses. After the removal of these two, the government's attitude appeared to have softened, at least for a time. Muwalo was linked to the persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses, that started in late 1963 before the pre-independence election, when Witnesses were beaten for failing to buy MCP cards, because their religious beliefs did not allow membership of political parties. In 1967, at the conference of the MCP, of which Muwalo was Administrative Secretary, it was agreed that Jehovah's Witnesses should be declared an [...] "unlawful society", and it was soon declared to be such, leading to attacks in which at least five Witnesses were killed and many fled the country. The anti-Witness campaign resumed in 1972, with further killings and beating. Over 50,000 Witnesses fled to Zambia or Mozambique, although in 1973, the Zambian authorities, and in 1975 the government of newly independent Mozambique, forcibly repatriated the majority of these refugees. A fifth wave of persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses began in September 1975, mainly organised by local MCP members, but authorised at the party's highest level. This involved over 5,000 arrests, with many Witnesses being sentenced to three years in prison for membership of an <b>illegal</b> <b>organisation,</b> many beatings and destruction of Witnesses' property, and at least two more killings. After Muwalo's arrest, this wave of persecution ended, and many of those imprisoned or in detention were released. Although {{it is clear that the}} initial impetus for banning the Witnesses in 1967 came from Banda, Muwalo was responsible for organising much of the subsequent anti-Witness action.|$|E

In this role, Vieweg designed, {{within the framework of}} the existing Soviet policy on Germany, several agricultural programmes, including some for the whole of Germany, influenced by German and Scandinavian social democratic programmes, but also using ideas from the Reichsnährstand, the agricultural regulatory body from the Nazi period. In the elections for the Volkskammer (parliament) on 19 October 1950 he was chosen as a deputy for the SED, which he remained for the entire first term. On behalf of the Central Committee of the SED Vieweg set to work on the construction of <b>illegal</b> <b>organisations,</b> including the conspiratorial [...] "All-German Working Group for Agriculture and Forestry" [...] in West Germany, which he also led.|$|R
