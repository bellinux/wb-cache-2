5000|$|The {{question}} of tax harmonisation touched on a vital {{interest of the}} Grand Duchy. Wealth management remained the principal activity of the financial centre, even though other sectors such as management of investment funds were developing. However, considerations of confidentiality constituted the life of private banking. In negotiations on the European level, the Luxembourgish government demanded the maintenance of banking secrecy as long as its principal financial-service competitors maintained it as well. But this confidentiality {{should not be used}} for criminal activities. This was why the previous government had put through anti-money laundering legislation. The Juncker-Polfer government extended these measures to improve the effectiveness of the <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> <b>fraud</b> and economic and financial crime. In terms of tax harmonisation, the European summit of Feira in June 2000 was a way towards a compromise. An action plan with a deadline of 2010 was agreed. In January 2003 in Brussels. in an [...] "Economic and Financial affairs" [...] council meeting, the European Ministers for Finances and the Economy finally reached an agreement on the taxation of revenue from savings. The agreement stipulated that EU member states could choose between two models: information exchanges between tax administrations, or the introduction of a withholding tax with a progressive increase in the rate of revenue which, after a transition period, would reach 35% from 1 January 2011. The move to the generalised automatic exchange of information was coupled to a similar action by third-party countries, including Switzerland.|$|E
