25|$|In most {{competition}}s, riders {{are allowed}} to walk the initial course but not the jump-off course (usually the same course with missing jumps, e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 instead of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) before competition to plan their ride. Walking the course before the event {{is a chance for}} the rider to walk the lines he or she will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride,</b> in order to decide how many strides the horse will need to take between each jump and from which angle. Going off course will cost time if minor errors are made and major departures will result in disqualification.|$|E
500|$|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward {{are told}} by the young surfers in the island {{that the only way}} to get back to Bikini Bottom is to surf there; {{unfortunately}} they do not know how to. Twitch, one of the surfers, tells them that there is one person who can teach them how to surf, Jack Kahuna Laguna. After they find Jack Kahuna Laguna, he comes out of his hut and surfs on an enormous surfboard which astonishes the three. He later says that they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> a wave called [...] "The Big One", in order to get back home. They practice surfing for some time, then get ready to ride [...] "The Big One". Before they set off, Jack Kahuna Laguna announces that The Big One demands a sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|The {{starting}} peloton did {{include the}} 1984 winner, Francesco Moser. Spanish rider Marino Lejarreta {{decided not to}} race the Vuelta a España in favor of racing the Giro. Luis Gómez, of El Pais, believed Lejarreta to be in top form going into the race {{and that he could}} challenge for the overall victory. Author Bill McGann believed that going into the race Hinault was [...] "the world's most potent racing machine" [...] and that Moser would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> very well in order to repeat as champion. Javier Dalmases, an El Mundo sportswriter, believed that there was no clear favorite for the race. Mario Fossati of La Repubblica named Moser, Saronni, Hinault, and Greg LeMond as contenders for the overall crown. Prominent French rider Laurent Fignon did not participate in the race due to an inflamed Achilles tendon.|$|E

500|$|The Daily Record {{also said}} {{ever since the}} Buckton family arrived they [...] "created drama", noting it was Ruby and Charlie especially. All About Soap {{questioned}} whether [...] "poor Ruby" [...] would ever find a [...] "good bloke" [...] to pair up with. They also said {{it should not have}} been to hard for Ruby with all the [...] "surfer types". Holy Soap later said [...] "If there's one thing that Ruby seems to have inherited from Charlie, it's her sometimes questionable taste in men." [...] When Ruby impressed everyone with her singing voice, the Daily Record said [...] "there is actually a rather pleasant storyline involving Ruby". They described the week Ruby slept with Romeo as an eventful one for her and opined she was on [...] "cloud nine". Debbie Schipp writing for Adelaide's Sunday Mail brands Ruby [...] "a low-down boyfriend-stealer" [...] for her affair with Romeo. Caroline Fitton writing for Daily Mail observed Ruby as being [...] "self-absorbed". TV Week said the [...] "impulsive teen" [...] waited until Romeo dropped his guard and [...] "moved in for the kill", but had her [...] "head in the clouds". They correctly predicted it would end [...] "messy". They also showed Ruby little sympathy when she told Indigo about her affair and lost her friends. They said: [...] "The salient lesson here is: don't cop off with your best mate's boyfriend, so you're just gonna <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> this one out, Rubes." [...] Peter Dyke writing for the Daily Star said Ruby is a [...] "randy schoolgirl" [...] and said that her romance with Casey was merely a [...] "passionate rebound romp". Whilst Erin Miller of TV Week said: [...] "Phew, it's hard to keep up with Ruby's romantic escapades lately!" [...] In April 2011, TV Week said Ruby had become [...] "increasingly trouble-prone" [...] and concluded that [...] "belle in blue Charlie is at her wits' end {{about what to do with}} her wayward daughter".|$|E
2500|$|But {{this was}} intentional, because the {{previous}} mountain stages {{had shown that}} from Landis's teammates, only Axel Merckx was somewhat able to stay with Landis and help him. [...] Through losing the yellow jersey, the [...] team made sure that those teammates did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> after the escaped riders every day; instead they now leave that responsibility to Pereiro's team, [...]|$|E
2500|$|Because the trot {{is such a}} {{safe and}} {{efficient}} gait for a horse, learning to ride the trot correctly {{is an important component}} in almost all equestrian disciplines, particularly for equitation riders. [...] "Gaited" [...] or [...] "ambling" [...] horses, which have smooth 4-beat intermediate gaits that replace or supplement the trot, are popular with riders who prefer for various reasons not to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> at a trot.|$|E

2500|$|The trail down Dalzell Gorge {{from the}} divide is {{regarded}} as the worst stretch of the trail. Steep and straight, it drops [...] in elevation in just , and there is little traction so the teams are hard to control. Mushers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> the brake most of the way down and use a snow hook for traction. In 1988, rookie Peryll Kyzer fell through an ice bridge into a creek and spent the night wet. The route then follows Tatina River, which is also hazardous: in 1986 Butcher's lead dogs fell through the ice but landed on a second layer of ice instead of falling into the river. In 1997, Ramey Smyth lost the end of his pinkie when it hit an overhanging branch while negotiating the gorge.|$|E
2500|$|... “There were a {{great many}} cowboys with the show. [...] There was a chief of the cowboys who had general {{supervision}} over both horses and men. [...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ride</b> bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was ready to go back to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
