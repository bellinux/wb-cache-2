500|$|Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{used his}} pre-match {{interview}} {{to state that}} his previous wins in the tournament had changed the way that clubs approach the League Cup: [...] "Lots of teams have followed us since then when we took the League Cup as a real competition, as a real challenge. It is a big competition." [...] He separated the final from the league season, saying, [...] "I don't think if we win the cup final we will win the league, or <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> it we will lose the league." [...] He refused to discuss the suspension of Matić, dismissing it with [...] "If I speak to you about that, I promise you I will be in big trouble". Despite opining that the two teams and the match officials would act fairly, he criticised players who dive, despite not naming any names. Mourinho also claimed that in after leaving Chelsea {{for the first time}} in September 2007, he was approached to manage Tottenham by chairman Daniel Levy, and again in 2012.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the 2012–13 season, Gannon signed defenders Sean Newton and James Tunnicliffe, and took back Paul Turnbull on loan once again. However, he was disappointed to lose striker Tom Elliott, who rejected a contract offer to switch to Cambridge United. He also appointed long-time associate Alan Lord as his assistant. However County found themselves struggling in the league, and Gannon blamed the predicament on the board's decision to slash the wage budget in the summer. An angry Lord Snape told the press that [...] "I'm getting pretty fed up of watching part-time teams beat Stockport County. Changes {{are going to be}} made unless things improve. Jim Gannon's pretty good at telling me how this club should be run. Well I'm going to tell him that I'm not impressed by the way the team is being run. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> a couple of our next games, we're in a relegation battle with a much bigger budget than most of the teams down there with us, which quite frankly is not good enough." [...] Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County sitting in the relegation zone, Gannon was relieved of his duties as Stockport manager on 16 January 2013 following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town.|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Halvorsen's {{role in the}} Berlin Airlift was to fly one of many C-54 cargo planes used {{to ferry}} {{supplies}} into the starving city. During his flights he would first fly to Berlin, then deeper into Soviet-controlled areas. Halverson {{had an interest in}} photography and on his days off often went sightseeing in Berlin and shot film on his personal handheld movie camera. One day in July, he was filming plane takeoffs and landings at Tempelhof, the main landing site for the airlift. While there, he saw about thirty children lined up behind one of the barbed-wire fences. He went to meet them and noticed that the children had nothing. Halvorsen remembers: [...] "I met about thirty children at the barbed wire fence that protected Tempelhof's huge area. They were excited and told me that 'when the weather gets so bad that you can't land, don't worry about us. We can get by on a little food, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> our freedom, we may never get it back.'" [...] Touched, Halvorsen reached into his pocket and took out two sticks of gum to give to the children. The kids broke it into little pieces and shared it; the ones who did not get any sniffed the wrappers. Watching the children, so many of whom had absolutely nothing, Halvorsen regretted not having more to give them. Halvorsen recorded that he wanted to do more for the children, and so told them that the following day he would have enough gum for all of them, and he would drop it out of his plane. According to Halvorsen, one child asked [...] "How will we know it is your plane?" [...] to which Halvorsen responded that he would wiggle his wings, something he had done for his parents when he first got his pilot's license in 1941.|$|E
2500|$|When Jin forces led by Yang Hu were {{approaching}} Jiangling (江陵; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), the Wu officers advised Lu Kang against leaving Jiangling to attack Xiling, but Lu said, [...] "Jiangling's fortifications are strong {{and it has}} sufficient troops to defend it, so {{there is nothing to}} worry. Even if the enemy captures Jiangling, they won't be able to hold it for long and our losses will be minimal. However, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> Xiling, the tribes in the southern hills will be affected and this will lead to serious problems. I'd rather abandon Jiangling than give up on capturing Xiling. Besides, Jiangling is already very well-defended in the first place." ...|$|E

Sun Quan wanted to construct a dock at Ruxu, but his subordinates said, [...] "We should land {{on the other side}} of the river and attack the enemy, then return to our ships. Why build a dock?" [...] However, Lü Meng supported the idea of building a dock, as he said, [...] "Battles are unpredictable and we might not always win. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> and the enemy closes in, and we don't have time to retreat to the riverbank, how can we even board our ships?" [...] Sun Quan agreed with Lü Meng and had the dock constructed to make boardings and landings more convenient. With this, Sun Quan's army defended their positions against Cao Cao's approaching forces, who retreated after several failed attempts to overcome the enemy.|$|E

After Paul stated that U.S. foreign policy is dragging the Republican Party down, Huckabee responded, [...] "Even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> elections, we should not lose our honor, and that {{is more important than the}} Republican Party." [...] As the third quarter closed, Huckabee was reported to have missed a major GOP conference in Michigan because his campaign could not afford a charter flight. Huckabee rebounded his finances before the end of the third quarter, however, reporting $651,301 on hand.

2500|$|The African press named Uruguay {{public enemy}} No.1 and {{described}} them as cheats. Suárez was unapologetic about his handball, stating [...] "I {{made the best}} save of the tournament." [...] Suárez boasted after the match of his handball save, claiming that [...] "The 'Hand of God' now belongs to me," [...] {{a reference to the}} handball goal scored by Diego Maradona in the 1986 World Cup. Ghana's coach Milovan Rajevac argued that Suárez's actions were [...] "really shocking," [...] describing the result as a [...] "football injustice." [...] Uruguay's coach Óscar Tabárez defended Suárez: [...] "Saying we cheated Ghana is too harsh a word to use...We also abide by what the referee did. It could have been a mistake. Yes, he stuck his hand out, but it's not cheating. What else do you want? Is Suárez also to blame for Ghana missing the penalty?

2500|$|On {{the day of}} Hoover's death, Hoover's {{secretary}} for five decades, Helen Gandy, began destroying his files. She turned over twelve boxes of the [...] "Official/Confidential" [...] files to Felt on May 4, 1972. This consisted of 167 files and 17,750 pages, many of them containing derogatory information. Felt stored them in his office, and Gray told the press that afternoon that [...] "there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity." [...] Felt earlier that day had told Gray, [...] "Mr. Gray, the Bureau doesn't have any secret files", and later accompanied Gray to Hoover's office. They found Gandy boxing up papers. Felt said Gray [...] "looked casually at an open file drawer and approved her work", though Gray would later deny he looked at anything. Gandy retained Hoover's [...] "Personal File" [...] and destroyed it. When Felt was called to testify in 1975 by the U.S. House about the destruction of Hoover's papers, he said, [...] "There's no serious problems <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>lose</b> some papers. I don't see anything wrong and I still don't." [...] At the same hearing, Gandy claimed that she had destroyed Hoover's personal files only after receiving Gray's approval. In a letter submitted to the committee in rebuttal of Gandy's testimony, Gray vehemently denied ever giving such permission. Both Gandy's testimony and Gray's letter {{were included in the}} committee's final report.|$|E
