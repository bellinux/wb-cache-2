25|$|Gates was {{nominated}} {{to become the}} Director of Central Intelligence (head of the CIA) in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the Senate would reject the nomination due to controversy about his role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> affair.|$|E
25|$|From {{an early}} stage, the rebels {{received}} financial and military {{support from the}} United States government, and their military significance decisively depended on it. After US support was banned by Congress, the Reagan administration covertly continued it. These covert activities culminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair.|$|E
25|$|His {{tenure as}} Secretary of Defense {{is the third}} longest in U.S. history, and spanned {{the final years of}} the Cold War. He is also known for his key role in the administration's Strategic Defense Initiative and for being indicted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair.

40|$|With {{the arrival}} of the fortieth President Ronald Reagan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White House, both {{internal}} and external affairs were rearranged to meet the perceived needs of this period. A new conservative coalition was formed under Reagan that would result in a two-term administration; from January 20, 1981 until January 20, 1989. During this period, a political scandal was revealed in which criminal elements from the US government and agencies sold arms illegally to a range of questionable buyers. With the revenue, <b>the</b> Contras <b>in</b> Nicaragua were supported illegally in order to overthrow the leftist Sandinistas that were in charge. What were <b>the</b> historical settings <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> scandal took take place? Who were <b>the</b> main actors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infamous <b>Iran-Contra</b> Affair, and what was their common goal? These questions will be worked out by taking a preliminary look at an historical overview of Nicaragua events that led up to the Sandinista rule, followed up by a description of what <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> affair (also known as Iran-gate or Contra-gate) is, and how it was investigated. A link will be drawn to present day foreign politics and the neo-conservative agenda that has held <b>the</b> world <b>in</b> its grip since the election of President George W. Bush...|$|R
25|$|During the Reagan presidency, he {{secured the}} {{purchase}} of AWACs surveillance aircraft despite opposition from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. After the United States rejected an arms order, he arranged the delivery of intermediate-range nuclear-warhead-capable missiles from China. This angered the Central Intelligence Agency and the United States Department of State. He was exposed for his involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> scandal. He had arranged $32 million in Saudi financing for the Nicaraguan Contras. Nancy Reagan used him to relay messages to the Cabinet.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. role Nicaragua was a {{controversial}} {{topic in the}} 1980s. The Reagan administration had sought to overthrow the socialist Daniel Ortega by funding the right-wing Contras, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair. Bush and Secretary of State Baker sought to find a bipartisan way to settle the issue, and {{with the support of}} Congress, they ended military aid to the Contras in return for a promise from Ortega to hold full and free elections in 1990. In the election, Ortega was defeated by Violeta Chamorro of the National Opposition Union.|$|E
25|$|In October 2005, Libby {{resigned}} {{from all three}} government positions after he was indicted on five counts by {{a federal grand jury}} concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair.|$|E
50|$|Devine’s {{career at}} the CIA spanned from the late 1960s to the early 1990s, {{including}} the fall of President Salvador Allende in Chile <b>in</b> 1973, <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> scandal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1980s, and the fight to push the Soviets out of Afghanistan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980s.

500|$|In Poindexter's {{hometown}} of Odon, Indiana, a street was renamed to John Poindexter Street. Bill Breeden, a former minister, stole <b>the</b> street's sign <b>in</b> protest of <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair. He {{claimed that he}} was holding it for a ransom of $30million, <b>in</b> reference to <b>the</b> amount of money given to Iran to transfer to the Contras. He was later arrested and confined to prison, making him, as satirically noted by Howard Zinn, [...] "the only person to be imprisoned {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> Scandal".|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> 1986, <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair {{became a}} problem for the {{administration}} stemming from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to Iran during the Iran–Iraq War to fund the Contra rebels fighting against <b>the</b> government <b>in</b> Nicaragua, which had been specifically outlawed by an act of Congress. The affair became a political scandal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States during the 1980s. The International Court of Justice, whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the United States, ruled that the United States had violated international law and breached treaties in Nicaragua in various ways.|$|R
25|$|Because of {{his senior}} status in the CIA, Gates was close to many figures who played {{significant}} roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> Affair and {{was in a position}} to have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that the U.S. do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the Sandinista government. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment of Gates for his Iran-Contra activities or his responses to official inquiries.|$|E
25|$|During his 15 {{terms in}} Congress, Leach's voting record was {{generally}} conservative on fiscal issues, moderate on social matters, and progressive in foreign policy. As {{chair of the}} Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus, he pressed for a Comprehensive Test Ban and led the first House debate on a nuclear freeze. He objected to military unilateralism as reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> policy of the 1980s. He pushed for full funding of U.S. obligations to the United Nations, supported U.S. re-entry into UNESCO, and opposed U.S. withdrawal from the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.|$|E
25|$|Khashoggi was implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair {{as a key}} {{middleman}} in the arms-for-hostages exchange {{along with}} Iranian arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar and, in a complex series of events, {{was found to have}} borrowed money for these arms purchases from the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) with Saudi and United States backing. His role in the affair created a related controversy when Khashoggi donated millions to the American University in Washington, DC to build a sports arena which would bear his name. Khashoggi {{was a member of the}} university's board of trustees from 1983 until his indictment on fraud and other charges in May 1989.|$|E

Hashemi had a 9-year {{relationship with the}} UK's Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), beginning soon after his arrival <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK <b>in</b> 1984.

50|$|On December 19, 1986, Walsh {{was named}} as <b>the</b> {{independent}} counsel <b>in</b> charge of <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> investigation. His investigation {{led to the}} convictions of both former Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, Vice Admiral John Poindexter and former NSC staffer, Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, though both convictions were subsequently reversed. Walsh also brought an indictment on two counts of perjury and one count {{of obstruction of justice}} against former Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger in June 1992. That September, one count, obstruction of justice, was dismissed for technical and jurisprudence reasons.|$|R
25|$|The Boland Amendment was a {{compromise}} because the U.S. Democratic Party {{did not have}} enough votes for a comprehensive ban on military aid. It covered only appropriated funds spent by intelligence agencies. Some of Reagan's national security officials used non-appropriated money of the National Security Council (NSC) to circumvent the Amendment. NSC officials sought to arrange funding by third parties. These efforts resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> Affair of 1987, which concerned Contra funding through the proceeds of arms sales to the Islamic Republic of Iran. No court ever made a determination whether Boland covered the NSC and {{on the grounds that it}} was a prohibition rather than a criminal statute, no one was indicted for violating it. Congress later resumed aid to the Contras, totaling over $300million. The Contra war ended when the Sandinistas were voted out of power by a war-weary populace in 1990. Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega was re-elected as President of Nicaragua in 2006 and took office again on January 10, 2007.|$|E
25|$|In June 2009 a coup d'état ousted President Manuel Zelaya; he {{was taken}} in a {{military}} aircraft to neighboring Costa Rica. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called {{for the restoration of}} Zelaya. Several Latin American nations including Mexico temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico. The United States sent out mixed messages after the coup; Obama called the ouster a coup and expressed support for Zelaya's return to power. US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, advised by John Negroponte, the former Reagan-era to Honduras implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> affair, refrained from expressing support. She has since explained that the US would have had to cut aid if it called Zelaya's ouster a military coup, although the US has a record of ignoring these events when it chooses. Zelaya had expressed an interest in Hugo Chávez' Bolivarian Alliance for Peoples of our America (ALBA), and had actually joined in 2008. After the 2009 coup, Honduras withdrew its membership.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{relations}} between Noriega and the United States began to deteriorate. In 1986, U.S. President Ronald Reagan opened negotiations with General Noriega, requesting that the Panamanian leader step down {{after he was}} publicly exposed in The New York Times by Seymour Hersh, and later exposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran-Contra</b> Scandal. Reagan pressured him with several drug-related indictments in U.S. courts; however, since extradition laws between Panama and the U.S. were weak, Noriega deemed this threat not credible and did not submit to Reagan's demands. In 1988, Elliot Abrams {{and others in the}} Pentagon began pushing for a U.S. invasion, but Reagan refused, due to Bush's ties to Noriega through his previous positions in the CIA and the Task Force on Drugs, and their potentially negative impact on Bush's presidential campaign. Later negotiations involved dropping the drug-trafficking indictments. In March 1988, Noriega's forces resisted an attempted coup against the government of Panama. As relations continued to deteriorate, Noriega appeared to shift his Cold War allegiance towards the Soviet bloc, soliciting and receiving military aid from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Libya. American military planners began preparing contingency plans to invade Panama.|$|E
50|$|Director of Central Intelligence William Webster {{formally}} reprimanded Allen {{for failing}} to fully comply with the DCI's request for full cooperation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> agency's internal <b>Iran-Contra</b> scandal investigation.

25|$|Along with {{bombings and}} hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made {{extensive}} use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is decapitation, another is shooting. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the Lebanese Civil War resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1986 <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair. During <b>the</b> chaos of the Iraq War, more than 200 kidnappings foreign hostages (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. <b>In</b> 2007, <b>the</b> kidnapping of Alan Johnston by Army of Islam resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, Cutler and co-director/producer David Van Taylor spent eleven months {{following}} the U.S. Senate campaign of Lt. Col.

500|$|In January 1987, Congress {{announced}} it was opening {{an investigation into the}} Iran–Contra affair. Depending upon one's political perspective, the Congressional investigation into the Iran–Contra affair was either an attempt by the legislative arm to gain control over an out-of-control executive arm, a partisan [...] "witch hunt" [...] by the Democrats against a Republican administration or a feeble effort by Congress that did far too little to rein in the [...] "imperial presidency" [...] that had run amok by breaking numerous laws. The Democratic-controlled United States Congress issued its own report on November 18, 1987, stating that [...] "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have". The congressional report wrote that the president bore [...] "ultimate responsibility" [...] for wrongdoing by his aides, and his administration exhibited [...] "secrecy, deception and disdain for the law". It also read that [...] "the central remaining question {{is the role of the}} President <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair. On this critical point, the shredding of documents by Poindexter, North and others, and the death of Casey, leave the record incomplete".|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{believed}} {{that there was a}} moderate faction in the Islamic republic headed by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the powerful speaker of the Majlis who was seen as a leading potential successor to Khomeini and who was alleged to want a rapprochement with the United States. The Americans {{believed that}} Rafsanjani had the power to order Hezbollah to free the American hostages and establishing a relationship with him [...] by selling Iran arms would ultimately place Iran back within the American sphere of influence. It remains unclear if Rafsanjani really wanted a rapprochement with the United States or was just deceiving Reagan administration officials who were willing to believe that he was a moderate who would effect a rapprochement. Rafsanjani, whose nickname is [...] "the Shark" [...] was described by the British journalist Patrick Brogan as a man of great charm and formidable intelligence known for his subtlety and ruthlessness whose motives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iran–Contra</b> affair remain completely mysterious. The Israeli government required that the sale of arms meet high level approval from the United States government, and when McFarlane convinced them that the U.S. government approved the sale, Israel obliged by agreeing to sell the arms.|$|E
