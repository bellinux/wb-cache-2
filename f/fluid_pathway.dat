To investigate whether meridian-like structures exist in fish body and operate via volume transmission in extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways,</b> we injected alcian blue (AB) under anesthesia into Gephyrocharax melanocheir, which has a translucent body. The migration of AB could be seen directly and was recorded by a digital camera. The fish was then embedded and cut transversely to observe the position of tracks in three dimensions. Eight longitudinal threadlike blue tracks were recognized on the fish. The positions of these threadlike tracks were similar to meridians on the human body. Transverse sections showed that these tracks distributed to different layers of distinct subcutaneous loose connective tissues and intermuscular septa. Lymphatic vessels were sometimes associated with the extracellular blue tracks where the migration of AB occurred.

40|$|In {{geologic}} {{imaging spectroscopy}} studies, typical end products are often mineral maps. These maps are usually ambiguous {{and form a}} limited method of representing geological information that is potentially contained in spectroscopic images. This situation can be improved by mapping the spatial configuration {{of the effects of}} geological processes instead of the solely individual minerals in a non-spatial context. This so-called process-based mapping opens the way for a truly contextual mapping approach since the spectrally detectable expressions of processes occur in specific spatial arrangements. The contextual approach will solve the ambiguity problem occurring in mineral maps and will facilitate targeting of geologic processes. End products of this approach are not mineral maps but a map of the geological process. A typical geologic process that is suitable for mapping using airborne imaging spectroscopy is submarine hydrothermal <b>fluid</b> circulation. <b>Fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> in fossil hydrothermal systems mark the start, the course, and the end fluid circulation from sites of recharge to sites of discharge.

The process of smectite formation did not proceed through X-ray amorphous or poorly crystalline transitional phases. Alteration of the glass was found to be most pronounced adjacent to perlitic cracks and vesicles that form an interconnected network focusing fluid flow. Glass dissolution adjacent to these <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> resulted in a characteristic alteration texture at the nm scale; the intensely altered groundmass contains round cavities that are partially coated or filled by smectitic flakes. The Mg content of the smectite broadly increases towards the <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways.</b> Smectitic flakes with compositions corresponding to saponite occur in the intensely altered groundmass adjacent to perlitic cracks. In addition, anatase, apatite and rare kaolinite were formed during the alteration of the volcanic glass. Primary minerals including plagioclase show only minor textural evidence of alteration.

A combination of computed tomography and electron microscopy have been used to identify, characterise and interpret the distribution, size, interconnectivity and secondary mineralisation of fractures through which water flowed. Secondary minerals which formed during aqueous alteration are found as fracture-filling silicates in olivine grains and a range of carbonates, sulfates and halite are found throughout olivine, pyroxene and mesostasis. The fractures which acted as <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> are highly interconnected, branching and reconnecting at multiple locations, leading to a pervasive and homogeneous distribution of secondary minerals throughout the sample. Miniature topographic basins have been identified and provide a unique method of identifying the true orientation of the meteorite while on its host planetary surface.

We use laboratory measurements of frictional properties to show that clay minerals on a simulated fault interface are characterized by weak and slow recovery, whereas other materials such as quartz show relatively quick recovery and thereby strong coupling on the fault surface. Aqueous fluids change the mineralogy at the plate interface by producing clay minerals due to hydrate reactions, suggesting that the hydrated weakly coupled regions act as a non-asperity and form a barrier to rupture propagation along the plate boundary at the depths of seismogenic zone.|$|E

At that time, 3 He/ 4 He ratios were determined for these fumarolic gases, yielding a value of 7.8 Ra (1 Ra corresponds to the atmospheric 3 He/ 4 He ratio), which demonstrates that magmatic gases were being supplied to the Iwo-Yama fumaroles (Sato et al., 1999). In another study on Kirishima volcanic group (Aizawa et al., submitted), the 3 D resistivity structure was modeled to a depth of 20 km, indicating the presence of a sub-vertical conductive zone connecting a deep-seated conductive body (at a depth of 10 km) to a shallow conductive layer near the Iwo-Yama volcano (Fig. 1).

METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging from 56 Griffon Bruxellois dogs was assessed for Chiari-like malformation and cerebrospinal <b>fluid</b> <b>pathway</b> abnormalities. Skull radiographs were obtained in 33 dogs. Two rostrocaudal and two ventrodorsal measurements were made, and ratios of one length to another were compared. RESULTS: In this selected sample, 60. 7 per cent had Chiari-like malformation. Syringomyelia occurred with and without Chiari-like malformation (37. 5 and 8. 9 per cent study population, respectively). The radiographic study demonstrated that one measurement ratio {{could be used to}} predict Chiari-like malformation (sensitivity of 87 per cent and specificity of 78 per cent) and that there were significant interaction factors between sex and syringomyelia for two measurement ratios.

The seafloor spreading fabric of the incoming Cocos plate is oriented parallel to the trench such that flexural bending at the outer rise optimally reactivates a dense network of normal faults that extend several kilometers into the upper mantle. Bending faults are thought to provide <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways</b> that lead to serpen-tinization of the upper mantle. While geophysical anomalies detected beneath the outer rise have been interpreted as broad crustal and upper mantle hydration, no observational evidence exists to confirm that bending faults behave as <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways.</b> Here we use seafloor electromagnetic data collected across the Middle America Trench (MAT) offshore of Nicaragua to create a comprehensive electrical resistivity image that illuminates the infiltration of seawater along bending faults. We quantify porosity from the resistivity with Archie’s law and find that our estimates for the abyssal plain oceanic crust are in good agreement with independent observations. As the Cocos crust traverses the outer rise, the porosity of the dikes and gabbros progressively increase from 2. 7 % and 0. 7 % to 4. 8 % and 1. 7 %, peaking within 20 km of the trench axis. We conclude that the intrusive crust subducts twice as much pore water as previously thought, significantly raising the flux of fluid to the seismogenic zone and the mantle wedge. 1...|$|R

In permeable systems with a well-connected porosity, fluid transport is largely driven by fluid pressure gradients. In less permeable rocks, deformation may induce permeability by creating interconnected heterogeneities, but without these perturbations, mass transport is limited along grain boundaries or relies on transformation processes that self-generate transient <b>fluid</b> <b>pathways.</b> The latter can facilitate large-scale fluid and mass transport in nominally impermeable rocks without large-scale <b>fluid</b> transport <b>pathways.</b> Here, {{we show that}} pervasive, fluid-driven metamorphism of crustal igneous rocks is directly coupled {{to the production of}} nanoscale porosity.
