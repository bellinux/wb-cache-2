After a failed experiment running a <b>gas,</b> <b>coke,</b> and lighting company, Rougier purchased a sports shop in Horsham with money they borrowed from Heyer's aunts.

Within a few years, he had not only won equal pay for equal work for women but also negotiated a health insurance plan—one which included the first dental insurance coverage in the private sector in the U.S. During his tenure as president of Local 149, Mazzocchi also led numerous successful organizing drives. [...] He merged several smaller locals into his own and conducted a number of organizing drives, until Local 149 represented workers in 25 companies. He was elected Vice-President of the Nassau-Suffolk CIO Council from 1952 to 1955, and (after the merger of the AFL and CIO in 1955) the Long Island Federation of Labor from 1955 to 1973.|$|E
60|$|Or {{suppose the}} reverse case; that more coke is wanted {{at the present}} prices than can be {{supplied}} by the operations required by the existing demand for <b>gas.</b> <b>Coke,</b> being now in deficiency, will rise in price. The whole operation will yield {{more than the usual}} rate of profit, and additional capital will be attracted to the manufacture. The unsatisfied demand for coke will be supplied; but this can not be done without increasing the supply of gas too; and, as the existing demand was fully supplied already, an increased quantity can only find a market by lowering the price. Equilibrium will be attained when the demand for each article fits so well with the demand for the other, that the quantity required of each is exactly as much as is generated in producing the quantity required of the other.|$|E

After they were no longer part of AFL and CIO, Lewis strengthened District 50.

30|$|In {{addition}} to the initial cracking reactions to form alkane and olefin, {{there are a number}} of secondary acid-catalyzed reactions that occur during hydrocarbon cracking, such as skeletal and/or double-bond position isomerizations, cyclization reactions, aromatization, alkylation, dealkylation, branching and polymerization. The secondary reactions produce a large amount of low carbon molecules such as aromatics and alkenes which are in favor of improving octane number of gasoline and propylene and butane yields. However, overcracking reactions of distillates also decrease light distillate yields and increase dry <b>gas</b> and <b>coke</b> formation, which are usually unexpected. Taking the thermal cracking into consideration, the FCC operation proceeds via parallel series reactions in the catalyst riser, converting high molecule hydrocarbons into light distillates, <b>gases</b> and <b>coke.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Producer gas is {{fuel gas}} that is {{manufactured}} from material such as coal, {{as opposed to}} natural gas. In this respect it is similar to other types of [...] "manufactured" [...] gas, such as coal <b>gas,</b> <b>coke</b> oven gas, water gas and carburetted water gas. Producer gas was used primarily as an industrial fuel for iron and steel manufacturing, such as firing coke ovens and blast furnaces, cement and ceramic kilns, or for mechanical power through gas engines. It was characteristically low in heating value but cheap to make, so that large amounts could be made and burnt.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{has been to}} describe different cases of the methanol production from steel-work off <b>gases</b> (<b>Coke</b> oven <b>gas</b> and Basic oxygen furnace gas) and biomass based synthesis gas. The SSAB steel mill {{in the town of}} Luleå, Sweden {{has been used as a}} basis to analyze four different methanol production cases. The studied biomass gasification technology is based on a fluidized bed gasifier unit, where the production capacity is determined from case to case coupled to the heat production required to satisfy the local district heating demand. Critical factors are the integration of the gases with availability to the synthesis unit, to balance the steam system of the biorefinery and to meet the district heat demand of Luleå. For each case, the annual production potential of methanol, the overall production efficiencies and the effects on the total steel plant have been estimated.
