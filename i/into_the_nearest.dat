25|$|In {{addition}} to {{her role as a}} judge on The X Factor, Cheryl Cole made a high-profile appearance on Piers Morgan's Life Stories, in which she discussed her marriage and divorce with Ashley Cole and her life-threatening battle with malaria. The show's ratings reached an all-time high. Polydor Records worked with advertising firm MediaCom to create various marketing strategies to promote the album, such as the usage of Facebook Places. Billboard posters invited fans to check <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> poster using Facebook Places on their smartphone, to win tickets, travel and hotel for a recording of The X Factor.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not clear}} when {{pollution}} first became an issue for the River Trent, but in the late 1880s, it had a thriving salmon fishery, with the river producing an annual catch of some 3,000 fish, a decade later, this had fallen to 100. The collapse of the fishery {{was due to the}} rapid population increase of the towns that developed following the Industrial Revolution. The tipping point being the introduction of piped water and a basic sewer network, which meant that effluent, which was previously stored in cesspits, was carried away through drains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> brook.|$|E

25|$|Every {{player has}} {{a limit to}} {{the total number of}} units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population limit increases with the number of houses or town centers in the player's village to a maximum of 200, with each house contributing five (or ten for the Norse) and each town center contributing 20 to the limit. There are two important features for unit management: The idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all of the player's villagers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> town center, fortress or tower for safety.|$|E
25|$|The English {{therefore}} had {{no alternative}} but to tow their vessels <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> friendly harbor, that being Tétouan on the Barbary coast. Once there fresh supplies were bought in and the inhabitants treated them favorably. News soon trickled in of the repulse of the galleys and the governor extended gifts upon them and granted them stay {{for as long as they}} wanted. After around four days and with the wind now in their favor, the English sailed off without incident; the Spanish in the harbor of Algeciras unable to intercept them because of their severe damage or the rough sea. The English soon arrived off the coast of England without further hindrance.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} UDDTs serve {{indigenous}} communities who live along small rivers {{as well as}} ecotourism operations in the Amazonian part of the country. In these regions, piped water supply is often lacking, clay-rich soils do not permit infiltration of wastewater, and the groundwater level is usually high. These factors make other types of toilets {{or other forms of}} excreta management problematic. For example, local governments and ecotourism operations often install flush toilets that drain straight into rivers or into holes in the ground, where the water is intended to drain but cannot, since the soil is mostly impermeable clay. Coupled with the abundant local rainfall, these pits tend to fill very fast and overflow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> streams. The streams get easily contaminated with fecal matter, as they are often quite small and there is not much dilution with clean river water. This leads to health hazards for the communities who use these rivers for drinking water, washing, swimming, and fishing.|$|E

500|$|Squadron Leader Arch Tindal, Northern Area Command Armaments Officer, {{added his}} weight to Lerew's pleas for modern aircraft. Tindal had arrived to inspect No.24 Squadron {{in the middle}} of an enemy attack on 3January, and {{immediately}} leapt <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> Wirraway to attempt an interception. He later submitted a report to headquarters at Townsville, echoing Lerew's concerns regarding the Wirraway's capabilities and warning that [...] "Rabaul is now wide open to bombing attack". Despite this, morale remained high in the unit; Lerew remarked on the devil-may-care attitude of his personnel, who frequently waited until the last moment to take cover during air raids. On 17January, Lerew was able to gain sufficient height in his Wirraway to confront a Japanese seaplane in a head-on attack, but his [...]303 machine-gun ammunition was not sufficient to bring it down. In 1956, while at a conference in Tokyo, he coincidentally met the Japanese plane's pilot, who informed him that his lone assault had damaged an engine and killed two crewmen, adding that Lerew was [...] "the bravest enemy I ever faced".|$|E

In this special, a female [...] "despair squid", whose ink causes joy and elation instead of despair to defend herself, causes Lister, Rimmer, the Cat and Kryten to share a hallucination where they believe they are fictional characters from a TV series called Red Dwarf, and their dimension is [...] "invalid". This leads them to be shown being pulled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>nearest</b> [...] "valid" [...] reality. They confront the [...] "Creator" [...] of Red Dwarf (Richard O'Callaghan) on a version of 21st century Earth who is ready to kill off the characters, and Lister accidentally kills him. The four subconsciously realise that they're hallucinating, and they wake up on board Red Dwarf. Kryten and Rimmer speculate {{that they were able to}} choose whether or not they wanted to wake up because of the strengthened antibodies of the four from the previous encounter with the despair squid.|$|E
