Critics contend that the technique may increase poaching by creating a perception of scarcity that increases ivory's value on the black market, and that evidence for the technique's effectiveness is insufficient to justify the opportunity cost for countries struggling with poverty.|$|E

Concretely, a linear map is determined by where <b>it</b> <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> basis: just as an invertible map can take any basis to any other basis, an orthogonal map can take any orthogonal basis to any other orthogonal basis.|$|E
25|$|Prosecutors say <b>it</b> <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> {{message that}} no one is above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a flight risk, since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E

Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who {{independently}} released his sixth album Ghosts I-IV under a Creative Commons licence the following year, thought {{it did not}} go far enough, calling it [...] "very much a bait and switch, {{to get you to}} pay for a MySpace-quality stream as a way to promote a very traditional record sale." [...] Singer Lily Allen called it [...] "arrogant", saying: [...] " [...] millions of pounds. <b>It</b> <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> weird message to younger bands who haven't done as well. You don't choose how to pay for eggs. Why should it be different for music?" [...] In the Guardian, journalist Will Hodgkinson wrote: [...] "Spare a thought for the thousands upon thousands of bands and singers who, nowhere near Radiohead's levels of fame and fortune, now have pretty much no chance of ever making a living from their music." [...] Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth told the Guardian the release [...] "seemed really community-oriented, but it wasn't catered towards their musician brothers and sisters, who don’t sell as many records as them. It makes everyone else look bad for not offering their music for whatever." ...|$|E
500|$|Geoff Klock eschewed {{the term}} [...] "deconstruction" [...] {{in favor of}} {{describing}} Watchmen as a [...] "revisionary superhero narrative". He considers Watchmen and Frank Miller's [...] to be [...] "the first instances [...] of [...] new kind of comic book [...] a first phase of development, the transition of the superhero from fantasy to literature." [...] He elaborates by noting that [...] "Alan Moore's realism [...] performs a kenosis towards comic book history [...] does not ennoble and empower his characters [...] Rather, <b>it</b> <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> wave of disruption back through superhero history [...] devalue {{one of the basic}} superhero conventions by placing his masked crime fighters in a realistic world". First and foremost, [...] "Moore's exploration of the [...] motives for costumed crimefighting sheds a disturbing light on past superhero stories, and forces the reader to reevaluate—to revision—every superhero in terms of Moore's kenosis—his emptying out of the tradition". Klock relates the title to the quote by Juvenal to highlight the problem of controlling those who hold power and quoted repeatedly within the work itself. The deconstructive nature of Watchmen is, Klock notes, played out on the page also as, [...] "ike Alan Moore's kenosis, [...] must destroy, then reconstruct, in order to build 'a unity which would survive him.|$|E

Thus a trains address will gradually increase or decrease, depending on its direction, as it travels along the track.

2500|$|Children {{may have}} {{problems}} with bladder control (primarily at night), until eight years or older, and may wear diapers while sleeping to control bedwetting. The Children's Health and Wellness website claims that diapering a child can prolong bedwetting, as <b>it</b> <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> [...] "message of permission" [...] to urinate in their sleep. [...] Dr Anthony Page of the Creative Child Online Magazine claims that children can get used to their diapers and begin to view them as a comfort, {{and that of the}} children surveyed, most would rather wear diapers than worry about getting up at night to go to the toilet. In a series of online surveys, Robert A Pretlow, MD, of eHealth International, Inc., cites an identical figure. He argues that if Internet users are representative of society as a whole, these surveys imply that a fetishistic or emotional attraction to diapers may be responsible for these [...] "comfort" [...] cases, and that [...] "these behaviors are a significant cause of enuresis and incontinence." [...] He called for further studies to be done on the topic.|$|E

2500|$|Yeast {{transport}} {{amino acids}} and small peptides (less than 5 amino acid residues) {{into the cell}} via an active transport process that utilizes specialized membrane proteins and {{the difference in the}} pH gradient of the acidic wine solution (pH between 3-4) and the near neutral pH of cytoplasm inside the yeast cells. The proton symport proteins in the membrane take in the amino acid coupled with a hydrogen ion that later gets expelled by the cell via a hydrogen ion pump. This is an energy dependent process that becomes more energetically unfavorable for the yeast cell as fermentation progressed and ethanol levels increase, creating [...] "passive leakage" [...] of excess hydrogen ions into the cell. The cell's hydrogen ion pumps have to work even harder to maintain its internal pH so <b>it</b> <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> signal to the symport proteins to stop bringing other ions. This {{is one of the reasons}} why late fermentation nitrogen additions have little to no effective as the transport mechanisms of the nitrogen into the cell are shut down.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} segments along the route occur in this area as the train clings precariously to the mountainsides – particularly Groundhog Mountain and Mount Cheadle. One place in particular is known as Little Hells Gate (Port d'Enfer), an area featuring treacherous rapids on the river similar to those in Hells Gate farther south on the Fraser River. Passengers will note railway slide fences {{on one side of the}} train. These wire fences protect the tracks and train from falling debris. When a wire breaks or is compromised, <b>it</b> <b>sends</b> <b>a</b> signal to stop or proceed at a much slower speed. As it is, the train creeps along at a cautious pace – [...] – along this stretch. It is not difficult to see why. On the other side of the train are views to the North Thompson River down below as well as toward the often-snow-covered mountains in the distance. One of the prettiest sights in this area is of Pyramid Falls, which cascades [...] down the side of Mount Cheadle. The train slows down enough for passengers to get close-up looks and maybe get a nice picture or two. The Cariboo Mountains and Slide Mountain are to the west. Malton Range is to the east. The train crosses the Canoe River over a [...] bridge shortly before arriving Valemount. It was also south of Valemount and north of the Canoe River where the Canoe River crash occurred on November 21, 1950. Memorials can be seen from the train. The icefields of the Albreda Glacier should be visible for several miles.|$|E
