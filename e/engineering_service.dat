Tickford's name had been long associated with expensive high quality carriages and cars and their folding roofs. New products included a Tickford Austin Metro, a Tickford Ford Capri and even Tickford train interiors, particularly on the Jaguar XJS. Pace continued sponsoring racing events, and now sponsored all Aston Martin Owners Club events, taking a Tickford-engined Nimrod Group C car owned by AMOC President Viscount Downe, which came third in the Manufacturers Championship in both 1982 and 1983. It also finished seventh in the 1982 24 Hours of Le Mans race. However, sales of production cars were now at an all-time low of 30 cars produced in 1982.|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} focuses on {{strategic}} thinking and opportunistic approaches to business growth and diversification. It begins {{by examining the}} recent purchase of ‘Quickcover’, a remote-controlled sports pitch covering system, by engineering company Strategic <b>Engineering</b> <b>services</b> and the company’s current dilemma – whether to continue to develop this type of product, or sell it and concentrate on its existing <b>engineering</b> <b>services</b> business. In recent years, Strategic <b>Engineering</b> <b>Services</b> has moved away from traditional heavy engineering and diversified into related areas such as <b>engineering</b> <b>services,</b> {{oil and gas industry}} recruitment, plant and equipment hire, instrument calibration and project management. The case considers the relationship between strategic thinking and entrepreneurial approaches to opportunity recognition, exploring the concept of intelligent opportunism as an approach that enables entrepreneurs to develop emergent strategies and take advantage of new opportunities. It explores these concepts {{in the context of the}} current dilemma of Strategic <b>Engineering</b> <b>Services.</b> Keywords: intelligent opportunism; emergent strategy; strategic thinking;effectuatio...|$|R

At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember it was very clear in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. There was no question about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were." [...] Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National <b>Engineering</b> <b>Service</b> for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program.

2500|$|Initial work in {{the sector}} {{established}} a series of casemates in the Raismes Forest, between Valenciennes and the Belgian border. The casemates were built by the Commission d'Organisation des Régions Fortifiées (CORF), the Maginot Line's design and construction agency. As the fortification of the Escaut Front was commenced later than the main section of the Line to the east, funds were restricted by {{the impact of the}} Great Depression, which had reached France. The plan was also affected by political considerations, in which the fortification of the Belgian frontier was seen as a betrayal of the French plan for forward defense on Belgian territory. Most of the Escaut blockhouses built in 1936-37 were built under local initiatives to designs by the Army <b>Engineering</b> <b>Service</b> Section Technique du Génie (STG). The CORF lines in the Raismes Forest were augmented by lesser positions in the principal line of resistance constructed in 1936-37. In 1940 a few hasty fortifications were built to the rear of Valenciennes under the authority of the Study Commission for the Fortified Zones (Commission des Études des Zones Fortifiées" [...] (CEZF) [...] ).|$|E
