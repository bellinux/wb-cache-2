40|$|This methodological report {{details the}} work done in the Prospective Insights on R&D in ICT (PREDICT) project in 2017. PREDICT {{provides}} updated indicators for the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sector and for its Research and Development (R&D) in the European Union and in the major ICT leaders worldwide. This project is being carried out jointly by the Joint Research Centre, <b>Directorate</b> <b>B</b> and the Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CNECT) of the European Commission. The data and methodologies have been developed {{in collaboration with the}} Valencian Institute of Economic Research (IVIE). The 2017 PREDICT Dataset has been deepened and expanded in this latest version in order to include complementary dimensions, such as the Media and Content sector and sub-sectors. An updated methodology for estimating ICT Government Budget allocations for Research and Development (ICT GBARD) has been applied. Furthermore, for the most important indicators, existing PREDICT time series have been reconstructed back to 1995, while figures are now-casted for 2015 and 2016. JRC. B. 6 -Digital Econom...|$|E
30|$|The SADC {{configuration}} {{is shown}} in two perspectives represented by boxes B 1 to B 10, and BA to BK. Boxes B 1 to B 10 represent the institutional hierarchy and reporting relationships within the hierarchical structure. Boxes BA to BK represent the functional descriptions associated with the institutional boxes (B 1 to B 10). The summit of the Heads of State to the SADC joint DRM Task Team (boxes B 1 to B 10) represent structures within the SADC system, while boxes BA to BK explain the nature of those structures and what the different administrative levels are responsible for. For the institutional model for collaborative DRM in the SADC, the SADC DRR Inter-Ministerial Committee (B 6) is critical because it provides political direction and stewardship for DRM and reduction in the SADC and is aligned with the theoretical grounding of neoliberal institutionalism of diplomatic strategic relations of states, conflict management, and general governance. Through {{the work of the}} SADC DRR Inter-Ministerial Committee (B 6) and that of its subordinate structures such as the SADC DRR <b>Directorate</b> (<b>B</b> 7), the SADC DRR Technical Committee (B 8), the Forum of non-state agencies (B 9), and the Joint DRR Technical Committee of the SADC (B 10), the actualization of the institutional collaborative model is conducted through SADC DRM Mutual Aid Agreements and Operational Frameworks (Box BK). This implies that the functioning of the administrative units represented in these boxes (B 6, B 7, B 8, B 9, and B 10) will culminate in the SADC collaborative system as shown in box BK (addressing high-level administrative cooperation, as well as all manner of political, economic, and social cross-border transactions). The arrow and double line linking the SADC Joint DRR Technical Committee (B 10) and the SADC DRM Mutual Aid Agreements and Operational Frameworks (BK) show (1) the functions to be performed by the Joint DRR Technical Committee (B 10); {{and the fact that the}} mutual aid agreements and operational frameworks will assume a bilateral and multilateral form and represent regional relationships.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} updated {{analysis}} of LHS 6343, a triple {{system in the}} Kepler field which consists of a brown dwarf transiting one member of a widely separated M+M binary system. By analyzing the full Kepler data set and 34 Keck/HIgh Resolution Echelle Spectrometer radial velocity observations, we measure both the observed transit depth and Doppler semiamplitude to 0. 5 % precision. With Robo-AO and Palomar/PHARO adaptive optics imaging as well as TripleSpec spectroscopy, we measure a model-dependent mass for LHS 6343 C of 62. 1 ± 1. 2 M Jup and a radius of 0. 783 ± 0. 011 R Jup. We detect the secondary eclipse in the Kepler data at 3. 5 σ, measuring ecos ω = 0. 0228 ± 0. 0008. We also derive a method to measure the mass and radius of a star and transiting companion directly, without any direct reliance on stellar models. The mass and radius of both objects depend only on the orbital period, stellar density, reduced semimajor axis, Doppler semiamplitude, eccentricity, and inclination, {{as well as the}} knowledge that the primary star falls on the main sequence. With this method, we calculate a mass and radius for LHS 6343 C to a precision of 3 % and 2 %, respectively. The RV data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. We are grateful to the entire Kepler team, past and present. Their tireless efforts were all essential to the tremendous success of the mission and the future successes of K 2. Some of the data presented in this paper were obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). STScI is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5 - 26555.

[...] Doughty was named to participate in the 2007 Super Series, an eight-game tournament against the Russian juniors meant to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the 1972 Summit Series. [...] He played in all eight games, recording two assists, as Canada finished the series unbeaten with seven wins and a tie. He then earned a spot on the roster for the 2008 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Doughty was named a tournament all-star, and given the <b>Directorate</b> Award for <b>Best</b> Defenceman after helping lead the Canadians to their fourth consecutive gold medal at the tournament.|$|R
