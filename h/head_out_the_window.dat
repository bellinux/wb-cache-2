6000|$|... "Why," [...] said Cork McManus, {{pulling his}} ear, [...] "I'm the latest thing in suitings with side vents and bell skirt {{when it comes}} to escortin' a lady. You bet you'll find me all right, Ruby. And I'll give you a tip as to who I am. My {{governor}} is one of the hottest cross-buns of the Wall Street push. Morgan's cab horse casts a shoe every time the old man sticks his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Me! Well, I'm in trainin' down the Street. The old man's goin' to put a seat on the Stock Exchange in my stockin' my next birthday. But it all sounds like a lemon to me. What I like is golf and yachtin' and--er--well, say a corkin' fast ten-round bout between welter-weights with walkin' gloves." ...|$|E
50|$|Henwood, {{while riding}} the tram, was {{overcome}} by a fit of nausea and stuck his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> This breached a bylaw made by the tram authority as a safety precaution, and he was struck twice by standards outside the tram.|$|E
50|$|Isaac Seneca's brother, Victor Seneca, {{also played}} for Carlisle. On the train {{returning}} from {{a game against the}} University of Pennsylvania in 1897, Victor was killed when he put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of the train and was struck by a telegraph pole.|$|E
60|$|The voices {{dropped to}} a whisper. The Bishop thrust his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Larson {{explains}} {{the creative process}} he goes through in making cartoons, showing the original doodles in his sketchbook alongside the final published versions. Sometimes he makes large changes to his initial idea, other times the differences are more subtle. (Example: A sketch of [...] "If Dogs Drove," [...] showing canine drivers hanging their <b>heads</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> was changed to [...] "When dogs go to work," [...] which depicts a bus-full of dogs with their <b>heads</b> hanging <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.)</b> He discusses <b>the</b> reasons for the changes he makes, {{and in a few}} cases he admits that he now prefers an earlier version, or that the final version could have been changed further.|$|R
60|$|I put my <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and shrieked <b>out</b> a laugh; {{but made}} no other reply.|$|R
5000|$|The scene then {{shifts to}} Holly DeCarlo, a lonely young girl and {{aspiring}} magician {{with only one}} friend, a tone-deaf, somewhat geeky character named Charles who {{has a knack for}} climatology. While practicing a magic act with Charles, the wind blows Holly's hat off her <b>head,</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and onto a snowman who comes to life as Frosty, thus revealing that Holly's hat was [...] "that old silk hat" [...] featured in the original song and previous adaptations.|$|E
50|$|Renfield (Dwight Frye) is a {{solicitor}} {{traveling to}} Count Dracula's (Bela Lugosi) castle in Transylvania {{on a business}} matter. The people in the local village fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses {{to stay at the}} inn and asks his carriage driver {{to take him to the}} Borgo Pass. Renfield is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> to ask the driver to slow down, but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.|$|E
5000|$|The bowler, not {{the cowboy}} hat or sombrero, {{was the most}} popular hat in the American West, {{prompting}} Lucius Beebe to call it [...] "the hat that won the West". Both cowboys and railroad workers preferred the hat because it would not blow off easily in strong wind while riding a horse, or when sticking one's <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> of a speeding train. It was worn by both lawmen and outlaws, including Bat Masterson, Butch Cassidy, Black Bart, and Billy the Kid. In America the hat came to be known commonly as the derby, and American outlaw Marion Hedgepeth was commonly referred to as [...] "the Derby Kid".|$|E
60|$|Lyra bent {{her face}} on her arm, and Jack Wilmington put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> where he stood.|$|R
60|$|Cass melted. He moved. Miss Porter put her <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and drew}} {{it back in}} a moment dry-eyed.|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} Ulf heard steps rapidly approaching; then a low whistle. He put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
5000|$|She {{was born}} in Nashville, Georgia, and was raised by black nannies. From the 1940s {{she worked as a}} stage comedian, {{performing}} monologues and songs accompanied by her pianist brother, George [...] "Geunie" [...] Griner, who died in 1975. Her most notable recording, in 1954, was [...] "Callin' Moody Field," [...] which described the lives of African-American airmen at Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta, Georgia. [...] "Callin' Moody Field" [...] was a regional rhythm and blues hit (Groove 0009). In the performance, Miss Peaches is talking to the base telephone operator and trying to reach her boyfriend: [...] "You doesn't know Cathead. Well, honey, just stick yo <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and holler for Cathead. He'll come." ...|$|E
50|$|The eight {{doctors in}} the town, who belonged to the Donora Medical Association, made house calls much like the firefighters {{during the period of}} intense smog, often visiting the houses of {{patients}} who were treated by the other doctors in town. This was a result of patients calling every doctor in town in the hope of getting treatment faster. It was not until mid-day Saturday that Mrs. Cora Vernon, executive director of the American Red Cross, had it set up so that all calls going to the doctors’ offices would be switched to the emergency center being established in the town hall. The smog was so intense that driving was nearly abandoned; those who chose to continue driving were risky. “I drove {{on the left side of}} the street with my <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Steering by scraping the curb.” recalls Davis.|$|E
50|$|The play {{opens at}} the {{exterior}} of a farmhouse in New England. It is sunset on an early summer day in 1850. Eben Cabot enters {{and walks to the}} edge of the porch. He rings a bell to call in his half-brothers, Simeon and Peter, who emerge soon after Eben goes back inside. The two brothers begin to talk about gold in the west and the risk of leaving everything they have worked for here. Eben sticks his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> as the two brothers speculate over their father's disappearance to the west, saying that he hasn't left the farm in 30 years or more. They decide they can't go west until their father dies. Eben reveals himself then by saying he prays his father were dead. With one last look at the setting sun and the promise of the west, the brothers retreat inside for supper.|$|E
60|$|The {{smoke was}} now getting very dense, {{and they could}} with {{difficulty}} breathe. Rupert put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
50|$|Johnson {{was known}} to have a serious {{drinking}} problem. In Berry's autobiography, he wrote that he had declared {{there would be no}} drinking in the car while the band was on the road. Johnson and his bandmates complied with the request by putting their <b>heads</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> Johnson denied <b>the</b> story but said he did drink on the road. Johnson quit drinking in 1991, after nearly suffering a stroke on stage with Eric Clapton.|$|R
60|$|The man obeyed. I {{sprang to}} the ground. The Baron had his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and <b>the</b> driver was {{flogging}} his horses.|$|R
5000|$|Browning {{was a man}} of {{eccentric}} personal habits, {{particularly in}} relation to his bats. He spoke to them, and gave each one a name, often that of a Biblical figure. In the belief that any individual bat contained only a certain number of hits, he would periodically [...] "retire" [...] bats, keeping vast numbers of the retired ones in the home he shared with his mother. These bats were 37 inches long and 48 ounces in weight, enormous even {{by the standards of the}} time. He also habitually stared at the sun, thinking that by doing so, he would strengthen his eyes. He also [...] "cleansed" [...] his eyes when travelling by train by sticking his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> in an effort to catch cinders in them. Browning also computed his average on his cuffs on a regular basis, and was not above announcing to all when his train arrived at a depot that he was the champion batter of the American Association.|$|E
5000|$|The band {{announced}} on July 3 that they'll be premiering the second single off Visions of a Life on Beats 1 on July 5. It was released after its premiere to streaming services and digital download. In {{an interview with}} Matt Wilkinson of Beats 1, the band described the song as [...] "the most synth-heavy tune" [...] they've made. Lead vocalist Ellie Rowsell also said: [...] "I kind of wanted to make one of those <b>head</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> on a long drive tunes. And I wanted to try my hand at like a hold-nothing-back love song. That was my thoughts. But other than that I just kinda let it go where it wanted to go… I just think if you hold back it will sound worse won't it?". Regarding {{the sound of the}} album, they added: [...] "I think hopefully when people hear the whole thing it won't be so all over the place. There are things that tie the 'Yuk Foos' and 'Don't Delete The Kisses' together if you know what I mean. There's hopefully something for everyone. I too struggle to define it" ...|$|E
60|$|In {{another moment}} Miss Peppy {{was seated in}} a carriage, with her <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> talking earnestly and rapidly to Mrs Niven.|$|R
60|$|But only a curse {{answered}} him, and a peremptory command not to {{lose sight}} of the prisoners by poking his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me out! Let me out! Jump! Jump!" [...] shrieked Aunt Kipp, {{thrusting}} her <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> {{while she}} fumbled madly for the door-handle.|$|R
60|$|Ginger {{stuck his}} <b>'ead</b> <b>out</b> o' <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> and by and by, when Peter whistled, him and Sam took the dog downstairs and <b>out</b> into <b>the</b> street.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Travers slipped {{inside and}} then thrust his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> [...] "Won’t she think it funny {{you should be}} so handy?" [...] he inquired.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the {{railings}} of Green Park, just by 'Yde Park Corner. One of 'em puts 'is <b>'ead</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> {{and calls}} {{to me to}} pull up." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alick put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> <b>window.</b> [...] "All right, sir; Joe {{has been}} a little hard on the crest of the {{left-hand}} one, but it is recovering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove!" [...] he thought, [...] "we must {{be nearly}} there!" [...] and {{he stuck his}} <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and got <b>the</b> air full in his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were not}} {{with him when}} he entered the cab and put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> telling <b>the</b> driver to go along Piccadilly until he was stopped?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you talk}} to me with your <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> as if this were a gallanty show. You come down and open the door," [...] {{commanded}} Mr. Korner.|$|R
60|$|The {{soldier who}} sat {{opposite}} to them {{must have heard}} the cry too, for he jumped up, as if wakened from sleep, and put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
60|$|They both craned their <b>heads</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> {{straining}} {{to hear what}} the policemen were shouting. People were coming <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> side streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking.|$|R
60|$|Mr Gazebee {{gathered}} himself up, {{and turned}} away his <b>head,</b> looking <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
6000|$|When {{they had}} {{finished}} the picnic supper he thrust his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and reported, [...] "It's turned awful chilly, and I think it's going to rain. You don't {{want to go to}} the movies." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{heard the}} shouts behind. Peter Ruff {{did as he}} was bid, and sat upon the floor, raising himself {{gradually}} to the seat when they had turned another corner. Then he put his <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop," [...] cried Harry, {{after a long}} while, {{putting his}} <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>window,</b> all at once--"stop! do you hear, you deaf man? you have passed the house--No. 40 I told you--that's it--the high steps there, with the purple light!" ...|$|R
