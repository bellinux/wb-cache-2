5|$|By 1798 the British Royal Navy had {{successfully}} contained the French Navy {{within its own}} <b>harbours,</b> employing a strategy of close blockade to ensure dominance at sea during the French Revolutionary Wars. The strategy was particularly effective in the English Channel, where the proximity of British bases and the importance in limiting {{the movements of the}} French invasion forces stationed around Boulogne focused British attention on the Normandy coast. This was essential to prevent the concentration of a large force of invasion barges that had been constructed at various <b>harbours</b> under the guidance of a Captain Muskein. To improve the Royal Navy's ability to observe French movements on the Normandy coast, a force under the command of Captain Sir Sidney Smith seized, garrisoned, and fortified the uninhabited Îles Saint-Marcouf in 1795.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} French {{garrison}} on Île Bonaparte had surrendered, Rowley {{had turned his}} attention eastwards to Isle de France. The British commander had decided {{that the best way}} to eliminate the threat of Hamelin's squadron was to blockade the island's principal ports by seizing the coral islands that marked the entrances to the <b>harbours</b> through the complicated coral reefs that surrounded Isle de France. These islands were fortified, and once in British hands could prevent French ships leaving or entering the <b>harbours,</b> effectively containing Hamelin's ships until Rowley was ready to launch an invasion. Detailed to lead this campaign was Captain Samuel Pym in Sirius and Willoughby in Nereide, with instructions to begin by seizing Île de la Passe at the entrance to the harbour of Grand Port on the south-eastern coast of Isle de France.|$|E

5|$|The {{advent of}} iron {{ships in the}} late 19thcentury and the {{development}} of port facilities on the River Tees led to the decline of smaller Yorkshire <b>harbours.</b> The Monks-haven launched in 1871 was the last wooden ship built Whitby and a year later the harbour was silted up.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications of Malta {{consist of}} a number of walled cities, citadels, forts, towers, batteries, redoubts, entrenchments and pillboxes. The fortifications were built over {{thousands}} of years, from around 1450 BC to the mid-20th century, and they are a result of the Maltese islands' strategic position and natural <b>harbours,</b> which have made them very desirable for various powers.|$|E

5|$|As {{the islands}} have no <b>harbours</b> or anchorages, the {{phosphate}} ships were loaded by securing to deep moorings and embarking their cargo via cantilever jetties. During south-westerly wind periods—which are common from November to March—the ships {{had to stop}} loading and sail away from the island until conditions improved. It was common for these ships {{to be allowed to}} drift to save fuel, and there were often several vessels lying off Nauru.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} French Revolutionary Wars (1793–1802), {{a string of}} {{victories}} at sea ensured that the Royal Navy was dominant. The French Navy in particular had suffered heavy losses, and in Northern European waters had been forced back into its own <b>harbours</b> by British blockade squadrons. Although large ports were watched by fleets of ships of the line, small ports had their own blockade squadrons too, including the shallow French ports on the English Channel. These <b>harbours</b> could not accommodate ships of the line but were well situated for frigates that attacked shipping in British waters whenever they could escape the blockade. One such port was Dunkirk in French Flanders, which contained a squadron of four French frigates: the 44-gun Poursuivante under Commodore Jean-Joseph Castagnier, the 40-gun Carmagnole and the 36-gun Désirée and Incorruptible. Dunkirk was well defended, with gun batteries and gunboats overlooking the harbour. In addition, the port was surrounded by complicated coastal shoals into which the frigates could retreat if attacked.|$|E
5|$|Leisure {{activities}} {{available in}} the county include beach activities, rambling, cycling, sea fishing, canoeing, sailing and horse riding.
