2500|$|Lexical {{measures}} use individual adjectives {{that reflect}} agreeableness or disagreeableness traits, such as sympathetic, cooperative, warm, considerate, harsh, unkind, rude. Words representing disagreeableness are reverse coded. Goldberg (1992) developed a 20-word measure {{as part of}} his 100-word Big Five markers, and Saucier (1994) developed a briefer 8-word measure {{as part of his}} 40-word mini-markers. Thompson (2008) systematically revised and improved these markers to develop a 40-word measure with better psychometric properties in both American and non-American populations, the International English Mini-Markers. This brief measure has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing agreeableness and other five factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. <b>Internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>reliability</b> of the Agreeableness measure for native English-speakers is reported as [...]86, that for non-native English-speakers is [...]80.|$|E
2500|$|Lexical {{measures}} use individual adjectives {{that reflect}} extravert and introvert traits, such as outgoing, talkative, reserved and quiet. Words representing introversion are reverse coded to create composite measures of extraversion/introversion {{running on a}} continuum. Goldberg (1992) developed a 20-word measure {{as part of his}} 100-word Big Five markers. Saucier (1994) developed a briefer 8-word measure as part of his 40-word mini-markers. However, the psychometric properties of Saucier's original mini-markers have been found suboptimal with samples outside of North America. As a result, a systematically revised measure was developed to have superior psychometric properties, the International English Mini-Markers. The International English Mini-Markers has good internal consistency reliabilities and other validity for assessing extraversion/introversion and other five factor personality dimensions, both within and, especially, without American populations. <b>Internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>reliability</b> of the Extraversion measure for native English-speakers is reported as [...]92, that for non-native English-speakers is [...]85.|$|E

5000|$|One {{issue with}} the GSS is <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>reliability,</b> {{specifically}} {{in regards to the}} Shift portion of the measure. Both Shift-positive and Shift-negative are associated with levels of <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>reliability</b> of x2 < [...]60. Internal Shift scores have been reported as x2 = [...]60, which is [...] "unacceptably low". These numbers serve as a possible explanation for why studies have not found [...] "theoretically meaningful correlations" [...] between the Shift sub-scale and other external criteria. Researchers argue against the use of a Total suggestibility composite due to evidence that Yield 1 and Shift scores do not significantly correlate with each other. This absence of a correlation is problematic because it [...] "suggests that yielding to a leading question and yielding to negative feedback from an interviewer operate under completely different processes". Other researchers have found that {{there are two types of}} suggestibility: direct and indirect. The failure to take these into account may have led to methodological problems with the GSS. Researchers suggest that until these issues have been addressed, the GSS should only be limited to the Yield sub-scale.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>reliability</b> checks {{how well}} the {{individual}} measures included in the research are converted into a composite measure. Internal consistency may be assessed by correlating performance on two halves of a test (split-half reliability). The value of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient is adjusted with the Spearman-Brown prediction formula to correspond to the correlation between two full-length tests. A commonly used measure is Cronbach's α, which {{is equivalent to the}} mean of all possible split-half coefficients. Reliability may be improved by increasing the sample size.|$|E
50|$|Scales {{should be}} tested for reliability, generalizability, and validity.

Reliability {{is the extent to which}} a scale will produce {{consistent}} results. Test-retest reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Alternative forms reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms of the scale. <b>Internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>reliability</b> checks how well the individual measures included in the scale are converted into a composite measure.|$|E
40|$|Hitherto, various {{critics have}} claimed that the most {{commonly}} used measure for daily hassles is confounded with psychological well-being in both content and format. In order to circumvent such contamination, the Survey of Recent Life Experiences (SRLE) was developed by Kohn and MacDonald (1992). In the present study, the SRLE was psychometrically evaluated within a general sample of the Dutch population. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that, {{with the exception of one}} item the original six-factor structure was strongly replicated. For five of six factors, <b>internal</b> <b>consistency</b> <b>reliabilities</b> proved satisfactory.
