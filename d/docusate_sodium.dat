40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{high-throughput}} screening (HTS) assays, {{the use of}} ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy (UA) is commonly limited to concentration and turbidity measure-ments. Our aim was to evaluate microplate-based UA and its second-derivative [(2 d) UA] for measuring the conforma-tional stability of two recombinant antigenic proteins {{in the presence of}} 44 excipients. Protein conformational stability was assessed by (2 d) UA upon titration with guanidine hydrochloride. (2 d) UA was compared with tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy (TF) and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), both commonly used techniques for measuring protein conformational stability. The HTS data were corrected for plate, row and column effects by applying a median polish procedure. Irrespective of the unfolding method applied, similar stabilizing excipients were identi-fied by all analytical methods for a given antigen. The native forms of both antigens were destabilized by arginine, hydro-xypropyl-b-cyclodextrin, and <b>sodium</b> <b>docusate,</b> and were protected by polyols. The median polish correction im-proved the quality of the prediction models and the screen-ing resolution. The higher sensitivities of TF and DSF compared with (2 d) UA allowed the identification of a larger number of stabilizing excipients. However, similar screening resolutions (z’-factor> 0. 8) were observed for 2 dUA, TF, and DSF in a HTS of excipients applied to one of the antigens. Therefore, (2 d) UA deserves more attention in HTS studies focused on protein conformational stability...|$|R

In studying the drug profiles of 52 elderly patients in a chronic care unit, we found that a large percentage were taking laxatives. We therefore wanted to compare {{the effect of a}} diet enriched with bran to the effect of an emollient laxative, <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium.</b> Patients were divided into two groups. For the first three weeks, one group received a diet with 15 g/day natural wheat bran added, plus a placebo, and the other received 200 mg/day <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium.</b> In the second three weeks, the groups were switched to the other treatment. After the 42 days of the study, the number of stools per day per patient did not differ significantly, whether they had been taking bran or laxatives. Otherwise, transit times revealed that those who had taken bran had a more rapid transit time than those who had taken laxatives.

Pure lipophilic excipients have two peaks in the DSC curve. The first one occurs at lower temperatures (27. 35 8 C for the suppocire AP and 34. 3 8 C for the witepsol H 19) and the second peak at higher temperatures (36. 27 and 35. 95 8 C for the suppocire AP and witepsol H 19, respectively). Polysorbate 80, <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium</b> and tetranyl AT- 1 /DP cause the first melting peak to disappear and the second peak to occur at a lower temperature. The thermograms of the formulas show two melting peaks and the endothermic peak does not appear due to the melting of ethosuximide (47. 8 8 C). We attribute this behavior to the solubility of the drug in the melted excipient, thus originating a decrease of the melting temperature of the second peak in the DSC scan. The excipients and formulations behave as Newtonian fluids and the influence of ethosuximide and adjuvants can be noted in an increase in the viscosity of the suppository mass...|$|E

40|$|About 10, 000 t of {{grinding}} scraps {{are produced}} {{in and around}} Turin each year. Grinding scraps result fromhigh speed tool cutting processes in the automobile and aerospace industries in which a fluid, called lubrorefrigerant oil, is used to cool the cutting tool. At present, grinding scraps are landfilled with an involved cost of 60 D /t, because the oil content (equal to 6. 40 % byweight, b. w.) does not permit recovery in secondary smelt furnaces. Secondary smelt foundries in fact only accept turnings, borings, scraps and oily machinery waste with an oil content no higher than 1 % b. w. The lubrorefrigerant fluid and heavy metal content of some grinding scrap samples have been determined. The characterized waste was then subjected to several laboratory tests in order to single out the most convenient operating conditions; these resulted to be: solid-liquid ratio 1 : 20 b. w., one washing phase, surfactant amount equal to 0. 15 % b. w. (of the washing water amount), solid-rinsing water ratio 1 : 20 b. w., employment of <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium</b> salt. The obtained results allowed a wet treatment to be arranged aimed at removing the cooling/cutting fluid from the waste and at a subsequent recovery or recycling the steel. The wet treatment involves a washing phase in a stirred reactor {{in the presence of}} <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium</b> salt, a filtration in a plate and frame filter for the solid separation and a final rinse in order to eliminate the residual surfactant amount. The treated material is finally pressed to minimize the residual moisture content. The oil is separated from the exhausted washing water using a cloth filter. The oily sludge is eventually landfilled. A cost analysis, carried out on the proposed reclamation plant, highlighted the economic advantage of the treatment (total annual plant operating costs are equal to about 40 D /t of treated grinding scrap) in comparison to the landfilling operation...|$|E

CBZ-hydrogenated castor oil (HCO) (Cutina (R) HR) wax microparticles were prepared without organic solvents as an alternative to polymeric microparticles. The process involved emulsification and solidification of CBZ-HCO melt at a significantly low temperature (5 degrees C). Five amphiphilic excipients (Pluronic F- 68 (PL), Labrasol (LB), Gelucire 44 / 14 (GL 44 / 14), D-alpha-tocopheryl PEG 1000 succinate (TPGS) and <b>Docusate</b> <b>sodium</b> (DOSS) were added with the wax melt. The microparticles were characterized with respect to their particle size distribution, drug loading, morphological character, drug-excipient interaction, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infra-red (FT-IR) and release properties. An average value for production yield was 83. 45 %. Evaluation of the release data indicates that the release mechanism from the prepared Cutina (R) HR microparticles follows both the Higuchi model of diffusion and anomalous release mechanism. Microparticles containing 5 % Labrasol, TPGS and GL 44 / 14 had the highest extent of dissolution. King Saud Universit...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{tweezers}} are {{a useful}} and fascinating {{tool for the}} manipulation {{of a range of}} microscopic particles. I describe the set up of optical trapping apparatus, and investigate the use of a spatial light modulator for the creation of arrays of optical traps. Optical deformation of microemulsion droplets has previously been demonstrated for systems with ultra-low interfacial tension. A disadvantage of the systems used was the strong temperature-dependence of the interfacial tension. I have explored options for creating temperature-insensitive microemulsions, and have shown that a mixed surfactant system containing <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium</b> salt (AOT) and pentaethylene monododecyl ether (C 12 E 5) is capable of stabilising a temperature-insensitive microemulsion with very low interfacial tension. With this system I was able to deform droplets across a wide temperature range using dual optical tweezers. I have investigated several methods of producing a monodisperse emulsion with droplet diameters in the region of 5 μm, including microfluidic technology and membrane emulsification. Although I was unable to produce a monodisperse emulsion within the scope of this project, the work has presented promising future opportunities. A design has been produced for a microfluidic device that will enable trapping and manipulation of emulsion droplets, and will facilitate changing the continuous phase composition. ...|$|E
40|$|Topical therapies for nail {{diseases}} {{are limited by}} keratinized cells in the human nail plate. An optimal permeation enhancer would not only improve drug delivery through the nail plate, but would also open new possibilities for treating neighboring target sites if systemic circulation is reached. The aim of the present work was to identify permeation enhancers and to improve the understanding of physicochemical parameters that influence drug permeation. Caffeine served as the model drug, and formulations were prepared in water and 20 % (v/v) ethanol/water solutions. Tested enhancers were urea, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), methanol, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium</b> salt (DSS), boric acid, and fungal proteins, such as hydrophobins. Permeability studies employed cadaver nails in modified Franz-type diffusion cells. The permeability coefficient of caffeine in ethanol/water {{was determined to be}} 1. 56 E- 08 cm/s and was improved to 2. 27 E- 08 cm/s by the addition of NAC. Formulations containing either methanol or DMSO showed the highest permeability coefficients in the range of 5 - 7. 5 E- 08 cm/s. Enhancers could be classified according to their permeation enhancement: methanol<class II hydrophobins<DMSO<followed by class I hydrophobins and urea.

Palpitations have been reported with duloxetine in 1 – 10 % of patients in clinical trials. 3 This case involves symp-tomatic tachycardia {{associated with the use}} of duloxetine that resolved following duloxetine discontinuation and returned with rechallenge. Case Report Duloxetine 20 mg daily was initiated for treatment of dysthymic disorder in a 26 -year-old man with moderate mental retardation. He resided in a long-term fa-cility for the intellectually disabled due to significant behavior issues including verbal and physical aggression toward others. Current medications included du-loxetine, extended-release divalproex, depo-testosterone, <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium,</b> nasal calcitonin, lactulose, levothyrox-ine, and lorazepam. Current diagnoses included moderate mental retardation (Intelligence Quotient 36), dysthymic disorder, dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism (treated), hypogo-nadism, history of seizures, and osteopenia. Approximate-ly 2 months after duloxetine initiation, episodes of fatigue and diaphoresis with chest pain were reported by staff working directly with the patient.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Problems {{attributed}} to the accumulation of wax (cerumen) {{are among the most}} common reasons for people to present to their general practitioners with ear trouble. Treatment for this condition often involves use of a wax softening agent (cerumenolytic) to disperse the cerumen, reduce the need for, or facilitate syringing, but there is no consensus on the effectiveness of the variety of cerumenolytics in use. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of ear drops (cerumenolytics) for the removal of symptomatic ear wax. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2008 issue 2); MEDLINE; EMBASE; CINAHL; ISI Proceedings; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was April 2008. SELECTION CRITERIA: We identified all randomised controlled trials in which a cerumenolytic was compared with no treatment, a placebo, or other cerumenolytics in participants with obstructing or impacted ear wax, and in which the proportion of participants with sufficient clearance of the external canal to make further mechanical clearance unnecessary (primary outcome measure) was stated or calculable. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The two authors reviewed all the retrieved trials and applied the inclusion criteria independently. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials satisfied the inclusion criteria. In all, 679 participants received one of 11 different cerumenolytics. One trial compared active treatments with no treatment, three compared active treatments with water or a saline 'placebo', and all nine trials compared two or more active treatments. Eight trials included syringing as a secondary intervention. Overall, results were inconclusive. The majority of comparisons showed no difference between treatments. Meta-analysis of two high quality trials produced a statistical difference in favour of triethanolamine polypeptide over saline in preventing the need for syringing, but no other significant differences between treatments. In three trials of high to moderate quality, no difference was found between the effectiveness of either sodium bicarbonate ear drops, chlorbutanol, triethanolamine polypeptide oleate condensate or <b>docusate</b> <b>sodium</b> liquid versus a sterile water or saline 'placebo'. One trial of moderate methodological quality found all three treatments - sodium bicarbonate ear drops, chlorbutanol and sterile water - to be significantly better than no treatment at preventing the need for syringing. None of the higher quality trials demonstrated superiority of one agent over another in direct comparisons. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Trials have been heterogeneous and generally of low or moderate quality, making it difficult to offer any definitive recommendations on the effectiveness of cerumenolytics for the removal of symptomatic ear wax. Using drops of any sort appears to be better than no treatment, but it is uncertain if one type of drop is any better than another. Future trials should be of high methodological quality, have large sample sizes, and compare both oil-based and water-based solvents with placebo, no treatment or both...|$|E
