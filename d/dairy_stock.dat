The {{establishment of the}} Brandon Training School in 1915 was a significant event, providing many employment opportunities for area residents. At its height, the Training School served over 600 Vermont residents. Changes in policy and social service practices led to closing the facility in November 1993.

[...] Fonterra claims to have a number of initiatives such as the Dairying and Clean Streams Accord, relating to environmental protection to achieve this policy. In December 2011, the Green Party questioned Fonterra's credibility and the effectiveness of the self-auditing approach given the wide discrepancy between Fonterra's claims and an independent audit of Dairying and Clean Streams Accord.|$|R

50|$|Like many European breeds, the Bleue du Nord {{derives from}} {{cross-breeding}} of local <b>dairy</b> <b>stock</b> with animals of the Durham breed - what {{would later be}} called the Shorthorn - imported from Britain. From about 1850, in the historic region of Hainaut {{on the border between}} France and Belgium, the Durham was crossed with dairy cattle of Dutch Friesian type with the aim of combining the growth rate of the former with the dairy qualities of the latter. Breeding was initially directed towards dairy use. Both the Bleue du Nord and the Belgian Blue descend from this stock.|$|E

On December 16, 1959, Ryazan obkom was able to announce that the region delivered 150,000 tons of meat to the state, which was three times the amount delivered the previous year.

5000|$|Currow (...) is a rural {{village in}} County Kerry in south west Ireland, located {{approximately}} 12 km from Killarney and 18 km from Tralee. Currow is {{situated on the}} Brown Flesk River, {{a tributary of the}} River Maine. Currow covers 3,376 Hectares, much of the land is arable, mainly used as pasture for <b>dairy</b> <b>stock.</b> However, there are areas of peat land, particularly to the south, where a blanket bog is located on the border with Kilcummin. There are many old, mature trees particularly on the floodplain of the river. Currow is mainly a residential area with close links to Castleisland. The main industry is agriculture. The original village grew up {{on both sides of the}} roadway to the north of Flesk Bridge, between two old estates, Dicksgrove and Parkmore, which have influenced the architectural character. The Meredith Family were the landlords of the area, residing in the old Parkmore estate. The first influence of the British came from the Herbert Family during the plantations. The village escaped much of the major development experienced by many nearby villages and towns during the Celtic Tiger. Any development is mainly one-off housing. Currow is bordered to the west by Farranfore, to the south by Kilcummin, to the east by Scartaglin and to the north by Castleisland. Currans lies north west of Currow, which forms the Killeentierna Parish. Con Houlihan, a columnist with the Sunday World, once wrote how he considered Currow as his 'own favourite' village in Ireland. Although he is undecided whether Currow is a village or a hamlet. He also declared he would someday 'apply to be made a Freeman of Currow'. Currow takes pride in its sporting heritage, producing several international rugby players. The popularity of the GAA is unrivaled in the community but basketball has thrived in recent decades, particularly with juveniles, with much success at county, provincial and national level.|$|E

40|$|The {{husbandry}} {{of domestic}} dairy cattle {{as one of}} the components of livestock sub-sector development is hopefully to increase numerously the capacity and the quality on its milk production, to gradually meet national milk demand and face the competitiveness at the global. The achievement of this purpose should be supported by the production of <b>dairy</b> breeding <b>stock</b> in good quality and sufficient number to increase efficiency of both quantity and quality of domestic milk production. One of important aspect that should be prepared is in determining national breeding system of dairy cattle that can function effectively as guidance and regulation for producing, distributing, and using dairy cattle as “domestic breeding stock”.

40|$|Agriculture {{remains a}} major {{sector of the}} New Zealand economy, with the vast {{majority}} of farm and food production exported. The accelerating intensification of farming in New Zealand over recent decades raises concern over the current sustainability of New Zealand farming, and whether it can remain so in the future. In this study, we focus on the impacts of policies to reduce environmental impacts of dairy farming, with a particular focus on nitrogen pollution and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. We use {{a modified version of the}} Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model and database, with improved specification of the agricultural sector and land-use. We augment the model with environmental indicators for New Zealand, including nitrogen balances and GHG emissions. We simulate a range of scenarios involving reductions in fertiliser use and <b>stocking</b> rates on <b>dairy</b> farms, from an updated 2010 database. In particular, we consider seven scenarios, with the objective of exploring reductions in the <b>dairy</b> <b>stocking</b> rate and the application of nitrogenous fertiliser to dairy farms to target reductions in the dairy sector’s nitrogen balance of 10 %, 20 % and 30 %. Reducing fertiliser use and stocking rates are two of the approaches that dairy farmers can take in order to reduce their emissions of nitrogen and GHGs.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} an AI heifer calf rearing scheme on <b>dairy</b> <b>stock</b> development, in a coconut grazing and a peri-urban smallholder dairy production system in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. The heifer rearing scheme included free advice on calf rearing, drugs, acaricides, minerals and subsidised concentrates for 30 months. The farmers in the coconut growing area integrate dairying with their plantation, they sell their milk to the main processors. The peri-urban farmers are intensive milk producers, who sell their milk at informal markets. To estimate {{the effect of the}} heifer rearing scheme on dairy replacement stock development, scheme farmers were compared with farmers who did not participate in the scheme. Calf mortality was twice as high in non-scheme farms (23 - 28 %) as in scheme farms (12 - 14 %). The scheme had a positive effect on weight development and scheme heifers calved 4. 5 months earlier than non-scheme heifers. The calf rearing package is cost effective in both farming systems, however, the required cash inputs are a major constraint. The costs per in-calf heifer under the scheme are much lower than the production of such animals by either multiplication in state farms or importing them.
