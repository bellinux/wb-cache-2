5|$|Hu Die {{retired in}} 1966, after a career {{spanning}} {{more than four}} decades. It was said that in 1967 she married an admirer named Zhu Fangkun (or Song Kunfang), who had given her financial support in the <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> following Pan Yousheng's death. She emigrated to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada in 1975 to join her son. She lived a low-key life and avoided attention by using the name Pan Baojuan. She dictated her memoir in 1986, which first appeared in Taiwan's United Daily News in serials, and was published in mainland China in 1987. She died on 23 April 1989, after suffering a stroke.|$|E
5|$|Austria {{is closely}} linked to the fate of {{prominent}} Russian diplomat and statesman Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov. He arrived in Vienna in 1833 as an adviser to the embassy, and, from 1854 to 1856, he led the Russian diplomatic mission. Gorchakov became Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Austrian court at the most <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> for Russia during the Crimean War, during which time he was able to preserve diplomatic relations with Austria and helped to overcome the international isolation of the Russian Empire and reinforced Russia's status as a great power. The Vienna Conference in 1855 was the first presence of Gorchakov in an international forum, and his performance in representing Russia at the Paris Conference of 1856 saw Alexander II appoint him as Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|Hartebeest are {{primarily}} grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A {{study in the}} Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than {{the other members of}} Alcelaphini. The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the roan antelope, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.|$|E

5|$|In 1930, Hart {{applied for}} and was {{appointed}} to the position of Administrator of Western Samoa, which was controlled by New Zealand under a mandate from the League of Nations. This was a <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> for the colony as many of its citizens wanted independence. The Mau movement in particular was agitating for self-determination and employed tactics of civil disobedience as a means of opposing the New Zealand administration. After some heavy-handed management of protestors by his predecessor had resulted in several deaths amongst the movement, Hart made progress in improving relationships with the Mau when he took up his position in 1931. He also returned some financial stability to the colony which had struggled during the Great Depression. Hart was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services in Samoa shortly before completing his term as administrator and returning to New Zealand in July 1935.|$|E
5|$|Joachim III's tenure {{coincided with}} a very <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> for the Bulgarian state when the Mongol menace was omnipresent in all levels of Bulgarian society. Although George Terter I had to become a vassal to the Mongol Golden Horde and sent to Theodore Svetoslav as a hostage in 1285, the devastating Mongol raids persisted. Unable to confront the Mongols and their leader Nogai Khan, in 1292 he {{abandoned}} the throne and fled to the Byzantine Empire. In 1292 Joachim III crowned as Emperor the influential magnate Smilets (r. 1292–1298), whose family held extensive lands between the Balkan Mountains and Sredna Gora. In 1299 he crowned the Mongol Chaka, son of Nogai Khan, who fled to Tarnovo {{in the company of}} Theodore Svetoslav {{as a result of a}} civil war in the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|The new Ibrox had a {{capacity}} of 44,000 and was opened with an Old Firm game played on 19 September 1981. By this time, however, the development cost had risen to £10 million, which depleted the club financially. This resulted in a <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> {{in the history of}} Rangers, as the average attendance fell to 17,500 in the 1981–82 season, including a crowd of only 4,500 for a game against St Mirren. The redeveloped stadium was partly blamed for this, as some fans felt that the new ground lacked atmosphere due to the spaces between the stands. This was during a period of low attendances in Scottish football in general. Despite the relatively low attendance at Ibrox, Rangers had the highest average home attendances in the Premier Division in both 1983–84 and 1984–85.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of plagues of the Black Death, many Cretans {{migrated}} overseas during <b>difficult</b> <b>periods</b> on the island, some acquiring great fortune abroad, such as Constantine Corniaktos (c. 1517-1603) who {{became one of the}} richest people in Eastern Europe.|$|R

5|$|According to Julien Merceron, the Worldwide Technology Director for Square Enix in {{the early}} 2010s, the concept for the new engine was born in 2011 {{while he was in}} the final stages of working on Final Fantasy XIII-2. This was a <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> for Square Enix: the project then known as Final Fantasy Versus XIII was hitting {{technical}} barriers as it transitioned to open world environments its original Crystal Tools engine could not handle, and Final Fantasy XIV had met with a disastrous launch due to development and technical problems. Faced with these issues, Square Enix decided to bring in former developers from Sega to create new engines for their products, including Luminous Studio. Talking about sharing the engine, Merceron said that he advised the company to avoid sharing between companies or internally between games until the engine had been finalized with the released game: this resulted in Luminous Studio being restricted to what would become Final Fantasy XV during development, while other major next-generation titles would use other outsourced engines.|$|E
5|$|Although Buenos Aires had {{suffered}} a <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> in its war for independence, its prospects were improving by 1812. Even though the defeats of Manuel Belgrano during the Paraguay campaign and Juan José Castelli in the first Upper Peru campaign had generated a political crisis, Belgrano's victory at Tucuman had given new fresh hope to the revolution, which would be strengthened shortly afterwards with the victory at the Battle of Salta. Montevideo, capital of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata since the May Revolution, was under siege by both an army from Buenos Aires led by José Rondeau and an Uruguayan one led by José Gervasio Artigas. The city, however, maintained its naval supremacy over Buenos Aires and their ships raided the coasts of the Paraná and Uruguay rivers to gather supplies, despite the siege. Montevideo organized a navy to destroy the gun batteries at Rosario and Diamante, two population centers along the Parana, but were prevented from doing so as Buenos Aires dismantled them knowing {{that they could not}} defend them.|$|E

5000|$|The Parlement de Paris {{was created}} in 1250.

25|$|Patricia (Pat) Wocknitz {{was elected}} {{president}} {{at the beginning of}} this <b>difficult</b> <b>period.</b> One of her first acts was to call a special constitutional convention in 1985 to reduce the Provincial Executive to 28 members.

25|$|The early 1980s saw {{the country}} facing a <b>difficult</b> <b>period</b> of {{structural}} adjustment caused by declining demand for its traditional products, deteriorating economic performance, and neglected structural reform.
