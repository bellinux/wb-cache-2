5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, {{the result is an}} acidic salt. If it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{radio waves}} are emitted {{directly}} by astronomical objects, {{a product of}} thermal emission, most of the radio emission that is observed <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of synchrotron radiation, which is produced when electrons orbit magnetic fields. Additionally, a number of spectral lines produced by interstellar gas, notably the hydrogen spectral line at 21cm, are observable at radio wavelengths.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{macroeconomic}} {{models that}} assume an exogenous stochastic process for multifactor productivity offer the interpretation that recessions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of ”bad news ” (technological regress) and expansions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of ”good news” (technological advancement). The view taken {{here is that}} both expansions and recessions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of ”good news ” {{in the sense that}} in both cases, aggregate production possibilities have increased. Recessions {{can be thought of as}} the Standard neoclassical models of economic fluctuations often rely on an exogenous autoregressive process for multifactor productivity. <b>The</b> interpretation <b>is</b> that recessoins <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a temporary decline in productivity while expansions <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a temporary increas...|$|R
40|$|Critically reading {{therapeutic}} trials {{consists in}} determining whether the treatment studied offers a sufficient and relevant benefit to patients in daily medical practice. Thus, critical reading implies that we answer the following questions : <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> reliable? <b>is</b> <b>the</b> trial’s methodology dependable? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> statistical <b>results</b> reliable? what is its epistemological value? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> reproducible? have they been confirmed by other trials and are they consistent with our basic knowledge on <b>the</b> subject? <b>is</b> <b>the</b> effect size large enough and how precise is its estimation? what <b>is</b> <b>the</b> risk-benefit ratio? <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> relevant to daily clinical practice, and how representative <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> and can they be extrapolated...|$|R
30|$|Tobacco kills around 6 {{million people}} each year. More than 5 million of those deaths <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of direct tobacco use while more than 600, 000 <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of non-smokers {{being exposed to}} {{second-hand}} smoke.|$|R
5|$|Aphasia <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> {{of damage}} to the brain's {{language}} centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, and can cause severe, chronic language impairment. Individuals with aphasia often communicate {{using a combination of}} speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.|$|E
5|$|Brane {{cosmology}} models, {{in which}} inflation {{is due to}} the movement of branes in string theory; the pre-Big Bang model; the ekpyrotic model, in which the Big Bang <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a collision between branes; and the cyclic model, a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> phobia could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a {{negative}} experience in a person’s life that was associated with knees. The discomfort {{at the sight of}} one's knees could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of <b>the</b> person’s parents or themselves wearing exclusively clothing that covered the knees growing up, therefore making the person unfamiliar with the sight of them. It could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of a traumatic injury that left a scar on the individual’s knee or on someone that they know.|$|R
5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|Endometrial {{cancer is}} a cancer that arises from the {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the abnormal growth of cells that {{have the ability to}} invade or spread {{to other parts of the}} body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
5|$|Extinction <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of the {{elimination}} of the geographic range of a species with a reduction of its population size down to zero. The factors that affect biogeographic range and population size include competition, predator-prey interactions, variables of the physical environment, and chance events.|$|E

Such polarization <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of solar radiation getting scattered by the dust {{particles in the}} coma of the comet and depends {{on the nature of}} the grains. It further confirms that the dust grains in the coma of comet Hale–Bopp were smaller than inferred in any other comet.|$|E

5|$|He {{showed that}} {{coloured}} light {{does not change}} its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.|$|E

5|$|Osteitis fibrosa cystica <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> of {{unchecked}} hyperparathyroidism, or the overactivity of the parathyroid glands, {{which results}} in an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH causes the release of calcium from the bones into the blood, and the reabsorption of calcium in the kidney. Thus, excess PTH in hyperparathyroidism causes elevated blood calcium levels, or hypercalcemia.|$|E
