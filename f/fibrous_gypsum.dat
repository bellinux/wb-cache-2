40|$|This article {{presents}} chronological investigations on interfault <b>fibrous</b> <b>gypsum</b> using {{the technique of}} Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) dating, essentially to demonstrate the robustness of the technique as a dating tool on <b>fibrous</b> <b>gypsum</b> precipitates in a semi-arid region. Samples of <b>fibrous</b> <b>gypsum</b> collected from Katrol hill range, Kachchh consist of those from fractures and bedding planes, and those along the inferred fault plane. The slow progressive uplift along the region resulted in erosion, unloading and dissolution of near-surface evaporite deposits and formation of extensional joints parallel to bedding and across. These openings became favourable sites for the <b>fibrous</b> <b>gypsum</b> to develop perpendicular {{to the wall of}} factures as well as fault plane. ESR chronometry. studies deduce that gypsum growth along the bedding plane and fractures took place around 300 ka, while ESR dating studies on fault plane gypsum indicate an age around 70 ka. The young age of the normal fault plane indicates that it developed on account of the ongoing compressive stresses which resulted in normal faults perpendicular to the principal stress and later got immediately filled by sulphate-rich solutions. The ongoing compressive stresses active on the region have finally resulted in further uplift of the footwall back limb to its present topography...|$|E
40|$|New {{knowledge}} on patterns of <b>fibrous</b> <b>gypsum</b> veins, their genetic mechanisms, deformation style and weathering {{is provided by}} a field- and laboratory-based {{study carried out on}} the Neogene to Quaternary Pisco Basin sedimentary strata exposed in the Ica desert, southern Peru. Gypsum veins vary considerably in dimensions, attitudes and timing, and can develop in layered and moderately fractured rocks also in the absence of evaporitic layers. Veins occur both as diffuse features, confined to certain stratigraphic levels, and localized within fault zones. Arrays formed by layer-bounded, mutually orthogonal sets of steeply dipping gypsum veins are reported for the first time. Vein length, height and spacing depend on the thickness of the bed packages in which they are confined. Within fault zones, veins are partly a product of faulting but are also inherited layerbounded features along which faults are superimposed. Owing to the different petrophysical properties with respect to the parent rocks and their susceptibility to textural and mineralogical modifications, water dissolution and rupture, gypsum veins may have a significant role in geofluid management. Depending on their patterns and grade of physical and chemical alteration, veins may influence geofluid circulation and storage, acting as barriers to flow and possibly also as conduits...|$|E
40|$|Fibrous mineral veins are {{extremely}} important structures in mudrocks because they represent phases of geological activity that occurred after the deposition {{of the host}} rocks. They are, therefore, crucial for unravelling the geological history, especially for analyzing postdepositional tectonism, diagenesis, and associated physical and chemical conditions. This research focuses on the investigation of <b>fibrous</b> mineral (<b>gypsum</b> and calcite) veins in mudrocks, using integrated field, petrographic, and geochemical methods. The aim is to obtain {{a better understanding of}} mineral vein systems in fine-grained rocks over spatial scales ranging from reservoir to microns, regarding the timing, formation mechanism, vein growth, fluid and stress conditions, fluid-rock interaction, and their expressions in vein texture. The results reveal that fibrous mineral veins are produced during different stages of basin evolution. Fibrous calcite veins in Lower Jurassic shales in the Wessex Basin have a diagenetic growth history during early burial of the sediments. In contrast, the formation of satin spar veins in the Triassic marls of the Bristol Channel Basin is closely associated with tectonic compression during basin uplift. However, both the gypsum veins and calcite veins owe their origin to overpressure and incremental fibre growth in closed systems, with their textures exhibiting similar antitaxial characteristics. Host rock lithology, defined by mineral components, fabrics and mechanical properties, mainly controls the development of the veins. The research highlights the kinematic implications of fibre orientations for host rock deformation and the EBSD measurement of crystallographic orientations of fibres for the analysis of paleo-stress state during fibre growth. Evidence for the force of crystallization exerted by mineral fibres, which has largely been ignored in previous studies, are revealed based on field and petrographic observations. The vein systems presented in this research provide an analogue for future studies on sub-seismic scale fracture/vein characterization and prediction in mudrocks either as caprock or source rocks for hydrocarbons. </p...|$|R

Those hot springs include Burlyashii, Oil pool, Zavarzin, Thermophile and Jen’s vents, which were previously reported for microbial ecology and mineralogy. Opal A spheroids are common in all hot spring sediments with particle size from 1 μm have cubic structure. The small pyrite crystals are also observed assembled to bigger cubic shapes, showing an ostwald ripening process. There are also spheroid shaped, 1 μm size pyritic aggregates with rough surface which showed a sulfate-reducing bacteria mediated formation of iron-sulfides. <b>Fibrous</b> and tabular <b>gypsum</b> crystals can be observed coexisting with sulfides, indicating local oxidation condition. Euhedral crystals of element sulfur of 30 μm can also be observed. Magnetic minerals are abundant in Jen’s vents, however, no magnetite can be detected, implying the existence of magnetic iron sulfides though thermophilic iron-reducing bacteria were isolated from some springs. Detrital quartz and silicates of larger sizes {{can be observed in}} some hot spring, showing water-rock interaction induced corrosion structures. The high abundance of iron sulfide minerals and the high percentage of menaquinones in sinter deposits indicated highly reduced conditions. The common existences of submicro- to nano-meter authigenic minerals, the abundant bacteria filaments, biofilms and diatoms indicate microbial mediation is a significant factor in the mineralization of those minerals in the hot springs. link_to_OA_fulltextGoldschmidt 2010 : Earth, Energy, and the Environment, Knoxville, TN., 13 – 18 June 2010.

40|$|The thesis investigates {{fracture}} sealing processes from micro- to basin scale. Chapter 2 {{describes the}} microstructural evolution of fracture sealing using a self-designed see-through apparatus. Analogue material {{is used to}} visualize and model sealing processes on a microscale, which is quantified with a numerical model and extended to fracture sealing of quartz. Chapter 3 describes hydrothermal fracture sealing experiments at hydrothermal conditions carried out in a Paterson rig. A temperature gradient induces a concentration gradient and precipitation in a pre-split quartzite samples, {{which can be used}} to qualitatively prediction the sealing potential of natural systems. Chapter 4 describes antitaxial <b>fibrous</b> veins (calcite, <b>gypsum,</b> quartz / Tiger's eye) in different sedimentary environments. A new type of sinusoidal solid host rock inclusion is described, and conclusions are drawn on the vein opening mechanism. The arrangement of solid host rock inclusions do not favour the crack-seal mechanism, but more likely suggest a continuous growth process. The force of crystallisation may have contributed to vein formation. Chapter 5 presents microstructural, stable (d 13 C, d 18 O) and radiogenic (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) isotope of antitaxial fibrous calcite veins from the Swiss Alps and New York State, USA. At least some veins are isolated in three dimensions, vein formation is initated by transgranular fracturing. Isotope data indicate that the fluid precipitatinig the vein was derived from an external source. Chapter 6 describes fracture sealing processes in Mesozoic limestonee, Jabal Akdhar anticline, Oman mountains. Seven different vein generations were distinguished and correlated with tectonic deformation phases of the Oman mountains. Stable isotope analysis (d 13 C, d 18 O) shows a early rock-buffered fluid system, and the influx of exotic waters with the onset of large normal faulting. The veins are correlated with the geomechanical evolution during the different fracture sealing phases, and fluid overpressure compartment is proposed forming the early veins...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Extreme {{swelling}} pressures (in {{excess of}} 5 MPa) were measured against the invert of a tunnel excavated by drill and blast method {{in a hard}} claystone containing variable proportions of anhydrite and gypsum dispersed in the clay matrix. When the invert was not present, floor heave reached displacements in excess of 60 cm in some cross sections. Displacements and pressures developed at a high rate (the maximum values mentioned were reached in a few months). Swelling was induced by gypsum crystallization in fissures and cracks. A crystallization model was included within the general purpose THM program CODE_BRIGHT. Discontinuities were simulated {{by means of an}} embedded discontinuity approach. Hydraulic characteristics of discontinuities change as their opening is modified, as a result of crystal growth induced strains. An evaporation front travels downwards and creates conditions for precipitation at increasing depths.). Calculated vertical swelling follows the patterns observed in the field by means of high precision extensometers. 1 The field problem The Lilla tunnel crosses a relief composed by hills and valleys on the left bank of the Francolí river-near Montblanc (Tarragona, Spain) -, following a N-S route with a maximum gradient of 2. 5 %. The tunnel runs mainly through Early Eocenic argillaceous rocks containing anhydrite and a complex system of cross-shaped moderately dipping <b>fibrous</b> <b>gypsum</b> veins. The excavated material consists basically of a horizontally-oriented monotonic series of gypsum-bearing brown argillaceous rocks (see Figure 1). m a. s. l...|$|E
40|$|Satin spar (<b>fibrous</b> <b>gypsum)</b> veins, which {{occur in}} {{evaporite}} basins worldwide, provide significant insights into host rock deformation and fluid flow, although the genetic mechanism remains obscure. Satin spar veins {{in the red}} marls of the Triassic Mercia Mudstone of the Bristol Channel Basin were characterized {{in the context of}} regional and local setting. The vein network in the Keuper Marl (lower Mercia) exhibits a lack of systematic cross-cutting between three distinct vein sets. Two sets of veins are observed in the overlying Tea Green Marl, with one set clearly crossing the other. The gypsum veins commonly contain a blocky median zone of multiple thin bands of host-rock inclusions and alabastrine gypsum crystals, exhibiting crack-seal patterns. Fibrous zones {{on either side of the}} median zone consist of pure parallel-aligned gypsum fibres that are oblique to vein walls, indicating a hybrid shear-extensional mode of vein widening. Veins developed within reverse-reactivated faults contain fibre lineations in the median zones and also on vein surfaces, suggesting a minimum of two phases of fault slip. The veins are interpreted to have formed as a result of overpressure in the low-permeability mudstones by tectonic compression during basin inversion, giving rise to the median zone. Growth of gypsum fibres commenced when the initial fractures were completely sealed. The timing of vein formation is suggested to be Miocene, based on cross-cutting relationships with folds formed during the latest phase of basin inversion. Because the fractures initiated in response to fluid overpressures, they provide a useful analog to subsurface hydraulic fracture systems in low-permeability rocks subjected to tectonic compression. The fibrous widening of the veins post-dates their initiation and led to continued propagation and increased connectivity...|$|E
