Libel action was brought by Jefferies against eight publications over their coverage of his arrest, resulting in the payment to him of substantial damages.

5|$|Electronic Logging Devices can {{be thought}} of as an {{automated}} electronic log book. An ELD records the same information as a manual paper log book, and requires less input from the driver. The ELD automatically records driving time and location, leaving the driver responsible only <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> on-duty and off-duty time. In these respects, the ELD is less susceptible to forgery than a paper log book.|$|E

5|$|On November 29 a {{disturbance}} in the ITCZ began gaining organization near Palmyra Island, which the ITCZ had been near {{for a week}} prior. The weather station on the island reported southwestern surface winds of 50mph and a pressure of 1002.7mbar and that during the night, the wind velocity peaked at 70mph. Because of an irregular schedule <b>for</b> <b>reporting,</b> the last report received from the weather station, obtained eighteen hours earlier, had reported only small winds and 1004.7mb pressure. Most noteworthy about this report was the 3-hour pressure tendency, which reported -3.2mbar. Post-analysis revealed that this tendency was an indication of tropical cyclone development.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was first identified as a tropical storm several hundred miles southeast of Hawaii on September9.

Later that day, the system entered an area with no ships available <b>for</b> <b>reporting.</b> However, no ships reported a storm in the region for several days, signifying the depression's dissipation.|$|E

5|$|In late May 1938, Chandler's {{campaign}} manager publicly claimed that federal relief agencies—especially the Works Progress Administration—were openly working for Barkley's re-election. Although the WPA administrator in Kentucky denied the charges, veteran reporter Thomas Lunsford Stokes launched {{an investigation of}} the agency's activities in the state and eventually raised twenty-two charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles covering the Barkley-Chandler campaign. Federal WPA administrator Harry Hopkins claimed an internal investigation of the agency refuted all but two of Stokes' charges, but Stokes was awarded the Pulitzer Prize <b>for</b> <b>Reporting</b> in 1939 for his investigation. In the wake of the investigation Congress passed the Hatch Act of 1939 to limit the WPA's involvement in future elections.|$|E

5|$|Team member Lucas Davis {{compiled}} {{the development}} tools and documentation for Anachronox and released them in August 2001. Four bug-fixing patches exist for Anachronox. Ion Storm {{created the first}} (1.01), which fixed the Windows 2000 buffer overrun crash and implemented other improvements such as taxi-cabs between distant points and enhanced save game functionality. Ion Storm released the first patch (1.01) on July 2, 2001. Joey Liaw set up a GeoCities website <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> bugs and technical information after the game's release, and worked on a new patch in his spare time. The second patch (1.02, or build 44) was released in May 2003 and overhauls the save-game system and provides other important stability fixes. The third and fourth patches—1.02 (build 45), released September 2003, and 1.02 (build 46), released April 2004—are fan-made unofficial patches and fix {{most of the remaining}} bugs. Fans have translated the game into German and released a conversion patch. Level designer Rich Carlson released a scrapped secret level for Anachronox in February 2004 after finding it on an old floppy disk.|$|E
5|$|Veracruz is {{the most}} {{dangerous}} place in Mexico for journalists; at least nine journalists have been killed since Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa took office in 2010, many of them by the Los Zetas drug cartel. Most of these reporters were killed under unclear circumstances, and few arrests have been made in their respective investigations. Given the high levels of corruption, criminal impunity, and drug-related attacks against the press all across Veracruz, many local journalists have decided to leave the state and relocate in other parts of Mexico. The atmosphere in Veracruz has also forced many media outlets to self-censor and stop reporting on the drug violence. With traditional reporting being too dangerous and intimidating, social media and blogs are often the only outlets <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> serious crimes.|$|E

5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> tax cheats).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit <b>for</b> <b>reporting</b> effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E
