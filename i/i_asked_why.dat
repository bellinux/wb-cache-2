500|$|Nino, a key villain, {{is portrayed}} by Ron Perlman, {{one of the}} last actors to join the cast. Regarding the casting of Perlman, Refn said, [...] "The {{character}} of Nino was originally not particularly interesting, so I asked Ron why he wanted to be in my movie when he's done so many great films. When Perlman said, 'I always wanted to play a Jewish man who wants to be an Italian gangster', and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> and he said, 'because that's what I am – a Jewish boy from New York', well, that automatically cemented it for me." [...] Oscar Isaac portrays a Latino convict named Standard, who is married to Irene and is just released from prison a week after Irene meets The Driver. He found the role to be a bit unappealing and chose to turn the archetypal character into something more. He said of the role: As soon as I sat down with Nicolas, he explained this universe and world of the story, so we made the character into someone interested in owning a restaurant, someone who made some wrong decisions in his life, ending up in a bad place. By making 'Standard' more specific and more interesting, we found that it made the story that more compelling.|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Alcala {{convinced}} {{hundreds of}} young men and women that he was a professional fashion photographer, and photographed them for his [...] "portfolio." [...] A Times co-worker later recalled that Alcala shared his photos with workmates. [...] "I thought it was weird, but I was young, I didn't know anything," [...] she said. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> he took the photos, he said their moms asked him to. I remember the girls were naked." [...] "He said he was a professional, so in my mind I was being a model for him," [...] said a woman who allowed Alcala to photograph her in 1979. The portfolio also included [...] "... spread after spread of [...] teenage boys," [...] she said. Most of the photos are sexually explicit, and most remain unidentified. Police fear that some of the subjects may be additional cold-case victims. [...] In 1979, according to later trial testimony, Alcala knocked unconscious and raped 15-year-old Monique Hoyt while she was posing for photographs.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was curious}} why a {{high-ranking}} official in President Bill Clinton's National Security Council (NSC) was given this assignment. Wilson {{had become a}} vocal opponent of President Bush's policies in Iraq after contributing to Al Gore {{in the last election}} cycle and John Kerry in this one. During a long conversation with a senior administration official, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> Wilson was assigned the mission to Niger. He said Wilson had been sent by the CIA's counter-proliferation section at the suggestion of one of its employees, his wife. It was an offhand revelation from this official, who is no partisan gunslinger. When I called another official for confirmation, he said: [...] "Oh, you know about it." [...] The published report that somebody in the White House failed to plant this story with six reporters and finally found me as a willing pawn is simply untrue. At the CIA, the official designated to talk to me denied that Wilson's wife had inspired his selection but said she was delegated to request his help. He asked me not to use her name, saying she probably never again will be given a foreign assignment but that exposure of her name might cause [...] "difficulties" [...] if she travels abroad. He never suggested to me that Wilson's wife or anybody else would be endangered. If he had, I would not have used her name. I used it in the sixth paragraph of my column because it looked like the missing explanation of an otherwise incredible choice by the CIA for its mission.|$|E

6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>WHY</b> {{you did it}} then?" [...] said Miss Trotter, with an acerbity {{which she}} put on to hide a vague, tantalizing consciousness.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Mellaire vindicated my {{judgment}} by {{telling me the}} man was the best sailor in his watch, a proper seaman. When {{he referred to the}} man as the Maltese Cockney, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> he replied: ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Staveley {{declined}} {{to tell me}} whether she had offered a bright example of gratitude {{to the rest of}} the sex. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> she declared that it was my turn now to tell her what I had been doing.|$|E
60|$|Our {{destination}} was the farther {{side of the}} plantation, where the ground, cleared in part, {{had not yet been}} broken up; but they were now setting about it. Upon halting, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> a plough was not used; some of the young wild steers might be caught and trained for draught.|$|E
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> Lucy Hardinge {{has come}} to so {{singular}} and violent an opinion, as connected with her bosom friend, and almost sister, Grace Wallingford?" ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{received}} the doctor to-day in the drawing-room. To my amazement, he begged leave {{to speak with}} me in the garden. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> he answered: [...] "I don't want to have a listener at the door. Come out on the lawn, where we can be sure that we are alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|And when I broke {{forth in}} indignation, Eustace lowered his voice, and said sadly that the King was changed in many points from the Prince of Wales, and that {{listening}} to policy {{was not good}} for him. Then <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> if the King hounded, as he called it, the Marquis, on this unhappy expedition, should Eustace have share in it? ...|$|E
60|$|The villagers told me {{that the}} patch of grass was full of devils and ghosts, all {{in the service of the}} priest, and that men and women and {{children}} had entered it and had never returned. They said the priest used their livers for purposes of witchcraft. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> they had not told me of this at the outset, they said that they were afraid they would lose their reward for bringing news of the pig.|$|E

6000|$|Left by themselves, the {{visitors}} {{began to speak}} jestingly of the strange situation {{in which they were}} placed. The original holder of Number Fourteen described his experience of the Doctor in his own pithy way. [...] "I applied to the fellow to tell my fortune. He first went to sleep over it, and then he said he could tell me nothing. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why.</b> 'I don't know,' says he. ' I do,' says I--'humbug!' I'll bet you the long odds, gentlemen, that you find it humbug, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't {{the least}} {{little bit of}} danger in running over there, {{especially}} if he has gone out with Towser, as she said, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> it was that a big fellow like Sonny Bunny couldn't go after a few carrots when his father had other business on hand. Then, if you'll believe it, she almost the same as accused me of being willing to send Sonny into danger because I was afraid to go myself, and I the very rabbit who killed Grandfather Fox! ...|$|E
60|$|When she chose, {{she knew}} all things, except the distant future. Thus {{she knew that}} we were coming, also the details of our march and that we should be {{attacked}} by the Rezuites who were going out to meet their returning company that had been sent afar to find a white queen. Therefore she had ordered him to go with soldiers to our assistance. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> she went veiled, and he replied, because of her beauty which drove even savage men mad, so that in old days she had been obliged to kill a number of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> {{the other}} {{matters of the}} Will are not shown to us?" [...] The {{attorney}} wiped his spectacles carefully with a big silk bandanna handkerchief before he answered: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that would exceed my power, the {{disappointment}} would be so strong. May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> you show so much interest in my keeping so cruel a mortification to myself?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN [nerved by indignation] May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why?</b> <b>I</b> am a Vice-President of the Travellers' Club. I {{have been}} everywhere: I hold {{the record in}} the Club for civilized countries.|$|R
6000|$|The visit {{seemed to}} have been gratifying. Mrs. Fordyce was {{declared}} to be of higher stamp than most of the neighbouring ladies; and my father was much pleased with the two clergymen, while as we drove along he kept on admiring the well-ordered fields and fences, and contrasting the pretty cottages and trim gardens with the dreary appearance of our own village. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> Amos Bell's home had been neglected, and was answered with some annoyance, as I pointed down the lane, that it was on our land, though in Hillside parish. [...] 'I am glad to have such neighbours!' observed my mother, and I kept to myself the remarks I had heard, though I was still tingling with the sting of them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I only {{sat there}} because I hoped to help you,' he said; {{and then he}} bade me {{remember}} that they had disclosed nothing of these intentions of theirs in the letters which spoke of an accommodation. If they had done so, he might have left me in Holland {{with some of the}} English ladies so as to be out of reach; but the scheme had only been propounded to him on the previous morning. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> he had not refused it at once, and he pointed out that it was not for him to disclose my secret attachment, even had it been expedient so to do. All that {{he had been able to}} do was to declare that the whole must depend on my free consent. 'And,' he said, with a smile, 'methought thereby I had done enough for our Nan, who has no weak will unless by violence she over-strain it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Things are sadly {{changed for}} the worse" [...] (Selina writes); [...] "but I don't forget that Philip was once engaged to Euneece, and that Mr. Gracedieu's {{extraordinary}} conduct toward him puzzled us all. The mode of discovery which dear Elizabeth suggested by letter, at that time, {{appears to be the}} mode which she is following now. When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why,</b> she said: 'Philip may return to Euneece; the Minister may recover--and will be all the more likely to do so if he tries Massage. In that case, he will probably repeat the conduct which surprised you; and your natural curiosity will ask me again {{to find out what it}} means. Am I your friend, Selina, or am I not?' This was so delightfully kind, and so irresistibly conclusive, that I kissed her in a transport of gratitude. With what breathless interest I have watched her progress toward penetrating the mystery of the girls' ages, it is quite needless to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{trust to}} see your lordship quoit them all down stairs," [...] {{answered}} Pearson. [...] "But may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> we pursue this discourse even now, until we have secured the common enemy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} I can't," [...] he said, sadly. [...] "Then, if {{domestic}} service is degrading in your eyes, {{and people are}} not willing servants among you, may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> any are servants?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your paraphrases {{are about}} equal to your compositions, Jackman, and, in saying that, I don't {{compliment}} you. Pray, may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> you have forsaken your favourite weapon, the gun, {{and taken to}} the rod to-day?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Madame Beck {{knew this}} woman's {{character}} perfectly well. She once {{talked to me}} about her, with an odd mixture of discrimination, indifference, and antipathy. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> she kept her in the establishment. She answered plainly, [...] "because it suited her interest to do so;" [...] and pointed out a fact I had already noticed, namely, that Mademoiselle St. Pierre possessed, in an almost unique degree, the power of keeping order amongst her undisciplined ranks of scholars. A certain petrifying influence accompanied and surrounded her: without passion, noise, or violence, she held them in check as a breezeless frost-air might still a brawling stream. She was of little use as far as communication of knowledge went, but for strict surveillance and maintenance of rules she was invaluable. [...] "Je sais bien qu'elle n'a pas de principes, ni, peut-être, de moeurs," [...] admitted Madame frankly; but added with philosophy, [...] "son maintien en classe est toujours convenable et rempli même d'une certaine dignité: c'est tout ce qu'il faut. Ni les élèves ni les parents ne regardent plus loin; ni, par conséquent, moi non plus." ...|$|E
60|$|Our {{return was}} enlivened by the {{inspection}} of an elephant-kraal, where a herd had been trapped, drugged, and shot {{during the last}} season. As the walls were very flimsy, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> the animals did not break loose; the answer was that the Ngán (Mganga or Fetishman) ran a line of poison vine along its crest, and that the beasts, however wild, would not attempt to pass through it. The natives showed me the liana which they described, still lying on the poles of the broken corral. Mr. Preston, of the Gaboon Mission, who first noticed it, and Mr. Wilson, who gives an illustration of the scene (p. 363), declares that the creeper is drawn around the herd when browsing; {{that as long as}} the animals are unmolested they will not dash through the magic circle, and that the fence of uprights is constructed outside it. The same tale is told of all the wild elephant-hunters in the interior, the Báti the Okáná, the Yefá, and the Sensobá.|$|E
6000|$|I wish I had any faculty {{whatever}} {{of remembering}} what people say; but, though I appreciate anything {{good at the}} moment, it never stays in my memory; nor do I think, in fact, that anything definite, rounded, pointed, separable, and transferable from the general lump of conversation was said by anybody. I recollect that they laughed at Mr. ------, and at his shedding a tear into a Scottish river, on occasion of some literary festival. [...] . They spoke approvingly of Bulwer, as valuing his literary position, and holding himself one of the brotherhood of authors; and not so approvingly of Charles Dickens, who, born a plebeian, aspires to aristocratic society. But I {{said that it was}} easy to condescend, and that Bulwer knew he could not put off his rank, and that he would have all the advantages of it in spite of his authorship. We talked about the position of men of letters in England, and they said that the aristocracy hated and despised and feared them; and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>why</b> it was that literary men, having really so much power in their hands, were content to live unrecognized in the State.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{all hope}} {{something}} of that kind, Mr. Hilary. You were here on a mission of that kind before. But may <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> you think <b>I</b> should believe you wish to be useful to them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "you asked a {{very natural}} question. What I am doing--my view of life, in fact--displeases you. You <b>ask,</b> can't <b>I</b> give it up? <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why?</b> Can you offer me any reason?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>why</b> you {{returned}} from America? I considered that the strong wish you expressed to go there, when an adequate sum was furnished, was tantamount to an engagement {{that you would}} remain there for life." ...|$|R
