The Parliamentary Monitoring Group's People's Assembly indicated that Dlamini was among the most prolific attendees at parliamentary committee meetings in 2016. However, her attendance waned in 2017, when she was expected to account for the grants crisis; between her and her Deputy Minister, Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, by the first week of May, the DSD had appeared in only three of the nine meetings that had taken place in 2017. In February, Dlamini failed to appear before Parliament's Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) to account for <b>irregular</b> <b>expenditure</b> of about R1 billion by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) during the 2016/2017 financial year.|$|E

The {{intention}} was to ensure effective and better public finance management practice. The Act requires that government departments should establish measures to prevent <b>irregular</b> <b>expenditure.</b> However, there has been persistent <b>irregular</b> <b>expenditure</b> reports every year, which {{is an indication of}} non – compliance. The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of <b>irregular</b> <b>expenditure</b> in the South African public finance management domain, using the national Department of Public Works as a case study...|$|E

40|$|Mnquma Local Municipality {{is located}} in the South Eastern part of the Eastern Cape Province. This {{category}} B municipality falls {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Amathole District Municipality (ADM) and comprises of an amalgamation of the former Butterworth, Ngqamakhwe and Centane TRC’s, Mnquma Municipality shares borders with three other local municipalities i. e. Mbhashe, Intsika Yethu and Great Kei Municipalities. In previous years this municipality was surrounded by violence, maladministration and mismanagement of funds. In 2009, Mnquma municipality received a disclaimer audit opinion. The bases for disclaimer are: - Consumer debtors who were disclosed at R 13, 4 million on the face of the statement of financial positions and to the annual financial statements; and this amount did not agree with debtor’s age analysis; - Auditor-General was unable to confirm the exact amount of debtors removed from the accounting system; - Limitations placed on the scope of work and municipal records not permitting the application of alternative audit procedures; - Trade Creditors not supported by adequate documentation and supplier reconciliations did not have adequate alternative system of ensuring that all goods and services received prior to year-end, not paid but were accrued; and number of items that were recorded incorrectly. “The municipality adopted the PMS framework by March 2008. It was implemented and Councillors played a pivotal role in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of theIDP. Cluster meetings set and received performance reports on quarterly basis. Directorates produced monthly performance reports and submitted them to the Executive management and the Executive Mayor respectively. The PMS was cascaded down to lower levels. Managers reporting to Directors had signed Accountability Agreements, while employees below signed Performance promises. It should be stated that there were some challenges on the implementation process. The Framework was implemented for the first time and institution was in a learning curve”. (N. Pakade: 2009). The municipal manager agreed that the institution was in a learning curve even though he commended the good work of councillors, it is not all councillors who know exactly what they are supposed to be doing in monitoring the municipal performance management systems. This has been proved by areas which still do not have electricity, roads and some no running clean water. There were some improvements in 2010 Financial Statements because the municipality received an unqualified audit opinion, but the in- fighting amongst councilors still existing that affect municipal performance in regard to provide local communities with basic needs. The <b>irregular</b> <b>expenditure</b> continued to be incurred where two different security companies were appointed by Executive Mayor and Municipal Speaker to prevent each other in entering the municipal premises because of disagreements about the reappointment of the municipal manager. Mnquma municipality does not have an Executive Mayor due to councilors who fired the mayor. The Mnquma councilors’ in fighting affects local communities in a negative way that contributes to municipal bad performance...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article was}} to determine whether the internal audit function (IAF) has a role to play in the prevention and detection of fraud in the South African public sector, with reference to national departments. Accordingly, the possible role of the IAF is discussed, with specific reference to fraud prevention and detection, fraud risk and reportable wasteful, <b>irregular</b> and unauthorised <b>expenditure.</b> The article presents a literature review and discusses the data gathered by means of a survey from the accounting officers (AOs), who act as heads of department (HoDs), the chairpersons of audit committees (CACs), and the chief audit executives (CAEs) of national departments in the South African public sector on their perceptions of the IAF’s role with regard to fraud. The findings show that the AOs, CACs and CAEs believe that the IAF has a responsibility to detect material fraud and reportable fruitless and wasteful, <b>irregular</b> or unauthorised <b>expenditure</b> in national government departments. Furthermore, {{a review of the literature}} suggests that the prevention and detection of fraud should remain the responsibility of the AOs, and the survey revealed that the responding AOs and CACs perceive the IAF as a management tool to detect elements of fraud. It is recommended that the AOs and the IAFs should take equal responsibility in notifying the CACs about any allegations of fraud received from any whistleblowing assurance provider. In conclusion, the article suggests avenues for further research on internal auditing’s role regarding fraud prevention and detection...|$|R
40|$|The Eastern Cape Department of Education consumes a huge {{chunk of}} the Eastern Cape provincial budget. Any {{transgression}} of the laws that govern how the public purse should be managed - whether overspending, under spending, <b>irregular</b> or wasteful <b>expenditure</b> - has far reaching consequences in terms of service delivery. The Eastern Cape {{is one of the}} poorest and most rural provinces in the country and by implication has huge service delivery backlogs. This has been confirmed by various stakeholders and role-players such as Chapter Nine institutions and non-governmental organisations. An observation by the Auditor-General and both the portfolio committees on Public Accounts and Education over the years is the lack of proper controls, especially in financial management. This study presents a case study of the Eastern Cape Department of Education in the financial years 2007 - 2012 to assess the Public Finance Management Act, Act 1 of 1999 (PFMA). The main objective {{of this study is to}} assist the department by putting forward lasting scientific recommendations and solutions that could be integrated into the plans of this department...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} social and financial activities of Buddhist nuns to demonstrate how and why they deployed Buddhist doctrines, rituals, legends, and material culture to interact with society outside the convent. By examining {{the activities of the}} nuns of the Daihongan convent (one of the two administrative heads of the popular pilgrimage temple, Zenkōji) in Japan’s early modern period (roughly 1550 to 1868) as documented in the convent’s rich archival sources, I shed further light on the oft-overlooked political and financial activities of nuns, illustrate how Buddhist institutions interacted with the laity, provide further nuance to the discussion of how Buddhist women navigated patriarchal sectarian and secular hierarchies, and, within the field of Japanese history, give voice to women who were active outside of the household unit around which early modern Japanese society was organized. Zenkōji temple, surrounded by the mountains of Nagano, has been one of Japan’s most popular pilgrimage sites since the medieval period. The abbesses of Daihongan, one Zenkōji’s main sub-temples, traveled widely to maintain connections with elite and common laypeople, participated in frequent country-wide displays of Zenkōji’s icon, and oversaw the creation of branch temples in Edo (now Tokyo), Osaka, Echigo (now Niigata), and Shinano (now Nagano). The abbesses of Daihongan were one of only a few women to hold the imperially sanctioned title of eminent person (shōnin 上人) and to wear purple robes. While this means that this Pure Land convent was in some ways not representative of all convents in early modern Japan, Daihongan’s position is particularly instructive because the existence of nuns and monks in a single temple complex allows us to see in detail how monastics of both genders interacted in close quarters. This work draws heavily from the convent’s archival materials, which I used as a guide in framing my dissertation chapters. In the Introduction I discuss previous works on women in Buddhism. In Chapter 1, I briefly discuss the convent’s history and its place within the Zenkōji temple complex. In Chapter 2, I examine the convent’s regular economic bases and its expenditures. In Chapter 3, I highlight Daihongan’s branch temples and discuss the ways that they acted as nodes in a network connecting people in various areas to Daihongan and Zenkōji, thus demonstrating how a rural religious center extended its sphere of influence in urban settings. In Chapter 4, I discuss the nuns’ travels throughout the country to generate new and maintain old connections with the imperial court in Kyoto, confraternities in Osaka, influential women in the shogun’s castle, and commoners in Edo. In Chapter 5, I examine the convent’s reliance upon irregular means of income such as patronage, temple lotteries, loans, and displays of treasures, and how these were needed to balance <b>irregular</b> <b>expenditures</b> such as travel and the maintenance or reconstruction of temple buildings. Throughout the dissertation I describe Daihongan’s inner social structure comprised of abbesses, nuns, and administrators, and its local emplacement within Zenkōji and Zenkōji’s temple lands. Exploring these themes sheds light on the lives of Japanese Buddhist nuns in this period. While the tensions between freedom and agency {{on the one hand and}} obligations to patrons, subordination to monks, or gender- and status-based restrictions on the other are important, and I discuss them in my work, my primary focus is on the nuns’ activities and lives. Doing so demonstrates that nuns were central figures in ever-changing economic and social networks as they made and maintained connections with the outside world through Buddhist practices and through precedents set centuries before. This research contributes to our understanding of nuns in Japan’s early modern period and will participate in and shape debates on the roles of women in patriarchal religious hierarchies.

60|$|The Oxbridge shopkeeper is {{peculiar}} among shopkeepers in {{the fact}} that he has to do very largely with shy and immature customers with an extreme and distinctive ignorance of most commercial things. They are for the most part short of cash, but with vague and often large probabilities of credit behind them, for most people, even quite straitened people, will pull their sons and daughters out of altogether unreasonable debts at the end of their university career; and so the Oxbridge shopkeeper becomes a sort of propagandist of the charms and advantages of insolvency. Alone among retailers he dislikes the sight of cash, declines it, affects to regard it as a coarse ignorant truncation of a budding relationship, begs to be permitted to wait. So the youngster just up from home discovers that money may stay in the pocket, be used for cab and train fares and light refreshments; all the rest may be had for the asking. Marjorie, with her innate hunger for good fine things, with her quite insufficient pocket-money, and the <b>irregular</b> habits of <b>expenditure</b> a spasmodically financed, hard-up home is apt to engender, fell very readily into this new, delightful custom of having it put down (whatever it happened to be). She had all sorts of things put down. She and the elder Carmel girl used to go shopping together, having things put down. She brightened her rooms with colour-prints and engravings, got herself pretty and becoming clothes, acquired a fitted dressing-bag already noted in this story, and one or two other trifles of the sort, revised her foot-wear, created a very nice little bookshelf, and although at times she felt a little astonished and scared at herself, resolutely refused to estimate the total of accumulated debt she had attained. Indeed until the bills came in it was impossible to do that, because, following the splendid example of the Carmel girl, she hadn't even inquired the price of quite a number of things....|$|R
40|$|Integrative Summary: Municipalities are {{the third}} level of {{government}} and are responsible for delivery of basic services to citizens. They carry the developmental mandate of government and are often the first point of interaction between government and citizens. Being at {{the front line of}} service delivery, the issue of fiscal stability of municipalities and their ability to deliver sustainable services is of grave importance (Carter & Ajam 2003). Unfortunately in a South African context most municipalities are not fiscally sustainable (Roos & Stander 2005). In a study of 142 South African municipalities, it was found that poor collection of outstanding debt and <b>irregular</b> or wasteful <b>expenditure</b> were the biggest causes of fiscal stress (Roos & Stander 2005). In fact, in 2004 the difficulties appear to have reached crisis level (Lubbe & Roussouw 2005). The fiscal situation within municipalities was so bad that the South African Local Government Authority (SALGA) implemented a unit specifically to assist municipalities that were at “crisis point” (Roos & Stander, 2005 p. 165). This research report focuses on the evaluation of Igoli 2002 which was a response to fiscal crisis within the City of Johannesburg metropolitan municipality when in 1997 the City of Johannesburg was declared insolvent. The research evaluated the long term sustainability of the Igoli 2002 programme to determine its success in addressing the issues of fiscal stress and crisis facing the municipality. The research also attempted to assess the applicability of international indicators of fiscal stress and crisis to the City of Johannesburg. The research evaluated the Igoli 2002 programme via a financial condition analysis, against international indicators of fiscal stress and crisis and against a logic framework detailing the goals of the programme. The research found that ultimately, the Igoli 2002 intervention implemented by the City of Johannesburg was successful in improving the fiscal position and sustainability of the City. In addition, indicators from predictive models of fiscal stress and crisis were found to be relevant to the City of Johannesburg...|$|R
