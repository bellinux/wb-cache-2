50|$|By definition, a <b>hermaphroditic</b> <b>connector</b> {{includes}} {{mating surfaces}} having simultaneous {{male and female}} aspects, involving complementary paired identical parts each containing both protrusions and indentations. These mating surfaces are mounted into identical fittings which can freely mate with any other, without regard for gender (provided that the size and type are already matched). Alternative names include hermaphrodite, androgynous, genderless, sexless, combination (or combo), two-in-one, two-way, and other descriptive terms. Several of these latter alternate names are ambiguous in meaning, {{and should not be}} used unless carefully defined in context. True hermaphroditic connectors {{should not be confused with}} mixed gender connectors, which are described elsewhere in this article.|$|E
50|$|Hermaphroditic connections, {{which include}} {{both male and}} female {{elements}} in a single unit, are used for some specialized tubing fittings, such as Storz fire hose connectors. A picture of such fittings appears in the #Genderless (<b>hermaphroditic)</b> <b>connectors</b> section of this article.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{commonly}} seen {{examples of}} <b>hermaphroditic</b> <b>connectors</b> include the SAE connector for 12 V DC power, jackhammer air hose connectors, and the Anderson Powerpole series of modular high-current power connectors. The IBM token ring connector was another widespread example, {{but it has}} become obsolete and is being phased out. The General Radio Corporation (GenRad) developed a hermaphroditic coaxial radio frequency connector often called the [...] "GR connector".|$|R
50|$|Plug and socket {{connectors}} {{are usually}} {{made up of}} a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a female receptacle (typically socket contacts), although <b>hermaphroditic</b> <b>connectors</b> exist, such as the original IBM token ring LAN connector. Plugs generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.|$|R
5000|$|Cabling is {{generally}} IBM [...] "Type-1", a heavy two-pair 150 Ohm {{shielded twisted pair}} cable. This was the basic cable for the [...] "IBM Cabling System", a structured cabling system that IBM hoped would be widely adopted. Unique <b>hermaphroditic</b> <b>connectors,</b> {{commonly referred to as}} IBM Data Connectors in formal writing or colloquially as Boy George connectors were used. The connectors have the disadvantage of being quite bulky, requiring at least 3 x 3 cm panel space, and being relatively fragile. The advantages of the connectors being that they are genderless and have superior shielding over standard unshielded RJ45. Connectors at the computer were usually DE-9 female.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hermaphroditic}} {{design is}} useful when multiple complex or lengthy components must be arbitrarily connected in various combinations. For example, if hoses have hermaphroditic fittings, {{they can be}} connected without having to pull a lengthy hose and reverse it because it has the wrong gender to connect to another hose. Some military fiber optical cables also have <b>hermaphroditic</b> <b>connectors</b> to prevent [...] "wrong gender" [...] connector problems in field deployments. In a similar fashion, railcars are usually equipped with hermaphroditic railway coupling mechanisms that allow {{either end of the}} vehicle to be connected to a train consist without having to turn the railcar around first.For the same reason, several spacecraft docking mechanisms are designed to be [...] "androgynous",including the Androgynous Peripheral Attach System, the NASA Docking System, and Chinese Docking Mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Some audio {{multicore}} cables are {{fitted with}} <b>hermaphroditic</b> multipin quick-disconnect <b>connectors</b> {{for ease of}} use in the field. One style of this audio signal cable is fitted on both ends with connectors that are each populated half with pins and half with sockets. The advantage to the user {{is that it does}} not matter which end connects to the stage and which to the audio mixer, facilitating faster set up. Another style of connector uses hybrid male/female pins with a receiving slot fitted in the center of each two-tine pin, and relies on 90-degree rotation of the pin axes to mate. The connector housings themselves are sexed male and female.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{additional}} complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations {{of male and}} female pins in a single connector body, for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the connector body, rather than the mixed-gender connector pins and sockets. These types of connectors are not strictly speaking <b>hermaphroditic,</b> since mating <b>connectors</b> are not freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is [...] "bisexual", in addition to the more official terminology, mixed-gender. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender female plug that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).|$|R
