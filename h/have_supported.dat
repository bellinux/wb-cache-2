5|$|On {{the inner}} {{surface of the}} nasal section of skull are ridges called nasoturbinals, which may <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> {{cartilage}} that increased {{the area of the}} olfactory epithelium, the layer of tissue that detects odors. These ridges are much smaller than those of later synapsids from the Late Permian and Triassic, whose large nasoturbinals are taken as evidence for warm-bloodedness because they may <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> mucous membranes that warmed and moistened incoming air. Thus, the nasal cavity of Dimetrodon is transitional between those of early land vertebrates and mammals.|$|E
5|$|Even {{within the}} King family, members {{disagree}} about his {{religious and political}} views about gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. King's widow Coretta said publicly that she believed her husband would <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> gay rights.

5|$|Although {{the main}} stem of Shamokin Creek is {{designated}} as a Warmwater Fishery, all of its tributaries are designated as Coldwater Fisheries. Some tributaries, such as North Branch Shamokin Creek and Quaker Run, lack fish life. However, several fish species have been observed in Carbon Run and downstream tributaries such as Trout Run, Bennys Run, Millers Run, and Lick Creek <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> healthy communities of aquatic life.

5|$|At {{the time}} Ecgberht was in exile, Francia was ruled by Charlemagne, who {{maintained}} Frankish influence in Northumbria {{and is known}} to <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> Offa's enemies in the south. Another exile in Gaul at this time was Odberht, a priest, who is almost certainly the same person as Eadberht, who later became king of Kent. According to a later chronicler, William of Malmesbury, Ecgberht learned the arts of government during his time in Gaul.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} in Bowling Green on August 26. Because {{of his age}} and ill health, he made {{no more than one}} speech per week. Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, questioning the sincerity of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> the events that took place there. He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an oligarchy. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fights}} for the ramparts of Wola, only {{artillery}} {{of the second}} line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> the forts of the first line, {{but he could not}} see what was happening in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden.|$|E
5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the main {{structure}} within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily defensible on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> a perishable watchtower.|$|E

The {{appointment}} {{had been pushed}} through by Foliot's relative, Miles of Gloucester, who was by then the Earl of Hereford. Foliot was well connected at court in other respects, for his probable father had been steward to David I, before David became King of Scotland. David was the uncle of both the Empress and Stephen's wife. Following his elevation to abbot Foliot recognised Stephen as king, although he seems until then to <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> Matilda.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the West Group have {{revealed}} an occupation {{beginning in the}} Late Classic and reaching its maximum extent in the Terminal Classic. The construction methods used in the West Group were inferior {{to those of the}} acropolis, consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth-based mortar rather than the lime-based mortar used in the palace complex. The platforms of the West Group appear to <b>have</b> <b>supported</b> perishable superstructures and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production.|$|E

Nonetheless, Finnish president Urho Kekkonen was the very first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968; he received the highest Czechoslovakian honours from the hands of President Ludvík Svoboda, on 4 October 1969.
