5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak from the hole in the airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E
5|$|Charles Scott {{was born}} in 1739, {{probably}} in April, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Goochland County, Virginia, that is now Powhatan County. His father, Samuel Scott, was a farmer {{and member of the}} Virginia House of Burgesses. His mother, whose name is not known, died most likely around 1745. Scott had an older brother, John, and three younger siblings, Edward, Joseph, and Martha. He received only a basic education from his parents and in the rural Virginia schools near his home.|$|E
5|$|Dušan's {{death was}} {{followed}} by the stirring of separatist activity in the Serbian Empire. The south-western territories, including Epirus, Thessaly, and lands in southern Albania, seceded by 1357. However, the core of the state (the western lands, including Zeta and Travunia with the upper Drina Valley; the central Serbian lands; and Macedonia), remained loyal to Emperor Uroš. Nevertheless, local noblemen asserted more and more independence from Uroš' authority even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the state that remained Serbian. Uroš was weak and unable to counteract these separatist tendencies, becoming an inferior power in his own domain. Serbian lords also fought each other for territory and influence.|$|E

5|$|In 1922, the National Museum was {{transferred}} from Palazzo Xara to Auberge d'Italie. The museum {{was directed by}} Sir Themistocles Zammit, and it was divided into archaeology, history, arts, natural history and mineralogical sections. The museum closed down during World War II, and the building received two direct hits on 7 April 1942. Part of the façade was destroyed by aerial bombardment, and the natural history collection suffered severe damage since it was located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the building which was hit. After the war ended, the damaged parts of the auberge were reconstructed, the museum was reopened {{and part of the}} building housed a school of art.|$|E
5|$|The {{green and}} golden bell frog occurs on three islands off {{the east coast}} of Australia: Kooragang and Broughton Islands off Port Stephens, and Bowen Island at Jervis Bay.

In most places, it is the only frog species in the vicinity. However, recent declines have been reported, suspected to be due to predatory fish. It was also introduced to the Pacific island countries of New Caledonia and Vanuatu in the 19th century, and has since become common there.|$|E

5|$|Born in Vicenza, Italy, {{and raised}} in Castle Rock, Colorado, Adams is the fourth of seven siblings. She trained to be a ballerina, but at age 18 found musical theater {{to be a better}} fit, and from 1994 to 1998, she worked in dinner theater. Adams made her feature film debut with a {{supporting}} part in the 1999 satire Drop Dead Gorgeous. After relocating to Los Angeles, she made several guest appearances in television, and took on mean girl parts in small-scale features. Her first major role came in Steven Spielberg's 2002 biopic Catch Me If You Can, opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, but she was unemployed for a year after.

5|$|By 1606 {{the missionaries}} had {{concentrated}} many Manche Ch'ols in nine new mission towns, and {{had started to}} penetrate {{the territory of the}} neighbouring Mopan Maya, who were on the borders of the fiercely independent Itza of central Petén. By 1628 the Dominicans were tending to 6,000 Maya <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Manche Ch'ol territory that they had gained access to. This figure included some apostate refugees from Spanish-controlled Cahabón. Estimates of the total Manche Ch'ol population in the mid-17th century vary from 10,000 to 30,000, with prominent 20th-century Mayanist J. Eric S. Thompson preferring the lower figure as opposed to the high-end estimates by 17th-century chroniclers. The Dominican penetration of Mopan territory alarmed the Itza, who started to harass the Manche Ch'ol, driving them away from the mission towns.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1841, Meyerbeer had {{completed}} {{the first draft of}} Le prophète, but refused to stage it because the then director of the opera, Leon Pillet, wished to cast his mistress, Rosine Stoltz, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Fidès, the hero's mother. (Berlioz characterised Stoltz as 'la Directrice du Directeur'). Meyerbeer insisted on Pauline Viardot for the role. Meyerbeer lodged the score with a Parisian lawyer, and refused to countenance any production until his wishes were met. It was not until 1849 when the Opéra was willing to agree his conditions. Meyerbeer was unique in his time in having the wealth and influence to impose his will as a composer in this way.|$|E

5|$|In 1967, Brooke-Little was {{advanced}} {{to the position of}} Richmond Herald. On 7 July 1980, after almost thirty years of service to the Earl Marshal and the College of Arms, Brooke-Little was appointed to replace Sir Walter Verco as Norroy and Ulster King of Arms, with heraldic authority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> England north of the Trent, as well as in Northern Ireland. While serving in that office, he enjoyed telling people that the commonly held view that the Order of Saint Patrick was extinct was quite false. Brooke-Little believed that as the Ulster King of Arms – the capacity in which he handled Northern Irish heraldry – he remained ex officio an Officer of the Order. As the holder of that office, he and his successors would remain the Order's King of Arms, Registrar and Knight Attendant, until such time as the Sovereign should choose formally to abolish the office of Ulster King of Arms or to declare that these positions are not vested in the office. The fact that the last knight had died in 1974 was of little consequence to such a staunch traditionalist.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} (cave hyena subspecies) is {{depicted}} in {{a few examples of}} Upper Palaeolithic rock art in France. A painting from the Chauvet Cave depicts a hyena outlined and represented in profile, with two legs, with its head and front part with well distinguishable spotted coloration pattern. Because of the specimen's steeped profile, it is thought that the painting was originally meant to represent a cave bear, but was modified as a hyena. In Lascaux, a red and black rock painting of a hyena is present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the cave known as the Diverticule axial, and {{is depicted in}} profile, with four limbs, showing an animal with a steep back. The body and the long neck have spots, including the flanks. An image on a cave in Ariège shows an incompletely outlined and deeply engraved figure, representing a part of an elongated neck, smoothly passing into part of the animal’s forelimb on the proximal side. Its head is in profile, with a possibly re-engraved muzzle. The ear is typical of the spotted hyena, as it is rounded. An image in the Le Gabillou Cave in Dordogne shows a deeply engraved zoomorphic figure with a head in frontal view and an elongated neck with part of the forelimb in profile. It has large round eyes and short, rounded ears which are set far from each other. It has a broad, line-like mouth that evokes a smile. Though originally thought to represent a composite or zoomorphic hybrid, it is probable it is a spotted hyena based on its broad muzzle and long neck.|$|E

40|$|This paper extends {{recent studies}} of the January effect by {{investigating}} {{the evolution of the}} daily pattern of the effect across size deciles.

Further analysis of daily trading volumes suggests a stable trading volume intensity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>part</b> <b>of</b> January and a substantial decline in trading volume intensity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>part</b> <b>of</b> January. ...|$|R
