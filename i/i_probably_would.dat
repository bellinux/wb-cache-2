To be honest, had it happened earlier in the game when I had more time and things were less frantic, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have deleted it as you couldn't make out the faces on the crowd {{on the back of the}} camera, and it was only when I pulled it up on the laptop later that I realised what I had.|$|E

The reality of the {{situation}} was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E

Banks {{said in an interview}} with the Newcastle Evening Chronicle that leaving Warwick University led him to become a published writer. Banks said, [...] "If I'd stayed on, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have gone down the acting route instead of writing. University isn't for everyone and I discovered that the other writers I know didn't finish their courses either. It was certainly the best thing that happened to me." ...|$|E

500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E
500|$|Squidward has {{received}} positive reception from critics and fans. SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny named Squidward his favorite character on the show. He said, [...] "He has an extra dimension where SpongeBob and Patrick's capacity of play mystifies him, but he's also jealous of it. When {{he tries to}} participate, he just fails utterly because he doesn't believe in it." [...] Staff writer Casey Alexander said, [...] "Squidward is the character I relate to the most. In an exaggerated way, he's the most human character. If I knew a human like SpongeBob, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> react to him like Squidward does". American singer Pharrell Williams, who says he {{is a fan of}} the show, said that [...] "Squidward is my favorite, though. If he was a human, I would hang out with him." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{appearing}} as a recurring guest {{actor in the}} fifth season, actor Jonathan Pryce was promoted to regular cast member for the sixth season. Prior to being cast as the High Sparrow, Pryce was approached to play another role {{in one of the}} previous seasons and refused the part. After being approached with the role of the High Sparrow, Pryce stated that he accepted the role because [...] "If the role hadn't been what {{it turned out to be}} for High Sparrow, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not have been involved. I remember starting out and my agent said 'does the character change the situation or is he just a functionary' and this character changes the situation." [...] Pryce added, [...] "Once I started work on Games of Thrones I was incredibly impressed with the organization, the crew and they're really good at their job and story telling so I have become a fan of the show." ...|$|E

500|$|Cameron sketched Jack's nude {{portrait}} of Rose for a scene which he feels has {{the backdrop of}} repression. [...] "You {{know what it means}} for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," [...] he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying to find things to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|E
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] saw the {{departure}} of several cast members and recurring guest actors from the series. Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts. <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have cried." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted [...] "Inside Out" [...] {{is one of}} the [...] "ten remaining tracks [...] continue the trend [...] ", considering the song's lyrics as [...] "blatantly slutty" [...] and praising [...] "the much-welcomed piano breakdown". David Buchanan of Consequence of Sound also agreed that [...] "the [...] singles are extraordinarily infectious, as is [...] "Inside Out", which slows the tempo, simultaneously sending Spears back to basics vocally, and into 2011 sonically." [...] On her review of Femme Fatale, Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club commented that [...] "songs like the dark, slinky [...] "Inside Out", the hyper-Euro chant-along [...] "Till The World Ends", and the strange, flute-assisted digression [...] "Criminal" [...] add texture to the wall-to-wall synth waves and booty bass." [...] The Guardians Alexis Petridis commented that the song [...] "lurches along on 's patent half-speed rhythm." [...] While Keith Caufield of Billboard considered [...] "Inside Out" [...] "easily a natural pick for 'Femme's' third single", Hannah Rishel of The Daily Collegian said that [...] "in general the song failed to hold my attention. If I heard it on the radio, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> change the station." [...] Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the song a negative review, considering it a [...] "weak mid-tempo fare", along with [...] "Criminal". Following the release of Femme Fatale, [...] "Inside Out" [...] reached number fifty-nine on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, after selling 7,222 digital units of the song alone.|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, he {{described}} his Roxy Music tenure as important to his career: [...] "As a result of going into a subway station and meeting , I joined Roxy Music, and, {{as a result of}} that, I have a career in music.

[...] During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower class women and artists' models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.|$|E

2500|$|In 1891, U.S. Senator Philetus Sawyer {{allegedly}} offered La Follette a bribe to {{side with}} him in a court case against former state officials.

2500|$|Piquet Jr. was criticised {{by many in}} the {{community}} and some suggest that the controversy effectively ended his hopes of continuing in F1. BBC F1 commentator Martin Brundle suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor would want {{to be associated with the}} Piquet family. Brundle noted that Piquet Jr. [...] "didn't deliver at Renault, he wasn't fast enough, that's why he was released and that's why he has dropped hand grenades into the system ever since". Brundle was also highly critical that Piquet Jr. escaped sanction from the FIA despite admitting to race-fixing, while the others involved were heavily punished. Other leading F1 figures have echoed Brundle's sentiments. Toyota team principal John Howett was quoted as saying, [...] "I think on his performance...disregarding the issue, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not give him a drive and I would probably be further influenced in that decision by what took place." [...] Christian Horner, team principal of Red Bull Racing, has added, [...] "I don't think we would have any interest [...] at Red Bull Racing." ...|$|E
