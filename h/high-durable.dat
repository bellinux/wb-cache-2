40|$|Abstract. Electrochemical {{reaction}} {{occurring in}} the SOFC cathode is the reduction of oxygen, therefore cathode materials for SOFC have to posses many properties. It is necessary to evaluate the performance and degradation of SOFC cathode since improvement of long-term stability {{is one of the}} major issues during SOFC commercialization process. The scope of this paper is focused on analyzing the chemical degradation of LSM cathode induced from many sources by GCI technique both from theoretical and experimental sides. This research is important toward the commercialization of SOFC because it could offer valuable information to overview chemical degradations from the SOFC cathode and develop strategy to realize <b>high-durable</b> SOFC...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} create <b>high-durable,</b> {{wear-resistant}} materials {{for a wide range}} of functional applications, comparative investigations of the structure and mechanical characteristics of ion-plasma Ti-W-B nano-crystalline condensates were carried out. The range of condensation rates 0. 11 ÷ 0. 25 nm/s was found to be critical for the coatings obtained from the target with 80 vol% W 2 B 5 - 20 vol% TiB 2. Below this, a phase with a cubic lattice (W,Ti) B 0. 7 … 1. 2 (O,N,C) 0. 3 … 0. 2 formed, while over this range, a solid solution (W,Ti) B 2 with a hexagonal lattice and element composition close to the sputtered target was observed. The structure state of the material changed from cluster-crystalline (under low sputter potentials U= 0. 6 … 1. 0 kV) to textured- crystalline (under U> 2. 2 kV). Structure perfection improvement with U increase results in higher hardness and elastic modulus of condensates. The conditions of cluster component formation and its effect on hardness and elastic modulus of condensates are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{temperature}} dependence of physical properties {{of iron and}} their temperature peculiarities curves have been investigated. The influence of the time-temperature treatment (TTT) on {{the efficacy of the}} modification of iron including durable have been also determined. Intorduction The contemporary engineering industry makes high requirements for casting alloys. Cast iron as most wide-spread and the cheapest structural material occupies the particular place among them. The interest to cast iron has grown significantly due to its modification practice. Still recently the objective of cast iron modification was some increase in structure homogeneity, mechanical properties and removing chill casting parts. At the moment methods of cast iron modification can solve the complex issues including obtaining the <b>high-durable</b> cast iron witch spherical carbon (ISC) or witch vermicular carbon (IVC) etc. In this study we traced the impact of the time-temperature treatment (TTT) of melting on the effect of the modification of cast iron [1]. Experimental The melting of iron according to serial and experimental technological was conducted in the induction furnace IST- 0. 16, capacity 160 kg. The composition of charge: conversion iron (84 - 87 %), steel scraps-carving (10 - 13 %) and ferrosilicon- 3 %. Chemical composition (wt%) of the sample...|$|E
