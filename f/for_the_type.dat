5|$|Seeking to {{capitalize}} on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, {{in its first year}} of service. Ethiopian Airlines placed the first order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> in December 1982. Featuring increased gross weight and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier payloads at distances up to , and was targeted at overseas customers. The 767-200ER entered service with El Al Airline on March 27, 1984. The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.|$|E

5|$|After being re-equipped with de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribou in 1964, No. 38 Squadron {{served as}} the RAAF's {{operational}} conversion unit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> and also conducted transport tasks within Australia and its territories. Throughout Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, it prepared aircrew for operational service with No. 35 Squadron, and maintained a detachment in Papua and New Guinea to provide pilots with experience flying in tropical conditions. A Caribou was deployed to Pakistan from 1975 to 1978 to support United Nations peacekeepers, and detachments were established within Australia during the 1980s to provide search and rescue capabilities and work with Australian Army units. From 1999 until 2001, a detachment was deployed to East Timor {{as part of the}} Australian-led peacekeeping force in the newly independent nation. No. 38 Squadron continued to operate Caribou after No. 35 Squadron was disbanded in 2000, though the age of the aircraft increasingly affected its operations.|$|E
5|$|French {{paleontologist}} Eric Buffetaut and a Thai colleague, Varavudh Suteethorn, {{described a}} partial {{upper and lower}} jaw from the Aptian-Albian Khok Kruat Formation of Thailand in 1992, giving it the name Psittacosaurus sattayaraki. In 2000, Sereno questioned the validity of this species, citing its eroded and fragmentary nature, and noted an absence of features characteristic of the genus Psittacosaurus. However, in 2002 the original authors published new images of the fossil which seem to show teeth in the lower jaw that exhibit the bulbous vertical ridge characteristic of psittacosaurs. Other authors have also defended its validity, while some continue to regard it as dubious. Sereno (2010) proposed that the best assignment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> material may be Ceratopsia incertae sedis.|$|E

5|$|In March 1996, British Aerospace {{promoted}} {{the option of}} establishing a production line to manufacture new-build Nimrod MRA4 aircraft {{as an alternative to}} the refurbishment of existing airframes, this was reportedly motivated by service concerns regarding attrition rates of the existing aircraft. It was also announced that preliminary talks had been conducted with the South African Air Force on the topic of the Nimrod 2000; British Aerospace were also considering the merits of using a newly developed variant of the General Electric CF34 turbofan powerplant, which General Electric had formally proposed the specific use of to power the type. In June 1996, British Aerospace announced that it had partnered with McDonnell Douglas to market new-build Nimrod 2000s to the export market; it has been claimed that this move was in response to scepticism from the MoD over the prospects of export sales <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type.</b> British Aerospace argued that the Nimrod 2000's selection would give it entry to the global maritime patrol aircraft market.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, {{cumulative}} 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn. In 2001, Boeing dropped {{plans for a}} longer-range model, the 767-400ERX, {{in favor of the}} proposed Sonic Cruiser, a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 767. The following year, Boeing announced the KC-767 Tanker Transport, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER. Launched with an order in October 2002 from the Italian Air Force, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo. The Japanese government became the second customer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> in March 2003. In May 2003, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging KC-135 tankers. The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a conflict of interest scandal, resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including Philip Condit, the company's chief executive officer, and chief financial officer Michael Sears. The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 1939, {{orders for}} nine destroyers (Z31–Z39) {{of the new}} Type 1938B class were placed, with a further three destroyers of the class being ordered in July. The Type 1938B were {{relatively}} small destroyers compared with the preceding Type 1936 and 1936A ships, to be armed with four 127mm (5in) guns in two twin turrets, and designed for long range. Following {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, however, orders <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 1938B destroyers were cancelled, with a reversion to a slightly modified version of the previous Type 1936A class, the Type 1936A (Mob) class. Four destroyers (Z31–Z34) were re-ordered from the Deschimag consortium to be built at the AG Weser shipyard in Bremen on that day, with a further three ships (Z37–Z39) ordered from the Germaniawerft yard. Z31 was laid down on 1 September 1940 (with the yard number 1001), launched on 15 May 1941 and commissioned on 11 April 1942.|$|E
5|$|The Tu-70 was {{completed}} in October 1946, but did not make its first flight until 27 November. It began manufacturer's trials in October, but an engine fire on the fourth flight caused it to make a crash-landing. This was traced to a design defect in the American-built supercharger-control system, but identifying the problem and fixing it prolonged the manufacturer's trials through October 1947. It was redesignated as the Tu-70 when it went through the State acceptance trials which ended on 14 December. It met all the design goals, but was not accepted for production as all the factories were already committed to building aircraft with a higher priority and Aeroflot had no requirement <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type,</b> being fully satisfied with its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 airliners.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} of the Hunter {{consists of}} six interchangeable major sections: the forward fuselage (housing {{the cockpit and}} armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from a summer visit to Los Altos, California, Rona received a vague telegram from the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester referencing war work and polonium, but no details of an assignment. When Rona responded {{that she would be}} interested in helping with the war effort but had immigration issues, a man identifying himself as Brian O'Bryen appeared in her office and explained the nature of the confidential work for the Manhattan Project. They proposed buying her method of polonium extraction and gave specific instructions <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of assistants she might use — someone unfamiliar with chemistry or physics. Her non-citizen status did not preclude her from working for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), to which she gave her methods without compensation. Before the Manhattan Project, polonium had been used only in small samples, but the project proposed to use both polonium and beryllium to create a reaction forcing neutrons to be ejected and ignite the fission reaction required for the atom bomb. Plutonium plants, based on her specifications for what was needed to process element, were built in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos National Laboratory, but Rona was given no details.|$|E
5|$|The design main {{armament}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Type</b> 1936A (Mob) class was, {{like the}} Type 1936A class {{on which it}} was based, five 15 cm (5.9in) TbtsK C/36 naval guns, with one twin turret forward and three single mounts aft. Development of the twin turret was slow however, and Z31 (like all the Type 1936A class), was completed with an additional single 15cm gun replacing the unavailable twin turret, giving {{a total of four}} 15cm guns. The forward gun was replaced by the intended twin turret in 1944, but the twin turret was replaced by a single 10.5 cm (4.1in) SK L/45 naval gun after the twin turret was wrecked in battle in January 1945. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of 2 twin 3.7 cm SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns (later replaced by automatic Flak M42 guns) and nine 20 mm cannon in one quadruple and five single mounts. A second quadruple 20mm mount was fitted forward of the ship's bridge in 1943, replacing one of the single mounts, while additional 3.7cm were fitted in 1945, giving a final anti-aircraft armament in German service of fourteen 3.7cm and twelve 20mm guns. Eight 533mm (21in) torpedo tubes in two quadruple mounts were fitted, and up to 60 mines could be carried.|$|E
