Whether {{it is possible to}} predict the amount of problems with the knowledge of the amount of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> is as well investigated. In addition is explored whether the <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and problems are related with the neighborhoods the children live in, or is related with their ethnicity. Method Youth Healthcare registers <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and problems in child development. The registrations of 868 children in the age of two and three years old are collected in four different neighborhoods.

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> for ischemic stroke may vary between {{different groups of}} stroke patients. We examined the distribution of individual well-established <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> {{as well as the}} multiplicity of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> in different age groups and among subtypes. Methods: In the Lund Stroke Register, we consecutively enrolled 2, 505 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke from 2001 to 2009 and registered hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, current smoking, hypercholesterolemia as well as stroke subtype. Results: Among young patients (< 55 years), at least 50 % had ≥ 2 <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and 20 - 25 % had ≥ 3 <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> In patients aged 55 years or older, the proportion with ≥ 2 <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> was 70 - 80 % and with ≥ 3 <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> 35 - 45 %. Men and women had a similar burden of <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Approximately 50 % of the cases classified as cardioembolism (CE) and large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) had ≥ 3 <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> which was significantly more than the other TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) subtypes (CE p < 0. 001, LAA p = 0. 001).

This study examined the prevalence and clustering of CVD <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> in a sample of church members from South Carolina. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a faith-based intervention, Faith, Activity, and Nutrition (FAN). SETTING: African Methodist Episcopal churches in four geographically-defined districts in South Carolina. PARTICIPANTS: 1119 church members. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported presence or absence of healthcare provider diagnosed diabetes, high cholesterol, and hypertension. Objectively measured blood pressure, height, and weight (body mass index) were also taken. The prevalence of single, multiple, and clustering of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> was computed. RESULTS: 62 % of participants were obese, 64 % had hypertension, 23 % had diabetes, and 39 % had high cholesterol; 15 % had no <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> 24 % had 1 <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> 30 % had 2 <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> 22 % had 3 <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> and 10 % had 4 <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> The most common clusters of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> were: obese and hypertensive (18 %), obese, hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic (13 %), and obese, hypertensive, hypercholesterolemic, and diabetic (10 %).

However, it is unclear which cardiovascular <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> tend to cluster predominately and how individual <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> states change over time. Methods & Results: We used data from 3, 187 individuals aged 20 - 79 years from the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania for a network-based approach to visualize clustered MetS <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> states and their change over a five-year follow-up period. MetS was defined by harmonized Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, and each individual's <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> burden was classified according to the five MetS components at baseline and follow-up. We used the map generator to depict 32 (2 (5)) different states and highlight the most important transitions between the 1, 024 (32 (2)) possible states in the weighted directed network. At baseline, we found the largest fraction (19. 3 %) of all individuals free of any MetS <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and identified hypertension (15. 4 %) and central obesity (6. 3 %), {{as well as their}} combination (19. 0 %), as the most common MetS <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Analyzing <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> flow over the five-year follow-up, we found that most individuals remained in their <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> state and that low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) (6. 3 %) was the most prominent additional <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> beyond hypertension and central obesity.

The present study examined the relationship of sociodemographic <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> to individual maternal and child outcomes as well as to composite measure of maternal and child well-being. Multiple statistical models were used to examine (a) the association of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> and outcomes (b) the independent predictive power of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> on the development of outcomes (c) the predictive power of the number of present <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> on the development of outcomes, and (d) whether effects of <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> on outcomes were moderated by other <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> Results showed that several <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> were associated with outcomes, however did not independently predict the outcomes, indicating that home visiting programs shown to affect specific outcomes should be targeted to families with <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> that independently predict those outcomes and more broad-based home visiting programs should be targeted to families with <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> that independently predict composite measures of well-being. Furthermore, certain outcomes were not independently predicted by a single <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> but were predicted by the number of present <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> indicating that programs seeking to change these outcomes should use cumulative risk models to select families.

40|$|For some diseases, {{there has}} been {{controversy}} about whether key <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> are related linearly to the occurrence of disease events. This issue {{has important implications for}} strategies to modify <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> since nonlinear threshold or J-curve associations imply that <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> modification is not beneficial beyond a certain level. This paper considers whether nonlinear <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> associations can arise spuriously from selection mech-anisms common in prospective cohort studies. Using theory, simulation, and cohort data, the authors show that selecting individuals based on their prior disease status leads to the primary <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> being negatively con-founded with other residual <b>risk</b> <b>factors.</b> If this confounding combines with effect modification between the primary and residual <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> as exists in cardiovascular disease, then the aggregate effect is nonlinear distortion of the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> relation. Such distortion can produce an apparent threshold or J-curve relation, even if the true un-derlying relation is linear. The authors conclude that nonlinear <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> associations observed in primary or secondary prevention cohorts should be interpreted with caution because they may be consistent with an un-derlying linear lower-is-better relation. Randomized studies provide an important complement to prospective cohort studies when choosing between intensive and moderate <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> modification strategies in high-risk populations. bias (epidemiology); cardiovascular diseases; confounding factors (epidemiology); effect modifiers (epidemiology); incidence; primary prevention; <b>risk</b> <b>factor...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{traditional}} Kaplan-Meier or Cox regression analysis, {{usually a}} <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> measured at baseline {{is related to}} mortality thereafter. During follow-up, however, things may change: either {{the effect of a}} fixed baseline <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> may vary over time, resulting in a weakening or strengthening of associations over time, or the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> itself may vary over time. In this paper, short-term versus long-term effects (so-called time-dependent effects) of a fixed baseline <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> are addressed. An example is presented showing that underweight is a strong <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for mortality in dialysis patients, especially in the short run. In contrast, overweight is a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for mortality, which is stronger in the long run than in the short run. In addition, the analysis of how time-varying <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> (so-called time-dependent <b>risk</b> <b>factors)</b> are related to mortality is demonstrated by paying attention to the pitfall of adjusting for sequelae. The proper analysis of effects over time should be driven by a clear research question. Both kinds of research questions, that is those of time-dependent effects as well those of time-dependent <b>risk</b> <b>factors,</b> can be analyzed with time-dependent Cox regression analysis. It will be shown that using time-dependent <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> usually implies focusing on short-term effects onl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Microsimulation {{models are}} an {{important}} tool for estimating the comparative effectiveness of interventions through prediction of individual-level disease outcomes for a hypothetical population. To estimate the effectiveness of interventions targeted toward high risk groups, the mechanism by which <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> influence {{the natural history of}} disease must be specified. We propose a method for evaluating these <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> assumptions as part of model-building. Methods We used simulation studies to examine the impact of <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> assumptions on the relative rate (RR) of colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality for a cohort with a <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> compared to a cohort without the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> using an extension of the CRC-SPIN model for colorectal cancer. We also compared the impact of changing age at initiation of screening colonoscopy for different risk mechanisms. Results Across CRC-specific <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> mechanisms, the RR of CRC incidence and mortality decreased (towards one) with increasing age. The rate of change in RRs across age groups depended on both the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> mechanism and the strength of the <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> effect. Increased non-CRC mortality attenuated the effect of CRC-specific <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> on the RR of CRC when both were present. For each <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> mechanism, earlier initiation of screening resulted in more life years gained, though the magnitude of life years gained varied across risk mechanisms. Conclusions Simulation studies can provide insight into both the effect of <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> assumptions on model predictions and the type of data needed to calibrate <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> models. </p...|$|R
