Nutt's teams were noted {{for a series of}} {{overtime}} games, including the two longest overtime games in NCAA history. Off the field, some of Nutt's players were named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll 145 times and he has established a reputation as a responsible coach academically. Nutt received some criticism for a SEC win-loss record that was just barely over [...]500 and because he calls his own offensive plays during a game instead of relying on an offensive coordinator. In his first six seasons, Nutt led the team to a bowl game each year and averaged eight wins per season.|$|E

We introduced the stacked CdTe detector and multi-channel readout ASIC to achieve both <b>high</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> resolution for <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> gamma-ray. Our measurement showed that stacked CdTe detector had the energy resolution of about 1. 5 % for 662 keV gamma-ray <b>and</b> <b>higher</b> sensitivity as expected.

Whereas, the weight of heart (per cent of body weight) was found to be significantly lower in low energy diet with 40  mg/kg of CoQ 10 supplementation <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> diet at 20  mg/kg of CoQ 10 in diet over the respective unsupplemented groups. The abdominal fat percentage was significantly reduced by the CoQ 10 supplementation at 40  mg/ kg in both normal <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> but not in low energy diet fed birds. CoQ 10 supplementation at 20  mg/kg {{did not affect}} the abdominal fat percentage. The reduction in the abdominal fat at 40  mg of CoQ 10 /kg in normal <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> diet might have been due to the better utilization of energy for muscle growth, however, the performance in terms of body weight gain nor feed efficiency were not significantly better in their groups. The intestinal length (cm) expressed as per kg body weight was significantly lower in normal energy group supplemented with 20 and 40  mg CoQ 10 /kg of diet but the length was not affected by both the levels of CoQ 10 in low <b>and</b> <b>high</b> <b>energy</b> groups. No reason could be assigned for reduction in intestinal length in normal energy diet supplemented with CoQ 10.
