25|$|The key patents {{having to}} do with natural gas {{liquefaction}} were in 1915 and the mid-1930s. In 1915 Godfrey Cabot patented a method for storing liquid gases at very low temperatures. It consisted of a Thermos bottle type design which included a cold <b>inner</b> <b>tank</b> within an outer tank; the tanks being separated by insulation. In 1937 Lee Twomey received patents for a process for large scale liquefaction of natural gas. The intention was to store natural gas as a liquid so it could be used for shaving peak energy loads during cold snaps. Because of large volumes it is not practical to store natural gas, as a gas, near atmospheric pressure. However, if it can be liquefied it can be stored in a volume 600 times smaller. This is a practical way to store it but the gas must be stored at −260°F (−162°C).|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} apparatus adapted to feed liquids by gas pressure. One important use of my invention is {{in connection with}} rocket craft or other air-craft in which two liquids, such as gasoline and liquid oxygen, are to be fed at high pressure to a combustion chamber. It is the general object of my invention to provide improved liquid-feeding apparatus for such use and for other similar purposes, which is apparatus is extremely light in weight and which will supply two or more different liquids under pressure in a safe and reliable manner. I further provide improved means by which a substantially constant gas pressure may be maintained as the tanks are gradually emptied. More specifically, my invention relates to the provision of liquid feeding apparatus comprising a light but strong and rigid outer metal casing and a plurality of flexible and collapsible <b>inner</b> <b>tanks</b> which are enclosed by said outer casing and which are adapted to store and deliver different kinds of liquids, such as gasoline and liquid oxygen. I also provide means for ejecting the liquids from the <b>inner</b> <b>tanks</b> by gas pressure exerted {{on the outside of}} said tanks, which gas pressure may be much higher than could be previously used in direct contact with cold liquids. Another feature of the invention relates to means for precooling the oxygen tank and its connections before the tanks are filled. [URL]...|$|R

5000|$|A {{bell prover}} (commonly {{referred}} to in the industry as a [...] "bell") consists of a vertical <b>inner</b> <b>tank</b> surrounded by an outer shell. A space between the <b>inner</b> <b>tank</b> and outer shell is filled with a sealing liquid, usually oil. An inverted tank, called the bell, is placed over the <b>inner</b> <b>tank.</b> The liquid provides an air-tight seal. Bell provers are typically counterweighted to provide positive pressure through a hose and valve connected to a meter. Sometimes rollers or guides are installed on the moving part of the bell which allows for smooth linear movement without the potential for immeasurable pressure differentials caused by the bell rocking back or forth.|$|E

40|$|We {{report an}} {{experimental}} study of the decay of grid-generated turbulence in a confined geometry submitted to a global rotation. Turbulence is generated by rapidly towing a grid in a parallelepipedic water tank. The velocity fields {{of a large number}} of independent decays are measured in a vertical plane parallel to the rotation axis using a corotating particle image velocimetry system. We first show that, when a "simple" grid is used, a significant amount of the kinetic energy (typically 50 %) is stored in a reproducible flow composed of resonant inertial modes. The spatial structure of those inertial modes, extracted by band-pass filtering, is found compatible with the numerical results of L. R. M. Maas [Fluid Dyn. Res. 33, 373 (2003) ]. The possible coupling between these modes and turbulence suggests that turbulence cannot be considered as freely decaying in this configuration. We demonstrate however that these inertial modes may be significantly reduced (down to 15 % of the total energy) by adding a set of <b>inner</b> <b>tanks</b> attached to the grid. These results suggest that it is possible to produce an effectively freely decaying rotating turbulence in a confined geometry. (c) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

50|$|On top {{of every}} closed milk cooling tank is a manhole of about 40 {{centimetres}} diameter. This enables thorough cleaning and {{inspection of the}} <b>inner</b> <b>tank</b> if necessary.

5000|$|Both {{telescoping}} types use the manometric {{property of}} water to provide a seal. The whole tank floats in a circular or annular water reservoir, held up by the roughly constant pressure of a varying volume of gas, the pressure determined {{by the weight of}} the structure, and the water providing the seal for the gas within the moving walls. Besides storing the gas, the tank's design serves to establish the pressure of the gas system. With telescoping (multiple-lift) tanks, the innermost tank has a ~1 ft wide by 2 ft high (30x60 cm) lip around the outside of the bottom edge, called a cup, which picks up water as it rises above the reservoir water level. This immediately engages a downward lip on the inner rim of the next outer lift, called a dip or grip, and as this grip sinks into the cup, it preserves the water seal as the <b>inner</b> <b>tank</b> continues to rise until the grip grounds on the cup, whereupon further injection of gas will start to raise that lift as well. Holders were built with as many as four lifts. An extra flying lift could be retrofitted into column or frame gas holders. This was an additional <b>inner</b> <b>tank</b> that extended above the standards, when the infrastructure would support the extra shear forces and weight. Though not exclusively, spiral guides were used.|$|E

Long-term performance prediction based on testing results according to EN 12977 - 3 : 2012, showed how an increased active volume of the heat exchanger enhances the energy available for space heating, although it may decrease solar collector thermal performance and increase the energy losses of the combistore. Long-term performance prediction based on testing results according to EN 12977 - 4 : 2012, considering a lower heat loss coefficient since a better insulation of the combistore is expected in future prototypes, showed fsav values for Davos and Wurzburg of 39. 3 % and 25. 3 %, respectively...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{differentiate}} the relatively weak signature of trace gases from the background radiation in the atmosphere, CLAES {{had to have}} high resolution and sensitivity. To achieve this, the instrument combined a telescope with an infrared spectrometer. The whole instrument was cryogenically cooled to keep heat from the instrument from interfering with the readings. The cryogenics system consisted of an <b>inner</b> <b>tank</b> of solid neon at −257 °C (−430 °F) and an outer tank of solid carbon dioxide at −150 °C (−238 °F). As the neon and carbon dioxide evaporated, they kept the instrument cool for a planned 19 months. The final cryogens evaporated from the instrument on May 5, 1993 and the instrument warmed up, ending its useful life.|$|E

50|$|The problem {{most often}} cited by western analysts is {{the design of}} the main fuel tank. Due to the low profile of the vehicle, the {{designers}} have had to place the fuel tank between the two rows of outward-facing seats, meaning that the infantrymen sit very close to the bulk of the vehicle's fuel storage; extra fuel is carried in the hollow armored rear doors. Therefore, a hit by an armor-piercing incendiary round would set the fuel contained there (especially, if kerosene is used instead of diesel), on fire. The burning fuel would move into the crew compartment, resulting in the death or injury to the infantrymen (if they are unable to leave the vehicle via the roof hatches), and a possible explosion. However, the rear door tanks are almost always empty when the BMP goes into combat, as they are only meant to increase the road travel range of the vehicle. In intense war areas where the BMP sees action often, and it is relatively near to its base of operations, instructions highly recommend detaching the rear door tanks from the fuel system, filling them with sand as additional protection for the troop compartment, and adding fuel to the internal main fuel tank from other sources when the need arises. This was not practiced by some BMP-1s crews during a number of local conflicts, e.g., in Chechnya, which resulted in frequent attempts by the enemy to hit the rear doors of the BMP-1s. The <b>inner</b> fuel <b>tank</b> is more vulnerable than that of many modern IFVs - the thin side armor means that penetration is likely to occur to the <b>inner</b> fuel <b>tank</b> as well.|$|R

5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case the pilot was incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the <b>inner</b> fuel <b>tanks,</b> closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. The pilot was alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|R
