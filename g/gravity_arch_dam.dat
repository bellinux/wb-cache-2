This behavior is usually simulated by means 3 -D Finite Elements with several layers across the dam thickness. Due to limited experienced existing {{for this type}} of dams a set of preliminary formulae have been obtained in order to compute the key parameters of the design definition, such as the slopes of upstream and the downstream faces of the dam, radius of the upper arch, with of the dam at the top level, etc. The methodology used to find the formulae consist in assuming a quadrilateral cross section for the valley where the dam will be located. The values to define the valley geometry are given as data. From these data and the concrete material properties, an <b>arch</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> supporting a set of loadings combinations can automatically be designed with a minimum weight. In the analysis of this design the obtained stresses should be layed between some specified admissible limits.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} analyze the main {{critical}} engineering factors, an information-based rough set approach that considers conditional information entropy as a measurement of information has been developed. An algorithm for continuous attribute discretization based on conditional information entropy and an algorithm for rule extraction considering the supports of rules are proposed. The initial decision system is established by collecting enough monitoring data. Then, the continuous attributes are discretized, and the condition attributes are reduced. Finally, the rules that indicate the action law of the main factors are extracted {{and the results are}} explained. By applying this approach to a crack in an <b>arch</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>dam,</b> it can be concluded that the water level and the temperature are the main factors affecting the crack opening, and there is a negative correlation between the crack opening and the temperature. This conclusion corresponds with the observation that cracks in most concrete dams are influenced mainly by water level and temperature, and the influence of temperature is more evident...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{boundary}} {{conditions in the}} construction and operation phases of a concrete <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> are always complex. After sealing, differences between the <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> temperature and its sealing temperature can cause compressive or tensile stresses.

A finite element model is implemented with the concern of the construction phase and operation phase of the <b>arch</b> <b>dam.</b> Results confirm good agreement with the measured temperature and verify the conjecture that the TRP occurs mainly because the external temperature of the <b>arch</b> <b>dam</b> is higher than its sealing temperature...|$|R
40|$|Deep seated {{landslides}} from massive rock slope failure {{are poorly}} understood and need be further investigated. The objective {{should be to}} gain the necessary confidence for predicting the likely behavior, assess the risk associated, and develop robust recommendations based on the instability scenarios which can be anticipated. This {{is to be done}} in view of the many complexities involved which encompass the understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the initial and post-failure behavior, and the different secondary processes resulting from instability. This paper shows that by using advanced numerical modeling methods such as the combined finite-discrete element method (FDEM), one is in position to contribute to such an understanding. To illustrate the potential of the FDEM in the simulation of typical instabilities, the Beauregard landslide, located in the Aosta Valley (NW Italian Alps), is taken as a case study.
