40|$|The {{discovery}} of the Alps {{in the second half}} of the eighteenth century spawned an aesthetics of sublimity that enabled overwhelmed beholders of mountains to overcome their confusion symbolically by transforming initial speechlessness into pictures and words. When travelers ceased to be content with beholding mountains, however, and began climbing them, the sublime shudder turned into something else. In the snowy heights, all attempts to master symbolically the challenging landscape was thwarted by vertigo, somnolence, and fatigue. After 1850, physiologists intervened, using the Alpine terrain as a laboratory landscape that was ideally suited to examine one of the most threatening concerns of fin de siècle <b>industrial</b> societies: <b>fatigue.</b> This essay examines how the picturesque voyage turned into an experimental physiology of fatigue, and how the "wordless subjectivity” of romantic travelers turned into the "wordless objectivity” of life scientist...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion fatigue (CF) {{is defined}} as the {{sequential}} stages of metal damage that evolve with accumulated load cycling, in an aggressive environment, and resulting from the interaction of irreversible cyclic plastic deformation with localized chemical or electrochemical reactions. The pitting fatigue corrosion (PFC) is a part of CF that studies the influence of fatigue and aggressive environment on pit creations and crack generation and propagation, up to catastrophic failure. It appears then evident the need to know and understand all phenomena that are involved in pit formation and growth in presence of both an aggressive environment and a cyclic load.

However, there are well known deficiencies of the conventional approach.

Here we follow up, through comparisons with experimental data from many sources, on a new approach to empirical fatigue life estimation (A Constructive Empirical Theory for Metal Fatigue Under Block Cyclic Loading', Proceedings of the Royal Society A, in press). The basic modeling approach is first described: it depends on enforcing mathematical consistency between predictions of simple empirical models that include indeterminate functional forms, and published fatigue data from handbooks. This consistency is enforced through setting up and (with luck) solving a functional equation with three independent variables and six unknown functions. The model, after eliminating or identifying various parameters, retains three fitted parameters; for the experimental data available, one of these may be set to zero. On comparison against data from several different sources, with two fitted parameters, we find that our model works about as well as the DLDR and much better than Miner's rule. We finally discuss some ways in which the model might be used, beyond the scope of the DLDR...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the emergence of ‘industrial fatigue’ {{as an object of}} medico-scientific enquiry and social anxiety in early-twentieth-century Britain. Between 1900 and 1918, <b>industrial</b> <b>fatigue</b> research became the basis of a new science of work, which I term ‘industrial physiology’. Drawing on François Guéry and Didier Deleule, I argue that industrial physiology is best understood as a science of ‘the productive body’. The worker was an object for medico-scientific intervention only insofar as they represented a constituent part of the machinery of industrial labour, while the individual body was, in turn, reimagined as a productive system in microcosm. In this context, industrial fatigue—defined as diminished capacity for productive work—emerged as the emblematic pathology of industrial civilisation. By 1918, it had become the central category in the scientific articulation of a conception of the body in which health was equated squarely with productive capacity...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the use of}} {{nitrogen}} or carbon as alloying elements in plasma diffusion treatment of TiAl 6 V 4 is beneficial for the load-supporting properties of the base material. The plasma diffusion treatment produces a compound layer consisting of nitrides or carbides and an inner diffusion zone, essentially characterized by the presence of nitrogen- or carbon-rich alpha-Ti crystals which are embedded in the metal matrix. This results in a hardness gradient from the interior to the surface. To avoid hydrogen embrittlement, plasma nitriding is performed in a pure nitrogen atmosphere. The formation of soot by carburizing could be avoided by optimizing the carbon flow during plasma carburizing. The influence of plasma nitriding and carburizing on the adhesion of the TiC coating depends on the plasma diffusion pretreatment and the conditions of the TiC coating. Plasma-nitrocarburizing pretreatment leads to the best adhesion of the TiC coating; the critical load of failure is 80 % higher than in the case of TiC on base material. A critical load of approximately 33 N was found under the optimum parameters. We conclude that the combination of plasma diffusion treatment and TiC coating extends the tribological applicability of TiAl 6 V 4 in many <b>industrial</b> sectors.

A coating of hemocompatible carbon film covers all the exposed, nonbiological surfaces. Optimal preservation of collagen and graft cells is achieved by fresh tissue glutaraldehyde fixation and cusp shaping without mold. Accelerated fatigue testing showed a duration of over 150 million cycles, a figure much higher than that observed when current pericardial and porcine valves were tested with the same apparatus. Results of long-term (greater than 7 months, average 10. 5) implantation in 20 sheep (13 mitral, 7 tricuspid) disclosed no case of mechanical failure, mild to moderate primary calcification in older explants, and significant fibrous tissue overgrowth only in the tricuspid position. Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed collagen and elastic fiber integrity, no significant plasma protein insudation, and well-preserved graft cells.

40|$|Mankind’s {{constant}} {{pursuit of}} knowledge founded on innovation and creativity {{has led to}} a more complex world. A world governed by structures stretching high into the skies, objects flying faster than the speed of sound and exploration of the stars. These advancements have manifested in structures with complex geometrical designs, new building and engineering materials and the need for constant structural health monitoring (SHM). Structures comprising of a handful of components to those enlisting thousands are not impervious to failure. The ‘perfect’ material, one that will never fail, does not exist and may never. The need to remove the possibility of failure from the ever growing list of materials, components and structures has never been greater. There is an abundance of well suited techniques for a myriad of engineering problems, all suited for individual problem areas but all suffering from different weaknesses. There is no complete solution, only partial, short-lived solutions which are eclipsed by the next. The objective of this PhD is to explore a new and interesting non-destructive testing and evaluation (NDT/E) technique; nonlinear ultrasound. The work looks at assessment of both metallic and composite structures. As of recently, the technique has become well studied and documented, which has highlighted the associated benefits. Theoretically it builds on the fundamental theories of ultrasound testing techniques, but provides solutions that have amplified sensitivity in early damage detection. The techniques follow the main principle that the excitation of damaged regions results in clapping/rubbing mechanisms that give rise to further harmonic production, these further harmonics can be correlated to damage. Nonlinear ultrasound techniques were used to assess various systems that are prone to failure, these systems included adhesively bonded structures, bolted structures, structures susceptible to fatigue, compression loaded structures and impact damage of a composite plate. A series of experiments were undertaken which evaluated the ability of novel nonlinear ultrasound techniques to detect damage within these systems. Initially the primary principles of nonlinear ultrasound techniques those that affect the accuracy and repeatability of these methods were explored. The effects of hysteresis, input and output voltages of piezoelectric transducers (PZTs), modal analysis, and various nonlinear parameters were evaluated. This allowed for a clear understanding of what factors affect the accurate generation of data from these techniques. After determining various influences on results, adhesive and bolted joints were evaluated. With the aim to determine accurate nonlinear techniques that would be able to assess kissing bonds in metallic and composite joints, cracks in loaded structures and the loosened state of an individual bolt. A novel frequency specific nonlinear acoustic moment method was used to evaluate the presence of kissing bonds. The acoustic moment experiments provided good kissing bond detection probability in both metallic and composite joints. Further experiments explored the effects of structurally loading on the production of nonlinear responses. The results provided valuable insight into the potential for these techniques to assess defects in loaded structures. Thus kissing bond detection as well as the loaded state of the structure was possible using the nonlinear acoustic moment method developed. Joints account for a large proportion of mechanical and engineering structures, robust evaluation techniques would provide great savings in terms of maintenance, complete failure and lifetime service costs. The main finding was the ability to measure the loosened state of an individual bolt. Individual bolt loosened state was possible by using only two PZTs while assessing a system which included four bolts. This piece of research provides significant advancement in SHM of these structures, which has implications for small and large scale <b>industrial</b> joints. <b>Fatigue</b> failure is the most prominent failure mechanism in metallic structures, an investigation into a baseline-free method using nonlinear ultrasound was undertaken. A fatigued component was examined over its useful life using a modulated nonlinear ultrasound technique, where the development of a nonlinear ultrasound theory was used to assess the residual fatigue life by comparing the nonlinear modulated response to a theoretical model. Findings showed good correlation between the theoretical and experimental results, paving the way for further studies of baseline-free methods. A baseline-free testing method would provide a great leap forward in current testing procedures; the work highlights the potential of such methods. Further studies explored the possibility of using a computational model to predict damage levels in a material from a measured experimental nonlinear parameter. The findings of this research found good correlation between the second harmonic measured experimentally and that of the computational model. A novel nonlinear ultrasound based thermosonic technique was developed using a dual frequency excitation method. The investigation looked at determining barely visible impact damage (BVID) of a composite plate. The speed and accuracy of the method provided many advantages over current testing methods, which can be slow and deliver inconsistent results. The research relied on the determination of damage-specific resonance frequencies (DSRF), which results in focused heating at the damaged zones. The methodology explored could be used in an autonomous setup which would provide rapid assessment of composites and higher probability of damage detection. Finally the nonlinear ultrasound research completed establishes the broad range of applications for these techniques. The ease of adaptability of the techniques from metallic to composite, loaded and unloaded structures and their ability to improve other NDT/E techniques shows the great potential of nonlinear ultrasound. Through methodical application of the various nonlinear ultrasound techniques to other SHM problems there is a great degree of certainty that these methods would provide further benefits...|$|R

While simulated driving tasks are sensitive, and simple performance tasks have been used in <b>industrial</b> <b>fatigue</b> management systems (FMS) to quantify risk, {{little is known about the}} relationship between such measures. Establishing a simple, on-road measure of fatigue, as a fitness-to-drive tool, is an important issue for road safety and accident prevention, particularly as many fatigue related accidents are preventable. This study aimed to measure fatigue-related performance decrements using a simple task (reaction time - RT) and a complex task (driving simulation), and to determine the potential for a link between such measures, thus improving FMS success. Fifteen volunteer participants (7 m, 8 f) aged 22 - 56 years (mean 33. 6 years), underwent 26 h of supervised wakefulness before an 8 h recovery sleep opportunity. Participants were tested using a 30 -min interactive driving simulation test, bracketed by a 10 -min psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) at 4, 8, 18 and 24 h of wakefulness, and following recovery sleep. Extended wakefulness caused significant decrements in PVT and driving performance. Although these measures are clearly linked, our analyses suggest that driving simulation cannot be replaced by a simple PVT. Further research is needed to closely examine links between performance measures, and to facilitate accurate management of fitness to drive, which requires more complex assessments of performance than RT alone.

40|$|Fatigue is a {{physiological}} phenomenon which has three processes, i. e., it is generated and developed by {{doing an activity}} such as work, learning or sport, and is recovered by rest or sleep taken after the activity. However, previous studies on workers' fatigue in Japan have inclined to make clear the former two fatigue processes of generation and development, resulting in neglect of the third process of recovery. In the present paper the author stressed that studies on workers' fatigue in Japan must attach importance to its recovering process for future improvement of the studies. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part the author criticized the study method of workers' fatigue prevailing in Japan which was proposed by the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Fatigue</b> Research Committee of the Japan Association of Industrial Health in the 1950 s. Based on the criticism, the author proposed a new concept of workers' fatigue, and indicated two specific issues {{to be considered in}} study methods of workers' fatigue, which human biological fatigue studies do not involve. The first issue is that workers' fatigue is of special significance in its effect upon their private, family or social lives which will be done after work. And the second one is that such study method should include fatigue assessment on whether workers examined in a fatigue survey are over-fatigued or not. The author insisted that an essential criterion for the fatigue assessment should be Recoverability, i. e., that human fatigue can be recovered by sleep every night or by rest and sleep on weekend holidays. Thus an over-fatigued condition is defined as contrary to the criterion of recoverability. The second part of the present paper contained how to make fatigue assessment from a viewpoint of the recovery of fatigue, based on results of two field surveys. In the first survey on interview it was examined whether 17 day workers attacked by fatal cardiovascular or cerebrovascular injuries had been over-fatigued in the 3 -month period prior to the attack. The results of the survey showed that two thirds of the attacked workers had unusually behaved showing strong demands for sleep in order to recover from their fatigue due to work. It was suggested that these workers had been explicitly over-fatigued. Further, one third of the attacked workers had demonstrated behavior showing the lack of energy, often accompanied with complaints of sleep shortage at home. These workers had obviously been in a state of extreme exhaustion. The second survey concerned a fatigue assessment on 25 electronics workers working in a permanent night work system. The work ?system consists of three consecutive 12 hr night shifts without any nap followed by four consecutive days-off. The results of the survey showed that on the straight off-duty days, the workers tended to have a longer night sleep as the first night shift approached, the longest on the last day. Time for both home and outdoor activities of the workers was markedly shortened in the daytime between two night shifts. These results suggested that the permanent night system is disadvantageous hampering the workers' daily activity needs. In the third part of the paper included were results of two experimental studies on a relationship between two fatigue processes of development and recovery. In these experiments, the development of fatigue was defined as a decrease in cerebral arousal level during wakefulness, which was manifested by high scores of the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, those of the Fatigue Feeling Scale which was proposed by the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Fatigue</b> Research Committee of the Japan Society for Occupational Health, or decreases of Critical Fusion Frequencies. The recovery of fatigue was considered as an increase in duration of stage 4 sleep (S 4) or Slow Wave Sleep (SWS) in sleep taken during a sleeping period. The first experiment examined relations between the two processes under the condition in which a cycle of 22 hr-wake and 8 hr-sleep was repeated four times. In the second experiment, the effects of three nocturnal nap conditions of no nap, a 1 hr nap and a 2 hr nap on the cerebral arousal level during subsequent morning hours were compared. The results of the two experiments showed that a decrease in the cerebral arousal level during wakefulness and an increase in duration of S 4 or SWS in sleep were not related to each other in prior wakefulness of approximately 20 hr...|$|E
40|$|Oil and gas fields {{located in}} {{offshore}} are today being developed in even harsher and more challenging environments {{than anyone had}} thought of before. New designs, technologies, regulations and requirements have been developed and implemented along with these changes. As {{a result of these}} harsh conditions, the offshore structures will experience a lot of challenges in terms of design and maintenance integrity. One of the most important concerns is the wave loadings which are critical on offshore structures in these environments due to their cyclic behaviour over time. The structures considered in this thesis are pipe lines, which are influenced by wave loadings. The wave loadings considered in this thesis are high cyclic loadings, which will accumulate damages on structures and then lead to fatigue failures. These failures are a result of a combination of the stress amplitudes and the number of cycles. ASME B 31. 3 is the piping code that is utilized in design of most offshore process piping systems. But due to its lack of information about high cyclic fatigue failures, other codes need to be considered on this matter. There are different specifications which address fatigue failures, and the code used in this thesis is PD 5500 British standard specification. This is used as a reference approach to estimate fatigue life. As an experiment there are two different other approaches discussed. One is covering the fatigue by calculating equivalent stress range and the other is covering the fatigue by assuming that a probability density function of stress range may be represented by a two parameter Weibull distribution. Examples from the Eldfisk and the Snorre fields have used for explanations of above given approaches. One has been the bridge piping on the Eldfisk field and the other one has been the flow line on the Snorre A field. The approach given in the PD 5500 specification and the equivalent stress range approach gives the same results for the fatigue life estimation, but the third approach which assumed a two parameter Weibull distribution of stress range, gives a different result than the other two. The equivalent stress range approach can be proven analytically, but hasn’t proven earlier to be used with the two slopes SN curves. The thesis is discussed about the feasibility of using the equivalent stress range approach as another way of high cyclic fatigue assessment. This approach can be suitable to use in the <b>industrial</b> <b>fatigue</b> analyses but not the third approach. Fatigue damages on offshore topside piping systems in the North Sea have been evaluated by using the above examples and it has identified that more than 80 % of the fatigue damages happened at the wave heights between 2 m to 8 m...|$|E
40|$|Dans l'entreprise moderne s'établissent forcément certaines {{relations}} entre l'entreprise elle-même et ses membres d'une part et {{le public}} d'autre part. Elles sont communément appelées « Public Relations » et « Human Relations ». Dans cet article l'auteur explique les origines et le développement des unes et des autres. A cause des éléments psychologiques sur lesquels elles reposent, ces relations ont de nombreuses sphères d'interaction et sont appelées à se compléter. Le travailleur étant un être humain doué d'intelligence mérite à juste titre d'être commandé dans l'industrie non par crainte mais par persuasion. Cette persuasion est réalisable au moyen de l'information « descendante » et de l'information « ascendante ». Pour mettre en application ces méthodes renouvelées, il faut faire appel aux sciences sociales qui ont un rôle capital à jouer dans ce domaine. In modem business, certain relations become necessarily established between the enterprise itself {{and all its}} members, on one hand, and the public, on the other hand. These are known as "Public Relations" and "Human Relations". Based on psychological factors, they have many spheres of interaction and are even called on to complete each other. It is interesting to study them successively, and to attempt to form a synthesis. "Public Relations"The beginning of "Public Relations" in the United States {{is due to the}} fact that the American enterprises were threatened in their very existence by what was essentially a crisis of progress. This threat consisted of a very severe antitrust legislation which originated and can be explained in the economic changes which took place in the United States right after the War of Secession. From these economic changes, there arose a powerful movement towards the forming of trusts, mergers and large enterprises which tended necessarily toward a scattering of personal resources and to certain abuses. An opposition movement arose, which led to an extension of Federal powers over commerce and industry. The Sherman Act, voted in 1890, forbids all forms of collusion between enterprises which might affect free trading or lessen competition. The application of the Act is carried out by a specialized agent, the Federal Trade Commission. Faced with such a system, the large American enterprises were obliged to react, to find means of defence. As these anti-trust laws were based on public opinion, it was necessary to reach the public and give it complete and understandable information. Wherever, "Public Relations" programmes have been well carried out, the people's verdict has been favourable to the enterprises. This is easily explained, as by educating the public, they appealed to a very powerful sentiment in mankind: the pride that each individual feels when he has an intimate knowledge of someone or of an organization which has a certain authority. This is what "Public Relations" try to realize, to give each one the feeling that he is taking part in the life of the enterprise. In destroying the divisions which exist inside the enterprise by creating an exchange of ideas, the "Public Relations" increased production. By making the enterprise a name known and liked, they attracted the loyalty of buyers. By continually informing the shareholders they made of them a moral force which supported the enterprise's policy in a positive manner. Finally, by discussing openly all the problems of the enterprise, they reduced greatly the bitter character of certain social conflicts. With this conception, the American industrial leaders learned by the practice of "Public Relations" that virtue and interest go together, that moral values remain the basis of all the industrial activity. The techniques used to influence those outside depend on the information 1 methods available in each country. On the other hand, the techniques used to influence the personnel of the enterprise are fairly uniform and depend especially on the size of the enterprise. The large enterprise may find that the best ways of reaching the personnel are the Company newspaper, the booklet for new employees, information bulletins, films and conference cycles. Small enterprises have the advantage of being able to use the most efficient method: this is regular meetings where the workers and the management meet and talk over in a friendly way, as fellow-workers, everything concerning the life, the reverses and the success of the enterprise. The aim must always remain the same: fight anonymity which makes the enterprise remain a great unknown for its personnel; make the ties personal which bind the worker to the enterprise. In addition to appealing to the intelligence of the employees, we must also appeal to the workers feelings by means of "Human Relations". "Human Relation"The movement of human relations is at the same time, the result of the Scientific Organization of Labour movement and a reaction against it. The purely mechanical system perfected by F. W. Taylor, helps and at the same time, forces the worker to improve his efficiency. This too rational research' caused excesses and gave rise to two diseases up to this time unknown: <b>industrial</b> <b>fatigue</b> and monotony. Gradually a truth that had been long forgotten began to be noticed: that there is a close relationship between the benefits a man receives and his state of mind, between efficiency and psychology. The founder of the movement of "Human Relations" within Industry or of sociology applied to the enterprise is Elton Mayo, professor of the Harvard Business School. The first outline of the sociology of an enterprise came from a scientific study which has remained unequalled: what is called in t h e United States, the Western Electric Company experiment. The Company wished to isolate and measure the influence of different physical factors on the efficiency of the industrial worker. Average workers were picked out and put to work by separate, groups under different experimental conditions. Curiously, the experimental' conditions could be changed as much as was wanted and yet efficiency continued to improve. The results of the research work were confusing because beforehand it seemed as though there existed a relationship between lighting conditions and the output of the workers. Elton Mayo found the crux or the problem or the factor of which nobody had thought. During the research work, the whole relationship between persons and between groups of workers involved in the experiments had been fundamentally changed: their relations with their superiors, their relations between themselves, their relations with the other workers of the factory. In other words, during the experiment, the researchers had brought a revolutionary change to the usual methods of management. This change was so important that besides this, all the other physical changes remained without consequence and Elton Mayo decided to extend his experiment which over a period of twelve years eventually covered over 20, 000 workers representing many different nationalities and carrying out a very great variety of tasks. From this research is brought out the fundamental conclusion that among the motives that guide the worker in his task, the material motive is not the most important one. The efficiency of the worker depends in the final analysis on the satisfaction he feels in his relations with other men. The needs that he tries to satisfy most stubbornly are above all moral and psychological needs. Numerous inquiries carried on in other enterprises only confirmed the value of these findings. The "Human Relations" movement tries first of all to determine what needs the workers are trying to satisfy in their work. There are first of all individual needs and then social needs. In fact, the workers of the enterprise form, whether we like it or not, a live group and the relations of each individual to the group as well as the morale of the groups form the atmosphere in which work is carried on. The studies of Elton Mayo and George Lombard show that absenteeism and labour turnover in the large aeroplane factories in the United States were affected by the existence of these "informal" groups formed by the workers themselves in the factories; inside these groups are developed practices, traditions, and unwritten social code, a hierarchy of persons and values. The problem of changes is then not studied only in technical terms but also in taking into account their effects on the constitution and routine of the groups. If circumstances oblige the management to allow the technical point of view to take precedence, they will, nevertheless, take care to explain it to the workers in plausible terms and attempt to secure their cooperation. It is especially under the impetus of the last war, and the increase of unionism in the United States, that the movement of "Human Relations" was so widely extended. This movement of "Human Relations" re-appraises in psychological and sociological terms the entirety of working conditions. It tries to assure a better psychological formation of the framework of the enterprise. In each one of its stages, it is the result of a harmonious cooperation between industry and university and furnishes business men methods with which to carry out better their function of management. This is why the exercise of modern industrial management must be done at the same time by 'Public Relations" and "Human Relations". If we only use "Public Relations" we risk missing the crux of the problems which arise inside our enterprises and only look for superficial solutions. If we only use "Human Relations" we are hiding the light under the bushel and we fail in our greater duty to society. To "Public Relations", we must give emphasis, we must enrich them by the teachings of "Human Relations". Together, they have great value because they put the social problem in a framework in which it must be solved — inside the enterprise itself. We must substitute for management by tradition, management by persuasion. The first indispensable condition in applying this new conception of the function of the manager consists in creating inside the enterprise a system of communication. Each worker must know clearly and continually what he is doing, what place he occupies in the working of the factory and what place the factory occupies in the life of the community. This point is extremely important. The communication of certain results is desirable but not sufficient in itself, it is necessary at the same time to furnish a basis which permits them to be appreciated. This basis is furnished by the method which consists of comparing present results with past results, the results of the enterprise to those of the industry as a whole. The workers must understand in a general way the policies followed by the enterprise. Finally, the workers must know their managers. This is "downward" information, but management by persuasion supposes also that a current of communication exists from the bottom to the top in such a way that management realizes what the employees think and feel. "Public Relations" try hard to bring together management and workers in the enterprise by making the enterprise a being which the workers know intimately and in giving the simplest tasks a wider social sense. "Human Relations" try to bring management and workers together by making communications a bond running in both directions and bringing men together by their feelings as much as by their intelligence. It is clear that in this renewal of our methods of management the social sciences are called upon to play an important role. It is necessary for the social sciences to be brought out in the light of day and for this reason industry and the universities must cooperate...|$|E
