25|$|Testosterone is {{significantly}} correlated with aggression and competitive behaviour and is directly facilitated by the latter. There are two theories {{on the role of}} testosterone in aggression and competition. The first one <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> hypothesis which states that testosterone would increase during puberty thus facilitating reproductive and competitive behaviour which would include aggression. Thus it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of competition among males of the species that facilitates aggression and violence. Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance especially among the most violent criminals in prison who had the highest testosterone levels. The same research also found fathers (those outside competitive environments) had the lowest testosterone levels compared to other males.|$|E
25|$|A further {{difficulty}} is {{presented by the}} shortage of trained health-care workers for tuberculosis control. CDC facilities are being rebuilt across the country but many are staffed inadequately or by poorly trained and unmotivated health-care workers. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of sustaining and further increasing long-term governmental commitment to the control of tuberculosis, which is essential to tackle the other challenges.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{lingering}} geopolitical crises stemming from British colonialism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> to Pashtun society {{posed by the}} Durand Line, the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan demarcated by the British, which dissects the traditional tribal territory of the Pashtuns. The severing of their tribal lands is viewed by Pashtun leaders {{as a threat to}} their dominance within Afghanistan, emboldening rival ethnic tribes, and has provoked cross-border tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. While having significant political, economic and social impact on Afghanistan, the intervention of the Soviet Union (1979–89), Afghan Civil War (1989–96), Taliban Regime (1996–2001) and United States invasion and occupation (2001–present) have not noticeably disrupted the primacy of ethnic tribal authority, and thus the power and influence of warlords, in ordering Afghan society. Although the United States and its coalition allies have expended a considerable amount of time, effort and resources attempting to foment the centralization of government and consolidation of power in the state with its seat of power in Kabul l, tribal warlords continue to maintain political influence and power throughout the country outside of Kabul.|$|E

25|$|Like Rugby union, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland all field {{separate}} teams Rugby league sides. Overall rugby {{league is}} a smaller sport than rugby union in the United Kingdom, but it draws healthy crowds in its heartlands in Yorkshire and North West England, and is popular with armchair sports fans nationwide. The top level league is Super League, which expanded to 14teams for the 2009 season, but {{was reduced to}} 12teams {{with the end of}} licensing and a reorganisation of the professional leagues in 2015. As of the current 2017 season, 11of the teams are in the heartlands, with French side Catalans Dragons being the exception. Before the 2015 reorganisation, London Broncos competed in Super League. Below this level are the Championship and League 1 (historically the National Leagues); French side Toulouse Olympique competed in the Championship from 2009 through to 2011, returned to British rugby league in 2016 in League 1, and earned promotion to the Championship for the 2017 season. The 2017 Championship involves 12teams, with 10 from the heartlands plus the London Broncos and Toulouse Olympique. In 2017, League 1 has 16teams (up from 10 in the recent past), but only eight are from the heartlands, with five scattered through the remainder of England, two from Wales, and one from Canada in the debuting Toronto Wolfpack. The Wolfpack won the 2017 League 1 title and will play in the Championship in 2018. Until 2008, automatic promotion and relegation existed between Super League and the Championship when it was replaced by three-year licences for clubs to play in the former. Promotion and relegation returned to Super League and the Championship in 2015. The main knock-out competition <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Challenge</b> Cup, which also includes clubs from France and Canada, and in the past has also included clubs from Russia.|$|E
500|$|Tech writer Bruce Sterling commented in 2007 {{that using}} Twitter for [...] "literate communication" [...] is [...] "about {{as likely as}} firing up a CB radio and hearing some guy recite the Iliad". In September 2008, the {{journalist}} Clive Thompson mused in a New York Times Magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into [...] "a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating {{and ought to be}} shared with the world". One of the earliest documented forms of celebrity-related Twitter-like disclosures dates from 1980, when real estate mogul William Desmond Ryan made round-the-clock press releases about his relationship with comedian Phyllis Diller, even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis. Conversely, Vancouver Sun columnist Steve Dotto opined that part of Twitter's appeal <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints, and Jonathan Zittrain, professor of Internet law at Harvard Law School, said that [...] "the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fischer is {{a proponent}} of interreligious {{dialogue}} between the worlds' religions, stating: [...] "I feel that in our period it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of religious traditions {{to do something more}} than simply reassert and reinterpret their faiths, hoping for loyal adherents to what they perceive to be the true doctrine. Looking back at the last century, with its devastating wars and holocausts and the shock of ecological vulnerability, I have the sense that religious traditions must now have a wider mission, and it is in the recognition of this mission, I believe, that interreligious dialogue becomes something not only polite and interesting, but also essential."He currently sits on the Board of World Religious Leaders for the Elijah Interfaith Institute, an interreligious dialogue organization. In July 1996, he attended a five-day meeting between members of different religions held at The Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani in Trappist, Kentucky, where he gave a talk about Dogen, zazen, and the importance of religions coming together—despite their different philosophies—to serve humanity. Fischer has participated in interreligious pilgrimages with Father Laurence Freeman OSB and the Dalai Lama.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Apatow {{served as}} {{producer}} for the biblical comedy film Year one, starring Jack Black and Michael Cera, {{and directed by}} Harold Ramis; the film was not well received. He also released his third directorial feature on July 31 that same year, titled Funny People. Apatow wrote the film, which starred Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen {{as a pair of}} standup comedians, one of whom has a terminal illness. Other co-stars included his wife Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, who was a comedic actor in Australia before appearing in American films. The film contained more dramatic elements than Apatow's previous directorial efforts. Although the film was not financially successful (grossing $54 million domestically), the critical reception was primarily positive, with David Denby of New Yorker Magazine including the film on his top ten films of 2009, calling Funny People [...] "a serious comedy about a funny man's brush with death" [...] and stating that the film [...] "is Apatow's richest, most complicated movie yet—a summing up of his feelings about comedy and its relation to the rest of existence." [...] The New York Times critic A.O. Scott stated in a piece reflecting on summer films of 2009 that Funny People was [...] "a movie about growing up, feeling sad, facing death—a long, serious film whose subject <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of maturity. Which may be why, {{in the face of a}} softish opening weekend, various interpreters of box office data were quick to declare Funny People a flop. The summer is no time for grown-ups." ...|$|E

Of majestic women bowing themselves to beautiful and meek girls, both wearing gorgeous robes, {{in the midst of}} lovely scenery, or at the doors of Palladian palaces, we have enough; but I do not know any picture which seems to me to give so truthful an idea of the action with which Elizabeth and Mary must actually have met,--which gives so exactly the way in which Elizabeth would stretch her arms, and stoop and gaze into Mary's face, {{and the way in which}} Mary's hand would slip beneath Elizabeth's arms, and raise her up to kiss her. I know not any Elizabeth so full of intense love, and joy, and humbleness; hardly any Madonna in which tenderness and dignity are so quietly blended. She not less humble, and yet accepting the reverence of Elizabeth as her appointed portion, saying, in her simplicity and truth, [...] "He that is mighty hath magnified me, and holy is His name." [...] The longer that this group is looked upon, the more it will be felt that Giotto has done well to withdraw from it nearly all accessories of landscape and adornment, and to trust it to the power of its own deep expression. We may gaze upon the two silent figures until their silence seems to be broken, and the words of the question and reply sound in our ears, low as if from far away: ...|$|E
