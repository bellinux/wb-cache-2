40|$|Current <b>drawing</b> <b>programs</b> provide mainly {{three ways}} for {{carrying}} out object alignment: either by issuing an alignment command, or by using direct positioning {{with the help of}} gravity active points, or by making use of constraints. The first technique has limited functionality, and the other two may be mysterious for a novice. We describe here a new direct manipulation tool for alignment. We show that while direct manipulation helps to make the tool intuitive, it has through iterative design evolved into a tool that also offers functionality not found in current commercial products. KEYWORDS: <b>drawing</b> <b>programs,</b> alignment tools, direct manipulation, two-handed interaction, iterative design INTRODUCTION Direct manipulation has {{for more than a decade}} been one of the preferred styles of interaction. <b>Drawing</b> <b>programs</b> were among the first applications that made heavy use of direct manipulation.
