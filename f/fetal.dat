5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning in {{pregnant women}} may cause severe adverse <b>fetal</b> effects. Poisoning causes <b>fetal</b> tissue hypoxia by decreasing {{the release of}} maternal oxygen to the fetus. Carbon monoxide also crosses the placenta and combines with <b>fetal</b> hemoglobin, causing more direct <b>fetal</b> tissue hypoxia. Additionally, <b>fetal</b> hemoglobin has a 10 to 15% higher affinity for carbon monoxide than adult hemoglobin, causing more severe poisoning in the fetus than in the adult. Elimination of carbon monoxide is slower in the fetus, leading to an accumulation of the toxic chemical. The level of <b>fetal</b> morbidity and mortality in acute carbon monoxide poisoning is significant, so despite mild maternal poisoning or following maternal recovery, severe <b>fetal</b> poisoning or death may still occur.|$|E
5|$|Because postmortem <b>fetal</b> {{extrusion}} is so rare, and occurs under highly idiosyncratic conditions {{regarding the}} individual and the ambient environment, this phenomenon has not been studied for possible applications to forensic investigation. Even if the study of postmortem <b>fetal</b> extrusion could lead to improved investigative methods, experimental research would be highly problematic. At present, forensic scientists have at their disposal an array of established techniques and procedures for a death investigation at the stages of decomposition when postmortem <b>fetal</b> extrusion typically occurs.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for postmortem <b>fetal</b> {{extrusion}} {{may be less}} ambiguous {{when the}} <b>fetal</b> remains are found to lie within the pelvic outlet of the adult, thus indicating that partial extrusion had occurred during decomposition.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>fetal</b> remains {{are found}} in a <b>fetal</b> {{position}} and are wholly within the pelvic cavity of the adult, the fetus died and was interred prior to delivery. The pregnant woman may therefore have died due to labor complications.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the growth}} of brain size, total brain {{ganglioside}} concentration also increases 3-fold from early <b>fetal</b> development to 5 years of age.|$|E
5|$|Before birth: In utero, <b>fetal</b> rats detect odor-bearing {{particles}} {{that come from}} their mother's diet and cross the placental barrier. Shortly after birth, newborn rats respond positively to these foods.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the fifth}} week, {{there is an}} opening in the <b>fetal</b> heart known as the foramen ovale. The foramen ovale allowed blood in the <b>fetal</b> heart to pass {{directly}} from the right atrium to the left atrium, allowing some blood to bypass the lungs. Within seconds after birth, a flap of tissue known as the septum primum that previously acted as a valve closes the foramen ovale and establishes the typical cardiac circulation pattern. A depression in the surface of the right atrium remains where the foramen ovale once walls, called the fossa ovalis.|$|E
5|$|Cell-free <b>fetal</b> DNA {{is found}} in the blood of the mother, and can be sequenced to {{determine}} {{a great deal of information}} about the developing fetus.|$|E
5|$|Congenital malformation, {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions can affect cerebellar structure and, consequently, cerebellar function. Unless the causative condition is reversible, {{the only possible}} treatment is to help people live with their problems. Visualization of the <b>fetal</b> cerebellum by ultrasound scan at 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy {{can be used to}} screen for <b>fetal</b> neural tube defects with a sensitivity rate of up to 99%.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} three months of <b>fetal</b> development, the sebaceous glands of the fetus produce vernix caseosa, a waxy white {{substance}} that coats the skin to protect it from amniotic fluid.|$|E
5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} {{in direct contact with}} the <b>fetal</b> chorion like it does in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, <b>fetal</b> growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E
5|$|Foods rich {{in certain}} fatty acids may foster a healthy immune system. Likewise, <b>fetal</b> {{undernourishment}} {{can cause a}} lifelong impairment of the immune system.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, it was {{reported}} that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in Kings Worthy, England, <b>fetal</b> remains appeared to lie within the birth canal of the skeleton of a young woman, with the <b>fetal</b> cranium external to the pelvic outlet and between the two femora (thigh bones) and the <b>fetal</b> leg bones clearly within the pelvic cavity. Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show History Cold Case, featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three neonates discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.|$|E
5|$|Iodine {{accounts}} for 65% of the molecular weight of T4 and 59% of T3. Fifteen to 20mg of iodine {{is concentrated in}} thyroid tissue and hormones, but 70% of all iodine in the body is found in other tissues, including mammary glands, eyes, gastric mucosa, <b>fetal</b> thymus, cerebro-spinal fluid and choroid plexus, arterial walls, the cervix, and salivary glands. In the cells of those tissues, iodide enters directly by sodium-iodide symporter (NIS). The action of iodine in mammary tissue is related to <b>fetal</b> and neonatal development, but in the other tissues, it is (at least) partially unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies were}} buried in {{separate}} shallow graves, placed in the <b>fetal</b> position (knees raised towards their heads), which {{was the most common}} form for Egyptian burials of the time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fetal</b> {{hypothalamus}} and pituitary {{start to}} secrete thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH is first measurable at 11 weeks. By 18–20 weeks, {{the production of}} thyroxine (T4) reaches a clinically significant and self-sufficient level. <b>Fetal</b> triiodothyronine (T3) remains low, less than 15ng/dL until 30 weeks, and increases to 50ng/dL at full-term. The fetus needs to be self-sufficient in thyroid hormones in order to guard against neurodevelopmental disorders that would arise from maternal hypothyroidism. The presence of sufficient iodine is essential for healthy neurodevelopment.|$|E
5|$|Cases {{have been}} {{recorded}} by medical authorities since the 16th century, though some archaeological cases provide evidence for its occurrence in many periods of human history. While cases of postmortem <b>fetal</b> expulsion have always been rare, the phenomenon has been recorded under disparate circumstances and is occasionally seen in a modern forensic context when {{the body of a}} pregnant woman lies undisturbed and undiscovered for some time following death. There are also cases whereby a fetus may become separated from the body of the pregnant woman about the time of death or during decomposition, though because those cases are not consistent with the processes described here, they are not considered true cases of postmortem <b>fetal</b> extrusion.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{the body}} of a 34-year-old woman, eight months pregnant, was {{discovered}} in her apartment in Hamburg, Germany. The body was bloated and discolored, and upon initial examination, {{it was found that the}} head of the fetus had made its appearance in the vaginal opening. At autopsy, medical examiners found that both the head and shoulders of the fetus had emerged, and concluded that it was a case of postmortem <b>fetal</b> extrusion in progress. The woman, who had given birth twice before, had died of a heroin overdose. The case was unusual and serendipitous, as few medical practitioners have been able to observe and document the progress of postmortem <b>fetal</b> extrusion.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{documented}} {{cases of}} postmortem <b>fetal</b> extrusion were {{described in the}} medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine, first published in 1896. The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition. Four hours after her death, and while the body still hung by the neck, two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body. This is unusual for the {{short amount of time}} elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery. As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances, it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated, or if other causal factors were at work. In the city of Brussels, in 1633, a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled. In Weissenfels, in 1861, postmortem <b>fetal</b> extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman. Other cases are described, though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of <b>fetal</b> remains following exhumation. Most cases occurred prior to burial; in some of these, the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier.|$|E
25|$|In pregnancy, {{it is the}} <b>fetal</b> {{heart and}} not the mother's heart that builds up the <b>fetal</b> blood {{pressure}} to drive blood through the <b>fetal</b> circulation. The blood pressure in the <b>fetal</b> aorta is approximately 30mmHg at 20 weeks of gestation, and increases to approximately 45mmHg at 40 weeks of gestation.|$|E
25|$|A {{heartbeat}} doppler, {{also called}} a doppler <b>fetal</b> monitor or doppler <b>fetal</b> heartbeat monitor, is a handheld device which uses ultrasound to identify <b>fetal</b> heartbeat {{as part of}} the prenatal health care measures. The doppler <b>fetal</b> monitor was invented in 1958 by American obstetrician Dr. Edward H. Hon.|$|E
25|$|Preparing <b>fetal</b> neurons for delivery: Crossing the placenta, {{maternal}} oxytocin {{reaches the}} <b>fetal</b> brain and induces a switch {{in the action}} of neurotransmitter GABA from excitatory to inhibitory on <b>fetal</b> cortical neurons. This silences the <b>fetal</b> brain {{for the period of}} delivery and reduces its vulnerability to hypoxic damage.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{were able}} to develop a novel way to {{transplant}} human <b>fetal</b> kidneys into anephric rats to overcome a significant obstacle in impeding human <b>fetal</b> organ transplantations. The human <b>fetal</b> kidneys demonstrated both growth and function within the rats.|$|E
25|$|The classic triad of the vasa praevia is: {{membrane}} rupture, painless vaginal {{bleeding and}} <b>fetal</b> bradycardia or <b>fetal</b> death.|$|E
25|$|A mother's {{water has}} to break before {{internal}} (invasive) monitoring can be used. More invasive monitoring can involve a <b>fetal</b> scalp electrode {{to give an}} additional measure of <b>fetal</b> heart activity, and/or intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC). It can also involve <b>fetal</b> scalp pH testing.|$|E
25|$|Insulin and {{glucagon}} can {{be detected}} in the human <b>fetal</b> circulation by {{the fourth or fifth}} month of <b>fetal</b> development.|$|E
25|$|Pregnancy: Atorvastatin {{may cause}} <b>fetal</b> harm by {{affecting}} serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which {{are essential for}} <b>fetal</b> development.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> alcohol exposure, causing <b>Fetal</b> alcohol syndrome, {{is one of}} {{the leading}} known causes of mental {{retardation}} in the Western world.|$|E
25|$|In {{pregnant}} women, <b>fetal</b> AFP {{levels can}} be monitored in urine. Since AFP is quickly cleared from the mother's serum via her kidneys, maternal urine AFP correlates with <b>fetal</b> serum levels, although the maternal urine level {{is much lower}} than the <b>fetal</b> serum level. AFP levels rise until about week 32.|$|E
25|$|Pre-eclampsia is also {{associated}} with increased frequency of Caesarian section, preterm delivery, and placental abruption. Furthermore, an elevation in blood pressure can occur in some individuals {{in the first week}} postpartum attributable to volume expansion and fluid mobilization. <b>Fetal</b> complications include <b>fetal</b> growth restriction and potential <b>fetal</b> or perinatal death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fetal</b> alcohol {{syndrome}} – {{about one}} in four patients with <b>fetal</b> alcohol syndrome has either an ASD or a ventricular septal defect.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is by {{endoscopic}} valve ablation. <b>Fetal</b> {{surgery is}} a high risk procedure reserved for cases with severe oligohydramnios, to try to limit the associated lung underdevelopment, or pulmonary hypoplasia, that is seen at birth in these patients. The risks of <b>fetal</b> surgery are significant and include limb entrapment, abdominal injury, and <b>fetal</b> or maternal death. Specific procedures for in utero intervention include infusions of amniotic fluid, serial bladder aspiration, and creating {{a connection between the}} amniotic sac and the <b>fetal</b> bladder, or vesicoamniotic shunt.|$|E
25|$|Addition of {{formaldehyde}} to maternal {{blood samples}} increases {{the percentage of}} free <b>fetal</b> DNA. The purpose of formaldehyde is to stabilize intact cells, and inhibit further release of maternal DNA. The mean percentage of free <b>fetal</b> DNA in maternal blood ranges from 0.32% to 40%, with a mean percentage of 7.7 without formaldehyde-treatment. The mean percentage of free <b>fetal</b> DNA with formaldehyde treatment was 20.2%. However, Benachi et al. in 2005 and Chinnapapagari et al. 2005 have highlighted the range of results from 5% to 96%. Another way to increase the <b>fetal</b> DNA is based on physical length of DNA fragments. <b>Fetal</b> DNA is smaller in size, and can comprise up to 70% of total cell-free DNA.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} <b>fetal</b> birth injury include <b>fetal</b> macrosomia (big baby), {{maternal}} obesity, {{the need for}} instrumental delivery, and an inexperienced attendant. Specific situations that can contribute to birth injury include breech presentation and shoulder dystocia. Most <b>fetal</b> birth injuries resolve without long term harm, but brachial plexus injury may lead to Erb's palsy or Klumpke's paralysis.|$|E
25|$|For {{mothers to}} deliver oxygen to a fetus, it is {{necessary}} for the <b>fetal</b> hemoglobin to extract oxygen from the maternal oxygenated hemoglobin across the placenta. The higher oxygen affinity required for <b>fetal</b> hemoglobin is achieved by the protein subunit γ (gamma), instead of the β (beta) subunit. Because the γ subunit has fewer positive charges than the (adult) β subunit, 2,3-BPG is less electrostatically bound to <b>fetal</b> hemoglobin compared to adult hemoglobin. This lowered affinity allows for adult hemoglobin (maternal hemoglobin) to readily transfer its oxygen to the <b>fetal</b> bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{evidence}} that <b>fetal</b> memory may begin within the second trimester after conception. Substantial evidence for <b>fetal</b> memories has been found at around 30 weeks after conception. <b>Fetal</b> memory is important for parental recognition, and facilitates the bond between child and parents. One of the most important types of memory is that which stores information contributing to the maternal bond between infant and mother. This form of memory is important for a type of development known as attachment. <b>Fetal</b> memory is thus critical to the survival of the fetus both prenatally (in the womb) and after birth as an infant.|$|E
