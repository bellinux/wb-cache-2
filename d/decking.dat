5|$|On 19 August 2014, {{a worker}} from Cumbria died after {{falling through the}} <b>decking</b> of the damaged pier.|$|E
5|$|The three {{sections}} of <b>decking</b> were assembled {{on the broad}} central reservation of Princess Road, and were craned into position over a weekend when Princess Road was closed. The <b>decking</b> was temporarily supported by trestles until the arch was ready. The six sections of the arch were welded together on site into two halves before being lifted into position during a second weekend. The cables were connected on third weekend. The bridge was formally opened on 10 May 1997 by Alex Ferguson in a ceremony including the Lord Mayor of Manchester and Tony Wilson. The ceremony was concluded by them being driven over the bridge in a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost, and {{was followed by a}} street festival.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the pier}} was closed as a {{security}} precaution. A section of <b>decking</b> was removed {{in order to prevent}} access from an enemy landing. The pier regained its popularity after the war, and continued to run regular summer shows, including Tommy Trinder, Doris and Elsie Waters and Dick Emery.|$|E
50|$|On board eight <b>decks</b> {{were open}} to the public; Sky <b>Deck,</b> Sun <b>Deck,</b> Bridge <b>Deck,</b> Promenade <b>Deck,</b> Riviera <b>Deck,</b> Pacific <b>Deck,</b> Bali <b>Deck</b> and Coral <b>Deck.</b>|$|R
25|$|Compartments are {{identified}} by the <b>deck</b> forming the floor of that compartment. Different types of ships have different <b>deck</b> naming conventions. Passenger ships often use {{letters of the alphabet}} sequentially down from A <b>deck</b> (the highest) above B <b>deck,</b> and B <b>deck</b> above C <b>deck,</b> and so forth. Another popular naming convention is numbering the main <b>deck</b> 1, the <b>deck</b> below it 2 (or the second <b>deck),</b> and the <b>deck</b> below that the third <b>deck,</b> and so forth. <b>Decks</b> above the main <b>deck</b> may be named, like the bridge <b>deck</b> or poop <b>deck,</b> or they may be numbered upwards from the main <b>deck</b> with a zero prefix: 01 above the main <b>deck,</b> 02 <b>deck</b> above 01, and so forth.|$|R
2500|$|The Augustus had the {{following}} nine passenger <b>decks</b> (arrange {{from beneath the}} top of the house): Sun <b>Deck,</b> Lido <b>Deck,</b> Boat <b>Deck,</b> Promenade <b>Deck,</b> Upper <b>Deck,</b> Foyer <b>Deck,</b> A <b>Deck,</b> B <b>Deck,</b> and C <b>Deck.</b> Sun <b>Deck,</b> which started off from the wheelhouse, chartroom, radio room, following along either side of aft, encircling the funnel casing, kennels, and the [...] "robot" [...] ventilator, was first class's facility. Lido <b>Deck</b> started off from a narrow full-wrap around promenade and officers' quarters, culminating aft with a bar, the first class pool, and changing rooms.|$|R
5|$|In 1954, an {{amusement}} arcade {{was added to}} the pier; this now occupies three quarters of the length of the structure. Alterations later that decade included the addition of a restaurant and replacement of the <b>decking.</b> By the 1970s the pier's amusements included crazy golf, a miniature zoo and live theatre performances.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} closed to motor {{vehicles}} on 15 February 2010 for refurbishment and strengthening. It was originally expected to remain closed for approximately 18 months, but after {{the condition of the}} bridge was found to be worse than expected, it was closed for 22 months. All of the timber in the <b>decking</b> as well as the footway that had rotted away were replaced, with additional timber added for strengthening. Surfaces at the carriageway and pavement <b>decking</b> were replaced. New steel structures were added to strengthen the bridge. All the lightbulbs were changed to more energy-efficient ones. The tollbooths were refurbished. All twelve layers of paint were stripped down until the bare metal was exposed, which was repaired and treated before three new coats of paint were added. The whole project cost £7.2 million of which the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea provided 25% of the cost and the other 75% was provided by Transport for London.|$|E
5|$|As Queen Mary 2 is {{too large}} to dock in many ports, {{passengers}} are ferried {{to and from the}} ship in tenders, which can be used as lifeboats in an emergency. These are stored while at sea in davits alongside the lifeboats. To transport passengers to shore the tenders pull up to one of four loading stations, each of which has a large hull door that hydraulically opens outwards to form a boarding platform, complete with railings and <b>decking.</b>|$|E
50|$|The ship's {{passenger}} accommodation was spread across six <b>decks</b> within the ship, each <b>deck</b> {{identified with a}} corresponding letter in descending order from the top <b>deck</b> down to the waterline, they being the Boat <b>Deck</b> (A <b>Deck),</b> the Promenade <b>Deck</b> (B <b>Deck),</b> the Shelter <b>Deck</b> (C <b>Deck),</b> the Upper <b>Deck</b> (D <b>Deck),</b> the Main <b>Deck</b> (E <b>Deck)</b> and the Lower <b>Deck</b> (F <b>Deck),</b> {{with each of the}} three passenger classes being allotted their own space on the ship. As seen aboard all passenger liners of the era, first, second and third class passengers were strictly segregated from one another. According to her original configuration in 1907, she was designed to carry 2,198 passengers and 827 crew members. The Cunard Line prided itself with a record for passenger satisfaction.|$|R
50|$|A {{double-deck}} aircraft has two <b>decks</b> for passengers; {{the second}} <b>deck</b> {{may be only}} a partial <b>deck,</b> and may be above or below the main <b>deck.</b> Most commercial aircraft have one passenger <b>deck</b> and one cargo <b>deck</b> for luggage and ULD containers, {{but only a few}} have two <b>decks</b> for passengers, typically above a third <b>deck</b> for cargo.|$|R
50|$|<b>Deck</b> - a <b>deck</b> is frame or {{apparatus}} {{that holds the}} screen cloth in place. It also contains the screening drive. It can contain multiple sections as the material travels from the feed end to the discharge end. Multiple <b>decks</b> are screen <b>decks</b> placed in a configuration where there {{are a series of}} <b>decks</b> attached vertically and lean at the same angle as it preceding and exceeding <b>decks.</b> Multiple <b>decks</b> are often referred to as single <b>deck,</b> double <b>deck,</b> triple <b>deck,</b> etc.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The stairwell of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel <b>decking</b> combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 2014, Boeing {{donated the}} teak <b>decking</b> of Colorado to the USO Northwest SeaTac Center {{to serve as}} the new center’s entry flooring. Her helm is in the {{collection}} of the Colorado Springs Museum. It was donated to the museum in 1961 by Rear Admiral G. R. Luker and other naval officers. Admiral Luker served on Colorado. The donation also included a bronze plaque and other historical materials.|$|E
5|$|Rahl {{installed}} <b>decking</b> on {{half of the}} trestle between 1989 and 1991, {{attempting to}} open it as a bungee jumping platform. A court ruling found that such a venture violated zoning laws, and the town denied Rahl a variance. In 2009 the county seized the trestle, and it was sold to an environmental group. The trestle was closed in 2010 for repairs, {{and is expected to}} be opened as part of the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail in 2012.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Mary Rose began in 1510 in Portsmouth and she was launched in July 1511. She was then towed to London and fitted with rigging and <b>decking,</b> and supplied with armaments. Other than the structural details needed to sail, stock and arm the Mary Rose, she was also equipped with flags, banners and streamers (extremely elongated flags that were flown {{from the top of}} the masts) that were either painted or gilded.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{observers}} noted smoke {{coming from the}} vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion. Compared with other nations' warships in wartime service, Japanese battleships contained {{a large amount of}} flammable materials including wooden <b>decking,</b> furniture, and insulation, as well as cotton and wool bedding. Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert hall}} {{had its own}} {{in-house}} orchestra by November, and ticket sales for concerts accounted for 43% of the pier's revenue by 1920. The West Pier was favoured by locals, while the Palace Pier was used more by day trippers. A top-deck entrance {{was added to the}} hall in 1932. The pier's central <b>decking</b> was removed during World War II to prevent enemy landings, and its popularity began to decline. On 26 November 1944 a Royal Air Force Hawker Typhoon fighter hit the pier, crashing onto the beach. The pilot sustained head injuries. The Typhoon was one of four aircraft escorting a VIP flight.|$|E
50|$|Structural {{engineers}} have several principal categories of bridge <b>decks,</b> {{for the purposes}} of analytic techniques. A beam <b>deck</b> is one where the <b>deck</b> and any supporting structure act together as a single beam. A grid <b>deck</b> uses beams and diaphragms as the supporting structure. The supporting system of a grid <b>deck</b> is analyzed using a grillage analysis. A slab <b>deck</b> is one where the <b>deck</b> is analyzed as a plate. If the slab has a stiffness that is different in two directions (at right angles), then the <b>deck</b> is known and analyzed as an orthotropic <b>deck.</b> A beam and slab <b>deck</b> is one where the beams may deflect somewhat independently, and any transverse forces are carried in the <b>deck.</b> A cellular <b>deck</b> is one where a number of thin slabs and webs will enclose cells within the <b>deck.</b> A boxgirder <b>deck</b> is one where the <b>deck</b> forms the top of the box girder during analysis.|$|R
50|$|Each player needs two <b>decks,</b> a race <b>deck,</b> and {{a dragon}} <b>deck.</b> The race <b>deck</b> is the normal <b>deck</b> from which cards are drawn, while the dragon <b>deck</b> is {{a pool of}} cards from which cards can be {{selected}} as needed during play.|$|R
50|$|On three <b>deck</b> ships, the {{division}} is roughly: <b>Deck</b> One for the officers, <b>Deck</b> Two for Passengers, and <b>Deck</b> Three for the crew. Each <b>deck</b> {{would have the}} group's recreation, dining and sleeping facilities. However, as there are more passengers than any other group, the overload from <b>deck</b> two are housed in sections of <b>Deck</b> One and Three.|$|R
5|$|At 05:37 {{an enemy}} contact report was made, and course {{was changed to}} {{starboard}} to close range. Neither ship was in good fighting trim. Hood, designed twenty-five years earlier, lacked adequate <b>decking</b> armour {{and would have to}} close the range quickly, as she would become progressively less vulnerable to plunging shellfire at shorter ranges. She had completed an overhaul in March and her crew had not been adequately retrained. Prince of Wales, with thicker armour, was less vulnerable to 15-inch shells at ranges greater than , but her crew had also not been trained to battle efficiency. The British ships made their last course change at 05:49, but they had made their approach too fine (the German ships were only 30 degrees on the starboard bow) and their aft turrets could not fire. Prinz Eugen, with Bismarck , had Prince of Wales and Hood slightly forward of the beam, and both ships could deliver full broadsides.|$|E
5|$|The command {{variant of}} the Tiger II was {{designated}} Panzerbefehlswagen Tiger Ausf. B. It had two versions, Sd.Kfz. 267 and Sd.Kfz. 268. These carried only 63 rounds of 8.8cm ammunition to provide room to accommodate the extra radios and equipment, and had additional armour on the engine compartment. The Sd.Kfz. 267 was to have used FuG 8 and FuG 5 radio sets, with the most notable external changes being a two metre long rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a Sternantenne D ("Star antenna D"), mounted on an insulated base (the 105mm Antennenfuß Nr. 1), which was protected by a large armoured cylinder. This equipment was located on the rear <b>decking</b> in a position originally used for deep-wading equipment. The Sd.Kfz. 268 used FuG 7 and FuG 5 radios with a two-metre rod antenna mounted on the turret roof and a 1.4 metre rod antenna mounted on the rear deck.|$|E
5|$|The soft organic {{material}} aboard and dispersed onto the seabed around the hull {{would have been}} the first to disappear, rapidly devoured by fish and crustaceans. Wood-boring molluscs such as Teredo colonized the ship's decks and interior in huge numbers, eating away the wooden <b>decking</b> and other wooden objects such as furniture, paneling, doors and staircase banisters. When their food ran out they died, leaving behind calcareous tubes. The question of the victims' bodies is one that has often troubled explorers of the wreck site. When the debris field was surveyed in Robert Ballard's 1986 expedition, pairs of shoes were observed lying next to each other on the sea bed. The flesh, bones, and clothes had long since been consumed but the tannin in the shoes' leather had apparently resisted the bacteria, leaving the shoes as the only markers of where a body had once lain. Ballard has suggested that skeletons may remain deep within Titanics hull, such as in the engine rooms or third-class cabins. This has been disputed by scientists, who have estimated that the bodies would have completely disappeared by the early 1940s at the latest.|$|E

40|$|Crack {{densities of}} Low-Cracking High-Performance Concrete (LC-HPC) bridge <b>decks</b> are {{compared}} to crack densities of control <b>decks</b> {{to investigate the}} benefits of the LC-HPC specifications developed at the University of Kansas. Specifications for construction of LC-HPC bridge <b>decks</b> are addressed. Bridge <b>deck</b> crack survey procedures are also summarized. Thirteen LC-HPC <b>decks</b> and thirteen control <b>decks</b> are compared by calculating crack densities and noting trends in cracking patterns over time. The results for eight additional <b>decks</b> are also presented. These include three LC-HPC <b>decks,</b> one control <b>deck,</b> and three <b>decks</b> which are considered neither LC-HPC nor control <b>decks.</b> The LC-HPC bridge <b>decks</b> have, with very few exceptions, lower crack densities than the control <b>decks.</b> Cracks are typically transverse above and parallel to the bars in the top layer of reinforcing steel, except at abutments, where cracks propagate longitudinally or perpendicular to the abutment...|$|R

Cards from that <b>deck</b> are reviewed whenever a number from the <b>deck</b> title matches the session number. (For example, cards from <b>Deck</b> 6-8-1-5 will be reviewed again at Sessions 8, 1, and 5.) If a learner has difficulty with a card during a subsequent review, the card is returned to <b>Deck</b> Current; otherwise it stays in its progress <b>deck.</b> When a learner is successful at a card during a session that matches the last number on the <b>deck</b> (for example, Session 5 for <b>Deck</b> 6-8-1-5), that card goes into <b>Deck</b> Retired, and the title card for that progress <b>deck</b> is freed up for use at the following session.|$|R
