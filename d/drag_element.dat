40|$|To {{determine}} the correct fault rheology of the Transverse Ranges area of California, a new finite element to represent faults and a mangle <b>drag</b> <b>element</b> are introduced into {{a set of}} 63 simulation models of anelastic crustal strain. It is shown that a slip rate weakening rheology for faults is not valid in California. Assuming that mantle drag effects on the crust's base are minimal, the optimal coefficient of friction in the seismogenic portion of the fault zones is 0. 4 - 0. 6 (less than Byerly's law assumed to apply elsewhere). Depending on how the southern California upper mantle seismic velocity anomaly is interpreted, model results are improved or degraded. It is found that {{the location of the}} mantle plate boundary is the most important secondary parameter, and that the best model is either a low-stress model (fault friction = 0. 3) or a high-stress model (fault friction = 0. 85), each of which has strong mantel drag. It is concluded that at least the fastest moving faults in southern California have a low friction coefficient (approximtely 0. 3) because they contain low strength hydrated clay gouges throughout the low-temperature seismogenic zone...|$|E

40|$|Mooring of {{floating}} wave energy converters {{is an important}} topic in renewable research since it highly influences the overall cost of the wave energy converter and thereby the cost of energy. In addition, several wave energy converter failures have been observed due to insufficient mooring systems. When designing these systems, {{it is necessary to}} ensure the applicability of the design tool and to establish an understanding of the error between model and prototype. The present paper presents the outcome of an experimental test campaign and construction of a numerical model using the open-source boundary element method code NEMOH and the commercial time-domain mooring analysis tool OrcaFlex. The work used the wind/wave energy converter Floating Power Plant as a case study, which is defined as a large floating structure with a passive mooring system. The investigated mooring consists of a three-legged turret system with synthetic lines, and it was tested for both operational and extreme events. In order to understand the difference between the model and experimental results, no tuning of the model was done, besides adding drag elements with values found from a simplified methodology. This resembles initial design cases where no experimental data are available. Generally good agreement was found for the tensions in the lines when the <b>drag</b> <b>element</b> was applied, with some overestimation of the motions. The main cause of difference was found to be underestimation of linear damping. A model was tested with additional linear damping, and it illustrated that a final analysis needs to use experimental data to achieve the best results. However, the analyses showed that the investigated model can be used without tuning in initial investigations of mooring systems, and it is expected that this approach can be applied to other similar systems...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{output of}} a large-eddy {{simulation}} {{was used to}} study {{the terms of the}} turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget for the air layers above and within a forest. The computation created a three-dimensional, time-dependent simulation of the airflow, in which the lowest third of the domain was occupied by <b>drag</b> <b>elements</b> and heat sources to represent the forest. Shear production was a principal source of TKE in the upper canopy, diminishing gradually above tree-top height and more sharply with depth in the canopy. The transfer of energy to subgrid scales (dissipation) was the main sink in {{the upper part of the}} domain but diminished rapidly with depth in the canopy. Removal of resolved-scale TKE due to canopy drag was extremely important, occurring primarily in the upper half of the forest where the foliage density was large. Turbulent transport showed a loss at the canopy top and a gain within the canopy. These general features have been found elsewhere but uncertainty remains concerning the effects of pressure transport. In the present work, pressure was calculated directly, allowing us to compute the pressure diffusion term. Well above the canopy, pressure transport was smaller than, and opposite in sign to, the turbulent transport term. Near the canopy top and below, pressure transport acted in concert with turbulent transport to export TKE from the region immediately above and within the upper crown, and to provide turbulent energy for the lower parts of the forest.

40|$|Large-eddy {{simulations}} {{described here}} {{have included the}} effect of canopy drag through the depth of a plant canopy. Specifically, we have considered the simulation of flow through a forest. Drag forces enter the simulation with the inclusion of form and viscous drag forces in the momentum equation. In addition, we have carried a variable to represent the kinetic energy (KE) associated with the turbulent wakes behind canopy elements. Assigning typical dimensions to canopy <b>drag</b> <b>elements</b> and, hence, to the scale of wake turbulence, we have evaluated wake effects on the dissipation process and on subgrid-scale (SGS) energy arising from the cascade of resolved-scale energy. Despite {{the fact that the}} rate of conversion of resolved-scale kinetic energy to wake energy is large, and the observation that wake energy is comparable with SGS energy, an effective diffusivity for wake turbulence can be ignored when calculated from wake-scale kinetic energy and a length scale based on element dimension. Thus, it is unnecessary to carry a wake energy variable in the simulation. On the other hand, {{it is very important that}} the process of conversion of SGS energy to wake-scale energy be included in the simulation because the action of wakes is to enhance the dissipation of SGS energy. Viscous drag appears to be of little consequence, at least in our calculations where elements are considered as flat plates and fully exposed to the grid-averaged flow...|$|R
40|$|Stably {{stratified}} canopy flow {{in complex}} terrain {{has been considered}} a difficult condition for measuring net ecosystem–atmosphere exchanges of carbon, water vapor, and energy. A long-standing advection error in eddy-flux measurements is caused by stably stratified canopy flow. Such a condition with strong thermal gradient and less turbulent air is also difficult for modeling. To understand the challenging atmospheric condition for eddy-flux measurements, we use the renormalized group (RNG) k –ϵ turbulence model to investigate the main characteristics of stably stratified canopy flows in complex terrain. In this two-dimensional simulation, we imposed persistent constant heat flux at ground surface and linearly increasing cooling rate in the upper-canopy layer, vertically varying dissipative force from canopy <b>drag</b> <b>elements,</b> buoyancy forcing induced from thermal stratification and the hill terrain. These strong boundary effects keep nonlinearity in the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations high enough to generate turbulent behavior. The fundamental characteristics of nighttime canopy flow over complex terrain measured by {{the small number of}} available multi-tower advection experiments can be reproduced by this numerical simulation, such as (1) unstable layer in the canopy and super-stable layers associated with flow decoupling in deep canopy and near the top of canopy; (2) sub-canopy drainage flow and drainage flow near the top of canopy in calm night; (3) upward momentum transfer in canopy, downward heat transfer in upper canopy and upward heat transfer in deep canopy; and (4) large buoyancy suppression and weak shear production in strong stability...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, {{wind energy}} {{is one of}} the most promising, {{sustainable}} and clean energy solutions for the future. The wind industry in Europe experiences a very fast development these years, moving from onshore to offshore in shallow water and then in deep water. A floating wind turbine is an offshore wind turbine mounted on a floating structure that allows the turbine to generate electricity in water depths where bottom-fixed towers are not accessible. However, the offshore wind energy still has its shortcoming, i. e. the high cost. The most effective way to reduce the cost of energy is to use a larger wind turbine, which can absorb more wind power. So a new design of offshore wind turbine need to be considered. In this thesis, a new spar-buoy concept was developed based on the OC 3 -Hywind concept which developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), to support the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine. An initial design is performed by upscaling of an existing 5 MW spar platform design, then checked against buoyancy, stability, hydrodynamic and strength criteria. In addition, a spread catenary mooring system has been designed for the spar concept. Then the SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn model is established include viscous <b>drag</b> <b>elements.</b> It is found that the blade pitch controller can excite large platform resonant motion at above rated wind speeds during turbulent wind test, which could be possibly reduced by changing the PI gains of the controller. Finally, time domain coupled dynamic analysis of the spar floating wind turbine is performed by using the SIMO-RIFLEX-AeroDyn code. Characteristic responses of the spar floating wind turbine are studied and compared to other two floating wind turbine concepts.

40|$|In the {{offshore}} industry {{it has become}} more common to install damping ”devices” on large displacement structures like FPSO and SPAR platforms. The damping devices are often circular discs {{on the bottom of the}} structure and it is installed to reduce the motion of the structure, mainly the heave motion. In this thesis a bottom disc is installed on a bridge pontoon supposed to be located in a fjord in Norway. The objective is to study the motion behavior of the pontoon, study how it is dependent on the Cd-coefficient and develop a simple numerical model for estimating the KCnumber by vertical oscillation velocity of the pontoon. A surface model is created in the hydrodynamic analysis tool Ansys Aqwa and run for several different disc ratios in a Sea State given by the Norwegian Public Road Administration (NPRA). The main purpose of the flange is to increase the added mass of the structure and shift the Natural Period away from the wave spectrum. Several simulations with different disc ratios is performed and the natural period is shifted away from the wave spectrum when the disc ratio is increasing. However, a downside by adding the bottom disc is that a cancellation effect of the damping load is occurring at certain periods. By adopting KC-numbers and Cd-coefficients from earlier studies on similar structures, a procedure is developed for estimating the KC-number for the pontoon. By using linear potential theory and Morison drag linearization, motion analysis is performed in Aqwa by adding Morison <b>drag</b> <b>elements</b> on to the disc to obtain the effect of drag loads on the pontoon. A second and harsher sea state is tested for the same pontoon for comparison and the same procedure is carried out for this sea state. It is found that the pontoon is quite independent of the Cd- coefficient for the initial moderate sea state, where the resulting vertical velocities are very small and are giving very small values of KC-number. For the second sea state the peak period is shifted and interacting more with the resulting motion RAOs of the pontoon, resulting in larger response and hence larger vertical velocities. The resulting KC-numbers for the second sea state is within range of the initially assumed KC-numbers...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{is devoted to}} the topic of river bank erosion and its prevention. Emphasis is placed on a physically-based model of bank erosion, into which various kinds of bank {{protection}} can be imbedded. For simplicity, the study is restricted to straight channels. The methods developed here can, however, be applied to the broader context of meandering channels. The report consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to an experimental study of the problem. The process of bank erosion of coarse material is first studied. The channel is allowed to erode until such point as a stable equilibrium is attained. Such experiments provide a baseline against which to test the effectiveness of various means of bank protection. The type of bank protection studied falls under the category of distributed drag. Such methods use timber-pile permeable dikes, jacks, jetties, or trees in conjunction with the Palmiter method to slow the flow down {{in the vicinity of the}} bank. In the present study, screens similar to permeable dikes were used to accomplish this. It was shown that a sufficient density of distributed <b>drag</b> <b>elements</b> can substantially slow or stop bank erosion. When fine, suspendable material was added to the water, this material tended to settle out preferentially in the near-bank field of retarded velocity due to distributed drag. As a result, not only could bank erosion be prevented, but eroded banks could be reconstructed by means of deposition from suspension. The second part of the study was devoted to a theoretical and numerical model of bank erosion and its prevention, in parallel with the experiments. The theory is based on a description of bedload transport on side slopes up to the angle of repose. The Finite Element Method was used to model the flow and sediment transport field, as well as describe the time evolution of the channel. At present, the model has proved successful in describing the process of bank erosion documented in the experiments. Numerical work continues on the subject of bank protection by means of distributed drag. Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resource...|$|R
