5|$|Building on {{his results}} on matrix games {{and on his}} model of an {{expanding}} economy, von Neumann invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after George Dantzig described his work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> when an impatient von Neumann asked him {{to get to the}} point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while von Neumann provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.|$|E
5|$|On another occasion, he amused and {{relieved}} the House, irritated {{by the prospect}} of being obliged to listen to the reading of a mass of documents as a preliminary to a resolution, by suggesting that a dozen or so clerks be called in who might read the documents simultaneously and thus dispose of the business <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{testicles}} are well-known to be {{very sensitive}} to impact and injury. The pain involved travels up from each testicle into the abdominal cavity, via the spermatic plexus, which is the primary nerve of each testicle. This will cause pain in the hip and the back. The pain usually goes away <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of August 2006, Israeli officials believed that its operation has destroyed {{the vast majority of}} Hezbollah's longer-range rockets and {{about a third of the}} shorter range Katyushas, but the group still has many Katyushas which are smaller and easy to hide or store underground, and can be set up and fired <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Gamma {{radiation}} in the TeV range {{emanating from}} the Crab Nebula was first detected in 1989 by the Whipple Observatory at Mt. Hopkins, in Arizona in the USA. Modern Cherenkov telescope experiments like H.E.S.S., VERITAS, MAGIC, and CANGAROO III can detect the Crab Nebula <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> The most energetic photons (up to 16 TeV) observed from an extragalactic object originate from the blazar, Markarian 501 (Mrk 501). These measurements were done by the High-Energy-Gamma-Ray Astronomy (HEGRA) air Cherenkov telescopes.|$|E
25|$|During the {{original}} {{outbreak of the}} Rage Virus, Don, his wife Alice, and four other survivors hide in a barricaded cottage {{on the outskirts of}} London. They hear a terrified boy pounding at their door and let him <b>in.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> later, they discover that the infected have followed the boy to them. The infected attack and kill most of the survivors, while Don, Alice, and the boy are chased upstairs. Don pleads with Alice to abandon the boy, but she refuses. He abandons them as the infected break into their room by busting out of the window. Don desperately sprints to a nearby motorboat, narrowly escaping after a tussle with a recently turned survivor.|$|E

25|$|Dr. Arden {{investigates the}} death chute {{to find the}} empty cart Grace was taken from and inhuman {{footprints}} leading out of the tunnel. He later shows Kit a plaster cast of the footprint, believing it to be alien. He asks Kit if {{he had sex with}} wife Alma (Britne Oldford) and Grace (Lizzie Brocheré) before their abductions, thinking the aliens are experimenting with eugenics. Arden asks Kit's permission to cause his temporary death to see if the aliens return. Kit consents, believing it will allow him to see Alma again. Arden renders Kit dead by a potassium chloride injection, promising to revive him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> with atropine and epinephrine. Bright light and loud sounds fill the hallways, and Arden leaves Kit to find Pepper (Naomi Grossman) and a naked full-term pregnant Grace.|$|E
25|$|Snoopy {{is lying}} {{on top of his}} doghouse, {{relaxing}} vacantly and peacefully. He begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> however, he is back to his peaceful state ("Snoopy"). Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Sally show up and mock him for this habit. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus daydreams of a blanket fantasy where everyone can relax with their blankets ("My Blanket and Me"). Lucy later tells him that she would someday like to be a queen. However, Linus tells her that she can't and she threatens to punch him. Sally gets a C for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The Lab’s work {{in global}} {{security}} aims to reduce and mitigate the dangers {{posed by the}} spread or use {{of weapons of mass}} destruction and by threats to energy and environmental security. Livermore has been working on global security and homeland security for decades, predating both the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. LLNL staff have been heavily involved in the cooperative nonproliferation programs with Russia to secure at-risk weapons materials and assist former weapons workers in developing peaceful applications and self-sustaining job opportunities for their expertise and technologies. In the mid-1990s, Lab scientists began efforts to devise improved biodetection capabilities, leading to miniaturized and autonomous instruments that can detect biothreat agents <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> instead of the days to weeks previously required for DNA analysis.|$|E

25|$|At 7:18p.m. ADT, {{the first}} 9-1-1 call {{was made to}} police about an armed man walking down a {{sidewalk}} on Pioneer Avenue and towards the woods west of the street. Twelve RCMP officers responded to the scene {{and set up a}} perimeter around the woods and the surrounding neighbourhood. Bourque was first seen by Cst. Mathieu Daigle stepping out of the forest, crossing a street, and entering another wooded area that bordered the backyards of several houses. Daigle sent out a radio transmission describing Bourque, but some radio static was heard, which made the description difficult to understand. Daigle was then joined by Csts. Fabrice Gevaudan and Rob Nickerson as they trailed Bourque, who was headed toward a house on Bromfield Court, where five other officers were positioned. All of the officers were intending on maintaining visual contact on him while waiting for the arrival of Police Dog Services, who were scheduled to arrive <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Narcosis may be {{completely}} reversed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> by ascending to a shallower depth, with no long-term effects. Thus narcosis while diving in open water rarely develops into {{a serious problem}} {{as long as the}} divers are aware of its symptoms, and are able to ascend to manage it. Due to its perception-altering effects, the onset of narcosis may be hard to recognize. At its most benign, narcosis results in relief of anxiety– a feeling of tranquility and mastery of the environment. These effects are essentially identical to various concentrations of nitrous oxide. They also resemble (though not as closely) the effects of alcohol or marijuana and the familiar benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam and alprazolam. Such effects are not harmful unless they cause some immediate danger to go unrecognized and unaddressed. Once stabilized, the effects generally remain the same at a given depth, only worsening if the diver ventures deeper.|$|E
25|$|The name swamp adder is an invented one, and the {{scientific}} treatises of Doyle's time do not mention any kind of adder of India. To fans of Sherlock Holmes who enjoy treating the stories as altered accounts of real events, the true identity of this snake has been a puzzle {{since the publication of}} the story, even to professional herpetologists. Many species of snakes have been proposed for it, and Richard Lancelyn Green concludes the Indian Cobra (Naja naja) is the snake which it most closely resembles, rather than Boa constrictor, which is not venomous. The Indian cobra has black and white speckled marks, {{and is one of the}} most lethal of the Indian venomous snakes with a neurotoxin which will often kill <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes.</b> It is also a good climber and is used by snake charmers in India. Snakes are deaf in the conventional sense but have vestiges to sense vibrations and low-frequency airborne sounds, making it remotely plausible to signal a snake by whistling.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Moyne regained consciousness, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> {{a doctor}} and {{ambulance}} arrived. Moyne was rushed to a British military hospital in Cairo, and admitted at 1:40p.m., in critical condition, having lost {{a great deal of}} blood through gross hemorrhaging and suffering from shock. Five minutes later, he was given the first of three blood transfusions, causing his condition to improve. After he complained of a burning sensation down his right leg and an inability to move it, X-rays revealed an injury to his thoracic vertebrae. Later, his right arm also became paralyzed {{as a result of the}} neck wound. Doctors were reluctant to operate until his condition improved, but at 5:30, a lumbar puncture revealed a blood stain, and it was decided to operate. He was given another blood transfusion, and in the operation that followed, surgeons removed the bullet lodged near the second lumbar vertebra and discovered the injuries to the colon and large intestine, while the neck wound and finger wounds were cleaned. Soon after the operation, his condition began to deteriorate, and he died at 8:40 pm, aged 64.|$|E
500|$|Real {{tanks were}} {{disguised}} as trucks, using light [...] "Sunshield" [...] canopies. They {{were made in}} two halves, which hinged {{on the sides of}} the tank.

500|$|Narcosis may be {{completely}} reversed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> by ascending to a shallower depth, with no long-term effects. Thus narcosis while diving in open water rarely develops into {{a serious problem}} {{as long as the}} divers are aware of its symptoms, and are able to ascend to manage it. Diving much beyond [...] is generally considered outside the scope of recreational diving. In order to dive at greater depths, as narcosis and oxygen toxicity become critical risk factors, specialist training is required in the use of various helium-containing gas mixtures such as trimix or heliox. These mixtures prevent narcosis by replacing {{some or all of the}} breathing gas with non-narcotic helium.|$|E
