Pulsed photonic curing uses high power Xenon flash lamps to thermally fuse printed nanomaterials such as conductive metal inks. To determine the feasibility of the proposed integration, three different polymer additive manufacturing materials were exposed to typical <b>flash</b> <b>curing</b> conditions using a Novacentrix Pulseforge 3300 system. FTIR analysis revealed virtually no change in the polymer substrates, thus indicating that the curing energy did not damage the polymer. Next, copper traces were printed on the same substrate, dried, and photonically cured to establish the feasibility of thermally fusing copper metal on the polymer additive manufacturing substrates. Although drying defects were observed, electrical resistivity values ranging from 0. 081 to 0. 103 Î©/sq. indicated that high temperature and easily oxidized metals can be successfully printed and cured on several commonly used polymer additive manufacturing materials. These results indicate that pulsed photonic curing holds tremendous promise as an enabling technology for next generation multi- material additive manufacturing processes...|$|E
50|$|Photonic curing {{is used as}} {{a thermal}} {{processing}} technique in the manufacturing of printed electronics as it allows the substitution of glass or ceramic substrate materials with inexpensive and flexible substrate materials such as polymers or paper. The effect can be demonstrated with an ordinary camera <b>flash.</b> Industrial photonic <b>curing</b> systems are typically water cooled and have controls and features similar to industrial lasers. The pulse rate can be fast enough to allow curing on the fly at speeds beyond 100 m/min making it suitable as a curing process for roll-to-roll processing. Material processing rates can exceed 1 m2/s.|$|R
50|$|During Spider-Island, Agent Venom is sent in {{to capture}} a spider-like beast that is {{fighting}} Firestar and Gravity. Agent Venom manages to capture the Spider-King and discovers {{that he is an}} enslaved Captain America. Venom disguises himself as the Spider-King in order to track the infestation to its source. The Queen and Jackal send him to kill Anti-Venom because he is curing people who have gained spider-powers, but his superiors order him to take him to Mr. Fantastic to help develop a <b>cure.</b> <b>Flash</b> and the Venom-symbiote fight each other because Flash wants to bring Anti-Venom to Mr. Fantastic and the symbiote wants to kill Anti-Venom for previously rejecting it. This leads to Venom and Anti-Venom fighting. Venom wins the fight and delivers Anti-Venom to Mr. Fantastic. Venom teams up with Red Hulk, X-23, Ghost Rider, and Johnny Blaze to fight Blackheart.|$|R

Flash wins the fight and delivers Anti-Venom to Mister Fantastic. At Project Rebirth, the scientists there are able to replicate the Anti-Venom cure using samples from Venom which is tested on the mutated Captain America. As Flash finally reaches the hospital, Betty Brant gives him a letter that was written by his late father before Flash is called back into action. He attacks the Queen and is backed up by Captain America later in the battle. They take down the Queen, but she transforms into a bigger, stronger spider form and is taken down by Venom, Captain America, Spider-Man, Kaine, and the assistance of the Avengers.|$|R
