5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic <b>digestion</b> consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a thermophilic anaerobic <b>digestion</b> facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic <b>digestion</b> and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E
5|$|<b>Digestion</b> {{can take}} a long time. The food moves from the mouth to a J-shaped stomach, where it is stored and initial <b>digestion</b> occurs. Unwanted items may never get past the stomach, and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects {{unwanted}} items from its mouth.|$|E
5|$|Maltose {{is formed}} during the {{germination}} of certain grains, {{the most notable}} being barley, which is converted into malt, {{the source of the}} sugar's name. A molecule of maltose is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose. It is less sweet than glucose, fructose or sucrose. It is formed in the body during the <b>digestion</b> of starch by the enzyme amylase and is itself broken down during <b>digestion</b> by the enzyme maltase.|$|E
40|$|Batch {{anaerobic}} <b>digestions</b> {{were performed}} in 160 ml serum vials, cellulose (1 % wt) {{was the sole}} added carbon source. All reactors were inoculated with a 10 % (v/v) leachate inoculum. The concentration of micro-organisms in the leachate inoculums was increased using centrifugation to investigate the effect of initial biomass on hydrolysis performance. The hydrolysis rate constant for <b>digestions</b> with the highest initial biomass was 0. 14 day− 1 compared to 0. 06 day− 1 in <b>digestions</b> with the lowest initial biomass. The {{results of this study}} indicate that hydrolysis performance is related to initial biomass concentrations. This is an ongoing project...|$|R

40|$|A {{physical}} map is presented for the 900 kilobase pair genome of Ureaplasma urealyticum 960 T, locating 29 sites for 6 restriction endonucleases. The large restriction fragments were separated and sized by pulsed-field {{agarose gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE). Their locations on the map were determined by probing Southern blots of digests with individual fragments isolated from other digests and by correlating the products of double <b>digestions</b> and partial <b>digestions.</b> An end-labelling technique was used to detect small fragments not readily observed by PFGE.

5|$|In 2012, a {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} a mesophilic anaerobic <b>digestion</b> facility was awarded, including the construction of buildings and various other pieces of equipment required for the treatment of sludge. Mesophilic anaerobic <b>digestion</b> enables the breaking down of biodegradable materials using micro-organisms under moderate temperatures. The new sludge treatment facility enables the recycled sludge to be used on neighbouring farmlands as manure, and also enables Yorkshire Water to generate 1.9MW of renewable energy using combined heat and power units.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that biogas (mainly methane) – produced from the anaerobic <b>digestion</b> {{of organic matter}} – is potentially a valuable and prolific feedstock.

5|$|Some dinosaurs {{are known}} to have used gizzard stones like modern birds. These stones are {{swallowed}} by animals to aid <b>digestion</b> and break down food and hard fibers once they enter the stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called gastroliths.|$|E
30|$|The C 6 S and C 4 S {{levels in}} SF were {{measured}} by high performance liquid chromatography {{according to the}} method reported by Shinmei et al. [15]. The SF samples were diluted 10 -fold and subjected {{to a series of}} <b>digestions</b> with chondroitinase ABC and chondroitinase AC-II (Seikagaku Corporation). The chondroitinase <b>digestions</b> produced the unsaturated disaccharides Δdi- 6 S and Δdi- 4 S from the CS chain structures in C 6 S and C 4 S, respectively. After ultrafiltration of the digested solutions, the levels of Δdi- 6 S and Δdi- 4 S in the filtrates were analyzed, and the area of the peak corresponding to each unsaturated disaccharide was calculated.|$|R

Here, we present a database (GlycoBase) and analytical tool (autoGU) to assist the interpretation and assignment of HPLC-glycan profiles. GlycoBase is a relational database which contains the HPLC elution positions for over 350 2 -AB labelled N-glycan structures together with predicted products of exoglycosidase <b>digestions.</b> AutoGU assigns provisional structures to each integrated HPLC peak and, when used in combination with exoglycosidase <b>digestions,</b> progressively assigns each structure automatically based on the footprint data.

5|$|The broader {{definition}} differs {{mainly in}} including plants {{that do not}} produce their own digestive enzymes but rely on internal food webs or microbes to digest prey, such as Darlingtonia and some species of Heliamphora. The original definition of botanical carnivory, set out in Givnish et. al. (1984), required a plant to exhibit an adaptation of some trait specifically for the attraction, capture, or <b>digestion</b> of prey while gaining a fitness advantage through the absorption of nutrients derived from said prey. Upon further analysis of genera currently considered carnivorous, botanists widened the original definition to include species that use mutualistic interactions for <b>digestion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{digestive}} system of beetles is primarily adapted for a herbivorous diet. <b>Digestion</b> takes place {{mostly in the}} anterior midgut, although in predatory groups like the Carabidae, most <b>digestion</b> occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the Elateridae, the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes. The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow pharynx, a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed gizzard. This {{is followed by the}} midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of cecum, and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six Malpighian tubules.|$|E
5|$|The {{salivary glands}} (element 30 in {{numbered}} diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts {{lead from the}} glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down. Some insects, like flies, have extra-oral <b>digestion.</b> Insects using extra-oral <b>digestion</b> expel digestive enzymes onto their food to break it down. This strategy allows insects to extract {{a significant proportion of}} the available nutrients from the food source. The gut is where almost all of insects' <b>digestion</b> takes place. It can be divided into the foregut, midgut and hindgut.|$|E
30|$|All batch <b>digestions</b> {{were carried}} out by setting up the protein {{solution}} with an enzyme concentration of 1  mg/L. The samples were incubated in a water bath at 37  °C for 30  min. After incubation the enzymes were inhibited using 1  mM AEBSF and the samples were kept on ice.|$|R
40|$|AbstractAdvancements in sample {{preparation}} for performing trace analysis of inorganic analytes {{are coming from}} the dissemination of microwave-assisted procedures, {{but there is still}} room for improvements by looking for simple and easily applied procedures. Recently it was proposed a new approach called single reaction chamber with capability for <b>digestions</b> at high pressures and temperatures using simple vials and racks. This was a limitation of former cavity microwave ovens with closed vessels. It was demonstrated here that the use of single reaction chamber approach allows the implementation of efficient <b>digestions</b> using diluted solutions of nitric acid and also allows addressing a critical need of {{sample preparation}} for inorganic analysis by running mixed batches of samples. The feasibility of this procedure was demonstrated for organic samples and accuracy was proved by using certified reference materials of apple leaves, bovine liver and whole milk powder. <b>Digestions</b> performed of whole milk powder and bovine liver using 2. 0 molL− 1 nitric acid solution plus concentrated hydrogen peroxide at 240 °C led to residual carbon contents of 0. 825 and 1. 50 % and residual acidities of 1. 04 and 0. 618 molL− 1, respectively. These parameters are fully compatible with further measurements using ICP OES or ICP-MS. Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Rb, Se, Sr, and Zn were accurately determined by ICP OES or ICP-MS depending on their concentrations in digests...|$|R

5|$|An insect {{uses its}} {{digestive}} system to extract nutrients and other substances {{from the food}} it consumes.

This break-down process is known as <b>digestion.</b>|$|E
