500|$|In March 1969, Harrison gave [...] "Something" [...] to Joe Cocker to record, having {{decided that}} it was more likely to become a hit with Cocker than with Lomax. Referring to this and similar {{examples}} where Harrison placed his overlooked songs with other recording artists, Ken Scott has refuted the idea that he lacked confidence as a songwriter in the Beatles, saying: [...] "I think he was totally confident about the songs. The insecurity may have been, if the Beatles kept going, 'How many songs am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to get on each album?', and with the backlog sort of mounting up... get it out there, and get something from it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, Osbourne {{announced}} that he had been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. He had experienced symptoms {{for a number of years}} including blindness in one eye; numbness in both legs; and problems with his bladder, bowel, and stomach. Osbourne injects Copaxone medication daily, uses vitamin supplements and hormone replacement therapy, and has travelled to Europe for stem cell therapy. He has also made lifestyle changes such as minimising stress, exercising regularly, and significantly altering his diet. However, he has spoken of his fear of a rapid decline and has admitted that his doctors have urged him to stop participating in highly intensive physical workouts: [...] "Right now am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a wheelchair? No. But if I don't take care of myself, who knows." [...] While appearing on Dancing with the Stars in October 2013, Osbourne said that he did not suffer from [...] "any severe symptoms other than the odd bit of tingling down my leg and the occasional bout of fatigue." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{we began}} to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such {{questions}} as what had I learnt and what was <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be?</b> I told her I {{was going to be}} apprenticed to Joe, I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,--or anything but my daily dinner,--nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services.|$|E

5000|$|It's {{interesting}} about the theme song. Not only is it costly - and that never sort of drives what we do creatively, but I think fans don't understand that there's {{money on the table}} every time they hear the theme song. That sounds like a bullshit producer response, too, but that's a part of it because every year our budget is pretty challenged. Knowing that, when I looked at the jump ahead, the four year jump, I felt like [...] "I Don't Wanna Be" [...] was very much an anthem for their adolescent lives. It was very much about who am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> and who am I and who am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> someday. Not to mention that it was 42 seconds of screen time that I knew I could use for story. So a lot went into the decision to drop the theme song, it wasn't done lightly.|$|E

5000|$|In a September 2001 {{interview}} with Murray Cammick, O'Neill {{said it was}} record producer John McCready that suggested she record the song, although she wasn't keen as it wasn't self-penned.

Maybe it made the Top 30. But it also empowered me a little with my own material and I stuck to that and got a lot more confidence.” ...|$|E

In an article on Bulls.com, Sefolosha was quoted saying [...] "I was certainly surprised (at the draft) when someone came up and said that I was the next to be picked. I thought maybe {{he had made a}} mistake or something.

5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1992, Hill served as wide {{receivers}} coach for Utah State University. He later returned to the University of Arkansas as wide receivers coach for the 1992 regular season. Immediately after losing the season opener to Division I-AA The Citadel, Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles fired head coach Jack Crowe. Fellow assistant coach Houston Nutt reflected on {{that time in the}} season: [...] "The thing that was so tough that year was the uncertainty you felt every single day. As an assistant, you're thinking, 'Am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> here after this season? Am I {{going to have to get}} another job?'" [...] In 2012, Hill said that Broyles [...] "felt a change was necessary not so much for the team, but for public perception" [...] after the loss to The Citadel. Hill remained on the staff of interim head coach Joe Kines and was retained by permanent head coach Danny Ford in 1993. Hill continued to be wide receivers coach until 2000. In 1998, under new head coach Houston Nutt, Hill added recruiting coordinator to his duties. In 2000, Hill became assistant head coach as well.|$|E

5000|$|Blues songs {{have the}} {{reputation}} of being resigned to fate rather than fighting against misfortune, but there have been exceptions. Bessie Smith recorded protest song [...] "Poor Man Blues" [...] in 1928. Josh White recorded [...] "When Am <b>I</b> <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Called a Man" [...] in 1936 - at this time it was common for white men to address black men as [...] "boy" [...] - before releasing two albums of explicitly political material, 1940's Chain Gang and 1941's Southern Exposure - An Album of Jim Crow Blues. Lead Belly's [...] "Bourgeois Blues" [...] and Big Bill Broonzy's [...] "Black, Brown and White" [...] (aka [...] "Get Back") protested racism. Billie Holiday recorded and popularised the song [...] "Strange Fruit" [...] in 1939. Written by Communist Lewis Allan, and also recorded by Josh White and Nina Simone, it addressed Southern racism, specifically the lynching of African-Americans, and was performed as a protest song in New York venues, including Madison Square Gardens. In the post-war era, J.B. Lenoir gained a reputation for political and social comment; his record label pulled the planned release of 1954 single [...] "Eisenhower Blues" [...] due to its title and later material protested civil rights, racism and the Vietnam War. John Lee Hooker also sang 'I Don't Wanna Go To Vietnam" [...] on 1969 album Simply the Truth.|$|E
5000|$|Sen Dick Sears, D-Bennington, was a {{key figure}} in passing the resolution. He {{received}} a call from a constituent and became convinced that the strategy made sense. [...] "I think it's an important resolution," [...] Sears said. [...] "Congress isn't going to act, and we've got to do something to get this country back under control." [...] When the resolution reached the House, an emotional plea from South Burlington farmer Benjamin Brown brought about a sense of urgency. [...] "What am I going to tell my children, what am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to say to them about this democracy?" [...] Brown asked the legislators. [...] "Vermont has an opportunity to lead right now it's not left and right, it's an issue of democracy," [...] he said. Rep. Mike Yantachka, D-Charlotte, agreed. He described the resolution as, [...] "an opportunity to kick-start a movement that I hope will spread throughout the country and let people become aware of the real problems we have with the influence of money on elections and on our public policy." [...] In contrast to these views, Senate Minority Leader Joe Benning, R-Caledonia, saw the resolution as a grave mistake. [...] "I see it as an attack on free speech," [...] Benning said. [...] "I did not want to give my vote to something that clearly restricts free speech, because I think the First Amendment {{is one of the most}} important amendments we have, if not the most important." ...|$|E
5000|$|The High Commissioner of India to the United Kingdom, V. K. Krishna Menon, was {{notified}} that a delegation would be arriving on 23 October {{to report their}} desire to nominate Nehru. He sent a telegram to Nehru, mistakenly referring to the vacant office {{as that of the}} Vice-Chancellor, and commenting that opinion within the University was in Nehru's favour. Nehru cabled back on the following day correcting the error, and instructing Krishna Menon to tell the delegation that he was [...] "deeply sensible of honour especially coming from my old University" [...] but that he could not accept when he could be of no service. He stressed that it would be undesirable to enter into a contested election. Nehru cabled again on 30 October when his nomination was announced, complaining that [...] "embarrassing questions are put to me" [...] and stated [...] "on no account am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a party to a contest". Krishna Menon replied that the Vice-Chancellor had formally written asking whether Nehru accepted nomination; he noted that in 1847 Prince Albert had not consented to nomination but did not interfere when he was actually nominated. Nehru consulted Lord Pethick-Lawrence, and replied at length on 2 November explaining that reaction in India were [...] "strongly unfavourable" [...] to his contesting the election, and imploring Krishna Menon to get his supporters to withdraw his name. One of Nehru's biographers has claimed that [...] "it was generally recognized that in any election Nehru would carry the majority".|$|E
