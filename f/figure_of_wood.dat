40|$|Feronia limonia (L.) Swingle {{better known}} as wood apple is an {{identity}} plant of Rembang Regency, Central Java Province, Indonesia. However, the population is very limited. In order to identify the conservation efforts, this ethnobotany study was aimed to determine traditional knowledge on the existence, economic value, utility, breeding technique and conservation of wood apple. The survey was conducted on a total of 102 local people from 10 sub-districts which were determined by proportionally stratified random sampling. Data were collected by questionnaires and individual interviews and then were analyzed descriptively. The results showed that all of respondents knew the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> apple, but only 79. 50 % understood its status as an identity plant. Most of respondents (96 %) stated that the fruits have low economic value, 80. 39 % respondents have utilized ripe fruit as ingredients of beverages and stems as firewood. This utilization was only equal to 29. 72 % compared to the potential usability based on research results. It was concluded that the traditional knowledge about the existence, economic value, and breeding technique were good and on the contrary, the knowledge about the plant’s usability was bad. The results will form a basic knowledge for in-depth studies to provide a government policy of Rembang Regency {{in order to develop}} an efficient strategy of management and conservation of wood apple as plant identity. </p...|$|E
40|$|Context : Teak (Tectona grandis L. f.) is a {{tropical}} timber which is appreciated worldwide {{and has been}} planted into many regions of the tropics. It {{is essential to obtain}} information about provenance variation of basic wood properties in order to preserve the wood quality of end-products derived from future plantations. Figuring is one of the wood characteristics valued for panelling and furniture and it is an important parameter to evaluate the quality of teak wood. The ring structure affects within-ring and between-ring colour variation and, therefore, the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> and the related aesthetical aspects. • Methods : By means of microdensity profiles, we constructed a segmented linear model that depicts the anatomical structure of the rings. It effectively distinguished ring porous and diffuse porous rings, leading to the development of an efficient ring porosity index, further used to study the provenance variation of the ring structure. • Results : A significant provenance effect was detected for both wood density variables and ring anatomical structure. Although no correlation was detected between the ring structure and the precipitation level at the provenance origin, the two provenances from very wet climates were distinguished by low values of ring porosity index (diffuse porous ring). • Conclusion : The progenies in our study, collected from origins with various climates, planted in a new climate, seem to maintain to some extent the wood characteristics typical of their mother trees, suggesting that these ring characteristics may be inherited...|$|E

[...] The deities were represented by their busts or statues, or by portable <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>wood,</b> with heads <b>of</b> bronze, wax or marble, and covered with drapery. It has also been suggested that the divine images were bundles of sacred herbs tied together {{in the form of}} a head, covered by a waxen mask so as to resemble a kind of bust, rather like the straw figures called Argei. These figures were laid upon a couch (lectus), the left arm resting on a cushion (pulvinus, whence the couch itself was often called pulvinar) in the attitude of reclining. The couch was set out in the open street, and a meal placed before it on a table.|$|R

However, most people of this ethnicity now live in neighboring Arizona. The Tohono O’odham have as a principle deity the “Older Brother,” who dominates the forces of nature. Among their most important rituals is one called the Vikita, which occurs in July, with dances and song to encourage rainfall during the area’s short rainy season. In July, during the full moon, a dance called the Cu-cu is performed, which is to ask for favors from Mother Nature so {{that there will be no}} drought and the later harvests will be abundant. The dance is performed during a large festival with brings together not only the Tohono O’odham from Sonora, but from Arizona and California as well. The feast day of Francis of Assisi is also important.
