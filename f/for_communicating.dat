Hebrew remained in use in Judah; however the returning exiles brought back Aramaic influence, and Aramaic was used <b>for</b> <b>communicating</b> with other ethnic groups during the Persian period. Alexander conquered Judah in 332BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic (Greek) domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmonean dynasty, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led {{to the destruction of}} the Second Temple in 70CE, and the second Bar Kokhba revolt in 132–135 led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds <b>for</b> <b>communicating</b> with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created.

Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company had not had time to work with them operationally.|$|E

Purpose of Study: this research is aimed at examining the relationship between rejection sensitivity and using Facebook social site. Methods: 265 students from Azad university of Isfahan (162 Female & 103 Male) were chosen using convenience sampling. Scales this study was Farsi form of Rejection Sensitivity Questionnaire (RSQ) (Downey & Feldman, 1996). For assessment “Using Facebook” was used Demography questionnaire. Findings and Results: The findings of current study indicated that sensitive to rejection has a positive and significant relation with use of Facebook. Conclusions: In Virtual world, relation with others is very easy than the Physical co-presence. Thus people that have sensitive to rejection, use Computer-Mediated Communication and Facebook <b>for</b> <b>Communicate</b> with others...|$|R

She is kept under guard by marines and Spartans including Gabriel Thorne, who lost his family during the Didact's attack on New Phoenix. While studying the artifact, Halsey begins receiving messages on her computer from an anonymous sender. The source of the transmissions is 'Mdama, who captures Glassman and forces him {{to work on a}} Forerunner device that supposedly contains the Librarian. Pursuing 'Mdama's troops, Crimson Squad recovers another artifact. When Halsey examines the device, it displays images Thorne recognizes as depicting New Phoenix. Lasky reveals to Halsey and the Spartans that the UNSC knows Prometheans are former humans. Approaching the artifact looking for answers, Thorne is teleported to Requiem and captured by Covenant. Palmer arrests Halsey <b>for</b> <b>communicating</b> with 'Mdama. Thorne escapes captivity outside 'Mdama's base, and escapes with Glassman; they are rescued by Majestic Squad.|$|E

5|$|Fischer-Elfert distinguishes ancient Egyptian {{graffiti}} {{writing as}} a literary genre. During the New Kingdom, scribes who traveled to ancient sites often left graffiti messages {{on the walls of}} sacred mortuary temples and pyramids, usually in commemoration of these structures. Modern scholars do not consider these scribes to have been mere tourists, but pilgrims visiting sacred sites where the extinct cult centers could be used <b>for</b> <b>communicating</b> with the gods. There is evidence from an educational ostracon found in the tomb of Senenmut (TT71) that formulaic graffiti writing was practiced in scribal schools. In one graffiti message, left at the mortuary temple of Thutmose III at Deir el-Bahri, a modified saying from The Maxims of Ptahhotep is incorporated into a prayer written on the temple wall. Scribes usually wrote their graffiti in separate clusters to distinguish their graffiti from others'. This led to competition among scribes, who would sometimes denigrate the quality of graffiti inscribed by others, even ancestors from the scribal profession.|$|E
5|$|Some species use {{vibrations}} <b>for</b> <b>communicating</b> within {{members of}} the same species, such as to attract mates as in the songs of the shield bug Nezara viridula. Vibrations {{can also be used to}} communicate between entirely different species; lycaenid (gossamer-winged butterfly) caterpillars, which are myrmecophilous (living in a mutualistic association with ants) communicate with ants in this way. The Madagascar hissing cockroach has the ability to press air through its spiracles to make a hissing noise as a sign of aggression; the death's-head hawkmoth makes a squeaking noise by forcing air out of their pharynx when agitated, which may also reduce aggressive worker honey bee behavior when the two are in close proximity.|$|E
