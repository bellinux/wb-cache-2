40|$|AbstractQuantitative {{analysis}} of the fire system efficacy of is the trend of China's fire equipment supervision and management. One of the important work is to analyze the effects of <b>failure</b> on fire <b>equipment,</b> and formulate corresponding countermeasures of maintenance and management. Utilizing function analysis system technique (FAST), the mission levels of the fire equipment in building were divided, the analyzing process for fire <b>equipment</b> <b>failure</b> was established according to the <b>failure</b> <b>information</b> during the actual operation of fire equipments, and {{on the level of}} component unit, subsystem function and system mission, the method of ranking the effective factors of fire <b>equipment</b> <b>failure</b> was proposed based on the mission and function analysis. The method divided the effects of failure into 3 classes: minor (failure class III), general (failure class II), significant (failure class I), and corresponding management measures were proposed for each class. The method was used in a case study...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure mode}} and effect {{analysis}} (FMEA) {{is a widely}} applied technique for prioritizing <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> in the maintenance decision making domain. Recent improvements on the FMEA have largely focused on addressing the shortcomings of the conventional FMEA of which, the risk priority number (RPN) is incorporated as a measure for prioritizing failure modes. In this regard, considerable research effort has been directed towards addressing uncertainties associated with the RPN metrics, that is, occurrence, severity and detection. Despite these improvements, assigning these metrics remains largely subjective and mostly relies on expert elicitations, more so in instances where empirical data is sparse. Moreover, the FMEA results remain static and are seldom updated with the availability of new <b>failure</b> <b>information.</b> In this paper, a dynamic risk assessment methodology is proposed {{and based on the}} hierarchical Bayes theory. In the methodology, posterior distribution functions are derived for risk metrics associated with <b>equipment</b> <b>failure,</b> of which, the posterior function combines both prior functions elicited from experts, and observed evidences based on empirical data. Thereafter, the posterior functions are incorporated as input to a Monte Carlo simulation model from which, the expected cost of failure is generated and failure modes prioritized on this basis. A decision scheme for selecting appropriate maintenance strategy is proposed, and its applicability demonstrated in the case study of thermal power plant <b>equipment</b> <b>failures.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) {{proposes to}} {{continue}} the automated collection of Agreement State licensee data on the occurrence of incidents and events involving the use and transportation of radioactive byproduct material, such as medical events, radiation overexposures, environmental releases, contamination, leaking sources, lost sources, <b>equipment</b> <b>failure,</b> etc. This <b>information</b> is submitted to the Agreement States by their licensees in accordance with Agreement State regulations that are compatible to NRC regulations, and that require the reporting of incidents and events involving the use of radioactive byproduct materials. In addition, NRC requests that the Agreement States report by telephone significant events that could pose a significant health, safety or security hazard to NRC within the next working day of notification by their licensee. (In accordance with established regulatory requirements, Agreement State licensees report significant events to the Agreement State within 24 hours.) These and other radioactive material events will be reported {{on a monthly basis}} using the automated system. Agreement States may also choose to submit reports in a standardized written format transmitted via electronic mail or fax. NRC is requesting that the Agreement States provide information on the initial notification, response actions, and follow-up investigations. The reporting of material event information is now mandatory under compatibilit...|$|R
40|$|Bioprocesses {{often require}} {{considerable}} expertise to insure proper operation and performance. However, {{they are also}} rich in both data and factual knowledge. Supervision and control can be improved by utilizing information from all available sources. Knowledge about dynamics may be incomplete, particularly during upsets or <b>equipment</b> <b>failure.</b> Additional <b>information</b> derived from past data trends, expert operators and the literature can be very useful in process analysis, fault detection, process salvaging and optimization. In this work an expert system which utilizes on-line real-time data as well as archived data trends and operator expertise to analyze a process is developed. A modular format (the hierarchical modular structure) is designed to organize the large body of information [...] typical of the knowledge likely to be encountered in a bioprocess. The highly modular format allows for knowledge to be classified as general, process configuration specific or system specific. The expert system is challenged with process faults which are not easily noticed without a qualitative understanding of process dynamics. The supervisor is able to detect the unusual situations by first generating a process assessment based on a synthesis of all available on-line measurements in conjunction with known qualitative information. Once a global process picture is established, the expert system can decide upon appropriate strategies for recovery or backup control. Process analysis, recovery and optimization were experimentally demonstrated using Clostridium acetobutylicum fermentation as a sample system. Successful expert system process analysis was able to detect sensor failures and media feed flow failures. In addition, effective backup pH control and process recovery strategies were suggested and implemented in real-time by the expert system supervisor. The expert system ability to aid on-line optimization by shortening {{the time needed to}} analyze process transients may result in faster attainment of the region of optimal performance...|$|R

50|$|The first {{published}} history of predicting spacecraft <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> {{occurred on the}} 12 Rockwell/U.S. Air Force Global Positioning System Block I (Phase 1) satellites using non-repeatable transient events (NRTE) and GPS Kalman filter data from the GPS Master Control Station, between 1978 and 1984 by the GPS Space and Ground Segment Manager. NRTEs were isolated to the GPS satellites after mission operations support personnel replayed the real-time satellite telemetry ruling out RF and land-line noise caused from poor Eb/No or S/N and data acquisition and display system processing problems. The GPS satellite's subsystem equipment vendors diagnosed the NRTEs as systemic noise that preceded the <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> because at the time, {{it was believed that}} all <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> occurred instantaneously and randomly and so <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> could not be predicted (e.g. <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> exhibited memoryless behavior). Rockwell International GPS Systems Engineering Manager ordered a stop to predicting GPS satellite <b>equipment</b> <b>failures</b> in 1983 claiming it wasn't possible and the company was not on contract to do so. The prognostic analysis that was completed on the GPS satellite telemetry was published quarterly contractually as a CDRL to the GPS Program Office personnel and a wide variety of Air Force subcontractors working on the GPS program.|$|R
