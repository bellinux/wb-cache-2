5|$|Dillmann {{then decided}} to try {{wheelchair}} basketball again. She retrieved her old basketball chair, now somewhat mouldy and smelly, from the basement, and sought a game with her old team, RSV Lahn-Dill.

5|$|Hensley {{continued}} to travel around Tennessee, receiving a mixed reception {{from those who}} were aware of his past. Some who knew him were willing to forgive him and welcome him back in a ministerial role, but he remained estranged from most of his family. His son Roscoe saw him preach in 1944. The younger Hensley was also a pastor by then, but <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> his father conduct a service.|$|E
5|$|In Yao's {{first game}} in Miami on December 16, 2002, the Heat passed out 8,000 fortune cookies, an Asian {{cultural}} stereotype. Yao was not {{angry with the}} promotion {{because he was not}} familiar with American stereotypes of Chinese. In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao said he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention.|$|E
5|$|One man in {{the village}} could {{accurately}} mimic the sound of many animals, and when asked to imitate the kilopilopitsofy, he made noises {{very similar to that}} of a hippopotamus, even though he had never left the island and said he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> an African hippo. When shown photos, others also identified a hippopotamus-like animal, but with larger ears. Several described the creature's last appearance in 1976.|$|E

5|$|After {{listening}} to the song, Barber was inspired to create a video around the Beatles' appearance on Sullivan's show based on the song's musical structure, but André 3000 <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> this footage. Barber showed the footage to André 3000 {{and came up with}} the idea of reversing the British Invasion, by having the American band the Love Below becoming popular on a British television program. The music video was filmed in two days in August 2003 on a sound stage at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|Astorga and Henderson were {{released}} in March 1973 {{after the war}} ended.

Gatwood left behind a 13-week-old son he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen,</b> Robin F. Gatwood III. The remains of Kulland, Frink and Paschall were recovered and returned to the United States in 1995, where they were buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

5|$|Costume {{designer}} Sue Blane was not keen {{on working}} for the film until she became aware that Curry, an old friend, was committed to the project. Curry and Blane had worked together in Glasgow's Citizens Theatre in a production of The Maids, where Curry had worn a woman's corset in the production. Blane arranged it with the theatre to loan her the corset from the other production for Rocky Horror. Blane admits {{that she did not}} conduct research for her designing, <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a science fiction film, and is acutely aware that her costumes for Brad and Janet may have been generalizations.|$|E
5|$|Hermética {{remained}} a popular {{band in the}} Argentine heavy metal scene, even among the younger fans who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the band live. Since their disbandment, the band's members have not attempted any reunion. At the 2011 reunion of Malón, Claudio O'Connor said that their personal conflicts with Iorio would not allow it {{and that they would}} not reunite the band if the four members do not have a good personal relationship.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol Empire's rise gave Western Christians the {{opportunity}} to visit lands that they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> before, and they set out in large numbers along the Empire's secure roads. Belief that a lost Nestorian kingdom existed in the east, or that the Crusader states' salvation depended on an alliance with an Eastern monarch, was {{one reason for the}} numerous Christian ambassadors and missionaries sent to the Mongols. These include Franciscan explorers Giovanni da Pian del Carpine in 1245 and William of Rubruck in 1253.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} historians {{began in the}} early twentieth century to {{question}} if the Imprimerie nationale Latin-alphabet type was really the work of Garamond, as the Grecs du Roi undoubtedly were. Doubt was raised by French historian Jean Paillard, but he died in the First World War soon after publishing his conclusions in 1914 and his work remained little-read. ATF's historian Henry Lewis Bullen secretly doubted that the 'Garamond' his company was reviving was really Garamond's work, noting that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> it in a sixteenth-century book. He discussed his concerns with ATF junior librarian Beatrice Warde, who would later move to Europe and become a prominent writer on printing advising the British branch of Monotype.|$|E
5|$|A {{woman named}} Ning Gongyu {{provided}} {{most of the}} funds needed to construct the hall, and its construction was led by a monk named Yuancheng. In the 10th century, a depiction of Foguang Temple was painted in cave 61 of the Mogao Grottoes. However, it is likely the painters <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the temple, because the main hall in the painting is a two-storied white building with a green-glaze roof, {{very different from the}} red and white of the Great East Hall. This painting indicates that Foguang Temple was an important stop for Buddhist pilgrims. In 1137 of the Jin dynasty, the Manjusri Hall was constructed on the temple's north side, along with another hall dedicated to Samantabhadra, which was burnt down in the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).|$|E
5|$|He used actors {{of diverse}} backgrounds, from famous film stars {{to people who}} <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a film (as in Aparajito). Robin Wood and others have lauded him as the best {{director}} of children, pointing out memorable performances in the roles of Apu and Durga (Pather Panchali), Ratan (Postmaster) and Mukul (Sonar Kella). Depending on the talent or experience of the actor, Ray varied the intensity of his direction, from virtually nothing with actors such as Utpal Dutt, to using the actor as a puppet (Subir Banerjee as young Apu or Sharmila Tagore as Aparna). Actors {{who had worked for}} Ray praised his customary trust but said he could also treat incompetence with total contempt.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to prevent}} the {{outbreak}} of a wider war, American officials ordered the U.S. Army to arrest the Meskwakis who massacred the Menominees. General Gaines was ill, and so his subordinate, Brigadier General Henry Atkinson, received the assignment. Atkinson was a middle-aged officer who had ably handled administrative and diplomatic tasks, most notably during the 1827 Winnebago War, but he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> combat. On April 8, he set out from Jefferson Barracks in Missouri, moving up the Mississippi River by steamboat with about 220 soldiers. By chance, Black Hawk and his British Band had just crossed into Illinois. Although Atkinson did not realize it, his boats passed Black Hawk's band.|$|E
5|$|In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues {{solitaire}} bones encrusted in stalagmite {{were discovered}} in a cave and sent to Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found {{to belong to the}} same species. These finds confirmed Leguat's descriptions, but at this time no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, a man who had lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. Rodrigues covers only , making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.|$|E
5|$|Kalinovka was {{a peasant}} village; Khrushchev's teacher, Lydia Shevchenko, later stated that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a village as poor as Kalinovka had been. Nikita {{worked as a}} herdsboy from an early age. He was schooled {{for a total of}} four years, part in the village parochial school and part under Shevchenko's tutelage in Kalinovka's state school. According to Khrushchev in his memoirs, Shevchenko was a {{freethinker}} who upset the villagers by not attending church, and when her brother visited, he gave the boy books which had been banned by the Imperial Government. She urged Nikita to seek further education, but family finances did not permit this.|$|E
