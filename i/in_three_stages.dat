5|$|The 2007 Giro d'Italia was the 90th {{running of}} the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place from 12 May to 3 June 2007. The race began in Sardinia and {{finished}} in Milan, and featured five mountain top finishes, of which one was an individual time trial. The race also visited France and Austria <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2007, {{the stadium}} was {{planned to be}} built <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages,</b> with a {{combined}} budget of NOK156.6 million. The first stage would involve the northern and western sides and cost NOK78.4 million, the second stage would involve the eastern side and cost NOK43.0 million, while the third stage would involve the southern side and cost NOK35.1 million. After construction started, BG changed two specifications, moving public rest rooms from the basement to the ground floor, and changing the angle of roof. Both of these gave increased construction costs and alteration of the architectural design plans.|$|E
5|$|Lake Bonney Wind Farm {{was built}} <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages.</b> Stage 1 {{consists}} of 46 turbines each having a rated capacity of 1.75 MW (total 80.5 MW) and was finished in March 2005. Construction of Stage 2 began in November 2006 and was finished around April 2008. Stage 2 consists of 53 turbines of 3 MW (total 159 MW). Stage 3 consists of 13 turbines of 3 MW (total 39 MW). The combined {{capacity of the}} three stages are 278.5 MW making it the biggest wind farm in Australia {{at the time of}} completion.|$|E

40|$|Current starved VCO {{is simple}} ring {{oscillator}} consisting of cascaded inverters. Differential ring oscillator has a differential output to reject common-mode noise, power supply noise and so on. In this paper we have designed and simulated Current Starved VCO and Differential VCO for PLL in Tanner 13. 0 v 0. 18 μm digital CMOS process. Performance comparison {{is done in}} terms of high oscillation frequency, low power consumption, and low area. It is observed that maximum oscillation frequency about 2 GHz is achieved <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stage</b> differential VCO. But area {{has been reduced to}} 688 µm 2 with low power consumption of 359. 08 µW with large tuning range <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stage</b> current starved VCO for a frequency of 1. 1 GHz at 1. 8 VDD...|$|R
50|$|However, {{the work}} {{produced}} in each stage {{is not the}} same. The ratio of work produced in a 2 stage turbine is 3:1 as one move from higher to lower pressure. This ratio is 5:3:1 <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stage</b> turbine and changes to 7:5:3:1 in a four stage turbine.|$|R
5|$|The second season's {{work was}} planned <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages.</b> First, all depot stores— in total—were to be {{transferred}} from Cape Evans to Hut Point. These stores would then be transported from Hut Point to a base depot at Minna Bluff. Finally, a journey south would be made, to reinforce the 80° depot and lay new ones at 81°, 82°, 83°, and lastly at Mount Hope, near {{the foot of the}} Beardmore Glacier, at 83°30'.|$|E
5|$|Begun in 1292, the Anglican parish {{church of}} St John the Baptist {{gradually}} evolved until taking its present general form {{during the reign}} of Charles II, after the tower collapsed into the building during a storm in 1632. The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages</b> over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced parapet and short croketted pinnacles and {{is said to have been}} built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634–1655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which shuts off the choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the Multinational Staged Improvement Program (MSIP) was {{conducted}} to evolve the F-16's capabilities, mitigate risks during technology development, and ensure the aircraft's worth. The program upgraded the F-16 <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages.</b> The MSIP process permitted the quick introduction of new capabilities, at lower costs and with reduced risks compared to traditional independent upgrade programs. In 2012, the USAF had allocated $2.8 billion to upgrade 350 F-16s {{while waiting for the}} F-35 to enter service. One key upgrade has been an auto-GCAS (Ground collision avoidance system) to reduce instances of controlled flight into terrain. Onboard power and cooling capacities limits the scope of upgrades, which often involves the addition of more power-hungry avionics.|$|E

5|$|The Vestbanen Line was {{extended}} west from Vestbanen station towards Skillebekk in two stages, on 21 December 1898 {{and again on}} 23 June 1899. The Gamlebyen Line {{was extended}} further east on 17 November 1899 to Oslo Hospital. The Vålerenga Line, which ran east from the city centre, opened on 3 May 1900, and the Kampen Line, which ran parallel but further north, on 6 June 1900. The first street line out of Kristiania into Aker was opened <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages</b> {{as an extension of}} the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line: on 29 September 1899 to Torshov, on 2 October 1901 to Sandaker and, finally, to Grefsen Station on 28 November 1902. For the electrification, KSS ordered 47 new trams from Falkenried and Waggonfabrik Linke-Hoffmann; these remained in service until 1967. In 1900, the tramway had a ridership of almost 17 million passengers, or 75 trips per inhabitant.|$|E
5|$|Tinne {{acquired}} a significant collection of clothes from shops in Bold Street, Liverpool shops and her local dressmaker. The collection comprised both off-the-rail items and bespoke outfits.

The collection includes more than 700 items, though many other items could not be accepted due to the low quality. The total collection included over 1000 items. The collection is the largest from an individual owned by a museum in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages</b> to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower is}} <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>stages</b> and is {{supported}} by buttresses. In the lowest stage, on the west side, is a doorway in Romanesque style, {{on the north side}} is an ogee-headed lancet window. On the left of the east side is a Perpendicular-style porch. The middle stage has a two-light window on the west side, above which is a circular clock face, and on the north and east sides are lancet windows. The top stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each side. The parapet is plain, and projecting from it on the west side is a gargoyle. The spire is octagonal, with two tiers of lucarnes (dormer windows). The north side of the church is divided by buttresses into four bays. The second bay from the east contains a priest's door, above which is a lancet window. To the right of the door is a small trefoil-headed window. The other bays contain two-light windows with Early English tracery. Battlemented parapets run around the walls of the aisle walls and the clerestory. The clerestory has seven bays on either side, each containing a four-light Perpendicular window. At the east end are three windows. The central window, {{at the end of the}} chancel, is Perpendicular with seven lights. This is flanked by two aisle windows with plate tracery, the one to the right having four lights, and that to the left five lights.|$|E
