Among the different approaches proposed in literature, the {{attention is focused on}} mechanical models based on the displacement-based approach, which describe the inelastic response of buildings by capacity curves able to provide essential information in terms of stiffness, overall strength and ultimate displacement capacity. In the paper an extensive sensitivity analysis is carried out by considering the various expressions proposed in literature for these entities (in order to define the more reliable ones) and by evaluating how each parameter (e. g. strength and ductility of materials, structural element dimensions, interstorey <b>heigt,</b> [...] .), which mechanical models may be founded on, affect the structural response (in terms of main parameters which define the capacity curve).

Variance components were estimated on the basis of <b>heigts</b> of individual plants in the first-generation seed orchards of Encaliptus pelita with ages of 1 to 5 years old. The seed orchards were established at two locations in Indonesia - South Kalimantan and South Sumatra. There were three types of variance components,comprising family variance,plot error variance, and within plot variance was derived using family variance as a percentage. A linear regression equation within plot variance was derived using family variance as an independent variable. The regression equation was statistically significant and could be used to determine relative size of the three variance under different levels of heritability. The optimum number of families of the intermediate heritability (= 0. 20) were found to be around 40 to 50, with six to eight tress per plot for a seed orchard of 2 ha with 10 replicates. This result suggested that the design of the first-generation seedling seed orchards was close to the optimum to achieve maximum genetic gain throught the two stages of selections, i. e. within plot selection and family selection...|$|R

SAR microwaves penetrate down into the forest canopy layer. The depth of this penetration depend on the amount of, and the 3 D distibution of foliage scatterers, and this may be utilized for forest monitoring. We have developed a routine that simulates the X-band SAR backscattter and interferometric heights derived from it. We have used a combined data set og SRTM x-band interferometric heights and airborne laser scanning data for a 15 km 2 forest area in South Norway. The 3 D distribution of scatterers is described by voxels, or 3 d pixels. The gap fraction and cover fraction of each of the 2. 5 mill voxels is determined from near-vertical LIDAR data. We have modelled the SRTM 55 degrees inclination angle view through the voxels, assuming a direct northfacing azimuth view. The backscatter from each voxel is estimated, as is the interferometric height. The interferometric heights and the modelled heights were linearly related with a slope of almost 1 : 1 and R 2 = 0. 99. After subtracting the terrain <b>heigts,</b> the relationship was still close to 1 : 1 and had R 2 = 0. 76. This corresponds to a height measure in the forest canopy.

40|$|We present Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph {{intermediate}} {{observations of}} the interstellar medium toward HD 116852, a low halo star {{at a distance of}} 4. 8 kpc (z = - 1. 3 kpc) in the direction l = 304. deg 9, b = 16. deg 1. The small science aperture observations have signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 30 to 90 and resolutions of 11 to 18 km/s (FWHM). We confirm the optical MK classification of this star through an analysis of its ultraviolet photosperic and stellar wind profiles. We detect interstellar lines of Al III, Si IV, C IV, and N V together with lines of C I, C I*, C I**, Si II, Ge II, P II, and Ni II. We convert the Mg II, P II, S II, Al III, Si IV, C IV, and N V profiles into measure of apparent column density as a function of LSR velocity. Gas scale height, velocity dispersion, and differential Galactic rotation effects govern the profile shapes. A simple computer model of the expected sight line column density profiles for the low and high ion species indicates that the gas velocity dispersions and scale heights increase as the ionization level of the gas increases. We find scale <b>heigts</b> H greater than or = 1 kpc for the high ions, which are comparable to the z-distance of the star, whereas we find H approximatley = 0. 6 to 0. 7 kpc for A 1 III and H approximatley 0. 1 kpc for P II and Ge II. An enhancement in the Al II profile near - 15 km/s accounts for approximately 25 % of the A 1 III column along the sight line and probably arises within gas located approximately 500 pc below the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm link. Portions of the broad underlying A 1 III distribution are associated with the higher ionization lines, perhaps in conductive interfaces. The presence of N V and the column density ratios of Si IV, C IV, and N V favor the interpretation that much of the high ion absorption is produced by collisional ionization in gas with T = 1 - 3 x 10 (exp 5) K. An enhancement near - 35 km/s in both the Si IV and C IV profiles may be due to an outflow from the Norma spiral arm at a z-distance of about - 1 kpc. The smooth decrease of the N(C IV) /N(Si IV) ratio at negative velocities may be due to an ISM ionization structure for hot gas that changes distance from the Galactic plane or to a two phase gas distribution in which the relative contribution from each phase changes with distance from the Galactic plane...|$|R
40|$| h). The {{surface of}} the {{deformed}} calyx is usually rough, and {{the parts of the}} stunted calyx are easily broken. The corolla as well as calyx are shortened under the influence of both strains. The deformed corolla has often the length from 2 to 5 cm instead of 7 cm. The anomalous corollas in their lower parts are broader than the normal ones (pl. 6, l — o). While the normal corollas are snow-white, the deformed ones can be green. The anomalous shape of corolla has been studied just as the calyx. We have separated the corolla from the other flower parts and then we have cut it lengthwise and opened it (pl. 6, l—r). Short or deep incisions can arise along the corollas. Mostly, only one lateral split, which does not reach the basis of the corolla can be formed. Trough the split on the corolla we can see the internal parts of the flower (pl. 4, g, j — l; pl. 5, b — e; pl. 6, q, r; pl. 12, e — h). Both strains B 12 and B 15 cause also deformations {{at the top of the}} corolla. While the normal corollas finish with five short tips at the top, the abnormal ones finish with longer tips or theread-like appendages (pl. 4, a—c, k; pl. 5, a; pl. 6, m, o, p; pl. 12, /, g). The appendages are often curved and can interweave. On account of that the corolla is closed at the top (pl. 4, j, l). Under the influence of strain B 15 the parts of the corolla can grow together with the stigma of the pistil. Strain B 12 can cause enations on the corolla (pl. 4, g; pl. 12, a, b). Strains B 12 and B 15 produce also deformations on the stamens, specially shortening of filaments, that are about 6 cm long in normal plants. Because of the considerable shortening of filaments, the stamens can become only several mm long (pl. 4, k; pl. 5, e). The infected flowers usually have also a greater number of stamens than the normal ones; instead of five stamens the deformed flowers can have six to ten. Moreover, a number of other different deformations can arise in the stamens as well. For example the anomalous stamens can grow together (pl. 2 ̆ 7 5, g, j—l; pl. 6, n). Because of that two or even three anthers can arise on one widened filament (pl. 5, g, j, 1). The stamens can also grow together with the corolla (pl. 5, h, i, q). Besides that both strains can cause transformation of stamens into leaf-like organs (pl. 5, o, p). The cross sections of such stamens (pl. 5, r) can show only two instead of four cavities. Along with the shortening of the other flower parts, the style of the pistil also becomes shorter (pl. 4, k; pl. 7, a — d). Strain B 15 can cause a disappearing of the style entirely so that the stigma is placed directly on the ovary (pl. 5, c). Sometimes the style is less shortened than the corolla and thus the style sticks out from the tube of the corolla (pl. 12, c). The stigma and the ovary are usually somewhat bigger than those of the normal pistil. The deformed pistils have often a greater number of tips on the stigma (pl. 7, e, h). The stigma is often strongly deformed under the influence of strain B 15 and in many cases it has several minute tips covered with papillose hairs on their surface (pl. 5, c, e; pl. 7, d, f). The normal ovaries or the fruit are composed of two carpels; they are two-celled at the top and four-celled at the basis. The number of carpels and ovary cells in the less deformed fruit can be the same as in the normal one (pl. 11, l — p, w, x). However, sometimes the deformed fruit has an increased number of carpels and ovary cells. For example on pl. 11, q — t are represented four sections of different <b>heigts</b> of a fruit. This fruit, infected with strain B 12 is composed of three carpels. Similar relations exist also in the fruit on pl. 11, u, v. Anomalous ovaries can be composed even of five carpels (pl. 10, b). Sometimes the anomalies are so complicated that we cannot with certainy establish of how many carpels the ovary is made (pl. 9, a, b). Strain B 15 causes a specially interesting anomaly where the carpels at the top of the ovary remain open (pl. 13); through that aiperture we can see the inside of the ovary. The aperture at the top of the ovary is often placed laterally as well (pl. 10, a). On account of that the placenta with ovules is exposed to outer conditions directly. The spines in particular places of the deformed fruit often lack completely or are strongly stunted (pl. 11, c, e — i). On basis of the described symptoms we can see that strains B 13 and B 15 produce the most severe anomalies. Besides the shoe-string leaf they cause also peculiar alterations of the stigma (formation of an aperture at the top of the stigma, of a great number of stigma tips). On the contrary the green strans Bll and B 12 are comparatively milder strains; they produce neither the shoe-string leaf nor the opening of the pistil. According to these considerable differences it is easy to differentiate strains B 13 and B 15 on the one hand from strains Bll and B 12 on the other hand. The point to stress is that deformations of leaf, flower and fruit of Datura stramonium, can arise in both groups of CMV strains, the green and the yellow. From these data we can see that the investigated strains on the leaf of Datura stramonium cause similar alterations to those which Lovi- solo and Benetti (1961) have described in Italy. Strains Bll, B 12, B 13 and B 15, according to the alterations which they cause on the leaf, the flower and the fruit of this plant, agree considerably with a group of CMV strains which Kovacevski (1965) has described in Bulgaria. As strain B 13 comes from England and strain Bll from Germany, we can conclude that the strains of CMV that cause deformations on Datura are spread all over Europe. On basis of the symptoms caused by strain B 15, that comes from USA, we can consider that these strains of CMV exist in America as well...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{dependence}} of maximum jump height on moment arms of m. gastrocnemius at the knee and ankle joint was investigated, using a forward dynamic simulation model of the human musculoskeletal system. Input of the model was the stimulation of six muscles of the lower extremity {{as a function of}} time, output was the movement of body segments. For many different combinations of moment arms, maximum jump <b>heigt</b> was determined by optimizing muscle stimulation. It was found that (1) maximum jump height depends on the combination of moment arms of m. gastrocnemius at the knee and ankle, (2) at a given moment arm at the ankle there is an optimal moment arm at the knee joint, and (3) this moment arm differs from zero, i. e. there is an advantage in the bi-articularity of m. gastrocnemius. This advantage, which amounted to less than 2 cm, was explained as follows. When m. gastrocnemius is bi-articular, it causes a particular combination of net joint moments at the knee and ankle joint during {{the last part of the}} push-off. This combination is such that the acceleration of the body's mass centre remains vertical, even at maximal stimulation of all muscles. Such a profitable situation cannot be achieved when m. gastrocnemius is mono-articular. Finally, it was shown that moment arm values derived from cadaver data reported in the literature were close to the optimal values determined for the model...|$|E
40|$|An {{increase}} in disc height, segmental lordosis or sagittal misalignement after total disc replacement (TDR) {{may lead to}} higher contact forces or capsule tensile forces in the facet joints of the segment L 5 /S 1. Therefore we investigated the correlation of these anatomical parameters to the clinical outcome of patients with TDR. 40 Patients suffering from degenerative disc disease or initial osteochondrosis at L 5 /S 1 were threated with TDR. In follow-up examinations radiographic analysis and clinical scores were examined. In radiographs the difference in disc <b>heigt,</b> segmental lordosis and sagittal vertebral misalignement to the preoperative state was measured. Clinical scores included ODI and VAS for overall, back, and leg pain. Depending on the clinical outcome patients {{divided into two groups}} (ODI 25 % group F) for correlation analysis to the radiographic parameters. We could examine 34 patients at a mean follow-up of 59. 5 month. 24 patients were assigned to group N, 10 patients to group F. However both groups had significant decrease of overall pain, back pain and ODI. In the correlation analysis patients with a larger disc height, increased lordosis, and posterior translation of the L 5 vertebra presented higher clinical scores. Comparing of these groups also showed significant differences of these parameters. We conclude that conditions with higher facet joint capsule tensile forces are a reason for clinical failure of TDR at L 5 /S 1. This failure can be eliminated by avoiding iatrogenic posterior translation and segmental overdistraction with consecutive hyperlordosis...|$|E

Material and Method: The patients over 65 years old {{were included in the}} study. Before examination, the definition of recurrent oral aphthous ulcers and a visual informatory form including photographs were presented to the subjects. The age, sex, height, weight of the subjects were noted on a chart. Then the history of recurrent oral aphthous ulcerations were asked and if present the frequency of the ulcers, the type of the ulcers, the localization of the ulcers, the subjective symptome of the ulcers, familial history for the ulcers, frequency of antibiotic usage, teeth brush habits and nutritional habits were examined by a questionnaire. Results: Eighty subjects completed the study. 31. 25 % of subjects declared recurrent oral ulcer history. Pain was the leading subjective symptome declared by 44 % of the subjects. 15 % of the subjects had a family history for recurrent oral ulcers. There was no correlation between frequency of antibiotic usage and history of RAS. Also, there was no correlation between teeth brush habits and history of RAS. The RAS group consumed tea and fizzdrinks more frequently whereas they consumed milk and milk products, walnut, bread and other grains more rarely. Discussion: Nutritional habits may have a role on ocurrence of reccurrent oral aphthous ulcerations.

40|$|Osteoporosis can be {{considered}} as a widespread disease among western industrial nations. Vertebral fractures (significant vertebral height reductions) are known to be among the most common complications. This explains an urge for early diagnosis of osteoporosis and for an early recognition of vertebral fractures as they can lead to subsequent fractures. This work examines a supposed connection between significant vertebral height reduction (defined as height loss > 20 %) and bone mineral density (BMD). Furthermore was examined if this supposed connection can be quantified in a linear correlation. 303 patients (252 women, 51 men, mean age 70 years) were retrospectively included in the study. In these patients the shape of vertebral bodies Th 4 – L 5 in previously acquired lateral x-ray images of the spine were analyzed using computer assisted quantitative vertebral morphometry. The BMD was measured using quantitative computed tomography (QCT) beforehand. A survey on the patients osteoporotic risk factors (using a categorial and metric designed questionnaire analogue to risk factors described by the DVO consensus on osteoporosis) showed an overall osteoporotic collective with statistically significant relations between BMD and risk factors. 202 patients (66, 6 %) showed significant vertebral height reduction (VHR) in 567 height reduced vertebral bodies altogether. These patients also had a significantly lower BMD (55, 88 mgHA/cm 3) compared to the group without significant vertebral <b>heigt</b> reduction (83, 47 mgHA/cm 3). Different computations of correlations showed no linear connection between QCT and Morphometry (Pearson´s correlation coefficient at max. : rP = - 0, 31). Non-linear significant connections can be shown in categorised patient groups: Patients with height reduction greater than 40 % (Genant score 3) showed a significantly lower BMD (39, 13 mgHA/cm 3) compared to the group with height reduction of 25 - 40 % (Genant score 2) with a mean BMD of 48, 05 mgHA/cm 3. Patients with height reduction of 20 - 25 % (Genant score 1) have a significantly higher BMD (mean 52, 52 mgHA/cm 3) than both other groups. In conclusion a quantitative correlation between BMD and vertebral height reduction evaluated by quantitative vertebral morphometry is weak. On the other hand a non-quantitativ connection can be found at a statistically significant level. The sole measurement of either BMD or height reduction is in accordance to the results of this thesis considered to be inferior to the combination of the methods as the findings suggest a connection of both methods, but cannot be significantly expressed in a quantitative correlation. Furthermore a visual evaluation of the x-ray image remains an absolute necessity for differential diagnostic considerations apart from the measurement of the bone mineral density...|$|E

40|$|An {{accurate}} satellite {{retrieval of}} cloud properties {{depends upon the}} detection and analysis of multilayered, overlapping cloud systems that surface observations show to be common. Multiple cloud layers are often found, for instance, in frontal situations, where cirrus overlays boundary layer convective cloud or low-to mid-level stratus cloud. Surface observers (Hahan et al., 1982) indicate that over ocean in the Northern Hemisphere between 30 deg. N and 60 deg. N, 51 percent of observations are of multilevel clouds. A satellite analysis by Coakley (1983) over the Pacific Ocean finds that more than 50 percent of 500 (250 sq km) frames exhibit evidence of multilayered cloud systems. The questions addressed {{in this study are}} the following: What error is introduced when inferring the cloud pressure from a Field-Of-View (FOV) that contains some arbitrary amount of transparent cloud overlaying a lower-level black cloud, such as stratus, by making the assumption that there is only a single cloud layer in the FOV, and what may be done to improve the cloud retrieval? The CO 2 slicing methods (e. g. McCleese and Wilson, 1976; Smith and Platt, 1978; Chahine, 1974) have been shown to provide accurate means of inferring cirrus cloud altitude from passive infrared radiance measurements. The CO 2 techniques have been applied to radiometric data from several instruments, notably the High Resolution Infrared Radiometric Sounder (HIRS/ 2, hereafter referred to as HIRS), the VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS) (e. g., Menzel et al., 1983; Wylie and Menzel, 1989), and most recently to the High Resolution Interferometer Sounder (HIS) (Smith and Frey, 1990). The methods take advantage of the fact that infrared CO 2 sounding channels spaced closely in wavenumber each have varying opacity to CO 2, thereby causing each channel to be sensitive to a different level in the atmosphere. The techniques {{have been shown to be}} effective for single-layered, nonblack, mid- to high-level clouds such as cirrus, but are generally applied operationally to any given cloud occurrence. The CO 2 slicing algorithms are most accurate for clouds than occur in a single, well-defined layer, or for multi-layered cloud cases in which the uppermost cloud layer is nearly black. Significant cloud height retrieval errors may ensue if the HIRS Field-Of-View (FOV) is cotaminated with low cloud. McCleese and Wilson (1976) have shown that the retrieved cloud height for the case of multiple cloud layers is a weighted average of the cloud heights actually present. The weight is approximately proportional to the product of the cloud <b>heigt</b> and the effective cloud amount. The effect of their result is that the uppermost cloud layer dominates the cloud pressure retrieval. Beyond stating that the higher cloud dominates the cloud pressure retrieval, there is no quantitative information to provide a way of estimating the errors in cloud pressure retrieval one should expect for certain common multilevel cloud situations or any suggestions on how to reduce the errors. In this paper we estimate the magnitude of the errors and use a simple algorithm to reduce the errors in optically thin cloud height retrival...|$|E

With the Bernese Mountain Dog 41, 1 % (216 / 525) of all joints were free of arthrosis, 21, 7 % (114 / 525) were suspicious. 19, 6 % (103 / 525) showed a low, 9, 5 % (50 / 525) a medium and 8, 0 % (42 / 525) a high degree of arthrotic changes. The joints of the Great Swiss Mountain Dog were free of arthrosis in 18 % (11 / 61) and in 41 % (25 / 61) suspicious. 26, 2 % (16 / 61) had a low, 9, 8 % (6 / 61) a medium and 4, 9 % (3 / 61) a high degree of arthrosis. The changes were bilateral for the Bernese Mountain Dog in 74, 1 % (80 / 108) and for the Great Swiss Mountain Dog in 64, 7 % (11 / 17) of the cases. Arthrotic changes were proved radiologic first on an age of 4 months. While the degree of arthrosis in the elbow joints of dogs under 9 months of age varied in the period of examination up to 4 degrees, it was constant in 68, 8 % (11 / 16) of the older animals, 25 % (4 / 16) showed an increase of one degree. Lameness resulting from pain in the elbow joint was found in 22 % (60 / 275) of the Bernese Mountain Dogs and in 15, 6 % (5 / 32) of the Great Swiss Mountain Dogs. The laming Bernese Mountain Dogs showed in 8, 4 % (9 / 107) arthrosis free, in 14 % (15 / 107) suspicious joints, 77, 6 % (83 / 107) were affected by arthrosis (30, 8 % low, 21, 5 % medium and 25, 2 % to a high grade). In lamefree Bernese Mountain Dogs 51, 5 % (190 / 369) of the elbow joints were free of arthrosis, 23, 6 % (87 / 369) were suspicious and 24, 9 % (92 / 369) had arthrotic changes (16, 0 % a low, 6, 0 % a medium and 2, 9 % a high degree). The height of the step between radius and coronoid process of the ulna appears as suitable parameter for an early diagnosis of fragmented coronoid process. According to radiographs in mediolateral projection in 10, 4 % (55 / 529) of the elbow joints of Bernese Mountain Dogs no step was prooved. 41, 6 % (220 / 529) had a step of 1 mm, 17, 8 % (94 / 529) of 1, 5 mm, 14, 2 % (75 / 529) of 2 mm, 8, 3 % (44 / 529) of 0, 5 mm and 4, 2 % (22 / 529) of 3 mm height. 1, 7 % (9 / 529) showed a step of 3, 5 - 4, 5 mm. In the Bernese Mountain Dog 60 % (33 / 55) of the stepless elbow joints, 48, 6 % (107 / 220) of the joints with 1 mm, 29, 8 % (28 / 94) of the joints with 1, 5 mm and 21, 3 % (16 / 75) of the joints with a 2 mm step were free of arthrosis. Corresponding the percentage of arthrotic joints went up with increasing height of the step. In the course of further controls on 3 - 4 month old Bernese Mountain Dogs with arthrotic free joints a positive correlation between an average monthly increase of the height of the step and the degree of arthrosis at the control examinations was noted. At a monthly increase of the <b>heigt</b> of the step of 0, 1 mm the joints remained free of arthrosis. At an increase of 0, 33 mm a low and at an increase of 1, 07 mm a high grade arthrosis was observed. The relation of the length of the trochlear notch to the length of the shortest distance between anconeal process and lateral coronoid process ("quotient") was determined as measurement for the shape of the trochlear notch and therefore for the risk of fragmentation of the coronoid process. At joints without arthrosis the trochlear notch appeared almost circular (median of the quotient on the Bernese Mountain Dog 1, 15, on the Great Swiss Mountain Dog 1, 22). With an increasing degree of arthrosis it became more of an elliptical form. The Bernese Mountain Dog had a quotient of 1, 16 in suspicious joints, of 1, 17 in joints with a low degree of arthrosis, of 1, 18 with a medium degree and of 1, 19 with a high degree of arthrosis (mean values). The mean values of Great Swiss Mountain Dogs were 1, 24 - suspicious, 1, 24 - of low degree, 1, 27 - of medium degree and 1, 30 - of high degree. For the Bernese Mountain Dog the mean value of the quotient was biggest at the age of 6 - 7 month (1, 19). It was for male dogs (1, 17) little larger than for bitches (1, 16). The degree of arthrotic changes also increased with a bigger size of the elbow joint (length of trochlear notch and length of distance between the tips of anconeal process and lateral coronoid process). Additional research was done in respect of the importance of the sex, body weight and rate of growth as well as food addition of minerals for the formation of disease of the elbow joints. The epiphyseal closure in the area of the elbow joint was also documented...|$|E
