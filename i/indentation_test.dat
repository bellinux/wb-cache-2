The load placed on the indenter tip is increased as the tip penetrates further into the specimen and soon reaches a user-defined value. At this point, the load may be held constant for a period or removed.

50|$|The Korsunsky work-of-indentation {{approach}} is a method of extracting a value of hardness for a small volume of material from <b>indentation</b> <b>test</b> data. Instead of relying on measurements or assumptions pertaining {{to the area of}} contact between indenter and sample, the method uses the load-displacement data registered in the continuously recorded indentation testing (CRIT) that is particularly widely applied in nanoindentation experiments. In particular, the method re-defines hardness and expresses it in terms of the energy (work) associated with indenting the surface of a material by the probe. The work-of-indentation used in the analysis may refer to the total, elastic or dissipated energy, depending on the formulation. The approach was found to be particularly useful in the analysis of thin coatings, nano-multi-layers, nanoscale features.|$|E

To this end, <b>indentation</b> <b>tests</b> have been systematically performed on coatings with yttria-stabilized zirconia top coat deposited by electron beam physical vapor deposition. Specimens in ‘‘as-coated” condition and after heat treatment in air have been studied. Unexpectedly, indentation of the heat-treated samples resulted in smaller delaminations than the as-coated samples, suggesting an increase in fracture toughness for coatings subjected to elevated temperatures. Careful image analyses of the cross-section of the indented area show that the ceramic top coat undergoes a complex damage evolution during indentation that is altered by thermal treatment. The consequences of this are discussed and we note that care must be taken when evaluating fracture parameters for multilayered structures based on <b>indentation</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|R

In 1925, Smith and Sandland of the UK developed an <b>indentation</b> <b>test</b> that employed a square-based pyramidal indenter made from diamond. They chose the pyramidal shape with an angle of 136° between opposite faces {{in order to obtain}} hardness numbers that would be {{as close as possible to}} Brinell hardness numbers for the specimen. The Vickers test has a great advantage of using one hardness scale to test all materials.The first reference to the Vickers indenter with low loads was made in the annual report of the National Physical Laboratory in 1932. Lips and Sack describes the first Vickers tester using low loads in 1936. There is some disagreement in the literature regarding the load range applicable to microhardness testing. ASTM Specification E384, for example, states that the load range for microhardness testing is 1 to 1000 gf. For loads of 1 kgf and below, the Vickers hardness (HV) is calculated with an equation, wherein load (L) is in grams force and the mean of two diagonals (d) is in millimeters: ...|$|E

There is still less research conducted toward foamed concrete under <b>indentation</b> <b>test.</b> It is stated that the standard method to obtain the compressive strength of foamed concrete based on ASTM C 39 standard or BS 1881 : Part 116 : 1983 is not captured the true compressive strength of foamed concrete. The compressive strength typically achieved low compressive strength and not behaves like a cellular material behavior. This result is due brittle collapse of the sample.

The output of a spherical <b>indentation</b> <b>test</b> {{is usually the}} load-penetration (P-h) curve.

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the tensile properties by spherical indentation {{is based on the}} relation of Tabor, which links the mean pressure and the indent diameter, obtained from <b>indentation</b> <b>tests,</b> to the stress and strain determined from a tensile test, respectively. However, in order to improve the indentation-tensile relationship, an additional correction related to the piling-up or sinking-in formation around the indent {{must be taken into account}} for the calculation of the strain by indentation. The correction factor is expressed as a function of the strain-hardening exponent. As a consequence, to validate such methodology, majority of the authors use the strain-hardening exponent previously determined by a tensile test. Unfortunately, this approach obviously impedes a direct construction of the tensile curve from <b>indentation</b> <b>tests</b> since the strain-hardening exponent will be undetermined. In addition, the tensile stress to mean pressure ratio is not a constant value because it depends on the mechanical properties and on the deformation regime. To circumvent these two problems, a simple expression of the mean pressure to stress ratio is proposed in macroindentation as a function of the strain-hardening exponent, which is determined by <b>indentation</b> <b>tests</b> using the relations of Hollomon and Ramberg-Osgood. This methodology, which allows the construction of the stress -strain curve only from <b>indentation</b> <b>tests,</b> is validated on a low-carbon steel and a commercial brass...|$|R

Review of previous studied reveals that <b>indentation</b> <b>testing</b> technique has been drawing increasing attempts in investigations of binder material mechanical properties. Various properties of bitumen, e. g. elastic, viscoelastic, have been successfully determined by <b>indentation</b> <b>testing</b> at different scales and test conditions. The response of bitumen to indentation was studied extensively under a wide range of test parameters such as temperature, loading rate, indenter geometry, etc. This experimental tool was also applied to asphalt cements grading and microstructure study. However, there have been limited numbers of studies at macro levels with the use of spherical indenters to characterize bitumen properties. This motivated the present study. Spherical indentations have been performed with balls of different curvature radii at - 5 oC. Load – displacement curves have been measured and used to determine the relaxation moduli of the studied bitumen. Repeatability of the measurements has been evaluated. Obtained results were compared with the observations from DSR relaxation test. The influence of the measurement scale and load level on the results of instrumented <b>indentation</b> <b>testing</b> has been investigated. It has been found that instrumented indentation was able to characterize accurately the viscoelastic behavior of bitumen which can be described by Prony series and agrees well with the results from DSR tests.

40|$|AbstractRate of area {{reduction}} {{is an important}} mechanical characterization to appraise the plasticity of metals, which is always obtained from the uniaxial tensile test. A methodology is proposed to determine the area reduction rate by continuous ball <b>indentation</b> <b>test</b> technique. The continuum damage accumulation theory has been adopted in this work to identify the failure point in the indentation. According to this theory, the damage is accumulated in the material during the test with voids nucleating and growing, which {{can be divided into}} two stages due to the variation in the degree of constraint. The turning point between two stages can be identified as the failure point where the material beneath the indenter collapses. The corresponding indentation depth of this point can be obtained and used to estimate the area reduction rate. The local strain limit criterion proposed in the ASME VIII- 2 2007 alternative rules is also adopted in this research to convert the multiaxial strain of <b>indentation</b> <b>test</b> to uniaxial strain of tensile test.
