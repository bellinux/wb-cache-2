40|$|Crop yields which {{determine}} {{farm income}} deficiency payments have been frozen at 1981 - 1985 levels since 1986. Data from a longitudinal survey of Ohio <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> are analyzed {{to evaluate whether}} updating payment yields will differentially affect <b>farm</b> <b>operators.</b> Results of the analysis imply that <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> who operate larger farms, live in counties with higher yields, and have higher fertilizer and pesticide expenses per acre of corn will benefit more. In addition, low (high) existing payment yields are understated (overstated) relative to updated payment yields. The Food Security Act of 1985 froze crop program payment yields, which in part determine farm in-come deficiency payments, at 1981 – 1985 levels (Glaser, p. 32). During debate on the Food, Agri-culture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (FACTA 1990), farm lobbyists argued that these program payment yields should be updated to re-flect a continuing improvement in actual crop yields. Primarily because of budgetary concerns, Congress did not mandate that payment yields be updated; but the Secretary of Agriculture was given discretionary power to update payment yields (FACTA 1990). While the policy debate has focused on budget-ary cost, updating program payment yields also may have differential impacts among farm opera-tors. For example, updating payment yields may benefit large <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> more than small <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> because large <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> may adopt new, yield improving technology more quickly.

40|$|Purpose: Although <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> have {{frequent}} {{exposure to}} hazardous noise and {{high rates of}} noise-induced hearing loss, they have low use of hearing protection devices (HPDs). Women represent about one-third of <b>farm</b> <b>operators,</b> and their numbers are climbing. However, among published studies examining use of HPDs in this worker group, none have examined gender-related differences. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine gender-related differences in use of hearing protection and related predictors among <b>farm</b> <b>operators.</b> Materials and Methods: Data previously collected at farm shows and by telephone were analyzed using t-tests and generalized linear model with zero inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution. Findings: The difference in rate of hearing protector use between men and women <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> was not significant. There was no difference between men and women in most hearing protector-related attitudes and beliefs. Conclusion: Although men and women <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> had similar rates of use of hearing protectors when working in high-noise environments, attitudes about HPD use differed. Specifically, interpersonal role modeling was a predictor of HPD use among women, but not for men. This difference suggests that while <b>farm</b> <b>operators</b> of both genders may benefit from interventions designed to reduce barriers to HPD use (e. g., difficulty communicating with co-workers and hearing warning sounds), farm women have unique needs in relation to cognitive-perceptual factors that predict HPD use.

40|$|While {{the growing}} {{importance}} of off-farm earnings suggests large benefits accrue to farmers from efforts to expand off-farm income opportunities, survival still depends on greater efficiency. To comprehensively gauge the economic health of <b>farm</b> <b>operator</b> households we interpret off-farm income as an output along with corn, soybeans, livestock, and other crops. To accomplish this task we use two related methodologies. First, using 2000 data, we setup a multiactivity cost function to analyze labor allocation decisions within the <b>farm</b> <b>operator</b> household {{and also to}} estimate returns to scale and scope. Second, using 1996 - 2000 data, we follow an input distance function approach to estimate returns to scale, technical progress, cost economies, and technical efficiency [...] and compare the relative performance of <b>farm</b> <b>operator</b> households with and without off-farm wages and salaries.
