25|$|When {{intermediates}} lay eggs, {{their eggs}} are often eaten by the egg laying wasp herself. This {{is known as}} oophagy. This may occur because this practice increases energy circulation.

This supports the idea that queens <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> control reproduction in the colonies. Intermediates know they are not in charge, so they consume their own eggs.|$|E

In 2001, she worked with Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) to write provisions into the No Child Left Behind Act (specifically sections 5131.a.23 and 5131c) authorizing single-sex education in public schools. Section 5131c required the Department of Education to write new regulations facilitating single-sex classrooms; this provision led to the publication of new regulations by the Department of Education in 2006 which <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> facilitate single-sex education in public schools.

25|$|Recent Mesothelae are {{characterized}} by the narrow sternum on the ventral side of the prosoma. Several plesiomorphic characteristics {{may be useful in}} recognizing these spiders: there are tergite plates on the dorsal side and the almost-median position of the spinnerets on the ventral side of the opisthosoma. Although it has been claimed that they lack venom glands and ducts, which almost all other spiders feature, subsequent works have demonstrated that at least some, possibly all, <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> have both the glands and ducts. All Mesothelae have eight spinnerets in four pairs. Like mygalomorph spiders, they have two pairs of book lungs.|$|E

25|$|Plasma-polymerized {{films have}} also found {{electrical}} applications. Given that plasma polymers frequently contain many polar groups, which form when the radicals react with oxygen in air during the polymerization process, the plasma polymers {{were expected to be}} good dielectric materials in thin film form. Studies have shown that the plasma polymers generally <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> have a higher dielectric property. Some plasma polymers have been applied as chemical sensory devices due to their electrical properties. Plasma polymers have been studied as chemical sensory devices for humidity, propane, and carbon dioxide amongst others. Thus far issues with instability against aging and humidity have limited their commercial applications.|$|E
25|$|Virginia Fortna of Columbia University, however, {{holds that}} {{peacekeeping}} interventions actually do substantively matter following {{the end of}} a civil war. She claims that selection bias, where opponents point only to failed peacekeeping interventions and do not compare these missions to those situations where interventions do not occur, is partly to blame for criticisms. Fortna says that peacekeeping missions rarely go into easily resolvable situations while they are sent into tougher, more risky post war situations where missions are more likely to fail, and peace agreements are unlikely to be committed to. When all factors of a certain peacekeeping case study are properly considered, Fortna shows that peacekeeping missions <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> help increase the chances of sustained peace after a civil war.|$|E
25|$|The color {{temperature}} {{of a light}} source is the temperature of an ideal black-body radiator that radiates light of a color {{comparable to that of}} the light source. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light that has important applications in lighting, photography, videography, publishing, manufacturing, astrophysics, horticulture, and other fields. In practice, {{color temperature}} is meaningful only for light sources that <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> correspond somewhat closely to the radiation of some black body, i.e., those on a line from reddish/orange via yellow and more or less white to blueish white; it does not make sense to speak of the color temperature of, e.g., a green or a purple light. Color temperature is conventionally expressed in kelvin, using the symbol K, a unit of measure for absolute temperature.|$|E

Of those inmates with the best scores, 98% <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> succeed on parole; and of those with the worst scores, only 24% <b>did</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> succeed (Burgess, 1928).|$|R

25|$|Most {{individuals}} <b>do,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> have a 2100-to-1 partition {{ratio in}} accordance with William Henry's law, which states that when the water solution of a volatile compound is brought into equilibrium with air, there is a fixed ratio between the concentration of the compound in air and its concentration in water. This ratio is constant at a given temperature. The human body is 37 degrees Celsius on average. Breath leaves the mouth at a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius. Alcohol in the body obeys Henry's Law {{as it is a}} volatile compound and diffuses in body water. To ensure that variables such as fever and hypothermia could not be pointed out to influence the results {{in a way that was}} harmful to the accused, the instrument is calibrated at a ratio of 2100:1, underestimating by 9 percent. In order for a person running a fever to significantly overestimate, he would have to have a fever that would likely see the subject in the hospital rather than driving in the first place. Studies suggest that about 1.8% of the population have a partition ratio below 2100:1. Thus, a machine using a 2100-to-1 ratio could actually overestimate the BAC. As much as 14% of the population has a partition ratio above 2100, thus causing the machine to under-report the BAC. Further, the assumption that the test subject's partition ratio will be average—that there will be 2100 parts in the blood for every part in the breath—means that accurate analysis of a given individual's blood alcohol by measuring breath alcohol is difficult, as the ratio varies considerably.|$|E
