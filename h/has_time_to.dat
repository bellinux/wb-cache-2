25|$|Taylor {{rejected}} the notion, which was universal {{in his day}} and still held today, that the trades, including manufacturing, were resistant to analysis and could only be performed by craft production methods. In {{the course of his}} empirical studies, Taylor examined various kinds of manual labor. For example, most bulk materials handling was manual at the time; material handling equipment {{as we know it today}} was mostly not developed yet. He looked at shoveling in the unloading of railroad cars full of ore; lifting and carrying in the moving of iron pigs at steel mills; the manual inspection of bearing balls; and others. He discovered many concepts that were not widely accepted at the time. For example, by observing workers, he decided that labor should include rest breaks so that the worker <b>has</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> recover from fatigue, either physical (as in shoveling or lifting) or mental (as in the ball inspection case). Workers were allowed to take more rests during work, and productivity increased as a result.|$|E

[...] David Miller of All About Jazz gave the album a mixed review, being critical of the entertainment value, stating that the performer [...] "is more introspective than ever, frequently using silence as his means of expression. The only problem is, it doesn't necessarily work." [...] Miller also suggested that [...] "Rubalcaba should develop his ideas in more conventional settings.

[...] In a separate review, Jim Santella, also of All About Jazz, praised Solo, commenting that Rubalcaba [...] "finds space in his exploratory interpretation for dreamy soliloquies, but the excitement is all there, and it's powerful. The pianist makes us wait for this moment, and it's always worth the anticipation. Ultimately he lights an inspiring fire." [...] Mark Corroto, in a third review of the album by All About Jazz, compared Rubalcaba's work to fellow Cuban artist Bebo Valdés, asseverating that both performers [...] "blurred the lines between jazz, classical and folk, easily convincing you there need be no distinction."
