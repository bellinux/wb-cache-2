60|$|MRS. DUDGEON. He {{had nothing}} of <b>his</b> <b>own.</b> <b>His</b> <b>money</b> was the money I brought him as my {{marriage}} portion. It {{was for me}} {{to deal with my}} <b>own</b> <b>money</b> and my <b>own</b> son. He dare not have done it if I had been with him; and well he knew it. That was why he stole away like a thief {{to take advantage of the}} law to rob me by making a new will behind my back. The more shame on you, Mr. Anderson,--you, a minister of the gospel--to act as his accomplice in such a crime.|$|R
5|$|As Bishop of Aberdeen, Lichton {{was one of}} its {{greatest}} builders. The Aberdeen Registrum noted {{that he began to}} rebuild the cathedral, and Hector Boece gave a description of his rebuilding, noting that although he finished the walls and two belltowers, the third belltower remained unfinished at his death. Licthon also constructed a new chapel dedicated to St John the Evangelist, and donated much of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> to new service books and vestments, {{as well as to the}} reconstruction of the cathedral. He also authored several legal and religious texts, though none have survived.|$|E

5|$|By {{the early}} 1730s public taste for Italian opera was {{beginning}} to fade. The popular success of John Gay and Johann Christoph Pepusch's The Beggar's Opera (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the Opera of the Nobility, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in doing so.|$|E
50|$|As {{the head}} of a cost {{reduction}} consulting firm, Schneider is frugal and creative about saving <b>his</b> <b>own</b> company <b>money,</b> and sometimes buys used office furniture for discounted prices from other companies that are going out of business or downsizing.|$|R

Franks had been a last-minute choice because New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman had been expected {{to run for the}} Senate. The record $62million amount surpassed Michael Huffington, who spent nearly $28million in an unsuccessful 1994 Senate race.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} trials Sissoi Veliky {{was ordered to}} join the Mediterranean Squadron which was engaged in the naval {{blockade}} of Crete {{in the wake of}} the 1896 Cretan riots and the Hamidian massacres. Her maiden voyage revealed more problems; the lack of ventilation in the steering compartment was so appalling that during the first port call the captain purchased electric fans with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> and the electrical systems failed one by one before reaching Gibraltar. The copper rings for sealing the portholes were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Favaloro {{established}} the 'Basic Investigation Laboratory' (Laboratorio de Investigación Básica), which was long financed with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> and which, at the time, depended upon {{the support of}} the Research and Teaching Department of the Fundación Favaloro. Subsequently it became the Institute of Research in Basic Sciences of the University Institute of Biomedical Sciences (Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias Básicas del Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Biomédicas) which in turn, was transformed into the Universidad Favaloro in August 1998.|$|E

50|$|This {{case was}} brought to trial by a private {{individual}} (businessman Hugh Glenister) using <b>his</b> <b>own</b> personal <b>money</b> (ZAR 3.5 million) to fund the case. The money retrieved from the victory is to be placed into a trust for use on similar cases in future.|$|R
5|$|Anderson had a final {{meeting with}} the Schanzkowski family in 1938. Gertrude Schanzkowska was insistent that Anderson was her sister, Franziska, but the Nazi {{government}} had arranged the meeting to determine Anderson's identity, and if accepted as Schanzkowska she would be imprisoned. The Schanzkowski family refused to sign affidavits against her, and no further action was taken. In 1939, World War II began with Germany's attack on the western half of Poland. In 1940, Edward Fallows died virtually destitute after wasting all <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> on trying to obtain the Tsar's non-existent fortune for the Grandanor Corporation. Towards {{the end of the}} war, Anderson lived at Schloss Winterstein with Louise of Saxe-Meiningen, in what became the Soviet occupation zone.

5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further {{attempts were made to}} secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer {{in the absence of a}} request to do so by the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born in Huntington on Long Island, Whitman {{worked as}} a journalist, a teacher, a {{government}} clerk, and—in addition to publishing his poetry—was a volunteer nurse during the American Civil War. Early in his career, he also produced a temperance novel, Franklin Evans (1842). Whitman's major work, Leaves of Grass, {{was first published in}} 1855 with <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> The work was an attempt at reaching out to the common person with an American epic. He continued expanding and revising it until his death in 1892. After a stroke towards the end of his life, he moved to Camden, New Jersey, where his health further declined. When he died at age 72, his funeral became a public spectacle.|$|E

60|$|The Marquis {{collected}} himself. Colonel Laycey {{had been}} asked three hundred a year and was paying two hundred, a sum which, somehow or other, the Marquis had always considered <b>his</b> <b>own</b> pocket <b>money,</b> and which had never gone into the estate accounts. A little increase would certainly be pleasant.|$|R

5|$|Charlie {{is pouring}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> into the factory to ensure {{it will be}} ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily forcing his staff to redo what he {{considers}} to be shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E
5|$|In 1925, Kimball and Joseph W. Greenhalgh, a Latter-day Saint {{businessman}} {{who served as}} a bishop in one of the local wards, began a small securities business making and purchasing loans from local businesses and individuals. By 1927, the business became independent, and after investing $150 of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> in the business, Kimball began running it full-time in Safford, Arizona, as the KimballGreenhalgh Agency, dealing in local insurance, real estate, debt collection, and bonds. The business suffered greatly during the Great Depression and lost much of its capital between 1930 and 1933. Through continued work and re-investment of profits, it survived the Great Depression and became increasingly successful during the late 1930s and early 1940s. By 1943, Kimball's initial $150 investment in the agency was worth nearly $100,000.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, Julian founded his own {{research}} firm, Julian Laboratories, Inc. He brought {{many of his}} best chemists, including African-Americans and women, from Glidden to his own company. Julian won a contract to provide Upjohn with $2 million worth of progesterone (equivalent to $ million today). To compete against Syntex, {{he would have to}} use the same Mexican yam Mexican barbasco trade as his starting material. Julian used <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> and borrowed from friends to build a processing plant in Mexico, but he could not get a permit from the government to harvest the yams. Abraham Zlotnik, a former Jewish University of Vienna classmate whom Julian had helped escape from the Holocaust, led a search to find a new source of the yam in Guatemala for the company.|$|E

25|$|Thus, for example, the {{insolvent}} cannot compel {{payment of}} money due {{in terms of}} a post-sequestration partnership entered into with the trustee’s consent, since there is no statutory provision which entitles him to recover for <b>his</b> <b>own</b> benefit <b>money</b> due under a partnership. Only the trustee can demand this payment.|$|R
25|$|When the theatres were reopened at the Restoration in 1660, Jordan again {{focused his}} {{energies}} on the drama, writing two plays and a masque {{as well as}} numerous drolls, afterpieces, prologues and epilogues, and also doing some acting. He played the part of Captain Penniless in <b>his</b> <b>own</b> play <b>Money</b> is an Ass (1668).|$|R
5|$|Orr {{has been}} known to be {{fiercely}} loyal to former Bruin personnel and teammates. When Derek Sanderson had alcohol and prescription drug-abuse problems and wound up penniless, Orr spent <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> to ensure that Sanderson successfully completed rehab. Decades later, Orr and Sanderson went into business together managing finances for hockey players. Orr also helped out Bruins trainer John (Frosty) Forristall, his roommate during his first years with the Bruins, who had just been fired from the Tampa Bay Lightning for alcoholism in 1994. Forristall's drinking put him on bad terms with his brother John, so he returned to Boston jobless and soon afterwards was diagnosed with brain cancer. Orr took Forristall into his home for a year until he {{died at the age of}} 51. Orr was a pallbearer at his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Romney raised $56million during 2011, {{more than}} double the amount raised by any of his Republican opponents, and refrained from {{spending}} <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money</b> on the campaign. He initially pursued a low-key, low-profile strategy. Michele Bachmann staged a brief surge in polls, which preceded a poll surge in September 2011 by Rick Perry who had entered the race the month before. Perry and Romney exchanged sharp criticisms of each other during a series of debates among the Republican candidates. The October 2011 decisions of Chris Christie and Sarah Palin not to run effectively settled the field of candidates. Perry faded after poor performances in those debates, while Herman Cain's 'long-shot' bid gained popularity until allegations of sexual misconduct derailed it.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher and Lloyd Webber {{restarted}} {{development for}} The Phantom of the Opera in December 2002. It was then announced in January 2003 that Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group had purchased the film rights from Warner Bros. {{in an attempt}} to produce The Phantom of the Opera independently. As a result, Lloyd Webber invested $6 million of <b>his</b> <b>own</b> <b>money.</b> The Phantom of the Opera was produced on a $55 million budget. A further $15 million was used for marketing, bringing the final budget to $70 million. Warner Bros. was given a first look deal for distribution; the studio did not sign on until June 2003, when the principal cast was chosen.|$|E
