500|$|The teaser was {{presented}} to the network on May 2, 2007. Nellie Andreeva of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Dawn Ostroff, president of The CW at the time, had responded positively to the new concept. The series's title might have been changed if the FBI idea had been accepted. The CW had recently cancelled Gilmore Girls, leading some news outlets to speculate that Veronica Mars might be renewed in order to fill a schedule hole. Several cast members, including Gonzalo and Lowell, had taken other acting opportunities in anticipation of the series's cancellation. Nevertheless, Thomas stated, [...] "I don't think we're dead; <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> our chances." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} cultural {{references to}} many American and British films. Woods becoming {{a convenience store}} clerk {{to prepare for a}} film is similar to Nick Lang (Michael J. Fox) becoming a police officer in the 1991 film The Hard Way, which Woods also starred in (interestingly, this is a reversal of roles: Woods played the cop that Lang was saddled with in the film). When Kent asks Homer if he is willing to go undercover to [...] "nail" [...] Apu, Homer replies: [...] "No way, man, get yourself another patsy!" [...] This is a reference to a line in the 1991 film JFK. The scene of Homer and Apu riding on mules to the Springfield Airport, with their luggage strapped to the mules' backs, is similar to a scene from the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. In his Kwik-E-Mart job interview, the interviewer asks Woods why he would want to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, to which he replies: [...] "To be honest, in my upcoming movie I'm going to be playing this tightly-wound convenience store clerk and, <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> to research my roles and really get into it. For instance, in True Believer I actually worked in a law firm for two months. And then, the film Chaplin I had a little cameo in that. I actually traveled back in time, back to the twenties, where... Well, I've said too much," [...] referencing the 1989 film True Believer and the 1992 film Chaplin.|$|E

So <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>liked</b> him." ...|$|R

[...] "But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, first <b>of</b> all, <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>liked</b> 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later?

2500|$|While Dino De Laurentiis gave Raimi and {{his crew}} freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production. Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut {{because it did not}} like his {{original}} ending, feeling it was negative. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with Bridget Fonda. Raimi recalls, [...] "Actually, <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> {{the fact that there are}} two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero".|$|E

[...] He told The Telegraph that he was inspired by his half-brother. According to Time, George [...] "has repeatedly denied... that he feels abandoned by Obama." [...] CNN quoted him as saying, [...] "I was brought up well. I live well even now. The magazines, they have exaggerated everything – I think <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> it here.

He had been accepted to Antioch (his brother's alma mater) while in high school. His interests led him to the theater department and then to broadcasting. He changed his major to Literature and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950.

50|$|Help Wanted Nights is {{the fourth}} album by the Omaha-based band The Good Life, {{released}} on September 11, 2007 on Saddle Creek Records. Currently, frontman Tim Kasher has moved to Los Angeles and has written a screenplay entitled Help Wanted Nights. He has stated that the screenplay acts as a 'counterpart' to the album:I tried to have the songs be less storytelling, and less narrative...since I was writing this fictionalized counterpart to this thing, <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>liked</b> the idea <b>of</b> writing songs to exist more as ideas that complement something else that was written.

She may turn out all right. Of course, she has a queer way of expressing herself--a little too--well, too kind of forcible, you know; but she'll likely get over that now that she's come to live among civilized folks. And then, her temper's pretty quick, I guess; but there's one comfort, a child that has a quick temper, just blaze up and cool down, ain't never likely to be sly or deceitful.

500|$|The {{character}} {{has also become}} a fashion trend. In 2008, American fashion designer Marc Jacobs donned a SpongeBob tattoo on his right arm.

I didn't understand it, but he did and then <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>liked</b> the guy, <b>I</b> dug the guy, and I listened to his music, I liked the music. So I said alright, I'll do it, even though I didn't know what I was going to do. So I said to my wife, 'I'm doing this thing with this guy Wale' and she said, 'Wale is my favorite Hip Hop artist. I have every single thing.' Somehow, she missed anything {{that had to do with}} me, but has every other cut, everything else he's done.

5000|$|... "The character's {{evolution}} {{over the}} season hasn't really surprised me,' he continues. 'I've been excited {{about what the}} writers have written for him, but it wasn't really surprising. I figured {{that was the only}} way he could go, which was to become a little bit lighter. Once in a while <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> it that he thinks he's got a place in life, that this is his journey and he's going to follow that journey, no questions asked. He's going to question everything else and defy all authority. <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> that, because even when he doesn't want to do something, I figured he would go against his heart and do what he felt he was meant to do. In one sense it's admirable, but in another it's kind of ignorant and stupid. <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> that loyalty on his part, but that's slowly going to be broken down with the relationship with Maria and Max and Isabel, which will force him to kind of embrace the human side of life more. That's going to be the real ultimate struggle for him. I don't think you can ride the fence on that one; you're going to have to fully embrace your alienhood or kind of go the other way, and I don't think, mentally for the health of the character, that he can just stay with his alienhood. Overall, I think a choice will have to be made and that's what he'll struggle with." [...] Brendan Fehr, from [...] "Roswell: Brendan Fehr" [...] by Edward Gross ...|$|E
