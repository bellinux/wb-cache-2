50|$|In forward flight, a helicopter's flight {{controls}} behave more {{like those in}} a fixed-wing aircraft. Moving the cyclic forward makes the nose pitch down, thus losing altitude and increasing airspeed. Moving the cyclic back makes the nose pitch up, slowing the helicopter and making it climb. Increasing collective (power) while maintaining a constant airspeed induces a climb, while decreasing collective (power) makes the helicopter descend. Coordinating these two inputs, <b>down</b> <b>collective</b> plus aft (back) cyclic or up collective plus forward cyclic causes airspeed changes while maintaining a constant altitude. The pedals serve the same function in both a helicopter and an airplane, to maintain balanced flight.

50|$|Sporadic riots {{occurred}} in the February - April 1930 in different areas of southern and south-western Mongolia. The main uprising began on April 10 or 11th 1932 in the Khyalganat monastery of Rashaant sum in Khövsgöl aimag, and spread quickly to neighbouring monasteries. The insurgents founded a high command under the name ‘’Ochirbatyn yaam’’ (Ochirbat’s ministry), and began arming the local lamas and lay people, burning <b>down</b> <b>collective</b> and sum centres, and killing opponents, especially targeting officials, party and youth league members who actively fought with religion for introduction of socialism. The rebellion quickly dispersed in aimags of Arkhangai, Övörkhangai, Zavkhan and Dörböt. The first response by the Mongolian government was {{the establishment of an}} extraordinary commission headed by J. Lkhümbe, and the deployment of armed units by the Ministry of the Interior in Ulaanbaatar, on April 15/16th. Main powers of the rebels were difeated to July, and the government started to withdraw troops. In August, however, the rebellion resumed starting again from the south of Khövsgöl and the north of Arkhangai aimags. It is supposed that the Mongolian rebels have connection with similar uprising in Tuva.|$|E

40|$|The {{first section}} of this article recalls the most {{important}} organisational features of the cross-industry players in the European social dialogue (UNICE, UEAPME, CEEP). Four sectoral employer federations (WEM, Euratex, FIEC, EuroCommerce), selected on grounds of the specific nature of their profile, are also analysed here {{in view of the}} increasing importance currently taken on by the sectoral social dialogue. The second part of the article reports on the achievements of the social dialogue as seen by the employers. This dialogue has seen at least two salient events: in 1991, when the cross-industry social partners signed an agreement laying <b>down</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining practices; and more recently when a first voluntary agreement on telework was concluded. This agreement represents for the European employers, as for the trade unions, a radical change in terms of affirming their autonomy in drawing up their work programme and in the way that negotiated solutions are implemented. This has also been a period of consolidation for UNICE as a body representing Europe's employers, while CEEP has embarked on new – territorial – forms of representation. As for UEAPME, a peripheral body in the early 1990 s, it has gradually asserted itself as a fully-fledged protagonist in the social dialogue...|$|E

50|$|The Howard government, {{before being}} elected in 1996, had promised {{significant}} industrial relations reform. In January 1997 it substantially amended the Industrial Relations Act, and renamed it the Workplace Relations Act 1996. The stated {{aim of this}} legislation was to foster individual choice in workplace bargaining by reducing the powers of external organisations, particularly trade unions, to intervene. In addition, the legislation reduced powers of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to arbitrate disputes. The Act also introduced individual statutory employment contracts.

5000|$|Madhuram Gayathi (1990) {{has been}} termed as [...] "a fantastic allegory fusing mythology, spirituality and ecology".

Vijayan's last novel Thalamurakal (Generations; 1997) is autobiographical to a great extent. It is historical to a still greater extent.

40|$|We {{study the}} temperature-dependent {{molecular}} dynamics, ion conduction, and phase behavior of plastic-crystal electrolytes {{based on the}} succinonitrile molecule. We employ calorimetry and dielectric spectroscopy to probe binary mixtures of succinonitrile with glutaronitrile or acetonitrile and also analyze the effect of dissolving lithium salts in these systems. The glutaronitrile-succinonitrile mixture has the highest conductivity, {{and it is the}} only plastic-crystal system that displays a perfect correlation between the ion drift and the on-site reorientational dynamics. Doping with lithium ions boosts the conductivity but breaks such perfect correlation. All of these features can be rationalized by assuming that conduction is due to the self-diffusion of a minority of ionized dinitrile molecules. Doping with lithium salts slows <b>down</b> the <b>collective</b> molecular dynamics while leaving the intramolecular relaxation motion unaffected. All samples exhibit a very broad melting transition and exist in a mixed liquid plus plastic state near room temperature. Some mixtures undergo phase segregation below 233 K, the transition temperature between the plastic and the fully ordered solid phase in pure succinonitrile, resulting in the appearance of a space-charge relaxation loss. Phase separation therefore {{plays an important role in}} pristine and lithium-doped succinonitrile mixtures. Postprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE: {{this paper}} wants to {{contribute}} to providing a legal framework for research work carried out in companies and the private sector. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: after providing the theoretical framework, an analysis is supplied of all measures – including financial ones – related to the promotion of research work in companies and the private sector, more generally. FINDINGS: the idea of research in Italy is still closely associated with academia and this might hamper the establishment of company-based researchers and cooperation {{between the public and}} the private sector, especially without the setting up of a legal and institutional framework that puts private research work on an equal footing with public research. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: this research calls for the need to bring together academia and industry by putting in place a set of rules regulating research work at companies and in the private sector, more broadly, according to the European Charter for Researchers. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: {{for the first time in}} Italy, non-academic research work is analyzed in a systematic framework covering legislation and rules laid <b>down</b> by <b>collective</b> bargaining.

[...] Richard Feast During a support race for touring cars, Swiss driver Joe Huber went off the track into a lamp post. He died six days later {{as a result of}} his injuries. The {{difficulty}} of implementing adequate safety measures, along with concerns that the Grand Prix was promoting reckless driving, led to motor racing being banned in Singapore after the 1973 Grand Prix. Other contributory factors have been suggested, including an increase in traffic, the inconvenience of having to close roads for the event and also a surge of oil prices stemming from the Suez Crisis. On average the Grand Prix saw one fatality per year, partly due to the nature of the circuit which featured monsoon drains and bus stops. Graeme Lawrence, a three-time winner of the Singapore Grand Prix, believed that the Thomson Road circuit was one of the most dangerous in the world.|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} {{with high levels}} of violence, economic growth can be slowed <b>down,</b> personal and <b>collective</b> security eroded, and social development impeded. Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner. Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth. For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending. The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of union elections, CALRA's effect on union {{membership}} seems mixed at best. Much of this evidence focuses on the UFW, assumed to be the prime beneficiary of the Act. Membership in the UFW fell from a high of more than 70,000-60,000 in 1972 to a low of 6,000-5,000 in 1974, but rose to just 18,000 by 1977. The Teamsters, however, had more than 55,000 farm worker members by 1977. The UFW had only six major collective bargaining agreements by 1994 (one vegetable grower, four citrus growers, one mushroom grower, and a host of small nurseries). However, one study concludes that mass importation and use of illegal immigrants—not flaws in CALRA—are holding <b>down</b> additional <b>collective</b> bargaining gains. Others conclude (on the basis of anecdotal evidence) that the Teamsters have signed sweetheart deals with perhaps as many as 375 growers, holding down membership gains for the UFW. Others criticize the ALRB for being politicized. [...] Critics point to the change in the Board in 1980, when George Deukmejian, the new Republican governor of California, replaced the Brown board with allegedly pro-grower members, leading to low union confidence in the Board's impartiality and a severe {{decline in the number of}} election petitions brought before the board.|$|R
