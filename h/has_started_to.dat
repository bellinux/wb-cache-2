5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked flames of gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend <b>has</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E

However, most nightclubs have a restriction on unescorted males. Alcohol is widely available in tourist restaurants, liquor stores and even some supermarkets.

Moreover, seaside recreation is present on the shores of Aqaba and the Dead Sea through several international resorts.|$|E

Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Lothian.

Each type of bus owned directly by Lothian Buses has had at least one of their type painted in the new livery.|$|E

Jules is able to relate well to Glenn, particularly because Glenn {{seems to have a}} mother-son bond with her son, Gabriel, as close as Jules has with Travis. Ellie (Christa Miller) is skeptical about Glenn's qualifications, and jealous that Jules now prefers to talk about her problems with Glenn instead of her.|$|E
5|$|Dave Piaseki (Steven Demarco) and Linda Chapman (Zakiya Cook) {{are found}} shot dead {{in their car}} at Fairmount Park. When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and detectives Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) arrive, they think the case is a Murder–suicide, but Megan finds two bullets in Dave and concludes that someone murdered them. Megan meets Linda's parents, Al (Barry Shabaka Henley) and Laura (Brenda Pressley), and tells them the news, leaving them devastated. Megan links Linda's ex-boyfriend Brian Hall (Brian White) to Dave and finds out that Dave was at Brian's {{restaurant}} the night he died. However, Brian has an alibi as he was with employee Nina Wheeler (Sherri Saum). The police find out that Linda {{used to work at}} Brian's restaurant and received psychological abuse until Dave found out and confronted him. Brian <b>has</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> abuse Nina, so the police get Nina away from Brian, as he caused Linda to suffer from bulimia due to the abuse.|$|E

5|$|Later, a huge onboard {{television}} screen displays an emergency message {{from a military}} officer, warning the crew and passengers about a deadly virus that <b>has</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> spread on the mainland. He says that all ships must remain at sea to ensure that humanity survives. The message is actually taken from a movie in the Simpson cabin's DVD library, set up by Bart to broadcast all over the ship. He also disables communications with the mainland by pouring hot fudge on a control panel. As the ship stays at sea, conditions deteriorate and the food supply starts to run out. Eventually, the cruise turns into a post-apocalyptic civilization, with gladiator arenas, marauders, capital punishment, and Priddis claiming kingship over the passengers.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure <b>has</b> <b>started</b> <b>to</b> improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E
