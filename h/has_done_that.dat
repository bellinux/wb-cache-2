Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "If this second installment spends {{too much time}} recapping events from book one, it doesn't disappoint when it segues into the pulse-pounding action readers have come to expect." [...] Booklist commented on how the [...] "unadorned prose provides an open window to perfect pacing and electrifying world building". The New York Times also gave a positive review, writing, [...] "Collins <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> rare thing. She has written a sequel that improves upon the first book. As a reader, I felt excited and even hopeful: {{could it be that}} this series and its characters were actually going somewhere?" [...] The review also praised Collins' development of the character of Katniss. The Plain Dealer wrote, [...] "The very last sentence of Catching Fire will leave readers gasping. Not to mention primed for part three." ...|$|E
500|$|Rain in England {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} referenced for its uniqueness and its demonstration of Lil B's {{broad range of}} styles. Hip hop writer Andrew Nosnitsky remarked in The Wire that Lil B was likely the only rapper who could pull off both an ambient release on Weird Forest and a collaboration with Soulja Boy in the same year. The San Francisco Bay Guardian said the album demonstrated Lil B's unpredictability; similarly, SF Weekly called it [...] "a different beast entirely" [...] {{from the rest of}} his work. In Seattle Weekly, Eric Grandy called Rain in England an [...] "oddity" [...] and said Lil B's music is better served by randomly listening to him on YouTube then in a long-form album format. In a 2012 profile of Lil B's career so far, The Wires Lisa Blanning said the album [...] "feels like a new musical expression." [...] Lil B himself described Rain in England as [...] "my favorite work ... I think that's my most powerful work, to myself. ... That's my favorite, because I know no one else <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> and that's what I'm most proud of, when I do things that I know nobody else has done before." ...|$|E

None has been needed....obody has a right to dismiss the doctrine of the limitedness, or particularity, of atonement as a monstrosity of Calvinistic logic until he has refuted Owen's proof that it is part of the uniform biblical presentation of redemption, clearly taught in plain text after plain text. And nobody <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> yet." [...] It should be noted of course that those who oppose the doctrine would disagree that Owen has [...] "proved" [...] anything from [...] "plain text after plain text," [...] maintaining that instead he has misinterpreted his texts; they would also disagree with the assertion that [...] "no one <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> [...] yet." ...|$|E

On February 17, 2012, DeWine announced he was retracting his endorsement of Mitt Romney and endorsed Rick Santorum. DeWine said, [...] "To be elected president, you have to do more than tear down your opponents. You have to give the American people a reason to vote for you, a reason to hope, a reason to believe that under your leadership, America will be better. Rick Santorum <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that.</b> Sadly, Governor Romney has not." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his tenure}} on the War Labor Board, Feinsinger helped settle {{a number of}} {{important}} strikes. [...] In November 1944, he settled a national strike by telephone switchboard operators belonging to the National Federation of Telephone Workers which had shut down telephone service in Washington, D.C., Detroit and other large cities. Feinsinger told the union leaders that they were defying the government of the United States and [...] "no union <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that</b> yet and succeeded." [...] On November 24, telephone workers in Dayton ended their walk-out and the nationwide strike collapsed. President Roosevelt specifically praised Feinsinger for his role in ending the dispute.|$|E

[...] The CBS Evening News had increased its audience every year from 2011 through 2015. On May 29, 2015, the media website, The Wrap, wrote: [...] "These days, CBS brass may finally {{have a reason to}} smile.

This is something that he really was going to promote and support, and he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> and in a sense he is the abortion president." [...] Among others, Rep. Janice Hahn complained because Dobson used the National Day of Prayer for partisan purposes. She said, [...] "Dobson just blew a hole into this idea of being a nonpartisan National Day of Prayer. It was very disturbing to me...and really a shame. James Dobson hijacked the National Day of Prayer — this nonpartisan, nonpolitical National Day of Prayer — to promote his own distorted political agenda." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{earlier and}} European marches recapitulate {{back to the}} {{beginning}} of the march. These marches typically did not use the Military March Form, but rather a shorter form such as the one directly above or the regimental march form. In other words, after either the final trio, or 'D' section, the march would start over again. Once it <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> repeats are ignored, and ends after the second strain. Codas are rare, but sometimes used as well, for example in [...] "Riders for the Flag" [...] by Sousa and [...] "Children of the Shrine" [...] by James Swearingen. The tradition of recapitulating marches ended at the start of the march music era. For example, John Philip Sousa abandoned this technique with all of his marches, except for [...] "On Parade," [...] one of Sousa's few circus marches. In fact, only Victor Herbert was one of the last American composers who still used recapitulation during the march music era. Examples of these marches include [...] "Under the Double Eagle" [...] by Wagner and [...] "The Serenade" [...] by Victor Herbert.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} accused Adventists of giving Satan {{the status of}} sin-bearer {{alongside}} Jesus Christ. Adventists have responded by insisting that Satan is not a saviour, nor does he provide atonement for sin; Christ alone is the substitutionary sacrifice for sin, but holds no responsibility for it. In the final judgment, responsibility for sin is passed back to Satan who first caused mankind to sin. [...] As the responsible party, Satan receives the wages for his sin – namely, death. Jesus alone bore the wage of death for the sinful world, while the guilt of sin is ultimately disposed of on Satan who carried the responsibility of [...] "leading the whole world astray." [...] Thus, the unsaved are held {{responsible for their own}} sin, while the saved depend on Christ's righteousness. The SDA Sabbath School quarterly, 2013 asks the question, [...] "Does Satan then play a role in our salvation, as some falsely charge we teach? Of course not. Satan never, in any way, bears sin for us as a substitute. Jesus alone <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>that,</b> and it is blasphemy to think that Satan had any part in our redemption." ...|$|E
