Papaya was planted between two litchi plants in each line and <b>Indian</b> <b>spinach</b> varieties were grown in the inter-space of two lines of litchi plant as well as control (farmer’s practice) in May 2012. Yield and yield contributing characters of <b>Indian</b> <b>spinach</b> varieties grown as litchi-papaya based agroforestry system and control did not vary. However, sprout plant- 1 and sprout weight of <b>Indian</b> <b>spinach</b> varieties grown in litchi-papaya based system were significantly influenced while the other parameters did not vary. Sprout plant- 1 of KS green (2. 97) and local (2. 89) variety were identical but higher over KS red variety (2. 57). Sprout weight of KS red variety was the highest (85. 80 g) while KS green and local variety gave lower and identical sprout weight. Though the yield did not vary among the varieties, KS red gave the highest yield (36. 32 t ha- 1) followed by local (34. 61 t ha- 1) and KS green (34. 00 t ha- 1). In case of growth of litchi, plant height and stem diameter increment were 21. 39 and 44. 94 % over the eleven months observation period. The yield of papaya was quite satisfactory with an average 42 fruits per plant with 23. 71 t ha- 1. Therefore, in the Litchi-Papaya-Indian spinach based system, <b>Indian</b> <b>spinach</b> varieties could be ranked as KS red > Local> KS green...|$|E

The lowest weed dry matter was 76. 3 g m- 2 in 2005 and l 01. 60 g m- 2 in 2006 from the plots weeded up to 40 days after transplanting (DAT). The highest yields were obtained (74. 82 t ha in 2005 and 48. 48 t ha in 2006) from the weed free plots. The fresh yield of <b>Indian</b> <b>spinach</b> did not vary among no weeding upto 20, 30 and 40 DAT in 2006. But weeded plot upto 30 and 40 DAT produced identical yield in 2005. Maximum BCR (4. 52) was obtained from weeded plots upto 30 DAT in 2005 but BCR (2. 60) was same from weeded upto 30 and 40 DA F in 2006. On an average, highest BCR (3. 55) was recorded from weeding upto 30 DAT. Results revealed that the critical period of crop weed competition lies between 20 and 30 DAT and two times hand weeding would be necessary within 30 DAT for maximum benefit.

40|$|Leaf is {{a source}} organ that serves dual {{function}} in photosynthesis and transpiration. As a primary interface between plant and ecosystem, it performs a range of biological processes from carbon assimilation and metabolite partitioning to plant productivity. Basic features of the leaf functionality are conserved in angiosperms exhibiting common and unique characteristics. Spinach has been the model crop for studying leaf function, primarily photosynthesis. It is a reservoir of several hundreds of primary and secondary biomolecules. To better understand the molecular basis for photochemical reaction and metabolic partitioning, we developed leaf proteome of <b>Indian</b> <b>spinach</b> (Beta vulgaris var. all green). LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis identified 639 proteins exhibiting discrete molecular features and functions, including photosynthesis, transpiration, gaseous exchange, transport, redox status, cell defense, and floral induction besides the presence of proteins with unknown function. This represents the first comprehensive foliage proteome of green leafy vegetable. Together, this work provides important insights into the molecular networks underlying spinach leaf biological processes...|$|E

40|$|Occurrence of fungi {{associated}} with {{two species of}} Basella and their pathogenic potentiality is reported. A total of 12 species of fungi representing 8 genera of the class deuteromycetes {{were found to be}} {{associated with}} Basella alba L. and B. rubra L [...] The genus Basella belongs to the Basellaceae family and has two chief cultivars, Basella alba, which bears thick, fleshy, broad, oval to heart-shaped leaves all along its vine length and Basella rubra features pink or purplish stems and pink colour veins in the leaves. In either case, leaves and terminal, tender, 8 - 12 inches stems are ready for harvesting about 35 to 45 days after seeding. Most authors agree, however, that the two color forms of Basella are not separate species. Perhaps both would best be treated as forms of Basella rubra. Basella is native to tropical Asia, probably originating in India or Indonesia. Today, it is grown widely in the tropics. Vine spinach is noted by regional names in different regions in Asia.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} effects of drying methods on {{nutrient}} retention in a leaf vegetable during storage. The leaves of <b>Indian</b> <b>Spinach</b> were dried to 3. 50 - 4. 0 % moisture content in the sun (35 °), shade (28 °C) and oven (45 °C) and then stored in polyethylene wrappers. Their moisture, ascorbic acid, minerals and total chlorophyll contents were determined after drying and during storage. There was minimal moisture gain during the twelve week storage period being less than 1 % in all three drying methods. Ascorbic acid decreased by 43 - 48 % {{as a result of}} drying but storage for twelve weeks did not result into much further loss. Shade-dried leaves retained ascorbic acid in the least. Chlorophyll and minerals contents also decreased slightly with drying and storage. Shade-dried leaves were lowest in Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, Mn and Zn. The contents of Ca and Mg in shade dried leaves increased in storage while K, Mn and Zn decreased. Manganese was the most critically reduced element by both drying and storage with shade dried leaves losing 73. 2, 81. 6 % at drying and 12 weeks later. Comparative figures for sun and oven dried leaves were 49. 2, 47. 6, 50 and 62. 6 % for the same periods. The greatest reduction in Zn content also occurred with shade drying. Sun drying resulted into more nutrient retention while there was only marginal difference in ascorbic acid content by the three techniques.

40|$|Optimum and {{qualitative}} production of {{vegetables in the}} depleted soils {{during the dry season}} are best achieved through irrigation. Two experiments were concurrently conducted in 2010 to determine the effect of irrigated poultry manure on the vegetative growth and nutritional quality of <b>Indian</b> <b>Spinach</b> (Basella alba) in South Western Nigeria. Poultry manure (P) rates at 0 (P 0 +W), 5 (P 1 +W), 10 (P 2 +W), 15 (P 3 +W) and 20 t ha- 1 (P 4 +W) were each irrigated with 6, 000 litres of water per hectare (W) and the plots were arranged on a complete Randomized Block Design with four replications. The plot that had no manure but irrigated with 6, 000 liters of water served as control. Compared with control, all the treatments significantly increased Basella height, leaf area (except P 1 +W), wet leaf weight and dry matter yield. The percentage increases in the leaf area of Basella alba were P 1 + W (0. 68 %), P 2 + W (6. 48 %), P 3 + W (10 %) and P 4 + W (25. 95 %).

30|$|Color {{is one of}} the {{characteristics}} of an effluent. Wastewater colored with dyes emanating from the production of the dye and its use in the textile and other industries (Allen and Koumanova 2005). It affects the color of water and restricts sunlight penetration thereby reducing photosynthetic activity (Sivaraj et al. 2001; Nacera and Aicha 2006). Dyes are carcinogenic and mutagenic. Generally, they are stable to biological degradation (Sivaraj et al. 2001; Wong and Yu 1999). It is therefore very important {{to get rid of them}} from effluents produced by industries before discharging into the environment. Congo red is the sodium salt of benzidinediazobis- 1 -naphthylamine- 4 -sulfonic acid. It is a benzidine-based azo dye. It was selected in this study as a model anionic dye due to its high solubility in aqueous solution and its persistence once it is discharged into natural environment. It mainly occurs in the effluents discharged from textile, paper, printing, leather industries, etc. (Bhattacharrya and Sharma 2004). While dying, about 15  % of it ends up in waste waters (Srivastava et al. 1988). It is a mutagen and reproductive effector. It acts as a skin, eye and gastrointestinal irritant. Congo red also causes the blood to clot and it is also responsible for aiding somnolence and respiratory problems (Alok et al. 2009). Existing techniques which had been used for removing dyes from wastewater polluted with dyes are disadvantageous due to high cost, the formation of harmful products and consumption of high energy (Banat et al. 1996).These techniques include ozonation, coagulation/flocculation, oxidative techniques, precipitation, ion exchange, reverse osmosis and ultra filtration. The commonest treatment (which adopts both physical and chemical methods) for removing dissolved organics from wastewaters is activated carbon adsorption. List of non-conventional, low-cost adsorbents that have been utilized for the removal of dyes from wastewater include durian seed (Ahmad et al. 2014 a, b), banana stalk (Bello et al. 2012), wheat husk (Gupta et al. 2007), coconut shell (Bello and Ahmad 2012), periwinkle shell (Bello et al. 2008), <b>Indian</b> <b>spinach</b> leaf, bottom ash and de-oiled soya (Gupta et al. 2006 a, 2009; Mittal et al. 2008), hen feathers (Gupta et al. 2006 b), oil palm fruit (Bello 2013), mango leaf (Bello et al. 2014), lime peel (Ahmad et al. 2015), spear grass (Bello and Semire 2012), ackee apple (Bello et al. 2013). Commercial activated carbon (CAC) are widely distributed because they are used for a variety of applications, because they are expensive, low cost non-conventional adsorbents is an economical alternative that could be used in lieu of CAC for wastewater treatment.|$|E

The {{study was conducted in}} three sub districts of the Gazipur district in Bangladesh. Questionnaires were used for the survey in which a total of 90 households were interviewed. Respondents for the survey were selected based on five different farm categories, i. e. tenant, marginal, small, medium and large farm. Among the different aspects, 80 % of the respondents would like to have training on the proper management practices of trees followed by species selection (43 %). A total of 43 % useful tree plant species (fruit and timber) were identified from the home gardens of the study area. The most common species in the study area was jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus, 26. 3 %) and mango (Mangifera indica, 22. 5 %) followed by mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni, 10. 3 %), coconut (Cocos nucifera, 10. 0 %), teak (Tectona grandis, 9. 7 %), while low prevalence species was minjiri (Cassia siamea, 0. 03 %), gora neem (Melia azadirch, 0. 18 %) and tamarind (Tamarindus indica, 0. 19 %). Based on diversified uses/services, the major fruit species were jackfruit, mango and coconut. The major timber species were koroi (Albizia procera), raintree (Samanea saman), neem (Azadirachta indica), teak (Tectona grandis) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.). Diversity and abundance of fruit species was found higher (Shannon`s diversity index, H= 7. 25) in all farm categories followed by timber species (H= 4. 83). A total number of 43 plant species were identified in the homestead of the study area of which 28 were horticultural and 15 were timber and fuelwood producing species. Total income was found to increase with increase of farm size. A large number of vegetables (32 species) are cultivated in the study area, largely for local consumption. The study showed that stem amaranthus, <b>indian</b> <b>spinach,</b> aroids, sweet gourd, chili, turmeric, eggplant and radish were grown under shade of jackfruit, mango, date palm, litchi, mahogany and drumstick trees. Country bean, bitter gourd, sponge gourd and cowpea were found to grow as creeper on jackfruit, mango, litchi, mahogany and drumstick trees. Farmers earned cash income by selling trees and vegetables produced in the homestead. The total income from trees {{in the last five years}} was higher in the large farm category (BDT 22458) than that in the tenant category (BDT 6150). The total income was found to increase with increase of farm size. Among different tree species, jackfruit was identified as an important cash generating crop in the study area. Scopes for improvement of tree management practices were prevalent in the study area. Most of the farmers prefer fruit trees over fuel/timber species. The major problems faced by the farmers in tree establishment were damage caused by animals which was reported by 68 % of the respondents. Insect pest was also another common constraint (27 % respondents), they added...|$|E
