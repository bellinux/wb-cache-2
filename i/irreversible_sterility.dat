50|$|In 2007, Zapatero's {{government}} was {{also responsible for}} a Gender Identity Law that allows transsexual persons {{the right to have}} their identity legally recognised, the criteria being one clinical evaluation and two years of treatment (generally hormone replacement therapy), and without demanding mandatory genital surgery or <b>irreversible</b> <b>sterility.</b> The law is, along with the legislation of some US states, one of the most simple and non-bureaucratic that currently exist in the world. Transsexual persons also have the right to marry persons of the opposite or same sex they have transitioned into, and to biologically parent children either before or after transitioning.|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} 150 years of mining in South Africa, nature {{has had to}} deal an {{accumulation}} of polluted substances. Destruction of rock by explosives exposes new surface areas {{with an abundance of}} water-soluble elements. The common remediation technique used for acid mine water is treatment with lime or with caustic soda. These tech-niques are not effective enough to keep the environment free of residues and don’t provide a sustainable treatment of acid mine drainage (AMD). The long- term environmental result of treatment with caustic soda is saline soil and could in addition, lead to <b>irreversible</b> soil <b>sterility.</b> A remediation technique for cleaning highly polluted AMD water should raise the pH and immobilise the heavy metals, keeping them out of the system permanently. With an organic medium – an organic material, a mixture of a specific Casuarina needle and a specific, pine bark with 2 other semi decomposed plants- it was proven that even in pH ranges of below pH 3. 5, high concentrations of Mn and Fe may still be removed. Only, after immobilising and binding heavy metals and treating up to 10, 000 m AMD per day, for at least two years, the organic medium has to be replaced. The quality of the treated AMD is confirm to the minimum guidelines for agricultural purposes and can be used for irrigation. The used material can be deposited on certified hazardous waste dumps, or could be recovered and recycled fo...|$|R
40|$|Steroid {{hormones that}} are {{controlled}} by steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) gene regulate sperm production. However, calcium ion is important for male fertility in vasodilation and sperm development. Calcium {{also serves as a}} second messenger to control acrosome reaction and sperm motility. Calcium channel-blockers (CCBs) as nifedipine and ethosuximide (used in hypertension and epilepsy treatment) can affect male fertility. However, {{little is known about the}} underlying mechanism of the male reproductive dysfunction and their side effects. The present study was designed to address the involvement of CCBs in inducing male infertility. Thirty-six male mice were orally treated by therapeutic dose of nifedipine and ethosuximide for 20  days followed by 10  days without treatment for drug withdrawal. Chromosome aberrations assay, sperm analysis and testicular expression level of biomarker steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR (mRNA were measured. In addition, histological structure of the testis was investigated to the process of spermatogenesis. Our results revealed that, CCBs significantly increased the percentage of chromosome aberration and sperm shape change. StAR-mRNA expression was significantly down regulated. Sperm count and motility were significantly decreased. However, slight improvement was observed in all tested parameters after drug withdrawal. Seminiferous tubules displayed total atrophy, disruption, severe damage and elongation of tubules with disorganization of germinal epithelium that detached from the basement membrane. The lumen of seminiferous tubules showed complete absence of sperm cells. Conclusions: Both nifedipine and ethosuximide significantly increase chromosome abnormalities, decrease sperm function, and down regulate StAR-mRNA expression. All these side effects may lead to <b>irreversible</b> male <b>sterility...</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Thake v Maurice 1984 2 All ER 513 {{a railway}} guard {{and his wife}} had five {{children}} living in a three-bedroomed council house and were unwilling to have further children. Thake consulted the surgeon who made it clear that a vasectomy was final and that Thake after the operation would become permanently sterile. Although the vasectomy was properly performed, the effect of this operation was naturally reversed and, not unexpectedly, Mrs. Thake conceived and a daughter was born. It was held that, applying the objective standard, the surgeon had contracted not merely to perform a vasectomy but had contracted to make Mr. Thake irreversibly sterile. The judge relied on the consent forms which stated that the vasectomy would be final. The claim was brought in contract and in tort. Peter Pain J. found that there was no reason why public policy prevented the recovery of expenses arising from the birth of a healthy child. He awarded damages in respect of the expenses of the birth and the mother's loss of wages but refused damages for the pain and distress of labour holding that these were off set by the joy occasioned by the birth. He did, however, award damages in an agreed sum for the child's upkeep to its seventeenth birthday. The Court of Appeal held that damages should be awarded for pain and suffering [...] "per the majority" [...] in tort rather than contract. The joy of having the child could be set off against the time, trouble and care in the upbringing of the child but not against prenatal pain and distress. For the latter, damages should be awarded. The case is also interesting because there was an alternative interpretation of the consent form. After sterilisation, some couples want to change their minds because their children have died or because they are seeing better days. Instead of the surgeon giving a guarantee of <b>irreversible</b> <b>sterility</b> which depended on the way in which human tissue healed, the warning of finality could be aimed at telling both husband and wife that they could not change their mind later and complain if the spouse had become permanently sterile.|$|E
30|$|Pyomyoma {{is a rare}} {{condition}} with high morbidity and mortality. Treatment with surgery is the primary approach, however, hysterectomy leads to <b>irreversible</b> <b>sterility</b> and myomectomy can {{be very difficult to}} perform. Therefore, the need for a less invasive but curative intervention exists for women who seek conservative therapy. Recently, treatment using computed tomography-guided drainage was successfully performed in two cases of pyomyoma in the postpartum period. For {{the first time in the}} literature, the authors present a conservative laparoscopic approach for pyomyoma.|$|E

The fast-moving developments in science and law, and the deep implications that the application of new techniques − which involve {{in the context of}} procreation a third person − can have in terms of protection of health and not only, makes it appropriate to keep under review this area, taking into account the pronouncements of the European Court of Human Rights and regulations in European countries...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{formulation of}} neem was tested on adult Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) {{to determine its}} effects on fecundity and longevity. Four no-choice tests were {{carried out in the}} laboratory at constant conditions of temperature, humidity, and photoperiod. Different concentrations were tested mixing neem solutions with the adult's rearing diet The laboratory tests showed that neem significantly reduced fecundity by interfering with oogenesis, which resulted in a complete and <b>irreversible</b> <b>sterility</b> of females. A slight reduction of longevity was also observed. The number of eggs laid decreased with increasing concentrations of azadirachtin in the diet. Preliminary histological observations indicated that the oviposition decrease {{was the result of a}} block in ovarian activity. Additional tests confirmed that azadirachtin induced sterility in the females, even when the flies were exposed for shorter periods (24 h) ...|$|E
40|$|According to the Pesticide Action Network (PAN), {{more than}} 500 men working in banana {{plantations}} {{in the area}} on Costa Rica's Atlantic coast have become sterile after having worked with DBCP. The pesticide dibromochloropropane (DBCP) - classified by the World Health Organization as extremely hazardous is a soil fumigant used to control nematode worms {{in a wide variety}} of crops, including pineapples and bananas. Between 1963 and 1978, more than 5 million kg of DBCP were imported into Costa Rica. It has also been used in Ecuador, Honduras, the Philippines and possibly Colombia and Panama. When DBCP is inhaled or absorbed through the skin, it passes into the bloodstream. With only a limited exposure to DBCP (less than two months) the hormone levels are not severly disrupted but sperm levels are reduced. <b>Irreversible</b> <b>sterility</b> occurs after more than 100 hours of intensive exposure. The World Bank now recommends that DBCP should not be used in farming activities. Many countries, including the United States, have banned this product.
