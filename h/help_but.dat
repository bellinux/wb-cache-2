5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British <b>help,</b> <b>but</b> that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion.

He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate rejection by the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E
