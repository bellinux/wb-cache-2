25|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memory</b> {{is a type}} {{of random}} access memory that stores each bit of data in a {{separate}} capacitor within an integrated circuit. Since real capacitors leak charge, the information eventually fades unless the capacitor charge is refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh requirement, it is a dynamic memory as opposed to static random access memory and other static memory. In 1966 DRAM was invented by Robert Dennard at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.|$|E

40|$|Although {{system-level}} {{radiation hardening}} can enable {{the use of}} high-performance components and enhance the capabilities of a spacecraft, hardening techniques can be costly and can compromise the very performance designers sought from the high-performance components.

The latter risk is particularly acute for Commercial-Off-The-Shelf components since high-performance parts (e. g. double-data-rate synchronous <b>dynamic</b> <b>random</b> <b>access</b> <b>memories</b> - DDR SDRAMs) may require other high-performance commercial parts (e. g. processors) to support their operation.

The ion-migration effects are coupled to redox processes which cause the change in resistance. They are subdivided into cation-migration cells, based on the electrochemical growth and dissolution of metallic filaments, and anion-migration cells, typically realized with transition metal oxides as the insulator, in which electronically conducting paths of sub-oxides are formed and removed by local redox processes.
