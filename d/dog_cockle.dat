50|$|The <b>dog</b> <b>cockle,</b> Glycymeris glycymeris, has {{a similar}} range and habitat to the common cockle, but {{is not at all}} closely related, being in the family Glycymerididae. The <b>dog</b> <b>cockle</b> is edible, but due to its {{toughness}} when cooked it is generally not eaten, although a process is being developed to solve this problem.|$|E
50|$|Glycymerididae, {{previously}} {{known as}} Glycymeridae, common names <b>dog</b> <b>cockles</b> or bittersweets, is a worldwide family of salt water clams, marine bivalve mollusks in the superfamily Arcoida. They {{are related to}} the ark clams. This family contains 45 species in four genera.|$|R
25|$|The first Norman {{fishing port}} of {{shellfish}} (clams, whelks, <b>dog</b> <b>cockles,</b> Saint-Jacques scallops), crustaceans (lobsters, brown crabs, small crabs, spider crabs) and fish (bream, rays, sharks, soles, pollock, bass, red mullet, cod, cuttlefish and squid) for local consumption with a fish market, a refrigerating terminal and a computerised sale of products. The tonnage landed (excluding farming) {{is of the}} order of 16,000 tonnes per year. An average of seventy-five equipped vessels with nearly 450 professional sailors attend the port. The marine cultures present on the islands of Chausey produce nearly 250 tons of clams, 5,000 tonnes of mussels and 100 tons of oysters.|$|R

5000|$|Despite {{the common}} name, {{it is not}} {{closely related to the}} common cockle. The word <b>dog</b> <b>cockle</b> implies that it roughly resembles a real cockle, but is not {{considered}} very good to eat, in other words, [...] "only fit for dogs".|$|E
50|$|Tucetona bicolor is {{a species}} of <b>dog</b> <b>cockle.</b> Its shell is subtrigonal with 39 radial ribs. The ribs have with {{moderately}} shallow, very narrow interspaces, with very fine, very closely spaced commarginal ribs. The hinge plate is moderately wide and curved.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} high resolution data on variation in environmental parameters before the establishment of monitoring networks, we evaluated <b>dog</b> <b>cockle</b> shells (Glycymeris glycymeris; Mollusca: Bivalvia) as archives for temperature and climate perturbations such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) over the last 50 years. Oxygen isotope compositions were measured from annual increments of shells collected from the Bay of Brest and the Chausey Islands in northwestern France. Simultaneously, sclerochronological analyses were performed on the same shells. Oxygen isotopic ratios measured in shells collected from the Bay of Brest were compared to in situ temperature and salinity data from monitoring stations and buoys in order to build a specific paleotemperature equation (r 2 = 0. 87; p < 0. 001) for the <b>dog</b> <b>cockle.</b> The specific equation was used to estimate sea surface temperatures around the Chausey Islands between 1966 and 1994. Standardized growth indices (SGI) calculated through sclerochronological methods were strongly correlated to oxygen isotope-derived temperatures. The SGI however did not capture the area's predominant climate pattern, the NAO. This study demonstrates that <b>dog</b> <b>cockle</b> shells can be used for long-term high-resolution reconstructions of past sea surface temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{cycle of}} the <b>dog</b> <b>cockle,</b> Glycymeris nummaria (Glycymerididae), was studied using specimens collected monthly from Mali Ston Bay, southeastern Adriatic Sea over the period from January to December 2010. We analysed sex ratios, gonad developmental stages, and oocyte diameters using standard histological techniques. There were no differences in the overall sex ratio and no difference in shell length with respect to sex. Results of a size-frequency analysis of oocyte diameters agreed with a qualitative analysis of gonadal developmental stages, confirming the occurrence of one annual spawning peak from May to July. A significant correlation was identified between mean gonad indices {{of males and females}} and condition index. This study provides the first data on the reproductive characteristics of G. nummaria, providing necessary information for the future sustainable management of its potential fishery...|$|E
40|$|Cross-dated chronologies {{derived from}} {{internal}} growth increments in the shells of the long-lived bivalve, the <b>dog</b> <b>cockle</b> Glycymeris glycymeris (Linnaeus, 1758), live-collected {{from two different}} sites off the east (1997) and south (2009) coasts of the Isle of Man respectively, are described. The chronologies, developed from ten individuals from each site, {{were found to be}} statistically robust (Expressed Population Signal (EPS) = 0. 87 and 0. 94 respectively) with a significant common growth signal despite their location 27 km apart (R = 0. 53; N = 49, P = < 0. 0001). The period of common growth between the two chronologies is consistent with the 12 -year difference in their dates of collection thus providing evidence of an annual periodicity of growth line formation. Significant positive correlations were identified between the chronology indices from both the southern (R = 0. 55, N = 58, P = < 0. 0001) and eastern sites (R = 0. 64, N = 68, P = < 0. 0001) and mean January to September sea surface temperatures. A significant positive correlation was also found between the southern site and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index (R = 0. 43; N = 49, P = 0. 0009). These data indicate that annual growth increments in the shells of G. glycymeris have the potential {{to be used as a}} scleroclimatological archive...|$|E
40|$|Marine {{ecosystems}} {{are increasingly being}} subject to human impact from diverse recreational and commercial activities, not necessarily restricted to those of a marine nature. This has significant implications for biodiversity. The large <b>dog</b> <b>cockle,</b> Tucetona laticostata, once occurred live in Rangitoto Channel, Hauraki Gulf, although this species no longer appears to occur there, most likely {{as a consequence of}} repeated dredging and channel excavation and continued siltation. Tucetona laticostata still occurs in a few isolated pockets of sea bed throughout Hauraki Gulf, particularly off Otata Island, part of the Noises complex of islands, where it resides partially buried in shell and rock gravels in shallow water (to 15 metres depth). The shells of T. laticostata collect in large post-mortem deposits in an area ramping from the sea bed off southwestern Otata Island. These mounds differ significantly in structural complexity from those of adjacent, extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels. Using the mounds of T. laticostata shell as a proxy for structural complexity, in order to appraise the effect of complexity on benthic-invertebrate diversity, the sea bed off southwestern Otata Island was sampled quarterly at two depths and in both T. laticostata shell mounds and adjacent extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels. These data were complemented with those from additional surveys around Otata Island, and off eastern Motutapu Island to determine the distribution and composition of benthic-invertebrate community assemblages throughout the region, and from concurrent surveys throughout the Waitemata Harbour and inner Hauraki Gulf to determine the current distribution of T. laticostata in this region. The number of benthic invertebrate species and individuals within T. laticostata habitat almost always was higher than that occurring within extensively fragmented shell- and rock gravel habitat, with densities to 142, 385 individuals m- 2 encountered. Temporal and spatial variations in benthic community structure also are reported for the two habitats, T. laticostata-based shells and extensively fragmented shell- and rock gravels. The numbers of species were higher amongst samples collected off the southwestern and eastern sides of Otata Island than elsewhere around this island, or of eastern Motutapu Island. Of the 351 species reported from all Otata and Motutapu Island samples combined, 73 % of them occurred off southwestern Otata Island, 30 % of which were found exclusively within T. laticostata shell habitat, and 10. 5 % within extensively fragmented shell and rock gravel habitat. The sea bed off southwestern Otata Island is regularly, seasonally dredged by recreational scallop fishers, {{in addition to being a}} popular small-vessel anchorage site. Both of these activities, dredging and anchorage, stand to reduce substratum complexity by fragmentation and dispersal of the valves of T. laticostata. Given the unique benthic invertebrates reported from T. laticostata shell deposits reported from southwestern Otata Island, any activity that damages the shells of this species, regardless of whether they are live or dead, is likely to result in loss of biodiversity. Admittedly, many of species identified as major contributors to differences in benthic invertebrate assemblages between T. laticostata shell-based habitats and those of extensively fragmented shell and rock gravels are not particularly charismatic or large, but each likely plays a role in local food webs and/or sediment and water column chemistry. It was not the intention of this research to determine the effects of anthropogenic disturbances like dredging or vessel anchorage on benthic-invertebrate communities off southwestern Otata Island. However, given the reported differences in species diversity within the structurally complex substratum provided by T. laticostata, conservation of biogenic reef-forming species like it might be a prudent, precautionary measure to take...|$|E
