This policy intervention provides an excellent opportunity to investigate how income security programs affect the timing of retirement. The structure of the Allowance also provides a view of how programs targeted at one spouse can affect the behavior of the other. Finally, conditional of the types of data available for this time period, the analysis considers the joint labor market decisions of couples. The results indicate that the introduction of the Allowance is associated with decreased employment rates and increased not in the labor force rates among eligible males. Eligible females did not share the rising employment rates over the 1970 s experienced by their counterparts who were not eligible for the <b>Spouse’s</b> <b>Allowance.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine the}} effects of the {{introduction}} of the <b>Spouse's</b> <b>Allowance</b> to the Canadian Income Security (IS) system on the retirement behavior of couples. This program was effectively targeted at females in couples attempting to live on a single pension. It allowed qualifying spouses to receive the age related benefits of the IS system at age 60, up to five years earlier than other members of the population. This policy intervention provides an excellent opportunity to investigate how income security programs affect the timing of retirement, and how programs targeted at one spouse can affect the behavior of the other. The results indicate that the introduction of the Allowance is associated with a relative increase in the labor force rates of 6 to 7 percentage points among males in eligible couples.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} labour force {{participation}} dynamics of older couples in the United States. Longitudinal {{data from the}} five available waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is used to investigate if the dynamics introduced by considering both spouses' behavior provide additional information in trying to fit observed participation sequences. The paper uses a bivariate dynamic binary choice model with unobserved heterogeneity and serial correlation to disentangle the many sources of dynamics and correlation in a couple's decision making. First, strong true state-dependence is found and results in a bunching of participation and non-participation sequences. Cross-spouse state-dependence is also found which points to indirect effects of social security and pension incentives through complementarity in leisure. Second, the <b>Spouse</b> <b>Allowance</b> program is found to have predicted effects on participation of the couple and these effects are statistically significant. A simulation exercise presents evidence that {{the elimination of the}} <b>spouse</b> <b>allowance</b> can raise participation of wives at age 62 by more than the decrease in participation of husbands at age 65. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{treatment}} of families in thirteen European income tax systems: twelve countries from the European Union and Poland. For the sake of simplicity families with only one wage earner are considered. In the first section, we survey the main features of twelve European tax systems {{to take account of}} <b>dependent</b> <b>spouse</b> and children. In the second section, we compare the tax-exempt income brackets for each country. In the third section, we calculate the costs that each tax system associates with the presence of <b>dependent</b> <b>spouse</b> and children in the taxpayer’s family. These costs may be explicitly stated as fiscal arrangements and child benefits or implicitly derived as a function of tax credits, family quotients and tax schedules. In the fourth section, the tax systems of Italy, Ireland, Belgium, Germany, France, Portugal and Poland are simulated on a representative population derived from the total number of employees in Italy. The simulation allows to evaluate the total tax yield and the impact of the different fiscal frameworks on three family types: single households, married couples with dependent children, singles with dependent children...|$|R

This study investigated the relationship of some selected demographic factors and acculturation level among scholars and their <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses</b> from Mainland China. The demographic factors chosen as independent variables of the study included length of exposure to the host culture, age at migration, gender, status, and participation in adult learning. The dependent variable, acculturation level of the participants, was measured through the adaptation of the Suinn-Lew Asian Acculturation Identity Scale. The dependent variable was correlated with each independent variable to explore their respective relationship. The Pearson product-moment coefficient of correlation was employed to describe the strength of the relationship between each pair of variables. The sample group of the study was composed of 102 Chinese scholars and their <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses</b> residing in the Midwest United States. All of them came to the US as graduate students, visiting scholars, or <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses</b> from Mainland China in the last twenty years or so. The {{purpose of the study was}} to discover the major factors with significant impact on the acculturation of the target population and to identify the population as a specific subgroup of Chinese immigrants. The acculturation literature reveals the relationship of some demographic factors and acculturation level in various ethnic groups of immigrants. Length of exposure to the host culture, age at migration, and gender are among the most evident factors correlated with acculturation level, though the strength and direction of relationship vary from one ethnic group to another. The study adopted these three demographic factors as independent variables and added two more to expand the scope of study, one focusing on the differences between scholars and their <b>dependent</b> <b>spouses,</b> and the other emphasizing the connections between acculturation and adult learning. Conclusions were made based on analyses of the data collected with the adapted SL-ASIA and the demographic questionnaire. A significant positive relationship was found between length of exposure to the host culture and acculturation level, between status and acculturation level, and between participation in adult learning and acculturation level among the participants, while no significant relationship was found between age at migration and acculturation level, or between gender and acculturation level in the sample group. In addition to these conclusions as they relate to the current literature, the personal experiences of the researcher as well as those of his family were included to provide further validation of the findings resulting from an analysis of the survey data. While limited by its research design in exploring the interactions of the variables upon each other, this study makes recommendations for future research with questions and subjects in the fields of acculturation and adult education...|$|R
