5|$|While {{there is}} an {{important}} need to link the economic, cultural, and ecological <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> development in the context of tourism enterprises, there is the key question of implementation and how the idea of sustainable tourism enterprises can be translated into reality: formulation of strategies and how they may be expected to interact with important aspects of indigenous culture. In addition to being locally directed and relevant, the planning process for the establishment of an ethno/ecotourism enterprise in an indigenous community should be strategic in nature. The use of a strategic planning process enables indigenous culture to be regarded as an important characteristic requiring careful consideration, rather than a feature to be exploited, or an incidental characteristic that is overshadowed by the natural features of the environment.|$|E

His zeal for souls is born from a love for Christ, which like all true love, implies identification with the person loved.|$|E
25|$|By late July 1941 the {{operations}} that Layforce had undertaken had severely reduced its strength {{and under the}} circumstances reinforcements were unlikely. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, the changing strategic <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> {{the situation in the}} Middle East, and the failure of the high command to fully embrace the commando concept had largely served to make the force ineffective. As a result, {{the decision was made to}} disband Layforce. Many of the men went back to their previous regiments following the decision, while others chose to remain in the Middle East and subsequently joined other special forces units that were raised later.|$|E

25|$|A {{historian}} by training, {{he wrote}} A Just Measure of Pain, {{a history of}} prisons during the Industrial Revolution. His biography of Isaiah Berlin reveals the strong impression the celebrated philosopher made on Ignatieff. Philosophical writings by Ignatieff include The Needs of Strangers and The Rights Revolution. The latter work explores social welfare and community, and shows Berlin's influence on Ignatieff. These tie closely to Ignatieff's political writings on national self-determination and the <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> democratic self-government. Ignatieff has also written extensively on international affairs. His historical memoir, The Russian Album, traces his family's life in Russia and their troubles and subsequent emigration {{as a result of}} the Bolshevik Revolution.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Dominic Behan {{wrote an}} episode of the UK {{television}} series Play for today entitled 'Michael Collins'. The play dealt with Collins' attempt to take the gun out of Irish politics and took {{the perspective of the}} Republican argument. At the time of writing the script, the troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland and the BBC were reluctant to broadcast the production. An appeal by the author to David Attenborough (Director of Programming for the BBC at that time) resulted in the play eventually being broadcast; Attenborough took the view that the <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> free speech could not be compromised in the cause of political expediency.|$|E
25|$|By {{locating}} {{the conditions of}} rationality in the social structure of language use, Habermas moves the locus of rationality from the autonomous subject to subjects in interaction. Rationality is a property not of individuals per se, but rather of structures of undistorted communication. In this notion Habermas has overcome the ambiguous plight of the subject in critical theory. If capitalistic technological society weakens the autonomy and rationality of the subject, it is not through the domination of the individual by the apparatus but through technological rationality supplanting a describable rationality of communication. And, in his sketch of communicative ethics as the highest stage in the internal logic {{of the evolution of}} ethical systems, Habermas hints at the source of a new political practice that incorporates the <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary rationality.|$|E

5000|$|In common speech, the conjugations <b>of</b> the <b>Imperative</b> mood <b>of</b> a {{small number}} of verbs tend to be {{replaced}} with the indicative singular third person.

Ex: hace lo que te pedí do what I asked. However, that is not allowed in formal speaking. Chilean Spanish speakers also replace the etymological 2nd person singular <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> the verb ir to go, ve, with the 2nd person singular <b>imperative</b> <b>of</b> andar to walk, anda, while ve is reserved for the verb ver to see.

25|$|Inden {{states that}} the attempt to {{classify}} Hinduism by typology started in the imperial times, when proselytizing missionaries and colonial officials sought to understand and portray Hinduism from their interests. Hinduism was construed as emanating not from a reason of spirit but fantasy and creative imagination, not conceptual but symbolical, not ethical but emotive, not rational or spiritual but of cognitive mysticism. This stereotype followed and fit, states Inden, with the imperial <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> the era, providing the moral justification for the colonial project. From tribal Animism to Buddhism, everything was subsumed as part of Hinduism. The early reports set the tradition and scholarly premises for typology of Hinduism, {{as well as the}} major assumptions and flawed presuppositions that has been at the foundation of Indology. Hinduism, according to Inden, has been neither what imperial religionists stereotyped it to be, nor is it appropriate to equate Hinduism to be merely monist pantheism and philosophical idealism of Advaita Vedanta.|$|E

On 21 February 1961, a new constitution was unanimously adopted, providing for a [...] "hyperpresidential" [...] regime. M'ba now had full executive powers: he could appoint ministers whose functions and responsibilities were decided by him; he could dissolve the National Assembly by choice or prolong its term beyond the normal five years; he could declare a state of emergency when he believed the need arose, though for this amendment he would have to consult the people via a referendum. This was, in fact, very similar to the constitution adopted in favor of Fulbert Youlou at roughly the same time. A report from the French secret service summarized the situation: ...|$|E

However, some argued that Ehrlich was distinguishing between positive (or state) law, which lawyers learn and apply, and other forms of 'law', what Ehrlich called [...] "living law", that regulate everyday life, generally preventing conflicts from reaching lawyers and courts.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{telling his}} disciples to be [...] "of one {{mind and heart}} on the way towards God" [...] Augustine of Hippo taught that [...] "Nothing conquers except truth and the victory of truth is love" [...] (Victoria veritatis est caritas), {{and the pursuit of}} truth through {{learning}} is key to the Augustinian ethos, balanced by the injunction to behave with love towards one another. It does not unduly single out the exceptional, especially favour the gifted, nor exclude the poor or marginalised. Love is not earned through human merit, but received and given freely by God's free gift of grace, totally undeserved yet generously given. These same <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> affection and fairness have driven the order in its international missionary outreach. This balanced pursuit of love and learning has energised the various branches of the order into building communities founded on mutual affection and intellectual advancement.

This {{continued}} in the team's biggest matches of the 1999 and 2003 World Cups, and in the 2007 World Cup final the team fielded two non-white players (Bryan Habana and JP Pietersen). South African Rugby Union president Oregan Hoskins considered the number of non-white players in the 2007 World Cup squad too low, and in 2008 the first non-white coach of the side was appointed. The political pressure on rugby coaches and administrators to select non-white players is strong; 16 of the 35 new Springboks appointed by former coach Jake White were non-white.

2500|$|Nor was {{the brotherhood}} among Zetes limited to mere words; the moving tale of Brother Henry Schwerin (Θ '63) {{illustrates}} {{the embodiment of}} love {{even in the most}} trying of circumstance.

A passing Confederate soldier, also a Zete, spied the badge and carried the invalid to medical care and safety, ignoring even the <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> war {{for the sake of his}} brother. The worthy badge later passed into the hands of his brother, Max Schwerin (Θ '70), who would one day serve as international president. After his death, it was donated by his sister to the Fraternity's archives and remains among its treasures. Brother John Day Smith (Ε '72) witnessed the incident on the Chattanooga field, and later related it to Brother Francis Lawton (Ε '69), who would author the poem [...] "The Badge of Zeta Psi," [...] later set to original music and preserved to this day. The reference to [...] "Chattanooga's bloody field" [...] is not idle hyperbole, but the recollection of a rare triumph among such sorrows.|$|E

2500|$|Authorities within state-endorsed {{religions}} were {{suspicious of}} pietist doctrine which they {{often viewed as}} a social danger, as it [...] "seemed either to generate an excess of evangelical fervor and so disturb the public tranquility or to promote a mysticism so nebulous as to obscure the <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> morality. A movement which cultivated religious feeling almost as an end itself". While some pietists (such as Pastor Francis Magny) held that [...] "mysticism and the moral law went together", for others (like his pupil Françoise-Louise de la Tour) [...] "pietist mysticism did less to reinforce the moral law than to take its place...the principle of 'guidance by inner light' was often a signal to follow the most intense of her inner sentiments...the supremacy of feeling over reason". Religious authorities could bring pressure on pietists, such as when they brought some of Magny's followers before the local consistory {{to answer questions about}} their unorthodox views or when they banished Pastor Magny from Vevey for heterodoxy in 1713. Likewise, pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats: Periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis, traditional disputation was replaced by competitive debating, which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship.|$|E
2500|$|Modern authors' {{versions}} of Morgan have her usually appear in conventionally villainous roles of a witchlike and irreconcilable enemy of Arthur, recurrently {{in league with}} Arthur's bastard son Mordred; be it {{in the time of}} the legend or still continuing her feud in the modern era, where she also may be just ruthlessly questing for power or even represent motiveless malevolence. Such Morgan is often merely a one-dimensional caricature, examples of which include the portrayals of her in several television films such as Merlin and the Sword (1985) (played by Candice Bergen), A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1995) (played by Theresa Russell) and Arthur's Quest (1999) (played by Catherine Oxenberg). Sklar described a modern stereotype of Morgan as [...] "the very embodiment of evil dedicated to the subversion of all forms of governance, express the fears that inevitably accompany the sort of radical cultural change represented by the social realities and ideological <b>imperatives</b> <b>of</b> escalating female empowerment during this (20th) century...a composite of all the patriarchal nightmare-women of literary tradition: Eve, Circe, Medea and Lady Macbeth compressed into a single, infinitely menacing package," [...] and whose [...] "sexuality exceeds even that of her prototype and serves as the chief vehicle for her manipulation of others." [...] Notable examples of this pattern are two comic book supervillainesses, Morgan le Fay (created by Stan Lee and Joe Maneely in 1955) in the Marvel Universe and Morgaine le Fey (created by Jack Kirby in 1972) in the DC Universe. A modern Morgan is often an antagonist character for Arthur, Merlin and their followers to overcome and save Camelot, Avalon, or even the world; even in Excalibur (1981), John Boorman's film adaptation of Le Morte d'Arthur, the evil Morgana le Fay (played by Helen Mirren) meets her end at the hands of Mordred, her son in the film, instead of accompanying Arthur to Avalon as she did in the source material.|$|E
