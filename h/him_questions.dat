5|$|Author Walter Noble Burns visited Earp in September 1926 {{and asked}} <b>him</b> <b>questions</b> {{with the intent}} {{to write a book about}} Earp. Earp {{declined}} because he was already collaborating with John Flood. Burns visited Tombstone and based on what he learned decided instead to focus his book on Doc Holliday. He pestered Earp for facts, and on March 27 the next year, Earp finally responded to Burns' repeated requests in an 11-page letter outlining the basic facts from Earp's point of view.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Sadler went to Europe {{and studied}} {{psychiatry}} {{for a year}} under Sigmund Freud. Sometime between 1906 and 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient with an unusual sleep condition. While the patient was sleeping he spoke to Sadler and claimed to be an extraterrestrial. Sadler spent years observing the sleeping man {{in an effort to}} explain the phenomenon, and eventually decided the man had no mental illness and that his words were genuine. The man's identity was never publicized, but speculation has focused on Sadler's brother-in-law, Wilfred Kellogg. Over the course of several years, Sadler and his assistants visited the man while he slept, conversing with him about spirituality, history, and cosmology, and asking <b>him</b> <b>questions.</b> A larger number of interested people met at Sadler's home to discuss the man's responses and to suggest additional questions. The man's words were eventually published in The Urantia Book, and the Urantia Foundation was created to assist Sadler in spreading the book's message. It is not known who wrote and edited the book, but several commentators have speculated that Sadler played a guiding role in its publication. Although it never became the basis of an organized religion, the book attracted followers who devoted themselves to its study, and the movement continued after Sadler's death.|$|E

25|$|Wilson pioneered twice-weekly press {{conferences}} in the White House. Though they were modestly effective, the president prohibited his being quoted and was particularly indeterminate in his statements. The first such press conference was on March 15, 1913, when reporters {{were allowed to}} ask <b>him</b> <b>questions.</b> In 1913, {{he became the first}} president to deliver the State of the Union address in person since 1801, as Thomas Jefferson had discontinued this practice.|$|E

25|$|A {{crucial point}} in the {{dialogue}} is when Socrates tells Meno {{that there is no}} such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or anamnesis. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows geometric principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask <b>him</b> <b>questions</b> to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series of questions about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the Pythagorean proposition.|$|E
25|$|After {{media and}} {{industry}} pressure forced the FCC to act, MacDougall was charged after surrendering to the authorities. FCC investigators spoke to MacDougall in July (he {{lost his job}} at Central Florida Teleport beforehand due to the closure of People's Choice), asking <b>him</b> <b>questions</b> {{that led him to}} believe that the commission was aware of the incident. Two FCC agents visited MacDougall's house two weeks later along with U.S. Attorney Lawrence Gentile III, who served MacDougall with a subpoena to appear in Jacksonville's U.S. District Court. In their meeting, MacDougall claimed not to have committed any crime. According to MacDougall, Gentile tried to make an agreement that if MacDougall discussed the incident, Gentile would be willing to recommend a small fine and probation to the judge. At that time, MacDougall stated that he started to feel that there was not enough evidence to convict him, and despite continuing to protest his innocence, MacDougall told Gentile he would attend court.|$|E

Ryan shows {{the staff at the}} branch the new Dunder Mifflin website, [...] "Dunder Mifflin Infinity 2.0", the previous version of which was shut down because sexual predators had invaded the social networking component of the site.

Michael and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) subsequently decide to go to New York, locate Ryan, attend parties with him, and try to meet women while doing so.|$|E
500|$|During {{one scene}} in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes", Munch and Bolander force a suspect {{to take a}} [...] "electrolyte neutron {{magnetic}} scan test", which involved placing his hand on a copy machine and photocopying his hand as they asked <b>him</b> <b>questions.</b> Prior to giving the exam, the detectives loaded papers with the words [...] "True" [...] and [...] "False" [...] into the machine, so when the final copies came out it appeared the machine was giving answers to the questions. The detectives pretended the test was radioactive and dangerous to further make the suspect nervous. This scene {{was based on a}} real-life trick used by Baltimore Police Department detectives in 1988. The real-life instance was featured in , the 1991 David Simon non-fiction book about a Baltimore Police Department, which was adapted into the Homicide series. This hoax was also used in [...] "More with Less", the fifth season premiere episode of David Simon's later police drama series, The Wire.|$|E

500|$|Some Circuit Courts {{have applied}} the Court's ruling in Drayton {{to hold that}} {{citizens}} are not coerced when police officers approach individuals {{on the street and}} ask them questions. The District of Columbia Circuit, for example, wrote that [...] "while the passengers in Drayton were questioned while inside a bus with an officer positioned near the exit ... the street encounter [...] no physical impediment to ’s freedom to walk away". However, the Seventh Circuit has held that according to the Supreme Court's ruling in Drayton, a suspect was unlawfully detained when police approached him in a dark alley and asked <b>him</b> <b>questions.</b> The Seventh Circuit described the encounter as [...] "coercive" [...] and distinguished it from the events that transpired in Drayton because [...] "lleys are distinguishable from the sorts of open, populated spaces in which police questioning is typically deemed consensual". The court noted that [...] "'a reasonable person may feel ... more secure in his or her decision not to cooperate with police on a bus than in other circumstances' because 'many fellow passengers are present [...] to witness officers’ conduct'".|$|E
500|$|He {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the International Astronomical Union in 1966; having twice edited the Union's General Assembly newsletters. He {{attempted}} to establish an International Union of Amateur Astronomers, which failed due to lack of interest. During the 1970s and 80s, he reported on the Voyager and Pioneer programs, often from NASA headquarters. At this time he became increasingly annoyed by conspiracy theorists and reporters who asked <b>him</b> <b>questions</b> such as [...] "Why waste money on space research when {{there is so much to}} be done here?". He said that when asked these type of questions [...] "I know that I'm dealing with an idiot." [...] Another question that annoyed him was [...] "what is the difference between astronomy and astrology?" [...] Despite this he made a point of responding to all letters delivered to his house, and sent a variety of standard replies to letters asking basic questions, as well as those from conspiracy theorists, proponents of hunting and 'cranks'. Despite his fame, his telephone number was always listed in the telephone directory and he was happy to show members of the public his observatory.|$|E

2500|$|Although widely {{recognized}} by the architectural community as embodying important new ideas, the Richards Laboratories had significant shortcomings {{from the viewpoint of}} the scientists who worked there.

After the fixer received a payment, he would refer the person to a lawyer contact of his, who had given Garson drinks, meals, cigars, and cash—accepting (and receiving) preferential treatment in return. The fixer and the lawyer would then bribe court employees to override the court's computer system, which was programmed to ensure that cases were assigned to judges randomly. Instead, they would have the case assigned to Garson. Garson, in turn, would then privately coach the lawyer. He would tell <b>him</b> <b>questions</b> the lawyer should ask of witnesses in the case before Garson, and arguments that the lawyer should make to Garson in court.
