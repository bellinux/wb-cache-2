2500|$|... "I {{drove down}} the highway and just before Cann River Les woke up. He {{wanted to know where}} we were. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> were in Victoria heading to Orbost. Les cracked the shits and was abusing me. He was saying {{he wanted to go to}} Sydney. He kept saying 'the bridge'. I took this to mean he wanted to throw the girls off the bridge because he had spoken about this before. There are some bridges on the way to Sydney on the Hume Highway which have great drops." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And," [...] he continued, with a lowered {{voice and}} solemn look, [...] "if Cheenbuk had not {{turned to the}} left when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> never would have found it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody, sir, but {{an agent}} {{that wanted to}} sell you {{some kind of a}} new calendar. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> had bushels of {{calendars}} already," [...] and the boy grinned slightly.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> {{expected}} to spend my two weeks' vacation here.|$|R
6000|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all <b>we</b> had {{accomplished}} that morning, and explained what Darius proposed we should do, whereupon he cried heartily: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> where <b>we</b> {{believed}} Lucilla to be. Grosse {{turned his}} head, {{and shook his}} fist at a bottle on the chimney-piece next.|$|R
6000|$|... "Turnips, you knows, sir. We always calls 'em 'nips in cargo. At the Havana <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> took {{in leather}} and jerked beef, and came home. Oh! he got nothin' from me, Capt. Spike, that'll ever do the brig a morsel of harm!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He’s {{the son of}} {{a friend}} o’ mine what I’ve brought aboard to oblige," [...] replied the skipper. [...] "He’s got a fancy for being a pirate, so just to oblige his father <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> was a pirate. He wouldn’t have come if I hadn’t." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> {{would talk}} farther about it; that I {{had such a}} thought in my head, and a strong {{inclination}} to undertake it myself, but that I could not answer it to leave the ships, which depended so much upon my care of the voyage.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> {{would go}} out into the world {{together}}; empty-handed we would fare forth together and defy the world. I said that he should be my knight-errant, my paladin! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> {{were from}} Pan-America, {{but he only}} {{shook his head and}} asked where that was. He had never heard of it, or of the Atlantic Ocean which <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{separated}} his country from mine.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the fewest}} words {{possible}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> had heard, and when I was {{come to an}} end of the brief recital, Jacob asked, as if believing that now all our plans would be changed: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{looked at}} me with his black eyes, almost as if he hated me, when he was ill, and said, 'It only wanted this. It only wanted that I should leave you and a young child to starve in this London.' <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> should not starve. But I was young, and foolish, and frightened, which he knew.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know who}} they meant, but they all laughed. And {{every now and again}} I'd hear them praising the food, which I don't wonder at, for Jules had {{certainly}} done himself proud. All artistic temperament, these Frenchmen are. The moment <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> had company, so to speak, he blossomed like a flower does when you put it in water.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] Ward called, {{instantly}} {{understanding the}} situation. [...] "They're gone. The {{old man was}} about played out, for they've been fighting snow all day, but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> couldn't {{take care of them}} here and they have gone on down to the camp. He thinks you got over the divide. You are all right for the present." ...|$|E
60|$|I agreed heartily with <b>him,</b> {{and then}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> {{had found in}} his absence, that the house which Dracula had bought was the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed to come on him.|$|R
60|$|He {{had heard}} from my {{guardian}} of my having been called away on some uncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> had but just left a coach and were going--but then I was obliged {{to look at my}} companion.|$|R
5000|$|Later, Priyanka would say: [...] "My {{mind was}} a blank... I was just signing {{whatever}} letters Rizwan {{was telling me}} to sign. <b>I</b> once <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> shouldn’t mention my father, but he said Pappu and Rukbanur had insisted that we frame the letters like that and they knew best." ...|$|R
60|$|But, {{in order}} to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> must divide the prisoners, {{and that he should}} go and take Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the cave where the others lay: this was {{committed}} to Friday, and the two men who came on shore with the captain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess about}} all it needs is rest," [...] {{answered}} Lester Lawrence. [...] "It {{was quite a}} journey from my shack to this place. But I saw that Phil was getting anxious to rejoin you, so <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> might as well make the venture to-day rather than wait. He has been hoping {{that you would have}} some word for him from my brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. March {{came away}} {{tingling}} with compassion for their evident anxiety, and this pity naturally soured into {{a sense of}} injury. [...] "Well, I must say I have completely lost confidence in Mr. Fulkerson's judgment. Anything more utterly different from what <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> wanted I couldn't imagine. If he doesn't manage any better about his business than he has done about this, {{it will be a}} perfect failure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just then {{my father}} came in and asked {{what all the fuss}} was about. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> had caught a young white baboon, and he was angry, and said that it must be let go. But when he looked at it through the bars of the window he nearly fell down with astonishment.|$|R
60|$|I duly {{relieved}} Van Helsing in {{his watch}} over Lucy. We wanted Arthur {{to go to}} rest also, but he refused at first. It was only when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> should want <b>him</b> to help us during the day, and that we must not all break down for want of rest, lest Lucy should suffer, that he agreed to go.|$|R
6000|$|He was {{stern and}} sad-eyed, {{like a man}} with a great weight of grief on his shoulders. He {{looked as if he had}} not slept; his dress was out of order, he had not taken his clothes off, I think. He isn't a man whom you can pity. I felt I had taken a liberty in knowing of the matter at all. When <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> where <b>we</b> had been, he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I met Will Morrison in New York, Hannah," [...] {{he said to}} his wife. [...] "He {{was just}} sailing for London with his family and will remain abroad all summer. He wanted us to occupy his {{mountain}} place, Hillcrest Lodge, during July and August, and although <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> couldn't use the place he insisted on my taking an order on his man to turn the shack over to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The captain {{proposed}} {{waiting a}} spell; but <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> weren't {{like to see}} any rougher weather than we'd pulled through together, and if we didn't know one another after such a year as this, we never should. I was sure I shouldn't be worth my pay without this hand on the wheel; so I had my way, and my brave little woman has shipped for the long voyage. God bless her!' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> {{would sell}} our cargo, and {{purchase}} China wares, calicoes, raw silks, tea, wrought silks, &c. {{and so would}} return by the same course we came. He told us our best port had been to have put in at Macao, where we could not fail of a market for our opium to our satisfaction, and might, for our money, have purchased all sorts of China goods as cheap as we could at Nanquin.|$|E
60|$|The longer I thought {{over this}} strange adventure, the more hopelessly tangled the mystery became: {{and it was}} a real relief to meet Arthur in the road, and get him to go with me up to the Hall, to learn what news the {{telegraph}} had brought. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> as <b>we</b> went, what had happened at the Station, but as to my further adventures I thought it best, for the present, to say nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{the fact}} is, your uncle and I could never agree on some {{business}} matters. I {{did not think}} his actions were right, and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> so, and <b>we</b> had quite a quarrel. But of course {{this has nothing to}} do with you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: An {{editorial}} cartoon on Canada-United States relations, 1886. It reads: Mrs. Britannia.—"Is it possible, my dear, {{that you}} have ever given your cousin Jonathan any encouragement?" [...] Miss Canada.—"Encouragement! Certainly not, Mamma. <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> can never be united." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As I was saying, madam," [...] {{continued}} Ralph, {{disregarding the}} interruption, [...] "I {{told him that}} I should not have thought of one exempted from feudal service in the camp, by our noble Knight, being deficient in his dues in his absence. <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> should see how he liked to be sent packing to Bordeaux with a sheaf of arrows on his back, instead of the sheaf of wheat which {{ought to be in}} our granary by this time. But you are too gentle with them, my Lady, and they grow insolent in Sir Reginald's long absence." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{he will be}} here soon," [...] said Philip, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>we</b> {{were coming}} to call. What sort of sport did you have? What, none! I am very sorry. You must come and try again--ah! I forgot you are going away. by the way, Mr. Heigham, why should you go just yet? If you are fond of fishing, and have nothing better to do, come and put up at the Abbey House for a while; we are plain people, but {{there is plenty of}} room, and you shall have a hearty welcome. Would you care to come?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay marry, hath he! The two took it {{into their}} royal noddles to try a fall, and {{wrestled}} together on the grass, when by some ill hap, this same Francis tripped up our Harry, {{so that he was}} on the sward for a moment. He was up again forthwith, and in full heart for another round, when all the Frenchmen burst in gabbling; and, though their King was willing to play the match out fairly, they wouldn't let him, and my Lord Cardinal said something about making ill blood, whereat our King laughed and was content to leave it. As <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> <b>we</b> have given the French falls enough to let them make much of this one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{said that}} we must not break our words. He would not hear me, when <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> could deny having promised. I said that {{promises}} made over the wine need never be kept. Who ever heard of keeping them? And Orestes was drunk, too. But he said that I might teach a Goth to be what I liked, except a liar.... Was not that a strange speech?.... And Wulf bade him be strong, and blest him for it.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Washington, in {{a rather}} panicky way, have been urging a NATO 'alert' with all that this implies (in our case, a Royal Proclamation and the call up of Reservists). <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that <b>we</b> do not repeat not agree at this stage. N. General Norstad agreed with this and said he thought NATO powers would take the same view. I said that 'mobilization' had {{sometimes}} caused war. Here it was absurd since the additional forces made available by 'Alert' had no military significance.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad indeed, signor, that I am {{not to be}} called, {{and that}} this affair of the {{conspiracy}} {{is not to be}} brought up. I would, with your permission, now return home. Giuseppi took a message to my father from me, the first thing, explaining my absence; and <b>I</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> when <b>we</b> left your house, to go at once to tell him that your daughters had been recovered, and that I should return before long. Still, he will want to hear from me as to the events of the night." ...|$|R
