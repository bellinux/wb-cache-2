The pre-crisis evidence indicates that the degree of wage rigidity is relatively high in Italy: wages remain unchanged on average for about two years, against an average of just over one year in the other countries. Italian firms hardly cut nominal wages, reflecting not only institutional constraints, but also an attempt to avoid a negative impact on their productivity.

Data concerning <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> management and machinery in crop production is essential for all type of planning and for machinery construction. Traditional data acquisition require lots of manpower, therefore an automated system for time and performance data acquisition is of great interest. A data acquisition system based on tractors equipped with sensors has been designed. Data concerning tractor performance, engine rpm, used gear, speed, slippage and fuel consumption has been collected in combination with timedata. Using two separated, yet by time stamping combined, data acquisition systems information concerning tractor and implement usage {{in the field is}} obtained and stored on tape for later processing. Tractor parameters are collected once a minute by a time controlled logger. A HP- 41 calculator works as measurement controller. Data transfer is handled on the HP-IL loop and stored on mini data cartridges. 16 readings are made each minute and the tape has the capacity of storing data from 16 hours continuous farmwork. Work performance parameters are collected and stored in a MICRONIC 900 hand-held computer. If the tractor driver leaves the cabin for more than 20 seconds, the driver is questioned on return about the cause of interruption. Time stamps and cause type-code are stored in RAM. To collect data about geographical displacement the driver is instructed to make appropriate coding while arriving to and leaving from the fields/farm centre. Three tractors have been equipped with these acquisition units. They have been on different farm sites and used by the farmers in their regular work. The system has been working very well and data from more than 200 workdays were stored until winter 85 / 86. Data from the two acquisition systems are stored in files. To handle the large amount of data, data about data (meta-data) are stored in a relational databank, thereby allowing data to be sorted and retrieved by logical selection. By way of example collected data are presented in graphs and charts. Presented data show measurements from plowing.

Here, we present results {{of the first two}} experimental years (2003 - 2004), which are considered as the conversion period. Wheat yield was 16 % higher (p < 0. 001) in ploughed plots than in the plots with reduced tillage (chisel and rotary harrow). In the following year, sunflower yield was enhanced by 5 % (p = 0. 06) in reduced tilled plots. Reduced tilled plots manifested a higher weed infestation, in particular with Convolvulus arvensis and Stellaria media. With the exception of low levels of Fusarium poae, no toxigenic fusaria were detected in wheat grains possibly due to the excep-tionally dry and hot summer 2003. The deoxynivalenol (DON) content was low in all treatments. While the DON content in wheat straw was increased after reduced tillage, it was decreased after ap-plication of biodynamic preparations (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Social {{production}} has risen {{on the agenda}} of the social sciences. Yet most observers have been reluctant to confront the question of the value of these practices. Instead they have mostly been characterised as ‘free’, ‘common ’ or beyond value. This article argues that far from being free, social production abides to a particular value logic, an ‘ethical economy ’ where value is relat-ed not to the <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> time, but to the ability to give productive organ-isation to a diffuse connectivity or, which is the same thing, to transform weak ties into affectively significant strong ones. The article concludes that progressive politics should work with this new emerging value logic. In recent years, what Yochlai Benkler () and many others havecalled ‘social production ’ has been established as a powerfulsocial and economic fact. Although most material production follows the monetary logic of a still hegemonic capitalist economy, immaterial production, the strategically central production of knowledge, affect and social relations, is increasingly performed according to a different logic, and does not primarily move according to monetary incentives. Such social production of immaterial wealth is nothing new: the nineteenth-century industrial revolution, for example, was largely driven by a similar diffuse production of technological know-how (see Mokyr,). However, it has become strategically central in new and powerful ways. There are two main reasons for this. One, the progressive mediatisation of the social (culminating in the diffusion of networked information and The ethical economy: Towards a post-capitalist theory of valu...|$|E

In this paper the total factor productivity {{is defined as a}} weighted sum of productivity of four production factors, K input of fixed capital, L <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> E input of energy consumption, M input of material consumption. Empirical approach based on a derived transcendental logarithmic (translog) production function employs as a starting point direct econometric application of this production function. Using the econometric estimate of translog production function, total factor productivity is subsequently derived and, as the next step, measured. Direct econometric estimates of the translog production function were obtained by using special technique of empirical estimates used in the cases of multicollinearity – the ridge regression. Two frameworks were employed: KLE for the Czech Economy and KLEM for the Czech Manufacturing. Quarterly time series covered the periods of 1 / 1995 to 4 / 2004 and 1 / 1995 to 3 / 2006, respectively. Comparing KLE and KLEM results we find the role of TPF strikingly robust. Share of the calculated long-term growth of TFP on the long-term growth rate of gross product was 13 per cent in KLE case while calculation based on KLEM production function shows 13. 1 per cent. It seems that the Czech economy has been still dominated by the manufacturing sector. The role of TFP in the process of long-term economic growth has from the qualitative point of view remained unchanged except possible turning point in 2007. Economic growth seems to be primarily attributable to the growth of factor aggregate input.

40|$|The article Are There Laws of Production? {{published}} in the American Economic Review in 1949 roused {{a great deal of}} interest among specialists, it has often been quoted and reprinted on several occasions. In the article Paul H. Douglas presented the results of his many years of studies. Having processed a great deal of statistical data, using the production function suggested by him together with C. W. Cobb, Douglas attempted to determine the share <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and capital in the final product of the manufacturing industry in a number of countries and regions. The results were as follows: there was a surprising constancy in the share <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and capital within individual countries throughout the research period and the returns from additional <b>inputs</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and capital were practically constant. For the US, Australia and South Africa the share <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> was close to 2 / 3 and the share of capital was 1 / 3.

If we take into consideration the well-known fact that the share of consumption in the GDP is very close to 2 / 3, the conclusions drawn by Paul H.

40|$|The {{concepts}} of value and {{price and the}} connection between those categories are important problems of economic considerations and disputes, both {{with respect to the}} essence of those concepts as well as to their role in the economy. The present article offers an attempt to investigate basic views of the representatives of various schools of political economy, with the attention paid to those aspects which might prove useful from the viewpoint of the rational shaping of the economic processes. Starting from the theoretical system of the classic English economy, the considerations are focused on theoretical problems of value and price in both explanatory and evaluative approaches. In particular, the author tries to prove a gradual disappearance from economic theories of the process of linking together prices and value in view of particular conditions of carrying out economic activity and in effect, in view of particular economic policy both in Western and Marxist economy. The considerations allow to say that the theory of value based on market price and the theory of value based on labour correspond with the stage of development when resources and goods were considered practically unlimited. However, we are more and more {{aware of the fact that}} it was only in the XlXth or partly XXth centuries stage of "abundance" and relatively little dangerous pollution of the natural environment that prices and their total level might be considered the reflection of value. The rejection of those assumptions and the recognition of not only relative but also absolute scarcity of the growing number of goods, the need of protecting them through prohibitive prices mark the end of the period of explaining prices exclusively in terms of the <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> One should therefore keep in mind that the growing degree of scarcity of resources will inevitably lead to the rise in their prices, i. e. to the economic impediment to their availability.

40|$|Productivity {{growth was}} at the heart of the {{economic}} development in the Afterwar period – the so called ‘trentes glorieuses’. These years were characterised by a strong coordination of labour markets, collective agreements that were mainly set at the sectoral level and wage constraint. At this time, the most relevant objectives were a strong competitive economy, a hard currency, low inflation and full employment. It seems that this glorious era has come to an end. Many EU and non-EU countries, such as the UK and the USA, have experienced a labour productivity stagnation or slowdown over the last decade. Academics, policy makers and business leaders are concerned to reverse this trend since “productivity is the ultimate engine of growth in the global economy” (OECD 2015). As the working population is projected to decline with the ageing population, labour productivity growth becomes the sole source for potential average output growth in both the EU and the euro area starting from 2028 (European Commission, 2012). This projection includes both the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of growth. Directly linked to productivity stagnation is the issue of inequality and, precisely, wage inequality (Keune, Tomassetti 2016). There is mounting evidence that “increasing inequality may be one of the causes of declining growth, as inequality both impedes improvements in productivity and weakens demand. Low growth, in turn, reinforces inequality by intensifying distributional conflict” (Streeck 2014, 37). Inequality is also likely to increase even more in the years ahead as a consequence of the impact of Industry 4. 0 and the digital evolution of the economy on labour markets and societies (Blasi et al 2013; Etui 2016). On the brink of a new extraordinary age of change – i. e. the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution (Shwab 2016) –, many scholars still disagree over what current technological innovations imply for the future of work and employment relations (Katz et al. 2015). Along with opportunities, new challenges appear in different forms than previous waves of technological change: hybridization between humans and robots; dematerialisation of boundaries between industries; working and doing business anytime, anywhere; labour market polarisation; marginal cost reduction and productivity slowdown. These factors are compounded by an increasingly diverse workforce where tensions exists between inclusion and diversity, impacting on employment relations. There is consensus that investments in technological innovation, research and skills are key drivers for labour productivity. It is also clear that – beside these factors – work organisation plays an important role in enhancing labour productivity and making growth sustainable. Productivity figures (GDP/GVA per hour worked and GDP/GVA per capita) are linked to the output of production and the <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour.</b> Collective bargaining and other aspects of labour and employment relations play a major role in these figures. Dialogue on productivity issues is important both in terms of consensual labour-management cooperation and as a regulator of wages and conditions of work. Coordination of collective bargaining has a positive impact on economic performance, because it impedes wage competition and enforces companies to increase productivity in order to being able to pay the given wages. At the company level, productivity agreements can result in innovation and enhance performance through compensation and benefits, working time flexibility, Work-life Balance, skills improvements and workers involvement. Furthermore, collective bargaining, especially firm-level bargaining, has always been conceived as a means both to facilitate and react to technological changes. This project is set against a background of institutionalist research which investigates the role of central institutions and actors in the setting and maintenance of employment relations. Drawing on key theories such as regulatory space, varieties of capitalism, regulation theory and coordination theory this research places the productivity bargaining in a theoretical arena to understand the role of productivity bargaining and the coordination of collective bargaining across key European countries. Against this background, this report aims to shed light on the reasons behind labour productivity slowdown or weak growth in some countries, by focusing on the role that employment relations plays behind such a trend. Our goal is to analyse the potential and effective implication of collective bargaining and employment relations on labour productivity, as well as to analyse public policies and social partners’ attitude towards labour productivity in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain and the UK A note of caution is, however, needed because the relationship between employment relations and the <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> is at best complex and, if worse, dubious. While the connotation of high productivity and hard work is a very basic one, the actual relationship is likely to be much more complex with influence from smarter working, new technology and research and development investment. Therefore, when comparing figures of productivity GDP growth between countries and sectors, such complexities should be kept in mind. The ‘productivity paradox’ furthermore points to the question to what extent productivity growth gives an accurate figure of productivity as such. The quality of production output may not be taken into account accurately and services that are for free, like some of the services with ICT, do not count to productivity but may still add to prosperity...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} suckler cows in Sweden has {{increased}} from 60 000 in the mideighties to 165 000 1995. By tradition {{the majority of the}} suckler cows are tied up in former milking cow barns during the winter season. These barns are insulated and ventilated, not very well maintained and very labour consuming. The interest and need for development of simple, rational and cheap systems of production systems for suckler cow has increased. This study comprises both a literature review and a field study. The literature review concerns the economy in suckler cow production as well as the origin of the cattle, ethology and their behaviour. It emphasizes the role of natural behaviour, because suckler cow production in more simple production systems and housing, to be successful, has {{to take advantage of the}} natural behaviour patterns in cattle at a great degree. The last and main part of the literature review concerns climate and ambient environment and the effect on cattle heat balance, possibilities for adjustment to cold and need for extra energy when the animals are exposed to low outside temperatures as well as wind and snow or rain. The literature review concludes that housing cattle outside or in simple sheds, results in a slightly higher feed consumption because of decreased digestibility of feed and because of demand of extra feed to maintain heat balance during cold periods. The literature review also shows that the suckler cow is well adjusted to stay outside or in simple sheds during the winter in Sweden if provided with sufficient feed. The field study includes material from visits at 50 suckler cow herds with different types of housing including insulated buildings with tied up cattle, different types of loose house systems, (cubicles, deep litter straw bedding etc) and even ranch systems without buildings. Geographically the herds are sited from Stockholm region to the southernmost province, Skåne. The herd size varied from 15 to 1000 suckler cows. Most of the herds had between 30 and 60 dams. The critical period in suckler cow production is the cold season combined with calving Then the demand on the thermal environment and intensity of labour is at its maximum. The question is how the producer can coop with these critical situations in an optimum way considering the animal and human wellfare. In the field study different aspects of this, such as technical, labour and animal environment, investment and feed costs, health and productivity where looked at. The results of the field study shows that suckler cow production under Swedish climatic and soil conditions can, maintained in low cost buildings with little <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and economic resources, still be far better than production in the traditional way in insulated houses and with tied up cows. In the field study, the following conclusions have been drawn: - Dividing the dams into groups, are at all forms of loose house systems important so that younger and weaker individuals do not loose weight and condition. The most suitable groups are pregnant heifers in one group, first time calvers and cows in bad condition in one group and older cows in good condition in one group. - Date of calving is not a factor that excludes simple non- insulated barns. Early calving is performed with good result except when calving outside especially when there is wet snow, which can cause loss of new-born calves. - Calving difficulties are much less in loose house systems compared to tied up systems. - There should be sufficient of calving boxes, preferably one box per 8 - 10 heifers and one per 15 - 20 cows. In tied up system the need for calving boxes are even bigger. - Calf cribs are well used by the calves. It should be placed in such a way that it provides the calves with a sheltered resting place and the space must be sufficient, at least 0, 6 m 2 per calf or bigger, It should also be placed near the cows, be easy to reach for the calves and free from draught. - Calf health is better in loose house systems where there are less animals per m 2 and the air volume per beast is greater than in tied up systems. - The working hours are more in a tied up system during the wintertime, 15 - 20 hours per cow compared to 8 - 14 hours per cow in a loose house system. - The need for checking and looking alter the cows and calves during the calving period is much greater in a tied up system than it is in a loose house system, but there is a greater demand in the stockman’s ability to take notice in his or her cattle in a loose house system. - When using existing buildings such as barns, one must be aware of the needs of reinforcement, particularly in the walls from animals and bedding. - When using straw bedding, the experience often is that the need of straw is very large and the work with the straw takes a great deal of time. There are great differences in the amount of straw that is needed depending on how many animals per m 2 there are, type of feed stuff, the quality of the straw and if there is an exercise yard connected to the bam. - Straw should, if possible, be kept under roof. It decreases the need of straw and makes it easier to use. The conclusion of this study throughout both literature and field studies, is that there are good possibilities in Sweden, to develop the more simple forms of housing with maintained or more likely enhanced health and well-being in the suckler cows and their calves, To be able to take in use more simple forms of housing for the suckler cows and by this lowering the costs, means greater possibilities for the suckler cow production to survive in the long run. Today there is no margin in the suckler cow production for any expensive investments...|$|E
40|$|It {{is argued}} {{in order to}} explain large {{differences}} {{in the level of}} the development and the growth of economies cannot be adequately explained only by looking the traditional <b>inputs</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> capital and natural resources. The hypothesis is that also the role of social capital needs to be taken into account. First the concept of social capital is defined and discussed. Then the role of social capital in the development process is explained. Empirical test based on the cross-country data of 27 countries indicates that trust as a component of social capital {{is an important factor in}} explaining the differences in the rate of economic growth in this set of countries. This supports the idea that the role of the trust to rules of the economic behaviour has indeed an important role to play in good economic performance. On the contrary the participation index is not statistically significant. This is in contrast with some other, usually micro-based studies where participation has proved to be important in improving the performance of the development projects. The report is part of a VATT research project "Human Capital and Entrepreunership". Economic growth, development, social capital, trust, participation...|$|R

Therefore industry and public office are obliged to implement the concepts of structured environmental management systems more and more strictly. The endpoints are dependent {{on the type of}} wastes and on the priorities set by society. They will with time evolve towards more restriction of all kinds of emissions. This will require increasing <b>inputs</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour,</b> information technology and energy into waste treatment and overall {{waste management}}. Particularly for aqueous and gaseous wastes that are not contained, continuously improving treatment with maximum re-use and minimum dissipation in the ecosphere will be the trend of the future. Moreover, the public in general and the individual citizen in particular will request to have (bio) assays to monitor regularly and autonomously the quality of his environment. Such advanced waste management requires considerable energy input. It thus may come in conflict with current concerns about CO 2 -emissions and the Kyoto agreements. Innovative approaches to combine waste management and the International Climate Change Partnership (ICCP) directives, for instance by implementing biological carbon sequestration, are therefore warranted. Biotechnology has a major role to play particularly in terms of advanced treatment down to ng/l-levels and in terms of validating the quality of the environment by means of powerful and intelligent bio-monitoring devices...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of innovation for firm performance is widely recognised but not frequently quantified, {{due to the}} lack of data on the creation and acquisition of intangible knowledge assets. In this analysis we use a unique data set to estimate how far expenditures on R&D and the acquisition of intellectual property (IP), in the form of patents and trade marks, can increase the productivity of firms, measured as the value added by <b>inputs</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and capital services. Without IP protection, knowledge is known to have the public good characteristic of non-excludability. Even with the existence of patents and trade marks, imitation and inventing around other firm’s products is frequently observed. We examine both the size and the duration of benefits to IP protection for firms. Knowledge assets are also frequently assumed to have the second public good characteristic of being non-depletable; if true this would imply that within firms it is the absolute amount of R&D, or the total number of IP assets, which is important for success. We examine this hypothesis against the alternative, that either or both R&D and IP reflect knowledge stocks which are depletable in use within the firm; on this view it is the intensity of these activities relative to the size of the firm which matters for their increased performance...|$|R
40|$|Every day, nearly 9, 000 people world-wide become {{infected}} with HIV, {{the virus that}} causes AIDS. The continent of Africa has been the most seriously hit, but the epidemic has spread throughout Asia and is increasingly evident in the Caribbean and in the Pacific. Because the disease is so widespread and far reaching in its effects, it cannot be looked upon solely as a medical problem. AIDS also has a direct major impact on agricultural production and national economies. Unlike many diseases, AIDS affects individuals m their most productive years, with the majority of HIV infections occurring in people between the ages of 20 and 40. In some rural communities of sub Saharan Africa, this selective nature of the disease has practically wiped out a whole generation, leaving behind the grandparents and the orphaned children to face the challenge of survival. HIV/AIDS has also had severe and, in some instances, devastating effects on extension and veterinary personnel, and {{it has been reported that}} in some districts of some eastern African countries there are insufficient staff to maintain these services. This could jeopardize the timely reporting of, and reaction to, disease outbreaks such as rinderpest (see In Brief Rinderpest, a continuing risk). It is, perhaps, no great surprise that studies of the situation in Zambia, Uganda and Tanzania report a significant decline in crop yields on small farms, especially over the last five years. This decrease in agricultural output can in part be blamed on the multiple effects of the AIDS epidemic. Illness and death directly affect the availability of labour, and those who remain healthy are preoccupied with caring for the sick or undertaking additional tasks that were previously done by others. As a result, time consuming work like weeding, mulching, pruning and land clearance is either not carried out properly or is left undone. Failing to carry out essential agricultural practices also causes a decline in soil fertility, an increase in pests and diseases and an inevitable reduction in output. Labour and land are usually the only sources of earnings available to small-scale farmers. Families affected by AIDS have to survive with less labour, reduced output and, consequently, on a lower income from the sale of farm produce; they cannot afford inputs such as seed and fertilizer, or the tools that may be required for the following season. Medical costs associated with caring for the sick and bedridden have to be borne, along with the funeral expenses of family members who die of the disease. The need for cash often forces desperate measures: cattle are sold, together with other marketable goods; and children are taken out of school to save expenditure On fees, books and uniforms and to provide extra labour. These measures can help sustain families for a while but, in the long term, they worsen the prospect of being able to earn a living and ensure an adequate supply of food. The threat to household and community food security is a serious one, particularly as a good nutritious diet has been shown to improve the condition of those living with AIDS. In areas such as the Kagera region of Tanzania, where the AIDS epidemic has struck hardest, there has been an estimated 50 % decline in production of bananas, coffee and staple foods. Farming families have, however, already started to develop their own Survival strategies. Many have made the change to less labour intensive crops that are easier to plant and maintain, and to crops that are also drought resistant. In some farming systems the impact of AIDS has resulted in a shift away from cash crops, such as coffee, in order to concentrate all available labour on the production of subsistence crops like sweet potatoes and cassava in Africa, and taro or eddies in the Pacific. Farmers have also had to adapt their livestock raising practices. Cattle require a high <b>input</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and, if this is not available, livestock health deteriorates and their economic potential is reduced. As a result, there appears to be a parallel trend towards the keeping of smaller stock, most notably pigs and poultry, which can be less demanding on labour and are also better able to survive by scavenging for much of their nutrient needs. These coping mechanisms developed by farmers are not long-term solutions. In fact, some of these shifts in agricultural practices are already beginning to show drawbacks: for example, a narrowing of the range of crops grown and livestock kept. Education has to be a key factor in reducing the impact of AIDS, particularly in the Pacific and the Caribbean, where the epidemic is still in its relatively early stages. Ms. Renu Chahil-Graf, Senior Advisor to the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), wants to see more countries put in place aggressive prevention programmes beginning with awareness creation through agricultural extension services. 'Providing basic information on how AIDS is spread and simple ways in which to avoid it can make a big change,' she says. Farming families that are already affected by AIDS need support and advice on health care and nutrition. Credit assistance could help farmers set up home-based incomegenerating opportunities and small-scale trading activities in order to supplement income. Various interventions are being undertaken by NGOs, but effective implementation requires the active support of ACP governments. Funds directed in this manner are a worthwhile investment for a stable national economy. Because of the nature of HIV/AIDS, and the reluctance of individuals and some governments to be frank about the extent of epidemics, it is difficult to be precise about their development or regression. The AIDS epidemic may be levelling off in some of the earliest affected countries, such as Uganda, but this is no time to be complacent. In other areas HIV/AIDS infections continue to rise at an alarming rate and the impact of HIV/AIDS continues to manifest itself in different ways, affecting every aspect of day to day life. The full extent of the epidemic and its eventual effect on ACP agriculture remains disturbingly hidden, but educational and supportive measures implemented now can help mitigate the consequences in the future.

40|$|Traditional olive {{orchards}} {{account for}} {{a large share of}} the area under olives in the EU, particularly in marginal areas, like those analysed in the OLIVERO project. In general, traditional olive growing can be described as a low-intensity production system, associated with old (sometimes very old) trees, grown at a low density, giving small yields and receiving low <b>inputs</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> and materials. Though such systems are environmentally sustainable, their economic viability has become an issue, since EU policies favour more intensive and competitive systems. Orchards that have not been intensified seem to be threatened by the recent reform of the EU olive and olive oil policy, as income support has been decoupled from production. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the present constraints to traditional olive growing, and to recommend some private and public interventions to prevent its abandonment. During the OLIVERO project, traditional olive production systems were identified and described in five target areas (Trás-os-Montes-Portugal, Cordoba and Granada/Jaen-Spain, Basilicata/Salerno-Italy, and West Crete-Greece). The causes and consequences of abandonment are discussed, based on the analysis of the costs and returns, which revealed that these systems are barely economically sustainable. Their viability is only assured if reduced opportunity costs for family labour are accepted, and the olive growing is part-time. Based on these results, recommendations are made to prevent the abandonment of traditional olive growing and to preserve its environmental benefits...|$|R

40|$|Productivity {{growth is}} {{strongly}} correlated {{to economic growth}} and increases in welfare. This fact also holds true at the industry level and is particularly true in the NZ construction industry, since productivity growth in this sector may have significant effects on the affordability of housing in the country. In recent years construction in NZ {{has been subjected to}} a series of reports that have either highlighted ‘failure’ to grow productivity or have exhorted the industry to improve its ‘poor performance’.   However thus far little by way of analysis has gone into the productivity figures that have been quoted, nor has much been done to explain and justify if or why these figures are correct or incorrect. This research seeks to deconstruct construction productivity figures in NZ and explain the patterns over recent years of ‘poor performance’ in comparison with other industries.   As such it will examine the nature of the NZ construction industry and analyse the historic statistics related to its labour productivity. This will provide an overall understanding of the sector as well as those extraneous factors that may have significant influences on the NZ construction sector. The research found that while factors influencing <b>inputs</b> <b>of</b> <b>labour</b> productivity measure such as labour and material costs remained stable, factors impacting the corresponding outputs such as house and land prices, value of work in Non-residential and Infrastructure construction grew significantly between 1997 and 2007. Given the positive skewing effect of standard economic indicators (inflation etc) on construction labour productivity figures, the relatively poor performance of construction is worrying for the industry. The paper concludes by demonstrating labour productivity in construction is significantly worse performing than previously suspected. </p...|$|R
