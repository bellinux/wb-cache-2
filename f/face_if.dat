5|$|Triadic joint {{attention}} {{is the highest}} level of joint attention and involves two individuals looking at an object. Each individual must understand that the other individual is looking at the same object and realize that {{there is an element of}} shared attention. Triadic {{attention is}} marked by the individual looking back to the other individual after looking at the object. Dyadic joint attention involves mutual gaze between the parent and infant. Mutual gaze is marked by both the parent and infant looking at each other's <b>face.</b> <b>If</b> two individuals are simply looking at an object, it is referred to as shared gaze.|$|E

25|$|The two {{airlines}} combined {{would have}} had 17% of Heathrow slots against British Airways' 43%. Worried about the increased competition it would <b>face</b> <b>if</b> such a merger went ahead, British Airways considered the takeover of either BMI or Virgin Atlantic to stop the merger. British Airways concluded {{it would be easier}} to take over the financially weaker and less high-profile BMI. However, in 2004 talks of any merger of the three airlines ended. In late 2006, the airline again dismissed renewed speculation that Virgin Atlantic was preparing to make a bid to acquire full control of BMI, despite Sir Richard Branson repeating in a radio interview that such a merger would be a logical business move.|$|E

25|$|Clique {{complexes}} {{are also}} known as Whitney complexes. A Whitney triangulation or clean triangulation of a two-dimensional manifold is an embedding of a graph G onto the manifold {{in such a way}} that every face is a triangle and every triangle is a <b>face.</b> <b>If</b> a graph G has a Whitney triangulation, it must form a cell complex that is isomorphic to the Whitney complex of G. In this case, the complex (viewed as a topological space) is homeomorphic to the underlying manifold. A graph G has a 2-manifold clique complex, and can be embedded as a Whitney triangulation, if and only if G is locally cyclic; this means that, for every vertex v in the graph, the induced subgraph formed by the neighbors of v forms a single cycle.|$|E

He recognizes the man as Raval (Bertil Anderberg), a theologian, who ten years prior had convinced the knight to leave his wife and join a crusade to the Holy Land. The squire promises to brand the theologian on the <b>face</b> <b>if</b> they meet again. The servant girl joins the squire. The trio ride into town, where the actors met earlier are performing. Skat the actor-manager introduces the other actors to the crowd, then is enticed by Lisa (Inga Gill)—wife of the sentimental and violent blacksmith Plog—away for a tryst. They run off together.

25|$|A new {{momentum}} bar {{has been}} introduced to determine {{the flow of the}} match, replacing the old clean/dirty and SmackDown! meters. If the player chooses their wrestler to fight clean, he/she will be portrayed as a <b>face,</b> <b>If</b> they choose fight dirty, he/she will be portrayed as a heel. The player also has to deal with a stamina bar, which drains as the wrestlers fights; the more elaborate the move, the more the wrestler will be tired. However, this is an optional feature and can be removed in the options menu. The player has to regenerate their stamina bar to prevent becoming completely exhausted and unable to perform. Each character also has a new stamina attribute, making those with a low stamina rating tire more easily. Also included is a new Hardcore attribute, allowing those rated high to inflict more damage to their opponent with weapons.|$|E

25|$|The Progressives {{were founded}} {{during the late}} 1870s {{by a group of}} yangban who fully {{supported}} Westernization of Joseon. However, they wanted immediate Westernization, including a complete cut-off of ties with Qing China. Unaware of their anti-Chinese sentiments, the Queen Consort granted frequent audiences and meetings with them to discuss progressivism and nationalism. They advocated for educational and social reforms, including the equality of the sexes by granting women full rights, issues that were not even acknowledged in their already Westernized neighbor of Japan. The Queen Consort was completely enamored by the Progressives in the beginning, but when she learned that they were deeply anti-Chinese, she quickly turned her back on them. Cutting ties with China immediately was not in her gradual plan of Westernization. She saw the consequences Joseon would have to <b>face</b> <b>if</b> she did not play China and Japan off by the West gradually, especially since she was a strong advocate of the Sadae faction who were pro-China and pro-gradual Westernization.|$|E

500|$|In 1993, Bruce Dickinson {{left the}} band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a {{farewell}} tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package). The first, A Real Live One, featured songs from 1986 to 1992, {{and was released}} in March 1993. The second, A Real Dead One, featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, however, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows and that at several concerts he would only mumble into the microphone. Dickinson denies the charge that he was under-performing, stating {{that it was impossible}} to [...] "make like Mr Happy <b>Face</b> <b>if</b> the vibe wasn't right", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour. He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the BBC and released on video under the name Raising Hell.|$|E

Adding to his guilt is when Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney are upset as well, telling Bart that they would attack the culprit {{critically}} as they did not actually mean what they said about the statue before. Bart begins to fear of the consequences he would <b>face</b> <b>if</b> his actions are to be revealed, and his conscience manifests itself as the statue's severed head, which begins speaking to him. Unable to go on, Bart finally confesses his crime to his family, explaining {{that he thought that}} being popular {{was the most important thing}} in the world that Homer told him. It was then Homer realized that he inspired Bart of his popularity advice that caused him to commit the crime in the first place, and feels extremely guilty of doing so. Bart then decides to return the head back where it belongs, and Homer follows along, holding himself responsible for the events. They are found by the angry mob, returning the story to the beginning.|$|E
500|$|Opening track [...] "Against Privacy" [...] was {{described}} by Willett as a [...] "bohemian manifesto" [...] made by a person with an affinity {{for the arts and}} wanting to live on an art commune. [...] "Mexican Dogs" [...] was written by the band during a trip in Mexico City where they saw a pack of unnamed three-legged dogs running wild across the field. Maust said that he saw it as a metaphor for how the band operates as a whole, in their conduction of both art and business, and how their song craft is [...] "very community oriented and very democratic." [...] The overall sound of the track is reminiscent of boogie rock. The track [...] "Every Valley Is Not a Lake" [...] was a song that was left off Robbers & Cowards. It tells the story about a mother lecturing her daughter about going wild {{in the world and the}} consequences she may <b>face</b> <b>if</b> not careful. The song utilizes jazz piano for its melodies. [...] "Something Is Not Right with Me" [...] is an upbeat track about a person losing touch with the revolving world and its constant changes from people to technology. Critics described the song as having [...] "Stones-styled bluesy licks" [...] and [...] "Lodger-era Bowie rhythms." ...|$|E
500|$|Hewitt {{convened a}} Court of Inquiry, judged by Indian officers, to {{investigate}} the events. The inquiry found that the ammunition issued to the men was of the same type the men previously used, and was in fact manufactured {{under the supervision of}} one of the five men who had accepted his ammunition during the parade. During the inquiry, only one man expressed a concern regarding the greased cartridges; the wider concerns of the men were based on the perceived stigma that they would <b>face</b> <b>if</b> they had accepted the ammunition. The inquiry found that the men had no reasonable cause, and no religious grounds, to refuse to accept the cartridges. A court martial was ordered, again composed entirely of Indian officers (six Muslim, nine Hindu), and this took place over a three-day period with each of the 85 men giving a plea of [...] "not guilty". The men were found guilty, by 14 of 15 officers, of disobeying orders, and were sentenced to 10 years' hard labour. The judges asked Hewitt to take into consideration the fact that the men were of good character and had been misled, but this was ignored as Hewitt felt there had been no expression of remorse. Eleven of the men, the youngest, had their sentences reduced from 10 to 5 years, but sentences of the remaining men were confirmed on 8 May.|$|E
