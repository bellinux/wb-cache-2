40|$|Austenitic {{chromium-nickel steel}} EK- 164 is the {{promising}} material for manufacturing claddings of fuel pins of fast nuclear reactors. Physical and chemical compatibility with typical nuclear fuel compositions {{on the basis}} of uranium dioxide pellets is an important aspect of ensuring fuel cladding operability. Post-irradiation examination of irradiated combined fuel assembly with maximum burnup 9. 1 % FIMA and damaging dose of 77. 3 dpa equipped with fuel pins with claddings made of CHS- 68 and EK- 164 steels in cold-worked state was performed. Gamma-scanning, electric potential resistometry and optical metallography methods were applied in the examination. According to the gamma-scanning and resistometry data high-temperature sections of fuel pins are the potential centers of development of fuel pin cladding corrosion. Comparative analysis of internal corrosion of fuel pin claddings made of EK- 164 and CHS- 68 steels along the reactor core height was performed. In the section with maximum power density at operational temperatures below 540 °С depth of corrosion of CHS- 68 steel from the side of fuel did not exceed 15 µm. On similar sections of fuel pin cladding made of EK- 164 steel depth of internal corrosion amounted to 10 µm. Maximum of corrosion damage for both steel types was registered at temperatures in the range from 600 °С to 650 °С. In this case depth of corrosion damages in the form of <b>intercrystalline</b> and general <b>corrosion</b> did not exceed 20 µm. No significant differences in the corrosion mechanism between the steels were found. Local exacerbation of corrosion at the junctions between fuel pellets and in places of concentration of cesium fission fragments was detected. And contrariwise in place of narrowing residual gap between fuel and cladding, where cesium is not present, corrosion of EK- 164 steel is minimal. Maximum thinning of cladding of the investigated fuel pins with maximum burnup of 9 % FIMA amounted to not more than 5 % of the original thickness...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The Russian 1370 Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloy (analogue of 6056) is an {{advanced}} {{material for the}} skin and stringers of fuselage. However, these alloys are susceptible to the <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>corrosion</b> depending on the heat treatment regimes. The investigations {{of the effect of}} heating temperature during the solid solution treatment (530 - 555) °C and quenching rate, ageing regimes and interval between the quenching and ageing on the structure and properties of 1370 alloy sheets were per-formed. The strengthening β (Mg 2 Si) -phase and Q (Al 5 Cu 2 Mg 8 Si 6) -phase relationship dependence of the alloy properties is established. Using the dark field electron microscopy which permits to in-tensify separate diffraction reflexes of strengthening phases the structure of Q-phase precipitates has been studied. Optimization of heat treatment of 1370 alloy sheets provided the combination of frac-ture toughness characteristic (Kco = 100 MPa√m) high level, the ultimate strength of 400 - 420 MPa and <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>corrosion</b> no more 100 µm in depth...|$|E

It has been proved that at the concentration of 0, 07 %C, products made of the examined cast steel reveal on their surface some symptoms of local corrosion. Carbon concentration raised to 0, 14 %C results in advanced <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>corrosion</b> and the onset of local corrosion.

40|$|Micron-size Ni-base alloy (NBA) powders {{were mixed}} with both 1. 5 wt. % (hereinafter %) micron-size CeO 2 (m-CeO 2) and also 1. 5 % and 3. 0 % {{nano-size}} CeO 2 (n- CeO 2) powders. These mixtures were coated on low-carbon steel (Q 235) by 2. 0 kW CO 2 laser cladding. The {{effects on the}} microstructures, phases and electrochemical corrosion of the coatings upon the addition of m- and n- CeO 2 powders to NBA (m- and n- CeO 2 /NBA) have been investigated. The results showed that a smooth coating was prepared under suitable processing parameters (P= 2. 0 kW, V= 180 mm min- 1) by adding 1. 5 % n- CeO 2. In addition to the primary phases of γ-Ni, Cr 23 C 6 and Ni 3 B in the Ni-base alloy coating, CeNi 3 was formed in Ni-base alloy coatings with both n- CeO 2 and m-CeO 2 particles, and CeNi 5 appeared in the coating upon decreasing the size of CeO 2 particles. Well-developed dendrites were observed in the Ni-base alloy coating; directional dendrites grew at the interface in the coating upon the addition of m-CeO 2, whereas fine and multioriented dendrites grew upon decreasing the size of CeO 2 particles to the nanoscale. Actinomorphic dendrites and compact equiaxed dendrites grew from the interface to near the surface upon increasing the content of n- CeO 2 from 1. 5 to 3. 0 %. In strongly acidic HNO 3 solution, the severe corrosion of dendrites occurred {{and there were many}} corrosion pits in the Ni-base alloy coating; <b>intercrystalline</b> <b>corrosion</b> also has a dominant role upon the addition of m-CeO 2, whereas uniform corrosion occurs in the coating as the size of CeO 2 particles is decreased to nanoscale...|$|E
