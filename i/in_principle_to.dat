5|$|Aggressive mimicry is {{opposite}} <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> defensive mimicry, {{where the}} mimic generally benefits from {{being treated as}} harmful. The mimic may resemble its own prey, or some other organism which is beneficial {{or at least not}} harmful to the prey. The model, i.e. the organism being 'imitated', may experience increased or reduced fitness, or may not be affected at all by the relationship. On the other hand, the signal receiver inevitably suffers from being tricked, {{as is the case in}} most mimicry complexes.|$|E

5|$|In September 2010 Willie Walsh, now CEO of IAG, {{announced}} that the group was considering acquiring other airlines and had drawn up a shortlist of twelve possible acquisitions. In November 2011 IAG announced an agreement <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> purchase British Midland International from Lufthansa. A contract to purchase the airline was agreed the next month, and the sale was completed for £172.5 million on 30 March 2012. The airline established a new subsidiary based at London City Airport operating Airbus A318s.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron transport chain come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of these rules is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> act in that way.|$|E

5|$|Students at Hastings Boys' High School {{organised}} {{a conference}} in 1999 to consider cloning the huia, their school emblem. The tribe Ngāti Huia agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> support the endeavour, which would be carried out at the University of Otago, and a California-based Internet start-up volunteered $100,000 of funding. However, Sandy Bartle, curator of birds at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, said that the complete huia genome could not be derived from museum skins because of the poor state of the DNA, and cloning was therefore unlikely to succeed.|$|E
5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} the front office. COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{recombination}} produces {{genetic variation}} that likely {{contributes to the}} evolution of resistance to anti-retroviral therapy. Recombination may also contribute, <b>in</b> <b>principle,</b> <b>to</b> overcoming the immune defenses of the host. Yet, for the adaptive advantages of genetic variation to be realized, the two viral genomes packaged in individual infecting virus particles need to have arisen from separate progenitor parental viruses of differing genetic constitution. It is unknown how often such mixed packaging occurs under natural conditions.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} at Srebrenica, sixteen nations {{met at the}} London Conference, which began on 21 July 1995, to {{consider}} new options for Bosnia. As {{a result of the}} conference, UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials. The North Atlantic Council, NATO's top political body, and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of Serb aggression.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to no training time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{proposals}} {{to abolish the}} five district councils in favour of a unitary authority (covering the existing two-tier county) were rejected following local opposition. West Somerset is the least populous district (except for the two sui generis districts) in England. In September 2016, West Somerset and Taunton Deane councils agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> merge the districts into one (with one council) subject to consultation. It is planned to achieve this on 1 April 2019 with the first elections to the new council in May 2019. The new district {{would not be a}} unitary authority, with Somerset County Council still performing its functions.|$|E

5|$|In late 2014, Russia {{offered the}} Su-35 to Indonesia {{as the country}} sought to replace its ageing F-5E Tiger II fleet. The {{following}} year, the Indonesian Ministry of Defence selected the Su-35 ahead of the Eurofighter Typhoon, Dassault Rafale, F-16, and Saab JAS 39 Gripen; the Defence Ministry cited the Indonesian Air Force's familiarity with the Su-27SK and Su-30MK2 {{as the reason for}} the aircraft's selection. There were some initial reports that the country was to order a squadron of up to sixteen aircraft, but the number was later reduced to some ten aircraft. By mid-2017, negotiations between the two parties for the sale of the Su-35 had reached an advanced stage, with the Indonesian government later agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> conduct a barter trade of agricultural products for a reported eleven aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Kremlin's military and political concessions, Reagan agreed to renew talks on economic issues and the scaling-back of the arms race. The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland. At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50percent. A second summit, was held in October 1986, Reykjavík, Iceland. Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, which Gorbachev wanted eliminated. Reagan refused. The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with {{the signing of the}} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF). The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500kilometers (300 to 3,400miles) and their infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|On January 15, 2003, Sound Transit and the Port of Seattle {{signed an}} {{agreement}} <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> develop a plan for light rail expansion to the airport. The agreement envisioned a light rail station along International Boulevard near South 175th Street connected to the airport's terminal via the existing parking garage, with enhanced pedestrian connections and connections to a future hotel {{at the north end}} of the garage. The two agencies also agreed to work together on planning and engineering for the project, which would be built in conjunction with a realignment of the Airport Expressway. The plan was finalized in December 2004, with an agreement to accelerate planning and construction in time for a December 2009 opening, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in nearby Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E

5|$|Alan Ball the {{previous}} chairman became executive deputy chairman, with Smallpeice requesting a non-executive deputy chairman position, which was quickly agreed to. Sandys and Smallpeice {{were joined by}} a third new board member, the Conservative politician Edward du Cann and the new board constituted in March 1972. The board quickly become concerned at the behaviour of their chief executive Tiny Rowland who had agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> finance a sugar refinery in Sudan {{at a cost of}} £80 to £100 million, whilst the company {{was in the midst of}} refinancing itself. The board was able to reword the agreement and it became a feasibility study, recovering the situation but respite from a further crisis would prove to be short lived. The situation at Lonrho went from bad to worse during early 1973, when Peats, Lonrho's auditors, discovered payments totalling £44,000 made from a subsidiary company based in the Cayman Islands to Duncan Sandys. Sandys, believing that the payment had been authorised by the board returned in full the money he had received.|$|E
5|$|During {{its annual}} session in 2000, the WMO/ESCAP Panel on North Indian Tropical Cyclones agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> start {{assigning}} names to cyclonic storms that developed within the North Indian Ocean. As {{a result of}} this, the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur {{by the end of}} 2000. At the 2001 session, the rapporteur reported that of the eight countries involved, only India had refused to submit a list of names, as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones. The panel then studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and thus requested that members submit new lists of names. During 2002 the rapporteur reported {{that there had been a}} poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names. Over the next year, each country except India submitted a fresh list. By the 2004 session, India had still not submitted its list despite promising to do so. However, the rapporteur presented the lists of names that would be used with a gap left for India's names. The rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists be used on an experimental basis during the season, starting in May or June 2004. The naming lists were then completed in May 2004, after India submitted their names. However, the lists were not used until September 2004, when the first tropical cyclone was named Onil by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company's {{status was}} bolstered {{when it became}} one of the first 12 {{companies}} to be listed on the inaugural Dow Jones Industrial Average, compiled in May 1896. However, it was not long before TCI was eclipsed by its principal competitor, the United States Steel Corporation, a huge conglomerate formed in 1901 out of the enormous Carnegie and Federal steel empires. By the time of the Panic of 1907, U. S. Steel felt confident enough to launch a takeover bid of its Southern rival. On the morning of Saturday November 2, banker and tycoon J. P. Morgan, one of the founders of U. S. Steel, convened a meeting in his library and there suggested that U. S. Steel purchase the stock of an insolvent Wall Street brokerage firm, Moore and Schley, which had secured huge loans against 6 million TCI shares. This was not an entirely selfish gesture, as Morgan recognised that the failure of Moore and Schley would send investor confidence in the markets into a nose-dive. E. H. Gary, president of U. S. Steel, agreed <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> <b>to</b> this transaction, yet argued that without careful political maneuvering the deal would be seen by Congress as an effort to create a monopoly and thereby encounter troublesome federal anti-trust litigation. Morgan himself had been burnt by crusading Washington trust-busters in 1902 when his Northern Securities Company had been forcibly broken up by the government in a landmark test case.|$|E
