500|$|At {{the end of}} the performance, {{according}} to Ted Shaffrey, [...] "Before he emerged from the phone-booth sized contraption of clear plastic and steel, Angel yanked out the air hose that allowed him to breathe. Then assistants pulled a black curtain over the 220-gallon (832-liter) chamber to block the view of television cameras and about 100 people gathered outside the window in which he was displayed. Under cover, Angel apparently escaped from the shackles that bound his arms, legs and neck, before pulling himself from the watery chamber with a celebratory scream." [...] Upon successfully completing the trick, he was described as having [...] "skin <b>crinkled</b> and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> bloodshot", and upon emerging from the tank he was taken to St. Clare's Hospital and treated for severe dehydration. He reported afterwards that he had suffered from overheating, jaw fatigue, and semi-consciousness while in the tank.|$|R
60|$|And--having {{nothing better}} to employ me then--I {{presently}} went raging to old Pettigrew {{in order to put}} the whole thing before him in what I considered the proper light. Old Pettigrew evaded my illumination; he saw me coming up his front steps--I can still see his queer old nose and the <b>crinkled</b> brow over <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and the little wisp of gray hair that showed over the corner of his window-blind--and he instructed his servant to put up the chain when she answered the door, and to tell me that he would not see me. So I had to fall back upon my pen.|$|R

6000|$|... "While {{they was}} talking who should come along but George English hisself! He came {{right up to}} the table, and they all sat back on the bench and stared at ’im fierce, and Henery Walker <b>crinkled</b> <b>’is</b> nose at him.|$|R

And their father and mother were Terrence and Biddy of Meringe. And Jerry is our Sing Song Silly. And this dog sings. And <b>he</b> has a <b>crinkled</b> ear. And <b>his</b> name is Michael." ...|$|R
60|$|The boy {{appeared}} on deck, very white about the gills, and looking piteously at the crew for support. He became conscious from their scowls {{that he had}} forgotten something, and remembering himself, stretched out his skinny arms to their full extent, and, <b>crinkling</b> <b>his</b> nose, walked with great trepidation to the side.|$|R

60|$|Already {{they were}} rarely together. Leitner ran {{attaching}} himself to somebody or other, always deferring, Loerke {{was a good}} deal alone. Out of doors he wore a Westphalian cap, a close brown-velvet head with big brown velvet flaps down over his ears, so that he looked like a lop-eared rabbit, or a troll. His face was brown-red, with a dry, bright skin, that seemed to <b>crinkle</b> with <b>his</b> mobile expressions. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> were arresting--brown, full, like a rabbit's, or like a troll's, or like the eyes of a lost being, having a strange, dumb, depraved look of knowledge, and a quick spark of uncanny fire. Whenever Gudrun had tried to talk to him he had shied away unresponsive, looking at her with <b>his</b> watchful dark <b>eyes,</b> but entering into no relation with her. He had made her feel that her slow French and her slower German, were hateful to him. As for his own inadequate English, he was much too awkward to try it at all. But he understood a good deal of what was said, nevertheless. And Gudrun, piqued, left him alone.|$|R

60|$|In the act {{of turning}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> gratefully towards <b>his</b> friend, he wandered away. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> stood still, and settled into that former intent unmeaning stare.|$|R

60|$|Indeed, in a minute, Mr. Will {{did come}} to himself. First <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> rolled about, or rather, I am ashamed to say, <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> one having been closed by Mr. Warrington's first blow. First, then, <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> rolled about; then he gasped and uttered an inarticulate moan or two, {{then he began to}} swear and curse very freely and articulately.|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Winkle {{was always}} {{remarkable}} for extreme humanity.
