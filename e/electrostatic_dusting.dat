50|$|The {{intermolecular force}} is weaker than {{electrostatic}} charges. However, it still attracts microscopic-sized dust {{to the image}} sensor with infinitesimal force. While earthing (grounding) the camera can help reduce the problem of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dust</b> it does not reduce intermolecular attraction. If, for example, flour were drizzled into the camera, it would still adhere {{to the surface of}} earthed metal. This kind of dust is attracted by intermolecular force. Liquid also adheres to the image sensor by intermolecular force and such molecules adhere strongly due to their ability to get closer to the adhesion surface, making it harder for dust reduction systems to remove these type of contaminants completely.

30|$|Charging of fungal spores and any {{potentially}} connected functions (e.g. {{in support}} for spores {{to serve as}} nuclei for raindrops; Elbert et al. 2007; Hassett et al. 2015) are understudied and generally little understood (Webster et al. 1988; Wargenau et al. 2011, 2013; Saar 2013; Saar and Parmasto 2014; Saar and Salm 2014). In line, practical use of charging of spores and spore behaviour in electric fields has so far only seldom been made of. However, guarding of bookshelves with an electric field screen has been tested to successfully protect old valuable books in library stack rooms against mold infection by airborne spores (Takikawa et al. 2014) and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dust</b> collectors were applied in French archives to study their fungal allergenic potentials (Roussel et al. 2012). Spores in buildings and rooms distribute unevenly, among as factors behind by being influenced by electric and magnetic devices (Anaya et al. 2015, 2016). Knowledge on fungal spore distributions in buildings as in outside environments can come through application of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dust</b> collectors (Normand et al. 2016) and electrostatic precipitators might be used (Han et al. 2011). An electrostatic nursery shelter and an ozone-generative electrostatic spore precipitator were reported to protect tomato plants in hydroponic culture and in open-window greenhouses against fungal pathogens (Shimizu et al. 2007; Kakutani et al. 2012; Takikawa et al. 2016) and an electrostatic spore collector {{has been applied to}} collect conidia of the barley pathogen Blumeria graminis (Moriura et al. 2006). While our experimental set-up here is simple and easy to apply by using electrostatic features intrinsic to the plastic lids of Petri-dishes to selectively collect basidiospores from mushrooms, our observations offer the possibility to also develop technically more sophisticated devices for basidiospore collection.|$|R

However, it can be associated to high emission of particulate matter characterized with a very fin size distribution and strong contribution of organic condensables. In France, the residential sector, to which heating using biomass combustion is a major contributor represents {{the main part of the}} national emissions inventory of PM and PAHs. In order to address the issue, the French environmental agency (ADEME) is promoting the development of highly energetically and environmentally heating devices. To that extent, the Peren 2 BOIS program which was financially supported by the ADEME and the French ministry of environment and was coordinated by INERIS and gathered, industrials, notified bodies, private and public research laboratories. It mainly aimed at evaluating the efficiency of primary and secondary reduction techniques for particles and organic compounds emissions.

The efficiency was tested by comparing the amount of pollutants measured in the flue gas during five successive combustion batches : before and after the technique (<b>electrostatic</b> <b>dust</b> filters and cyclone); or with and without the technique (catalytic filter).

In order to investigate {{the nature of this}} plasma environment, the first two-dimensional kinetic simulations of solar wind expansion into a lunar crater with a self-consistent plasma-surface interaction have been undertaken. The present results reveal how the plasma expansion into a crater couples with the electrically-charged lunar surface to produce a quasi-steady wake structure. In particular, there is a negative feedback between surface charging and ambipolar wake potential that allows an equilibrium to be achieved, with secondary electron emission strongly moderating the process. A range of secondary electron yields is explored, and two distinct limits are highlighted in which either surface charging or ambipoiar expansion is responsible for determining the overall wake structure...|$|R

A generalized viscoelastic hydrodynamic model {{with the effects}} of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dust</b> pressure associated with the strong coupling of dust particles, and a quantum hydrodynamic model {{with the effects of}} quantum forces associated with the Bohm potential and the exchange-correlation potential for electrons and ions are considered. Both the linear and weakly nonlinear theory of DA waves are studied by the derivation and analysis of dispersion relations as well as Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and KdV-Burgers (KdVB) -like equations. It is shown that in the kinetic regime (ωτ_m≫ 1, where ω is the wave frequency and τ_m is the viscoelastic relaxtation time), the amplitude of the DA solitary waves decays slowly with time with the effect of a small amount of dust viscosity.

Since tape-lifting and swabbing, the currently established methods for non-destructive trace DNA sampling from clothing, both have their shortcomings in collection efficiency and handling, we thought about a new collection method for these challenging samples.

Our objective was therefore to compare several dust sampling methods for the detection of cultivable-microorganism exposure in stables. Sixteen French farms were sampled using four different methods: (i) active air sampling using a pump, (ii) passive dust sampling with a plastic box, (iii) dust sampling with an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>dust</b> fall collector (wipe), and (iv) dust sampling using a spatula to collect dust already settled on a windowsill. The results showed that collection of settled dust samples with either plastic boxes or wipes was reproducible (pairwise correlations, 0. 72 and 0. 73, respectively) and resulted in highly correlated results (pairwise correlation between the two methods, 0. 82). We also found that settled dust samples collected with a plastic box correctly reflected the composition of the samples collected in the air of the stable when there was no farmer activity.
