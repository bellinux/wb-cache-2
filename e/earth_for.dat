5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient phenomena might not {{be associated with the}} Moon itself but could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the <b>Earth.</b> <b>For</b> instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near the resolution of the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E

5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in Saber of London, a detective series, was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain Black and the Mysterons. After his mind is hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to use when transmitting threats to <b>Earth.</b> <b>For</b> his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E
5|$|During the 21st century, {{there will}} be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 72 will be annular, 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and annular eclipses. Of these, two annular and one total eclipse will be non-central, {{in the sense that}} the very center (axis) of the moon's shadow will miss the <b>earth</b> (<b>for</b> more {{information}} see gamma). In the 21st century the greatest number of eclipses in one year is four, in 2011, 2029, 2047, 2065, 2076, and 2094. The predictions given here are by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.|$|E

5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>for</b> solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{said that}} the show would {{continue}} to cover modern themes in a science fiction way as had the first series, saying that these could include hijacking, nationalism and radicalization of both individuals and groups. He also wanted to show 23rd-century <b>Earth</b> <b>for</b> the first time, and said that this had been the answer to Paramount executives asking him {{if there had been}} anything he wanted to do on The Original Series but could not. A further change was to be the number of female cast members, as NBC had a requirement of a maximum of one-third, and Roddenberry wanted to have them appear in authority positions.|$|E
5|$|The deities' ongoing battles prompt {{an alien}} race called the Aurum to invade <b>Earth</b> <b>for</b> its resources.

However, Pyrrhon betrays the deities due to wanting to claim the Aurum's power and prove himself as the strongest god in existence, which leads to him being mentally controlled by the Aurum Brain. After Pit defeats the fusion of Pyrrhon and the Aurum Brain, Pyrrhon briefly comes to his senses and sacrifices himself to banish the Aurum {{to the far side}} of the galaxy.|$|E

5|$|The {{emission}} {{of dust and}} particles could have covered the entire surface of the <b>Earth</b> <b>for</b> several years, possibly a decade, creating a harsh environment for living things. The shock production of carbon dioxide caused by the destruction of carbonate rocks would {{have led to a}} sudden greenhouse effect. Over a longer period, sunlight would have been blocked from reaching the surface of the Earth by the dust particles in the atmosphere, cooling the surface dramatically. Photosynthesis by plants would also have been interrupted, affecting the entire food chain. A model of the event developed by Lomax et al. (2001) suggests that net primary productivity (NPP) rates may have increased to higher than pre-impact levels over the long term because of the high carbon dioxide concentrations.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena {{is that the}} vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring at the same place on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on <b>Earth</b> <b>for</b> the same event, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events is that they are caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E

It has also been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and from <b>Earth</b> <b>for</b> the past 23 years. Ground-based observations of the rings require the largest available telescopes.|$|E
