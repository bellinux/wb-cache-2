500|$|King William dies after Victoria's 18th birthday, {{avoiding}} a regency. After accession, Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence, including moving into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her {{first meeting with}} the Privy Council, she announces that [...] "I mean to devote my life in service of my country and my people". Victoria now moves into the recently completed Buckingham Palace and her aunt, Queen Adelaide, advises her against giving in too much to Lord Melbourne's direction. Albert then comes to England {{to spend more time}} with Victoria. They bond more, dancing together during her coronation and later discussing together the condition of the poor. Albert hints at taking their relationship further but the self-sufficient Victoria resists and he leaves.|$|E
500|$|Despite being married, Beatrice {{fulfilled}} {{her promise}} to the Queen by continuing as her full-time confidante and secretary. Queen Victoria warmed to Henry, as she often did with other handsome, strong men. However, the Queen criticised Beatrice's conduct {{during her first}} pregnancy. When Beatrice stopped coming to the Queen's dinners a week before giving birth, preferring to eat alone in her room, the Queen wrote angrily to her physician, Dr James Reid, that, [...] "I [...] coming to dinner, and not simply moping in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room,</b> which is very bad for her. In my case I regularly came to dinner, except when I was really unwell (even when suffering a great deal) up to the very last day." [...] Beatrice, aided by chloroform, gave birth the following week to her first son, Alexander. Despite suffering a miscarriage {{in the early months}} of her marriage, Beatrice gave birth to four children: Alexander, called [...] "Drino", was born in 1886; Ena in 1887; Leopold in 1889 and Maurice in 1891. Following this, she took a polite and encouraging interest in social issues, such as conditions in the coal mines. However, this interest did not extend to changing the conditions of poverty, as it had done with her brother, the Prince of Wales.|$|E
500|$|Maria and Anastasia {{were dressed}} {{similarly}} for special occasions, when they wore {{variations of the}} same dress. She tended {{to be dominated by}} her enthusiastic and energetic younger sister. When Anastasia tripped people who walked by, teased others or caused a scene with her dramatics, Maria always tried to apologize, though she could never stop her younger sister. Maria had simple tastes and was so kind-hearted that she was sometimes taken advantage of by her sisters, who nicknamed her [...] "fat little bow-wow." [...] In 1910, her fourteen-year-old sister Olga persuaded ten-year-old Maria to write their mother a letter asking that Olga be given <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> and be allowed to let down her dresses. Maria tried to persuade her mother that it was her own idea to write the letter. Her mother's friend, Lili Dehn, said that while Maria was not as lively as her three sisters, she knew her own mind. Maria had a talent for drawing and sketched well, always using her left hand, but was generally uninterested in her schoolwork. She was surprisingly strong and sometimes amused herself by demonstrating how she could lift her tutors off the ground. Though usually sweet-natured, Maria could also be stubborn and occasionally lazy. Her mother complained in one letter that Maria was grumpy and [...] "bellowed" [...] at the people who irritated her. Maria's moodiness coincided with her menstrual period, which the Tsarina and her daughters referred to as a visit from [...] "Madame Becker." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{she entered}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{and refused to}} leave them, {{in spite of the}} prayers of Cornichon, who begged her to let him explain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lily {{will be well}} {{long before}} that, I hope; not, indeed, that {{she ought to be}} moved out of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> for many weeks to come yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, do, dearest Hugh."--Then the matron {{proceeded}} {{through the}} rooms, expressing her satisfaction at the care {{which had been}} had for her comfort, in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> in particular.|$|R
500|$|The two visit Loretta in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> {{and find}} out that she feels guilty for {{cheating}} on him with Quagmire, and believes she can {{never go back to}} Cleveland. Later, Cleveland visits Brian to clear any negative feeling he has against him and Carolyn, as they are at [...] "a point of great soreness", but then Cleveland announces to Brian plans to elope with Carolyn in Hawaii, which makes their friendship tense. Just as Cleveland leaves, Loretta appears out of nowhere. Loretta apologizes to Cleveland for her affair with Quagmire, she then announces that she wants to get their family back together and promises she'll never betray him again. Cleveland goes to Peter and Lois for advice on what should be done. Peter and Lois think Cleveland shouldn't go back to Loretta, but Brian (seeing this as his only chance at getting back with Carolyn) says Cleveland should [...] "forgive and forget", and points out Loretta's good qualities (which he's obviously lying, as his nose starts to grow). Cleveland decides to talk to Loretta tomorrow to see how he feels about getting back together with her. Thinking Loretta hasn't changed, Peter recruits Quagmire to have sex with Loretta again so Cleveland can see she hasn't changed. Quagmire meets her at the hotel she's staying in, but this time, Loretta resists his advances and tells him to beat it after smashing him in the face with an iron. When Cleveland shows up to her hotel room, Cleveland forgives her, but insists that {{it is time for the}} both of them to move on while Loretta lives her life as amazing and wonderful as she can. Cleveland finally leaves as Loretta tearfully watches on. When Cleveland visits Carolyn, he finds her and Quagmire having sex, apparently the same way it happened to Brian. Since both Brian and Cleveland have been cheated on by the same woman, Cleveland apologizes to him for stealing Carolyn and they make amends, with the former revealing himself to have received a genital wart.|$|E
2500|$|That summer, {{the couple}} {{performed}} in rodeos in Winnipeg, Canada, and Boise, Idaho, and arrived back in Pendleton {{a few days}} before the Pendleton Round-Up was due to begin. However, because rooms were almost impossible to obtain, they decided to [...] "tie the knot" [...] as married couples were given preference, and as a result the landlady gave them <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b> [...] They won enough money to return to Los Angeles, where Hoot worked as a cowboy extra and double for Tom Mix, at the Selig Polyscope Company in the Edendale district of Los Angeles (now known as Echo Park). Helen also worked for Selig and for the Kalem Studios in Glendale.|$|E
60|$|Lady Ker {{sent her}} away, and called Simon Grieve to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Hot tears again surged to her eyes, as {{she would}} not let him see them, she turned quickly within, and ran {{as fast as she}} could up to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Flannigan {{was again}} called upon and readily {{agreed to take}} charge of Tommy and Dottie once more. She took them to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> and was cautioned about letting strangers in.|$|R
60|$|She could but kiss him, {{and hide}} her {{agitation}} in caresses, ere hurrying {{up the stairs}} she reached <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> a single bed- chamber opening into a more spacious sitting-room, now partially lighted by the candles on the toilette-table within.|$|R
60|$|Hortensia, a sob {{beating in}} her throat, turned and fled to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Alone {{again in}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room,</b> Mrs. Wagner {{stood by the}} reanimated fire, thinking.|$|E
60|$|Lucilla rose, bitterly disappointed, {{and opened}} the door that led into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{she sought}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> in Diana's Grove, {{she went over}} the whole subject again and again, always finding {{in the face of}} Lilla Watford a key to a problem which puzzled her--the problem of a way to turn Caswall's powers--his very existence--to aid her purpose.|$|R
60|$|She led {{him into}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> little <b>room,</b> and placed her hands in his.|$|R
50|$|Margaret is also {{famous for}} the legend that she was kissed or almost kissed by poet Alain Chartier while asleep in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> (another variant of this legend has Anne of Brittany as its protagonist), though her age and {{location}} {{at the time of}} Chartier's death would have made that impossible.|$|R
60|$|With {{this the}} Princess bade her guests {{good night and}} went to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr Apjohn, {{just before}} he went, had an {{interview}} with her in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{went into}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> {{and shut the}} door, without a word or a look.|$|E
6000|$|Approaching <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> Teresa waited, and listened, {{before she}} showed herself. No sound reached {{her through the}} half open sitting-room door. She noiselessly entered the bedroom, and then locked the door again. Once more she listened; and once more {{there was nothing to}} be heard. Had he seen her on the stairs? ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Baker had {{now gone}} back to Littlebath, either to receive Adela Gauntlet, or because {{she knew that she}} should be more {{comfortable}} in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> than in <b>her</b> uncle's dismal house--or perhaps because Sir Lionel was there. She had, however, gone back, and Caroline remained mistress for the time of her grandfather's household.|$|R
60|$|The {{grandmother}} {{stayed a}} {{while at the}} Yew Cottage, till the Marsh was restored. Then she returned to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> quiet, and it seemed, wanting nothing. Fred threw himself into the work of restoring the farm. That his father was killed there, seemed to make it only the more intimate and the more inevitably his own place.|$|R
60|$|Noel {{suffered}} the embrace without response, {{but when it}} was over, went to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{closed the}} door softly {{and walked down the}} long cool passage towards <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room....</b>|$|E
60|$|Lettie {{continued}} to play for some time, after which she went up to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|The whole {{company were}} {{listening}} to the story with breathless attention, when it became plain that Dely could go no further, while Tezila had flung herself on a heap of cushions and hidden her face. Zambac ordered her women to give them all the attention possible, and desired they should be carried into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't eat honey-bees, but you'll {{be given}} {{something}} just as nice," [...] Dorothy told him. Then {{she had the}} Glass Cat taken to another room for the night and the Patchwork Girl she kept in one of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> for she was much interested in the strange creature and wanted {{to talk with her}} again and try to understand her better.|$|R
60|$|She {{returned}} to the house with her father. When she had again ascended to the landing and to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> beyond it was a great relief to her to find that both Petticoat the First and Petticoat the Second of her Bien-aime had silently disappeared. They had, in all probability, heard the words of her father, and departed with their anxieties relieved.|$|R
60|$|Lizzie murmured {{that she}} had {{something}} to do in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room,</b> and went away upstairs.|$|E
60|$|They were {{interrupted}} by the dinner-bell, but Amy ran into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room</b> for one moment.|$|E
60|$|And {{she ran to}} <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>room,</b> {{and brought}} a {{beautiful}} golden casket, which contained her medicines.|$|E
60|$|But the outspoken {{admiration of}} the entire court soon undeceived her, and made her so angry that she pretended illness and retired to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms,</b> {{so as to avoid}} {{witnessing}} the princess's triumph. She also sent word to the Queen of the Flowery Isles that she was sorry not to be well enough to see her again, and advised her to return to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> states with the princess, her daughter.|$|R
60|$|Once on a {{time there}} was a king who had an only daughter. He was so proud and so fond of her, that he was in {{constant}} terror that something would happen to her if she went outside the palace, and thus, owing to his great love for her, he forced her to lead the life of a prisoner, shut up within <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|Joan {{went back}} by the early train. She met some people at the station that she knew and {{travelled}} up with them. That picture of Mrs. Phillips's tongue just showing beyond the line of Mrs. Phillips's cheek remained {{at the back of}} her mind; but it was not until she was alone in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>rooms</b> that she dared let her thoughts return to it.|$|R
