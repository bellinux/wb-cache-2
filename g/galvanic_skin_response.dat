25|$|By 1906, {{the group}} had grown to sixteen members, {{including}} Otto Rank, who was employed as the group's paid secretary. In the same year, Freud began a correspondence with Carl Gustav Jung who was by then already an academically acclaimed researcher into word-association and the <b>Galvanic</b> <b>Skin</b> <b>Response,</b> and a lecturer at Zurich University, although still only an assistant to Eugen Bleuler at the Burghölzli Mental Hospital in Zürich. In March 1907, Jung and Ludwig Binswanger, also a Swiss psychiatrist, travelled to Vienna to visit Freud and attend the discussion group. Thereafter, they established a small psychoanalytic group in Zürich. In 1908, reflecting its growing institutional status, the Wednesday group was renamed the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society.|$|E

50|$|A {{second set}} of methodological tools {{involves}} physiological measures such as heart rate, <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses</b> (sweating) or muscle activity. Heart rate {{is used as a}} measure of whether an orienting response has occurred. When people show an aroused response, their heart rate decelerates for a few seconds before returning toward their baseline. Likewise, an increase in skin conductance is evidence of an aroused response. Thus, the combined evidence of heart rate deceleration and an increase in skin conductance provides convergent evidence that an orienting response (OR) has occurred.|$|R
2500|$|Most healthy {{participants}} sample {{cards from}} each deck, and after about 40 or 50 selections are fairly good at {{sticking to the}} good decks. Patients with OFC dysfunction, however, continue to perseverate with the bad decks, sometimes even though {{they know that they}} are losing money overall. Concurrent measurement of <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>response</b> shows that healthy participants show a [...] "stress" [...] reaction to hovering over the bad decks after only 10 trials, long before conscious sensation that the decks are bad. By contrast, patients with OFC dysfunction never develop this physiological reaction to impending punishment. Bechara and his colleagues explain this in terms of the somatic marker hypothesis. The Iowa gambling task is currently being used by a number of research groups using fMRI to investigate which brain regions are activated by the task in healthy volunteers as well as clinical groups with conditions such as schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder.|$|E

40|$|Background: The word “stress” {{describes}} {{the status of}} the body affected by external or internal forces, or “stressors”, threatening to alter its dynamic balance or homeostasis. The adaptive changes which occur in reply to stressors are either behavioral or physical. Once a given threshold is surpassed, a systemic reaction takes place involving the “stress system” in the brain together with its peripheral components, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic sympathetic. Objectives: Stress induces an activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether the SNS and the HPA axis would show parallel or divergent stress response patterns in a session of first parachute jump. Patients and Methods: Activation of the SNS was evaluated by dosage of salivary alpha-amylase, <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses,</b> and heart rate in seven male novice parachutists. Activation of HPA axis was tested by dosage of cortisol. These variables were measured before and 1 minute and 90 minute after the jump. Results: All variables reached a peak at 1 minute post-jump. Salivary alpha-amylase, <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses</b> and heart rate did not return to basal value at 90 minutes post-jump, while cortisol returned to basal value at 90 minutes post-jump. Conclusions: This evidence indicates that parachute jumping is accompanied by a dissociation of SNS and HPA response patterns in novice parachutists, showing a slower recovery in sympathetic activity than in cortisol secretion...|$|R

40|$|Typically, self-reports {{are used}} in {{educational}} research to assess student response and performance to a classroom activity.

A laboratory protocol to study undergraduate students 2 ̆ 7 responses to classroom events (e. g., exams) is presented. Participants were asked to complete a representative exam for their degree. Before and after the laboratory exam session, students completed an academic achievement emotions self-report and an interview that paralleled these questions when participants wore a <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> sensor and salivary biomarkers were collected. Data collected from the three methods resulted in greater depth of information about students 2 ̆ 7 performance when compared to the self-report.

40|$|Abstract—Facial {{expression}} {{are widely}} used for emotion recognition. Facial expressions may be expressed differently by different people subjectively, inaccurate results are unavoidable. Nevertheless, physiological reactions are non-autonomic nerves in physiology. The physiological reactions and the corresponding signals are hardly to control while emotions are excited. Therefore, an emotion recognition system with consideration of physiological signals is proposed in this paper. A specific designed mood induction experiment is performed to collect physiological signals of subjects. Five biosensors including electrocardiogram, respiration, <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses</b> (GSR), blood volume pulse, and pulse are used. Then a Support Vector Regression (SVR) is used to train three regression curves of three emotions (sad, fear, and pleasure).

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} there may be an increase in positive affect and autonomic arousal in response to seeing a familiar face. These studies rarely distinguish between faces for which there is only a “feeling” of familiarity, and faces for which this feeling is accompanied by the retrieval of semantic knowledge about the individual. In the current study we aimed to make that distinction. Participants made recognition judgments on famous and non-famous faces while <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses</b> (GSR), zygomatic muscle activity, and heart rate (HR) were recorded. We found increases in GSR (autonomic arousal), and zygomatic muscle activity (positive affect) for faces that were accompanied by semantic-access. These results suggest that the positive affective signal may be generated as a result of retrieving semantic information about a face, rather than as a result of some other mechanism, such as processing fluency...|$|R

He cautions that his ideas are tentative, and so far he has not published any research on this subject.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wireless physiological/neurological {{monitoring}} {{in virtual}} reality (VR) offers {{a unique opportunity}} for unob-trusively quantifying human responses to precisely controlled and readily modulated VR representations of health care environments. Here we present such a wireless, light-weight head-mounted system for measuring electrooculogram (EOG) and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity in human subjects interacting with and navigating in the Calit 2 StarCAVE, a five-sided immersive 3 -D visualization VR environment.

30|$|Both ultramarathons were self-sufficient, whereby {{participants}} {{planned and}} provided their own ad libitum foods and fluids along {{the duration of}} the events. Only plain water was provided by the race organisers. Aid stations along the running course were situated approximately 10 and 3  km apart for the MSUM and 24  h, respectively. For the MSUM, estimated total daily energy expenditure was calculated through predictive equations [37] and verified through SenseWear (7.0, BodyMedia Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) in a sub-sample of ultramarathon runners using convenience sampling (22 verifications, coefficient of variation 5.6  %), as previously used to guide sports dietetic support during MSUM competition [38]. For the 24  h, estimated total energy expenditure was determined by SenseWear in all participants. The triaxial accelerometry, which also included measurements of heat flux, <b>skin</b> temperature, and <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses,</b> was attached firmly to the upper arm of the participants, over the mid-point of the triceps muscle, during the measurement period.

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the brain regions associated with emotional processing in euthymic bipolar patients. Methods: The study examined 12 euthymic bipolar patients using functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) while performing an emotional Stroop (eStroop) task. The task comprised emotionally valent and neutral words presented in alternating blocks that was designed to implicitly induce affect. In conjunction with fMRI, <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses</b> (GSR) were measured to monitor arousal. Results: Euthymic bipolar patients had diminished activation in response to the affective stimuli in both cortical and subcortical brain regions when compared with healthy subjects. In particular, patients had less activation in the left ventral prefrontal cortex suggesting a potential trait deficit. Patients were slower to react than healthy controls, but did not differ with respect to accuracy. Conclusions: Euthymic bipolar patients are perhaps constrained in their ability to engage affective processing. Diminished ventral prefrontal cortex activation corroborates previous reports of a potential trait deficit, suggesting that 'all is not well in euthymia', although the effects of medication cannot be overlooked. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005...|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} studies which suggest that perhaps music is truly {{the language of}} emotions. Music seems to have an almost willful, evasive quality, defying simple explanation, and indeed requires deeper neurophysiological investigations {{to gain a better}} understanding. The current study makes an attempt in that direction to explore the effect of context on music perception. To investigate the same, we measured <b>Galvanic</b> <b>Skin</b> <b>Responses</b> (GSR) and self-reported emotion on 18 participants while listening to different Ragas (musical stimulus) composed of different Rasa's (emotional expression) in the different context (Neutral, Pleasant, and Unpleasant). The IAPS pictures were used to induce the emotional context in participants. Our results from this study suggest that the context can modulate emotional response in music perception but only for a shorter time scale. Interestingly, here we demonstrate by combining GSR and self-reports that this effect gradually vanishes over time and shows emotional adaptation irrespective of context. The overall findings suggest that specific context effects of music perception are transitory in nature and gets saturated on a longer time scale...|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{fluctuations}} (SF) in skin conductance {{are often}} used to index sympathetic arousal and emotional states. SF are caused by sudomotor nerve activity (SNA), which is a direct indicator of sympathetic arousal. Here, we describe a dynamic causal model (DCM) of how SNA causes SF, and apply variational Bayesian model inversion to infer SNA, given empirically observed SF. The estimated SNA bears a relationship {{to the number of}} SF as derived from conventional (semi-visual) analysis. Crucially, we show that, during public speaking induced anxiety, the estimated number of SNA bursts is a better predictor of the (known) psychological state than the number of SF. We suggest dynamic causal modeling of SF potentially allows a more precise and informed inference about arousal than purely descriptive methods.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} {{the quality of}} decisions made by groups under either majority rule (MR) or consensus rule (CR). Theoretically, engagement may be a factor. Measures of engagement in three-person groups included self-reports (not analyzed at this time), counts {{of the number of}} participant utterances during discussions, and changes in electrodermal activity (EDA; formerly known as <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses).</b> We predicted that engagement, based on number of utterances, would be greater under CR discussions, which are open-ended, rather than those under MR, which are focused; conversely, under MR, we predicted that average GSR responses would be greater, indicating more focus on the problem at hand. Participants working under the consensus condition spoke significantly more often during discussions than those under MR. As also predicted by theory, after de-trending the GSR data, we found that MR produced an average higher GSR and shorter discussion times. We also describe our most recent preliminary work in which group size has been increased to five participants, and groups have been given the Wason Selection Task as a puzzle to solve. Group sizes will eventually be increased to seven subjects...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{psychological stress}} on the prognosis of the postoperative recurrence of keloids. Methods: Patients with keloids (n= 25), candidates for surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy, had their psychological stress evaluated {{on the day before}} the surgical procedure. the parameters evaluated were pain and itching (Visual Numerical Scale), quality of life (Questionnaire QualiFibro/Cirurgia Plastica-UNIFESP), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), depression and anxiety (Hospital Depression and Anxiety Scale), salivary cortisol and minimum and maximum <b>galvanic</b> <b>skin</b> <b>responses</b> (GSR) at rest and under stress (i. e., while the questionnaires were being filled out). Patients were evaluated during the 3 rd, 6 th, 9 th and 12 th months of postoperative care. During each return visit, two experts classified the lesions as non-recurrent and recurrent. Results: the recurrence group presented the greatest values in GSR during a stressful situation. the chance of recurrence increased by 34 % at each increase of 1000 arbitrary units in maximum GSR during stress. Conclusion: Psychological stress influenced the recurrence of keloids. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
