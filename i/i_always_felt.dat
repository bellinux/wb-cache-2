Similarly, Moneypenny called Bond a [...] "cunning linguist" [...] after she interrupted his lesson with his Danish-language teacher. Brosnan {{was not happy}} {{with some of the}} humour in the films, particularly the [...] "stupid one-liners — which I loathed — and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> phony doing them".|$|E
500|$|In {{his memoir}} , Dylan {{described}} the kinship he felt with the route that supplied {{the title of}} his sixth album: [...] "Highway 61, the main thoroughfare of the country blues, begins about where I began. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> like I'd started on it, always had been on it and could go anywhere, even down in to the deep Delta country. It was the same road, full of the same contradictions, the same one-horse towns, the same spiritual ancestors... It was my place in the universe, always felt like it was in my blood." ...|$|E

500|$|In the new forewords to the Cleis Press editions, Bannon {{addressed}} the criticisms of her characters as self-destructive in limiting roles, explaining that she simply depicted {{what she knew}} and felt at the time. Bannon has said she knows {{the concerns of the}} women who are uncomfortable with the themes of her books: [...] "I can understand that; they weren't there. To them some of it looks negative and some of it looks depressing. Although I didn't feel that way. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> excited when I was writing them." ...|$|E

"Consider the lyrics: Prayed {{through the}} nights / Felt so alone / Suffered from {{alienation}} / Carried the weight {{on my own}} / Had to be strong / So I believed / And now I know I've succeeded / In finding the place I conceived. Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had a hard life. It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person – ethnically. And sometimes {{that can be a}} problem. If you look a certain way everybody goes, 'White girl,' and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'" ...|$|E
500|$|As {{background}} {{research about}} the medical profession, Hammerstein interviewed his own doctor. [...] He wrote {{a few pages}} of the book before embarking [...] with his wife for Australia to visit his mother-in-law; when his ship arrived in Brisbane he mailed Rodgers part of the remainder. [...] On receiving the packet, Rodgers, who generally did not compose until Hammerstein supplied him with a lyric, immediately sat down and composed three songs. [...] Hammerstein put {{a good deal of}} his own experiences into the play. [...] According to his son, William, [...] "Most of the first act was based on his own memories of his own childhood. [...] He had always been intrigued by it, you know; his mother died when he was twelve. [...] <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> his songs came out of his feelings about her." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1953, her {{daughter}} Deirdre Angela Shaw was born. Shaw {{had a son}} by a previous marriage, David, and after gaining legal custody of the boy in 1953 he brought him to California {{to live with the}} family; with three children to raise, the Shaws moved to a larger house on San Vincente Boulevard in Santa Monica. However, Lansbury did not feel entirely comfortable in the Hollywood social scene, later asserting {{that as a result of}} her British roots, [...] "in Hollywood, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> like a stranger in a strange land." [...] In 1959 the family moved to Malibu, settling into a house on the Pacific Coast Highway that had been designed by Aaron Green; there, she and Peter escaped the Hollywood scene, and were able to send their children to a local public school.|$|E
500|$|While Jones is {{credited}} with writing the screenplay, the shooting script was actually a collaborative effort that featured contributions from Henson, George Lucas, Laura Phillips, and Elaine May. Jones himself {{has said that the}} finished film differs greatly from his original vision. According to Jones, [...] "I didn't feel that it was very much mine. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be one thing and I wanted it to be about something else." [...] Jones has said his version of the script was [...] "about the world, and about people who are more interested in manipulating the world than actually baring themselves at all." [...] In Jones' original script, Jareth merely seems [...] "all powerful to begin with" [...] and is actually using the Labyrinth to [...] "keep people from getting to his heart." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1984, American Continental Corporation bought Lincoln Savings and Loan Association {{for just}} over $50 million. Up {{through the early}} 1980s, Lincoln had been a conservatively-run enterprise, with almost half its assets in home loans and {{only a quarter of}} its assets {{considered}} at risk. It made slow growth at best, and had shown a loss for several years until it made a profit of a few million dollars in 1983. Once he took over, Keating fired the existing management. Savings and loan associations had been deregulated in the early 1980s, allowing them to make high-risk investments with their depositors' money, a change of which Keating and other savings and loan operators took advantage. When Keating later was asked why he got into savings and loans, he said, [...] "I know the business inside out, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> that an S & L, if they'd relax the rules, was the biggest moneymaker in the world." ...|$|E

500|$|Victoria Principal {{has said}} that she feels Pam changed {{throughout}} the course of the series. She commented, [...] "Pam didn’t have two parents, her father was a drunkard, and she really had to fight for everything she aspired to and achieved. When Bobby married her, he wasn’t marrying milk toast; she was very, very spirited; she was always a good person. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> Pam was the moral centre of the programme but she was complicated, and she was fiery, she had opinions, and she was not afraid to voice them. But as the years went by, as JR became more and more evil, the writers felt, and I certainly understand why {{for the benefit of the}} show, that Pam had to become more and more good." [...] When asked about whether she had any input on her characters growth, she said: [...] "Once the show achieved extraordinary world wide fame, I don’t think any of us had much input. [...] You know the old saying, if it's not broken, don’t fix it; I really believe that Lorimar Television looked upon it as something that was working and they did not want to deviate from the formula." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{explained}} on her iTunes Radio {{channel that}} [...] "Rocket" [...] {{was one of}} the [...] "most sensual songs", adding that it reminded her of the vibes of D'Angelo's song [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] (2000). The singer elaborated the concept behind the song during an album documentary filmed for Beyoncé, titled [...] "Honesty", saying, [...] "Now I'm in my 30s, and those children that grew up listening to me have grown up, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> like it was my responsibility to be aware of kids and their parents and all these generation". With that said, the singer felt [...] "stifled" [...] and unable to express every feeling she wanted to show. However, she noted that with [...] "Rocket", one of the most liberating songs on the record, she managed to express many of those feelings and show different sides of her personality. Revealing that she would not have been confident enough to record the song earlier in her career, Beyoncé noted, [...] "I kinda dropped that fourth wall and I did it". The singer also discussed the meaning of the song by saying, [...] "What I love about this song is, it takes you through this journey. You're flirting and you're talking all of your arrogant [...] Then you climax, and then you have your cigarette... This song actually is about singing from the heart, and harmonies and adlibs and arrangement". During the same video, she praised Timberlake and Miguel's work; the clip also showed footage of Beyoncé recording the song in the studio.|$|E

Marvin was always honest and unpretentious.|$|E
2500|$|Manson's lyrics {{deal with}} darker themes, {{often in a}} mocking manner. She credits that to her Scottish psyche that leads to preferring {{depressing}} themes, and the fact she always felt like an outsider, even within Garbage – [...] "I’m the odd one out by default. I’m the only girl, I’m younger than they are, they’ve all {{known each other for}} 40 years, or something crazy like that. So <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt,</b> like, off the centre of things." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite severe {{restrictions}} in the US against foreigners holding communist views, Calvino {{was allowed to}} visit the United States, where he stayed six months from 1959 to 1960 (four of which he spent in New York), after an invitation by the Ford Foundation. Calvino was particularly impressed by the [...] "New World": [...] "Naturally I visited the South and also California, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> a New Yorker. My city is New York."

2500|$|While polls {{attributed}} Davis' declining popularity to {{the energy}} and budget problems, some newspaper articles and commentators have identified other issues that limited his effectiveness and political appeal. Davis, a moderate, had some disagreements with the more liberal Democratic-controlled Legislature. Democrat John L. Burton, {{the leader of the}} California State Senate, was Davis' chief antagonist. In 2003, Republican leader Jim Brulte told The Los Angeles Times that Davis lacked the basics of political collegiality to pull him through hard times.
