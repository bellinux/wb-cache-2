50|$|The school, a {{memorial}} to fallen Maristonians (past students) of World War I and World War II, was constructed to a new design by Cullen and was built by KD Morris and Sons for Â£35,000. The three storey college was built of <b>fire-resisting</b> <b>construction</b> and contained eight large classrooms and two science laboratories. The lower ground floor incorporated a large assembly hall complete with stage, a sports store, tuckshop and lavatories. The principal's office was located {{on the ground floor}} opening off the main entrance vestibule as was the memorial library. The class rooms and science laboratories were complete with modern educational facilities and all class rooms were newly furnished with dual and single desks. An incinerator incorporated into the building served each of the floors and a public address system was installed to allow for the broadcasting of messages and programmes to all or any number of the classes. The design also provided for the later addition of an extra storey.|$|E

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{simulation}} (CRISP) {{of entire}} fire scenarios {{has been developed}} for use in risk assessment. CRISP'S basic struchlre is a two layer multi-room zone model, with extra features, most notably people, included. The model {{has been used to}} perform a fire risk assessment of a domestic house. If a house has more than two storeys (which may also be the case if an attic or roof space has been converted for use as living accommodation in a two-storey house), the Approved Document of the Building regulations for England and Wales recommends protecting the staircases with <b>fire-resisting</b> <b>construction.</b> The purpose of the CRISP study was to investigate whether the provision of smoke alarms would remove the need for staircase protection. It was found that smoke alarms did provide an acceptable level of risk for the occupants, which was comparable to that provided by passive fire protection...|$|E
