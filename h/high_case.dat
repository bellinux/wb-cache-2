60|$|He wouldn't for {{a moment}} have {{admitted}} that he was jealous of his old comrade, but would almost have liked {{to be accused of}} it: for this would have given him a chance he rather lacked and missed, the right occasion to declare with plausibility that motives he couldn't avow had no application to his case. How could a man be jealous when he was not a suitor? how could he pretend to guard a property which was neither his own nor destined to become his own? There could be no question of loss when one had nothing at stake, and no question of envy when the responsibility of possession was exactly what one prayed to be delivered from. The measure of one's susceptibility was one's pretensions, and Peter was not only ready to declare over and over again that, thank God, he had none: his spiritual detachment was still more complete--he literally suffered from the fact that nobody appeared to care to hear him say it. He connected an idea of virtue and honour with his attitude, since surely it was a <b>high</b> <b>case</b> of conduct to have quenched a personal passion {{for the good of the}} public service. He had gone over the whole question at odd, irrepressible hours; he had returned, spiritually speaking, the buffet administered to him all at once, that day in Rosedale Road, by the spectacle of the crânerie with which Nick could let worldly glories slide. Resolution for resolution he preferred after all another sort, and his own crânerie would be shown in the way he should stick to his profession and stand up for British interests. If Nick had leaped over a wall he would leap over a river. The course of his river was already traced and his loins were already girded. Thus he was justified in holding that the measure of a man's susceptibility was a man's attitude: that was the only thing he was bound to give an account of.|$|E

30|$|The first {{consideration}} {{concerns the}} evaluation of the costs related to the increase in the production rate. Generally, the improvement in production rate is proportional to the investments in the buffer and preventive maintenance actions. The benefit of the PM is more relevant when the production rate required is <b>higher</b> (<b>cases</b> 5, 6 and 7). The dynamic allocation of the buffer storages works better when the production rate required is <b>higher</b> (<b>case</b> 7) reducing drastically the costs with the same level of the production rate of the other models tested. The cases of low production rate required (cases 1, 2, and 3) the fixed allocation of the buffer storages and dynamic PM actions lead to better results in terms of costs and production rate.|$|R

50|$|The {{first case}} was a female travel agent {{who lived in the}} {{outskirts}} of Lusaka. She suffered from fever which grew worse with time. She was evacuated to Johannesburg for medical treatment. Almost two weeks later, the paramedic that nursed the patient on the flight to South Africa also fell ill and was also brought to Johannesburg for medical treatment. At this time the connection between these two patients was recognized by the attending physician in the Johannesburg hospital. Together with the NICD-NHLS the clinical syndrome of VHF was recognized and specimens from the second patient were submitted for laboratory confirmation. In addition, a cleaner and a nurse that had contact with the first patient also fell ill. A second nurse was infected through contact with the paramedic. The outbreak had a <b>high</b> <b>case</b> fatality rate with 4 of 5 identified cases resulting in death.|$|E
5000|$|The International Energy Agency (IEA) saw overall stagnating annual {{installations}} {{in the range}} of 36-39 GW until 2020, when global capacity would reach 403 GW, according to the highlighted baseline case scenario of the Medium Term Renewable Energy Market 2014 report. Paradoxically, since the report's 2013-edition, projected cumulative for 2018 had increased by 6% from 308 GW to 326 GW, while the corresponding annual deployment decreased. This was {{due to the fact that}} the International Energy Agency adjusted annual installations upward on the near-end - in order to meet actual deployment, while reducing estimates on the far-end. The result was a flat curve that stayed below 40 GW until 2020 (see table). For 2017, the projected low of 36 GW concided with the scheduled expiration of the solar investment tax credit (ITC) in the U.S. and the expected end of the solar boom in Japan. IEA's projected annual installation of less than 40 GW also lead to a negative growth rate, since expectations for 2015 were much higher. Such a decline, however, would have been unprecedented and has never been observed in the recorded history of solar PV deployment. This scenario made IEA's baseline case the most conservative of all projections. In the less featured enhanced <b>high</b> <b>case</b> scenario, IEA estimated that [...] "solar PV could reach a cumulative 465 GW to 515 GW in 2020" [...] and that [...] "solar PV capacity could top 500 GW globally in 2020".|$|E
