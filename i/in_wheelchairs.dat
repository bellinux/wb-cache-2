5|$|Before leaving office, Mahathir had {{condemned}} Malays who {{relied on}} their privileges. Abdullah continued this, warning Malays {{to learn to}} live without crutches or end up <b>in</b> <b>wheelchairs.</b> His administration began the practice of meritocracy, which Mahathir had tentatively proposed, and university admissions quotas were eliminated. However, some charged that this did not eliminate discrimination in education. The pre-university stream was divided into two; one course prepared students for the Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan Malaysia (STPM) standardised examination, lasting two years, while the other comprised various matriculation courses graded by individual lecturers, typically lasting a year.|$|E
5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester {{is informed}} that the school budget will not cover a handicap-accessible bus to transport the glee club to sectionals, which means that Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) will have to travel separately {{from the rest of}} the club. Will encourages the other club members to support Artie, not only by holding a bake sale to raise funds for a handicap bus, but also by spending time <b>in</b> <b>wheelchairs</b> to experience what life is like for him. Meanwhile, Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) is struggling to cover the medical expenses of her pregnancy, and threatens to break up with Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) if he cannot pay her ultrasound bill. Puck (Mark Salling) fights with Finn, whom he feels is not doing enough to support Quinn. By including cannabis in the cupcakes, Puck ensures the bake sale is a success and offers Quinn the money raised. She apologizes for previously calling him a loser, but refuses to accept the money, and is relieved when Finn is able to find a job.|$|E

30|$|The goal of {{the present}} study is to {{systematically}} review, describe and synthesise literature investigating the impact of impairment in muscle strength, coordination and range of movement of the trunk on performance <b>in</b> <b>wheelchair</b> activities, with a focus on wheelchair court sports. The primary question was proposed <b>in</b> <b>wheelchair</b> rugby; however, because wheelchair rugby has many commonalities with other court sports [12 - 14], the scope of this study includes all wheelchair court sports (including wheelchair rugby, basketball and tennis). There is no evidence-based set of tests that determines the performance <b>in</b> <b>wheelchair</b> activities <b>in</b> general or <b>in</b> any <b>wheelchair</b> sport [15]. Therefore, the existing literature about wheelchair activities that determine performance <b>in</b> <b>wheelchair</b> court sports was analysed [12 - 14, 16 - 18]. This review resulted in the following activities: maintaining balance after perturbation, reach, propulsion, acceleration, change of direction and specific for wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby, tilting the chair. These activities matched those previously used in earlier research to assess the performance <b>in</b> <b>wheelchair</b> rugby [19 - 21]. The impact of equipment on performance in the presence of trunk impairment was dealt with as a covariate.|$|R
