25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Winfrey and King decided to go on an 11-day road trip across America, from California to New York, 3,600 miles. They were excited to meet people from small towns and see <b>how</b> <b>America</b> really lives. However, the initial {{excitement}} quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence. Despite {{the challenges of the}} road trip, they got to see the beauty of Sedona, meet the people of Navajo Nation, crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of Pagosa Springs, and learn about Amish culture. Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.|$|E

2500|$|A 1987 essay titled [...] "The Overhauling of Straight America", by Marshall Kirk and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill), {{lays out}} a six-point {{plan for a}} campaign, which was first {{published}} in Guide magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans [...] "to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders". Then [...] "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book [...] "After the Ball: <b>How</b> <b>America</b> Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the ’90s." [...] The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the gay liberation phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of Newsweek, Time and The Washington Post. The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as Focus on the Family as important {{to the success of the}} LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged [...] "homosexual agenda".|$|E
2500|$|Erik Sandberg-Diment of The New York Times in January 1984 {{stated that}} Macintosh [...] "presages a {{revolution}} in personal computing". Although preferring larger screens and calling the lack of color a [...] "mistake", he praised that the [...] "refreshingly crisp and clear" [...] display and lack of fan noise. While unsure whether it would become [...] "a second standard to Big Blue", Ronald Rosenberg of The Boston Globe wrote in February of [...] "a euphoria that Macintosh will change <b>how</b> <b>America</b> computes. Anyone that tries the pint-size machine gets hooked by its features". Gregg Williams of BYTE that month found the hardware and software design (which it predicted would be [...] "imitated but not copied") impressive, but criticized {{the lack of a}} standard second disk drive. He predicted that the computer would popularize the 3½-inch floppy disk drive standard, that the Macintosh would improve Apple's reputation, and that it [...] "will delay IBM's domination of the personal computer market." [...] Williams concluded that the Macintosh was [...] "the most important development in computers in the last five years. [...] brings us one step closer to the ideal of computer as appliance." [...] In a follow-up article in the May 1984 issue of BYTE, Williams added, [...] "Initial reaction to the Macintosh has been strongly, but not overpoweringly, favorable. A few traditional computer users see the mouse, the windows, and the desktop metaphor as silly, useless frills, and others are outraged at the lack of color graphics, but most users are impressed by the machine and its capabilities. Still, some people have expressed concern about the relatively small 128K-byte RAM (randomaccess read/write memory) size, the lack of any computer language sent as part of the basic unit, and the inconvenience of the single disk drive." ...|$|E
