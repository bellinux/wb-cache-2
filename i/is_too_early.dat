5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{stated in}} its {{forecast}} on September3 that Gabrielle had a 10percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days. On September5, meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass {{north of the}} Virgin Islands and told the press that it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> {{to suggest that the}} storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position. As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west-northwest, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing. When Gabrielle, recurved northwestward, the National Hurricane Center forecast {{the outer edge of the}} hurricane to graze Bermuda, bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island. In Bermuda, cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies.|$|E

500|$|Upon its release, Hasta la Raíz {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics.

[...] AllMusic's Mariano Prunes gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars ranking, and on his review stated that [...] "these are extremely well-written songs in the spirit of the great Latin America romantic tradition of which Lara was a founding father, but infused with a contemporary perspective". Luis Romero of the website Coffee and Saturday said that the album is one of the best pop releases of the year, praising Lafourcade's evolution as a musician, but was critical of Lafourcade for not having extended [...] "her comfort zone", since it <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> in her career to become settled in one type of music, [...] "and the proof is that the best album tracks are those where she is helped by Leonel García, Torreblanca and María Daniela". An editor from Televisa Espectáculos wrote a mixed review, commenting that the album has to be listened to twice to [...] "fall in love with at least one song", comparing positively the title track with Lafourcade's work on her previous album (Mujer Divina) and the songs [...] "Mi Lugar Favorito" [...] and [...] "Te Quiero Ver" [...] with her album Hu Hu Hu, creating a [...] "mix of sounds" [...] on which Lafourcade shows all the things she learned after working with Agustín Lara's catalog. Lissette Corsa, of MTVIggy, stated that [...] "despite moments of darkness and heartfelt sadness, Hasta la Raiz bristles with a sense of adventure and optimism", and noted the influence of Chilean songwriter Violeta Parra in the track [...] "Vámonos Negrito", as part of Lafourcade's [...] "eclectic artistry".

40|$|BackgroundThe {{timing and}} context around the 1 st {{intercourse}} {{are associated with}} risks of sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies. Negative experience may also affect long-term sexual health. We examined the associations of contextual factors around the 1 st intercourse with the feeling that 1 st intercourse <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> MethodsHBSC study <b>is</b> a WHO collaborative cross-national survey. Data were collected among 2, 015 French-speaking Belgian adolescents aged 16 - 20 in 2014 who had already had intercourse. Variable of interest was about the feeling on the timing of 1 st intercourse. Using logistic regression model, associations with age difference between partners, contraceptive use (including condom) and sociodemographic factors (for potential confounding effects) were assessed. Number of subsequent intercourse was included in model 2. The potential effect of time between the 1 st intercourse and the survey was also included in model 3. Interactions with gender were tested. ResultsOne in five adolescents (19. 7 %) reported 1 st intercourse <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> After adjustments, girls (OR: 3. 0; 95 %CI: 2. 2 - 4. 0), non-use of contraception (1. 8; 1. 1 - 2. 9) and an older partner (≥ 3 years older: 1. 7; 1. 20 - 2. 5 vs same age partner) were associated with feeling that 1 st intercourse <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> In the 2 nd model, all these associations were unchanged and feeling that 1 st intercourse <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>was</b> associated with no other sexual intercourse since (3. 5; 2. 3 - 5. 5). In the 3 rd model, all the associations remained statistically significant and the feeling that 1 st intercourse <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>was</b> more frequently reported as the gap in time between 1 st intercourse and the survey widened (1 year ago: 1. 7; 1. 1 - 2. 9 – 2 years ago: 3. 6; 2. 2 - 6. 0 - ≥ 3 years ago: 4. 3; 2. 6 - 7. 1). ConclusionFeeling that 1 st intercourse <b>was</b> <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>was</b> frequently reported, especially by girls and adolescents with an older partner. This feeling was associated with sexual risk behaviours and the time lapse. Main messages• Having their first intercourse when they did not actually feel “ready” could place adolescents at higher risk of non-use of contraception (including condom). • Education programs should help adolescents in assessing their "wantedness" of 1 st intercourse and in defending their decision, especially girls and adolescents with an older partner. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
