5|$|Minton {{informed}} Eisenhower of {{his intention}} to retire in a letter on September 7, 1956, in which he dryly stated his retirement was authorized by law. Eisenhower responded with a brief note wishing him a happy retirement. Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> president, Minton informed {{the members of the}} Court that his duties were too taxing on his health. His anemia had steadily worsened, slowing him physically and mentally. Minton served as a Justice until October 15, 1956, retiring after 7years and 3days of service. He was succeeded by William J. Brennan, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds did {{not believe}} there was time to make changes because, {{if there were any}} delays in publication, the {{newspaper}} would not be published {{before the end of the}} school year. After consulting with his supervisors, he opted to publish a four-page newspaper instead of a six-page one, omitting the pages containing the two stories in question. Cutting two pages removed a total of seven articles from the paper. Reynolds <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> students about the decision, and they did not find out about it until the paper was delivered to the school.|$|E
5|$|Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Ridley Scott {{asked him to}} play Millburn. Trying to {{duplicate}} {{the reaction of the}} Alien cast to the chestburster scene, the director <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Prometheus cast that a Hammerpede puppet was in the silicon replica of Spall's body; Kate Dickie's scream is genuine. The character of Milburn was criticized, since no biologist would touch an unidentified, extraterrestrial organism displaying hostility. Spall defended his character, citing a deleted scene where Millburn holds a smaller, docile Hammerpede.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} David C. Large wrote that, {{like any}} public pronouncements, these bylaws <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> full story about HIAG's real goals. By investigating how these statutes were applied in practice, {{he was able}} to tease out what the organisation stood for. For example, HIAG claimed to represent the entire Waffen-SS membership, surviving and fallen, as well as their families: 500,000 in total. In reality, the organisation's rolls did not exceed 20,000. HIAG attained this number in the late 1950s, and held it until the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|With the {{nomination}} undecided, Weed maneuvered for New York {{to send an}} uncommitted delegation to the 1848 Whig National Convention in Philadelphia, hoping to be a kingmaker in position to place former governor Seward on the ticket, or to get him high national office. He persuaded Fillmore to support an uncommitted ticket, though he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Buffaloan of his hopes for Seward. Weed was an influential editor, and Fillmore tended to cooperate {{with him for the}} greater good of the Whig Party. But Weed had sterner opponents, including Governor Young, who disliked Seward {{and did not want to}} see him gain high office.|$|E
5|$|Galileo had alienated one of {{his biggest}} and most {{powerful}} supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632. He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo Maculani to be charged. Throughout his trial, Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions, and initially he denied even defending them. However, he was eventually persuaded to admit that, contrary to his true intention, a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism. In view of Galileo's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue, his final interrogation, in July 1633, concluded with his being threatened with torture if he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> truth, but he maintained his denial despite the threat.|$|E

5|$|If the {{controller}} were to background garbage collect {{all of the}} spare blocks before it was absolutely necessary, new data written from the host could be written without having to move any data in advance, letting the performance operate at its peak speed. The trade-off {{is that some of}} those blocks of data are actually not needed by the host and will eventually be deleted, but the OS <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> controller this information. The result is that the soon-to-be-deleted data is rewritten to another location in the flash memory, increasing the write amplification. In some of the SSDs from OCZ the background garbage collection clears up {{only a small number of}} blocks then stops, thereby limiting the amount of excessive writes. Another solution is to have an efficient garbage collection system which can perform the necessary moves in parallel with the host writes. This solution is more effective in high write environments where the SSD is rarely idle. The SandForce SSD controllers and the systems from Violin Memory have this capability.|$|E

25|$|In one of {{the most}} damning admissions, nuclear {{regulators}} said in early June that inspectors had found tellurium 132, which experts call telltale evidence of reactor meltdowns, a day after the tsunami— but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> public for nearly three months. For months after the disaster, the government flip-flopped on the level of radiation permissible on school grounds, causing continuing confusion and anguish about the safety of schoolchildren here in Fukushima.|$|E

25|$|The JPEG {{committee}} {{investigated the}} patent claims in 2002 and {{were of the}} opinion that they were invalidated by prior art. Others also concluded that Forgent did not have a patent that covered JPEG. Nevertheless, between 2002 and 2004 Forgent was able to obtain about US$105 million by licensing their patent to some 30 companies. In April 2004, Forgent sued 31 other companies to enforce further license payments. In July of the same year, a consortium of 21 large computer companies filed a countersuit, with the goal of invalidating the patent. In addition, Microsoft launched a separate lawsuit against Forgent in April 2005. In February 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office agreed to re-examine Forgent's JPEG patent {{at the request of the}} Public Patent Foundation. On May 26, 2006 the USPTO found the patent invalid based on prior art. The USPTO also found that Forgent knew about the prior art, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> Patent Office, making any appeal to reinstate the patent highly unlikely to succeed.|$|E
500|$|Conley's former attorney, William Smith, {{had become}} {{convinced}} {{that his client}} had committed the murder. Smith produced a 100-page analysis of the notes for the defense. He analyzed [...] "speech and writing patterns" [...] and [...] "spelling, grammar, repetition of adjectives, [...] favorite verb forms". He concluded, [...] "In this article I show clearly that Conley <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> truth about those notes." [...] Slaton compared the murder notes, Conley's letters to Annie Maude Carter, and his trial testimony. Throughout these documents, he found similar use of the words [...] "like", [...] "play", [...] "lay", [...] "love", and [...] "hisself". He also found double adjectives such as [...] "long tall negro", [...] "tall, slim build heavy man", and [...] "good long wide piece of cord in his hands".|$|E

Contrary to official Soviet statements at the time, he recalled telling ground controllers that there were [...] "blinking lights". He continued, saying that [...] "I saw two rows of windows and knew that this was a Boeing. I knew this was a civilian plane. But for me this meant nothing.

500|$|Just after Day's 21st {{birthday}} in June 1769, he and John Bicknell travelled to the Shrewsbury Orphan Hospital {{to choose the}} first girl for his experiment. Sabrina was 12 {{years old at the}} time, described as [...] "a clear auburn brunette, with darker eyes more glowing bloom and chestnut tresses". She was slender, and had long eyelashes and a pleasant voice. Day was struggling to choose a girl for the experiment, and Bicknell quickly picked her out. The pair <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> orphanage secretary, Samuel Magee, about the planned experiment. Instead they told him that she was to be indentured as a servant at Edgeworth's country house in Berkshire, waiving the £4 (...) fee they would have received for the apprenticeship. In line with the orphanage's requirements that responsibility be held by a married man, Edgeworth would be legally accountable for Sabrina, despite him not being present nor even aware of the arrangement.|$|E
