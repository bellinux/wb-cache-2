25|$|Although {{only about}} one-quarter of Taiwan's land area is {{suitable}} for farming, virtually all farmland is intensely cultivated, with some areas suitable for two and even three crops a year. However, increases in agricultural production have been much slower than industrial growth. Agricultural modernization has been inhibited by {{the small size of}} farms and the lack of investment in better facilities and training to develop more profitable businesses. Taiwan's agricultural population has steadily decreased from 1974 to 2002, prompting the Council of Agriculture to introduce modern farm management, provide technical training, and offer counseling for better production and distribution systems. Promotion of <b>farm</b> <b>mechanization</b> has helped to alleviate labor shortages while increasing productivity; both rice and sugar cane production are completely mechanized. Taiwan's main crops are rice, sugar cane, fruits (many of them tropical), and vegetables. Although self-sufficient in rice production, Taiwan imports large amounts of wheat, mostly from the United States. Meat production and consumption has risen sharply, reflecting a high standard of living. Taiwan has exported large amounts of frozen pork, although this was affected by an outbreak of hoof and mouth disease in 1997. Other agricultural exports include fish, aquaculture and sea products, canned and frozen vegetables, and grain products. Imports of agriculture products are expected to increase due to the WTO accession, which is opening previously protected agricultural markets.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to better assess {{the role of}} mechanization {{in the future of}} smallholder farmers in Nepal. It addresses the knowledge gap about whether promoting mechanization that is often complementary to land can effectively support smallholders, particularly {{in the face of a}} growing nonfarm sector. Rising rural wages in Nepal have increasingly put pressures on smallholder farmers, who tend to operate labor-intensive <b>farming.</b> Agricultural <b>mechanization</b> through custom hiring of tractor services has recently been considered as an option to mitigate the impact of rising labor costs for smallholders. However, the benefit of agricultural mechanization may still be better captured by exploiting the economies of scale of medium to large farmers rather than smallholders. In the meantime, the Nepal agricultural sector still employs a disproportionate share of workers given its share in the economy, potentially depressing agricultural labor productivity. It is therefore an important policy question whether to (1) continue supporting smallholders through custom-hired tractor services or (2) encourage smallholders to rent their farms out to medium-size or larger farmers, while helping smallholders specialize in the nonfarm sector, where their labor productivity may be higher. Using samples from the Terai zone—one of the agroecological belts in Nepal, largely consisting of lowland plains— from the Nepal Living Standards Survey, we assess whether the benefits of hiring in tractor services are greater among medium to large farmers than among smallholders, and how these benefits may depend on smallholders’ decision to remain in or leave farming. This study also contributes to the impact evaluation literature by showing that jointly assessing the effects of two treatments (whether to adopt custom-hired tractor services and continue farming, or to search for better options and specialize in off-farm activities) can lead to different implications than assessing them separately. Our analyses suggest that the government should continue to promote custom-hired tractor services not only for medium to large farmers but also for smallholders. If, over time, barriers to specializing in nonfarm activities are lowered and more smallholders start leaving <b>farming,</b> <b>mechanization</b> may no longer benefit the remaining smallholders. Support for mechanization can then be focused more on medium to large farmers, while types of support other than mechanization can be devised for the remaining smallholders.

However, the drying of freshly harvested grain {{is a big problem}} needing to be resolved. In-store drying technology has good ability for large scale drying. Low energy consumption and successful application of this technology in Australia and America has attracted much attention by the Chinese government. Therefore, study of instore drying started in China from the cooperative study of ‘In-store drying of paddy in China’ with Australia in 1997. This paper will introduce the main projects of in-store drying in China since 1997, different periods of the technology development, key problems solved, major achievements and the drying technology distribution within China. After about 13 years development, in-store drying of paddy in China includes technology and related equipment specifically for China, such as technology and equipment for mobile ventilation, mold prevention with ozone, heaters for drying grain moisture, and computerized cooling systems. The initial moisture content of paddy allowed for in-store drying increased from 16 % to 25 %, the bulk allowable depth of paddy increased from 1. 8 m to 6 m, and was competitive with paddy drying throughout the world.

40|$|Agriculture is {{the main}} source of {{livelihood}} for a majority of India's population. However, despite the number of workers, the yield and the yield of principal crops in India is much lower than that in developed nations. One of the reasons for this is the lack of <b>farming</b> <b>mechanization</b> in India. One of the common ways to run farming equipment is by using a single-cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine. Diesel engines can be turbocharged in order to make them more efficient for less cost. A method has been found to turbocharge a single-cylinder diesel engine by adding an air capacitor to form a buffer between the intake and exhaust strokes. This thesis analyzes how the size and heat transfer of the air capacitor for this turbocharged diesel engine are correlated to engine performance and fuel economy. According to the modeled engine, a 3. 0 liter capacitor had better peak power and fuel economy at high loads and speeds than a 2. 4 or 1. 25 liter capacitor. Additionally, forced convection cooling on the capacitor using a fan allowed the intake air density to increase, and the engine to have better fuel economy than the. However the peak power and fuel economy of the modeled naturally aspirated engine was better than the turbocharged engine for speeds below 2500 rpm. The general trends from the model were reflected in the experimental data. The forced convection increased cooling, and improved the intake air density. However, it was difficult to make any confident recommendations about the fuel economy based on the experimental data. by Colleen McCoy. Thesis: S.

40|$|The {{relation}} of cost economies to size of farm {{has been a}} subject of considerable speculation in Iowa. Farmers are interested in farms of different sizes because cost advantages or disadvantages have an important bearing on farm profits.

Many people put forth the hypothesis that modern farming methods give very great cost economies to the large acreage. The supposition is: 2 ̆ 2 Mechanization results in very low per-acre costs for large units and a danger exists that these cost advantages will give rise to large-scale units which cause the liquidation of family-farm units. 2 ̆ 2 Whether or not a threat of this nature actually exists depends on the costs associated with farms of different sizes. Discussion of farm size has gone on with very little knowledge of the cost economies realized in different types of agriculture. Certain aspects of cost are, however, evident: (1) Cost economies are likely greatest in grain and crop <b>farming</b> systems; <b>mechanization</b> has been developed particularly around these enterprises. Important changes have taken place in production of livestock. fruit and vegetable crops. However, the adaptation of mechanization to these enterprises has not been great.

Mechanization has had a bad press. Only the failures of experiments and past projects are seen, highlighted by pictures of fleers of rusting equipment; the successes are forgotten. Mechanizarion is also accused, rightly or wrongly, of destroying the land or creating unemployment in the rural environment. However, <b>mechanization</b> can increase <b>farm</b> productivity and hence profirabiliry: the main aim of a mechanization policy should be to enhance economic efficiency. But mechanization is only one factor in agricultural production, since its effectiveness depends on the use made of other factors (fertilizer, seed, pesticide, irrigation erc.) : mechanization is nor an end in itself, but is one of the means of improving agriculture. Mechanizarion policies must have two main characteristics in order to be long-laying: one physical, the other economic. Firstly, the development of mechanization is practical only if it does nor degrade natural resources (vegetation, soil, water sources) which constitute the farmer's heritage. Secondly, mechanization is practical economically only if farmers can buy, maintain and replace equipment at marker prices. The Committee for Regional Agricultural Information Programmes and Srraregies (CRAIPS) for agricultural information activities in Central Africa has requested CTA to address this important issue in agricultural development.

40|$|Industrial {{agriculture}} and its technological package (intensive <b>farming,</b> <b>mechanization,</b> use of chemicals) {{are no longer}} in position to ensure food security (Altieri et al., 2012). To overcome the strongly negative externalities produced by this model, agroecological transition may be considered as a privileged pathway. Nevertheless, two major evolutions of modern agriculture can be distinguished (Duru et al., 2014) : the weak (implementation of "good practices" that intend to improve the efficiency of chemicals and/or reduce their use) versus strong (substitution of chemical inputs by biodiversity providing ecosystem services) ecologization of agriculture. In this article, we focus on the enhancement of mycorrhiza (symbiosis between roots and soil fungi), key elements of biodiversity becoming a momentum in matter of agroecological engineering. We study the complex interrelationship structure implying a diversity of actors that are closely linked, share norms of action, values. The result of their coordination (market and non-market) and the networks within these actors interact shape a "socio-technical regime" (Geels and Shot, 2007; Vanloqueren and Baret, 2009). This concept is close to Dosi's (1982) evolutionary approach of industrial processes and changes that are embedded in the systems of innovation approach. The aim {{of this article is to}} appraise the robustness of the socio-technical regime grounded on the use of mycorrhiza. We pay attention to the most widespread technology: the inoculation of industrial strains. We base our analysis on the identification of the set of actors who pilot the technological trajectory of this agroecological pattern (industrials, scientists, public authorities, farmers). We then produce a heuristic map. Using the stakeholder analysis (Mitchell et al., 1997), we conduct around 30 interviews that permit (i) to characterize the nature of the relationships among agents (information sharing, subsidies, goods and services) and (ii) to specify in what extent these interactions stabilize the existing technological paradigm. We show that the agroecological pattern based on the inoculation of industrial strains corresponds to a weak form of ecologization of {{agriculture and}} hinders the emergence of alternative innovative niches (i. e. mobilization of indigenous mycorrhizal networks) that could support a strong modernization of agriculture.
