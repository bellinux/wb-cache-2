500|$|Writing for Rough Guides in 2006, Chris Ingham said Harrison was [...] "rightly annoyed" [...] {{with his}} former record company. Ingham added that, with the [...] "excellent Volume II" [...] (Best of Dark Horse 1976–1989) no longer in print, The Best of George Harrison was {{therefore}} the artist's only available compilation album and [...] "hardly a satisfying one-stop sampler". Reviewing Let It Roll for the music website Popdose, in 2009, Jon Cummings wrote that [...] "the compilation gods have never been kind to [...] " [...] and described the 1976 album as [...] "downright insulting". In her role as compiler of Let It Roll, Harrison's widow Olivia said of The Best of George Harrison: [...] "That album always bothered me... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> is really not fair and I {{think we have to}} put something in that place, and that's really what this [...] is." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{includes}} one acoustic song, [...] "Hero of War", {{which is}} about an Iraq War Veteran looking back on his war experiences. It is described by Rolling Stone as an [...] "ambivalent aggro-folk track". McIlrath said of the song, [...] "I {{wanted to take the}} perspective [...] of 'What is the war going to be looked back on as?'" [...] In another interview McIlrath stated, [...] "It was a way to document what's going on, like other artists documented for their generation and for generations to come." [...] He went on to say, [...] "There are not many songs...talking about what's going on during eight years of occupation in Iraq. That, combined with meeting active soldiers and retired soldiers at our shows and hearing those stories {{about what is going on}} on the ground amid all the bullshit, showed me the differences from what is really happening to what is happening in the news media. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> this needed to go into a song." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and there. We were all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Strawberry Kisses" [...] is a pop song {{written by}} Jeff Franzel, Andy Marvel and Marjorie Maye, {{produced}} by Chong Lim for Nikki Webster's first album Follow Your Heart (2001). It was released as the album's first single on 11 June 2001 in Australia and 27 May 2002 in the UK as a CD single. Webster states the song as being [...] "fresh, really bright and chirpy". To this date, it is number 2 on the List of Top 25 singles for 2001 in Australia. She also states [...] "After I {{first heard the}} demo, I was singing it <b>that</b> night and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that's</b> a fantastic sign of a good song - something people remember".|$|R
500|$|Colin Greenwood {{admitted}} that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, [...] "felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this... naughty thing, 'cause nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from Marvin the Paranoid Android in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. Yorke said the title [...] "was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>that's</b> great. That's how people would like me to be. And {{that was the end}} of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all." [...] In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it [...] "just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together over a couple of evenings and putting some different pieces together". The band used Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] and the work of the Pixies as reference points while writing; yet Ed O'Brien denies they wrote [...] "a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties", and Jonny Greenwood considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.|$|R
5000|$|... “It’s {{just about}} the time of year. It’s really a time to give back any way you can,” Nsekhe said. “I just look at the {{situations}} that took place this past year. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> about <b>that</b> situation specifically because that’s a little girl who witnessed a real traumatic event. It’s unfortunate. So <b>I</b> <b>just</b> felt like, maybe instead of her having a lasting memory of that traumatic event, maybe brighten up her holiday season.” ...|$|R
500|$|On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series (although seventh film Bond overall). A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat. Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, Casino Royale; he later recalled that [...] "once I sat down and read the story, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to tell ... I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents". Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. Many disparagingly called him [...] "James Blonde", believing the [...] blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland.|$|E
2500|$|At Christmas in 1956, Townes's {{father gave}} him a guitar, which he practiced while {{wandering}} the countryside. He would later tell an interviewer that [...] "watching Elvis Presley's October 28, 1956, performance on The Ed Sullivan Show was {{the starting point for}} me becoming a guitar player... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> Elvis had {{all the money in the}} world, all the Cadillacs and all the girls, and all he did was play the guitar and sing. That made a big impression on me." [...] In 1958 the family moved to Boulder, Colorado. Van Zandt would remember his time in Colorado fondly and would often visit it as an adult. He would later refer to Colorado in [...] "My Proud Mountains", [...] "Colorado Girl", and [...] "Snowin' On Raton". Townes was a good student and active in team sports. In grade school, he received a high IQ score and his parents began grooming him to become a lawyer or senator. Fearing that his family would move again, he willingly decided to attend the Shattuck School, Faribault, Minnesota. He received a score of 1170 when he took the SAT in January 1962. His family soon moved to Houston, Texas.|$|E
2500|$|At a February 2014 {{listening}} {{session for}} the album, Schoolboy Q {{spoke on the}} album's opening track: [...] "When I first made [...] all I wanted to say was that my grandma showed me my first strap. That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. They used to have all the shiny shit. That's how we talked. We would call a gun 'fly.' Like, 'Your dickies is cut super perfect and they got the right amount of dirt on them. That shit is fly." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} really vividly, you know, having {{pizza with}} my friends {{a day or two}} after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, [...] "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." [...] But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of {{what it comes down to}} is we just cared more.|$|R
5000|$|Tinley {{was born}} in Lymington, Hampshire. As a youngster, {{influenced}} by punk rock and John Peel, he formed his first band The Stupid Babies when he was 11 and living in New Forest in England. Persuaded by his 5-year-old brother Dominic, they sent a demo tape to the indie label Fast Product Records, run by The Human League's manager Bob Last. [...] "Everyone <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> was a really precocious and strange thing for an 11 year-old to do," [...] Adamski recalls [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that's</b> what everybody did". The kiddie-punk tracks were released on a sampler. When alternative BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel started playing their song [...] "Babysitters" [...] the band caused quite a stir, receiving positive write-ups in music mags like [...] "Smash Hits" [...] and [...] "Melody Maker". He performed with his brother Mark Tinley, and Johnny Slut of the band Specimen, as Diskord Datkord. The band was signed to SOHO GIRL Records and released one 12" [...] E.P. The Tinley brothers continued to work together even after the demise of Diskord Datkord. In the late 1980s, Adam Tinley adopted his stage name after the UFO enthusiast, George Adamski.|$|R

A big Frenchman was just dealing a {{sweeping}} cut at me when a musket shot struck him. Still this is a thousand times better than standing still and being pounded by their artillery. I confess I felt horribly uncomfortable while that was going on." ...|$|R
2500|$|Mercy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created by}} a team of 13 writers aged between 17 and 22 for the Internet spin-off series EastEnders: E20. The characters were created in August 2009 and open auditions were held for the cast at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Mojekwu's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which she commented: [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square—a dream come true—I'm enjoying every second." [...] When Mojekwu was asked in an interview with media website Digital Spy how she felt about being the only main cast member from EastEnders: E20 not appearing in EastEnders, she said: [...] "If I was meant to go into the main show, then I would have done. Obviously I'd have loved to but for someone like my character, it'll be the support of the viewers that decide her fate. I don't feel upset or anything, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> it's the way these things go." [...] It was announced on 24 January 2010 that Mercy would appear in EastEnders later in 2010. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that once he had seen the completed episodes of EastEnders: E20, he wanted Mercy in the main show as well, and stated: [...] "Mercy's also been a huge hit with E20 viewers—she's funny, warm, sensitive and rather mysterious. [...] I'm delighted Bunmi will be bringing those qualities to the wider EastEnders audience." [...] Mercy and her grandmother Grace's introduction to EastEnders made them the first Nigerian family to appear in the series. Mojekwu was surprised at how long it took the programme to represent her community in the series, but congratulated them for doing so, saying [...] "they {{have a long way to}} go in representing us." [...] Mercy's younger sister Faith Olubunmi was introduced in series 3 of E20.|$|E

He held the fish out so that Grandfather Frog could see just how plump and nice they were.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she {{has always}} refused, but I have been very persistent. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> she was perhaps a little shy, or found it {{difficult}} to break through her retirement--people get like that, you know, when they live alone. So this morning I really went for her, and I happened to be looking, and I saw something in her face which puzzled me. It stopped my asking her any more. There is something underneath her quiet manner and self-devotion. She has had trouble of some sort." ...|$|E
5000|$|Yellow Tanabe {{says that}} she uses {{reference}} books with pictures as inspiration for designs of ayakashi. She used her own images of the appearances of kanji characters of special terms and placed the terms in a system {{in order to create}} the special powers of the Kekkaishi and the terms of magic in the series. In regards to what inspired her to create the Shadow Organization, she said [...] "I'm not really sure. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> sort of <b>thought</b> <b>that's</b> the way organizations are." ...|$|R
5000|$|Iommi {{has said}} that the {{decision}} to release Live Evil was prompted by two factors. The first was the 1980 release of the unsanctioned Live at Last album, and the second was former lead vocalist Ozzy Osbourne's 1982 release of a live album consisting entirely of Black Sabbath songs. In his autobiography, Iommi confesses that he was [...] "unpleasantly surprised" [...] that Osbourne had included only Sabbath songs and speculates [...] "I think putting out the live album like that was down to Sharon (Osbourne, Ozzy's wife and manager), trying to put the cat among the pigeons." [...] At the time, Sharon was severely at odds with her father Don Arden, who was managing Sabbath and was attempting to steer Osbourne away from his deal with Arden's label Jet and on to a new deal with Jet's distribution company CBS. [...] "We had to give the old man two albums, well, a live album counted as two," [...] she is quoted as saying in Mick Wall's 2013 biography on the band. [...] "I knew he'd go for it because it wouldn't cost anything to make...But Don was expecting something with Randy (Rhoads) on it and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> fuck <b>that.</b> I'm not giving him that. He can have something with a load of old Sabbath shit on it." ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} following the airing of the episode, Podeswa stated about {{the scene in}} which Jon Snow is resurrected; [...] "I think just establishing {{the right amount of}} tension through the scene, so you really didn't know up until the last second which way it was going to go. That was the biggest thing, creating a sense of mystery and magic around the whole thing. We really wanted that scene to be very beautiful, but also fraught with tension. That's the main thing we were looking for." [...] Podeswa also compared how he shot the scene to The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt, continuing, [...] "It had a very rich, textual, moody, atmospheric quality. I think we were all in that space for a long time for this scene — while we were shooting all the scenes involving Jon Snow's body, really, but particularly the one where he's resurrected." [...] In another interview Podeswa described how the resurrection would play out on screen, noting [...] "There was much discussion about what that actually was: There's this sense of rebirth and whether it should be a big moment or a small moment. We tried a lot of different things, but it really felt to me, and I think we all agreed, this first gasp of life, like what a baby has when it's born, is kind of what it needed to be. And <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> he did <b>that</b> so great." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{put that}} song out in 1970 {{and no one}} would play it because they said it was un-American, because I'm singing the part of a soldier that's in Vietnam dying and those are his last words. So no one ever got to hear it, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> {{would be a good thing}} include, because that wasn't {{commercial}} either". Cher taking about [...] "Classified 1A".|$|E
5000|$|Speaking of {{the video}} in October 2008 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning Blues & Soul, Robin stated: [...] "For the song I just wanted to {{celebrate}} that feeling that gave people hope and made them feel good on the inside. And, with its vibe being about the endless possibilities in life and with space being the final frontier, for the video <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> seeing people lying on the moons and controlling the universe suited that theme of bravado very well." ...|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} his NBA {{career he}} altered the {{spelling}} of his first name from [...] "Armon" [...] to [...] "Armen" [...] because he was tired of it continually being mispronounced. At the time, he was quoted as saying: [...] "Most people pronounced it Ar-MON. I've been correcting people so long that I got tired of it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> if I put the 'e' in there, it would make it a lot easier to pronounce. I'm not Muslim.

5000|$|Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{described}} the live version included on Songs in the Attic as hitting {{harder than the}} studio version.

Anyway, everybody didn't really love her. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> they did."

I'll never get a chance to play a villain this good. I want to do it.' And I was very happy. I wasn't trying to talk her out of it, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> as a friend I should point out {{that there might be a}} down side.

I know there is this generic commonplace that every band that gets labeled with that term hates it. They feel scandalized by it. But honestly, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> all the bands I played in were punk rock bands. The reason I think it's so stupid is that - what, like the Bad Brains weren't emotional? What - they were robots or something? It just doesn't make any sense to me." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Prayer" [...] was {{inspired}} lyrically by two events. The first event was {{the death of}} vocalist David Draiman's grandfather, the second was the September 11 attacks, chiefly the response the clergy made to the events. Draiman explained, [...] "Instead of consoling their flock, people the clergy like Jerry Falwell and Oral Roberts chastised them and used the situation {{as a means of}} empowerment, saying it was our own fault because we're a decadent and promiscuous people. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>thought</b> <b>that</b> whole notion is ridiculous."
