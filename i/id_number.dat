40|$|Identification (<b>ID)</b> <b>numbers</b> are {{structural}} invariants {{based on}} weighted paths and {{walks in the}} molecular graph. They are useful molecular descriptors in the structure-property and structure-activity relationship studies, with very low degeneracy and high structure discriminating ability. For cyclic structures, the number of paths and walks increases very fast and the computation of <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> for large polycyclic molecular graphs is very time consuming. New identification numbers, MINID and MINSID, are defined using weighted distances of the molecular graph. Their computation is easier and faster {{than that of the}} previously defined <b>ID</b> <b>numbers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{recognize}} <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> from {{three types of}} valid identification documents in China: the first-generation ID card, the second-generation ID card and the driver license of motor vehicle. We have proposed an approach using local similarity voting to automatically recognize <b>ID</b> <b>numbers.</b> Firstly, we extract the candidate region which contains <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> and then locate the numbers and characters. Secondly, we recognize the numbers by an improved template matching method based on the local similarity voting. Finally, we verify the <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> and characters. We have applied the proposed approach {{to a set of}} about 100 images which are shot by conventional digital cameras. The experimental results have demonstrated that this approach is efficient and is robust to the change of illumination and rotation. The recognition accuracy is up to 98 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{recognition}} of identification (<b>ID)</b> <b>numbers</b> in <b>ID</b> card {{is very important}} in real applications. In this paper, we have proposed a novel algorithm based on random forests to recognize <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> in the first-generation ID card, the second-generation ID card and the driving ID card. Firstly we obtain the region of interest by the minimum cross-entropy in spatial domain and determine the type of ID card according to the position of face. After using vertical projection and horizontal projection, we separate <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> into different characters and apply random forests to recognize character patches. Additionally, a supplemental method with the encoding rules of <b>ID</b> <b>numbers</b> is introduced to further improve recognition performance. The experiments executed on a challenging dataset have shown that the proposed algorithm has low complexity in computation and a high accuracy rate in recognizing three types of ID cards. Moreover, this algorithm is robust to the changes of illumination, rotation and image distortion...|$|R

25|$|A node {{that would}} like to join the net must first go through a {{bootstrap}} process. In this phase, the joining node needs to know the IP address and port of another node—a bootstrap node (obtained from the user, or from a stored list)—that is already participating in the Kademlia network. If the joining node has not yet participated in the network, it computes a random <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> that is supposed not to be already assigned to any other node. It uses this ID until leaving the network.|$|E
25|$|Even for {{sequences}} in {{the book}} predecessors to the OEIS, the ID numbers are not the same. The 1973 Handbook of Integer Sequences contained about 2400 sequences, which were numbered by lexicographic order (the letter N plus 4 digits, zero-padded where necessary), and the 1995 Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences contained 5487 sequences, also numbered by lexicographic order (the letter M plus 4 digits, zero-padded where necessary). These old M and N numbers, as applicable, are contained in the <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> field in parentheses after the modern A number.|$|E

The electoral roll of the Republic of Lithuania then forms the basis for electoral rolls of single-member constituencies and polling districts, that contain information necessary for individuals to vote.

25|$|In {{accordance}} with state law, the Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' Association establishes the uniform and vehicle standards for all 99 counties. As such, all uniforms and patrol vehicle graphics {{are the same}} {{for each of the}} 99 Sheriff's Offices throughout Iowa {{with the exception of the}} respective County's name appearing on their badges, uniform patches, and vehicle markings. Badge numbers for Sheriffs and Deputies consist of a prefix number, which represents the county number, followed by a one to three digit number, which represents the Sheriff's or Deputy's number within that specific office. The Sheriff's badge number in each county is always #1. So the Sheriff from Bremer County would have an <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> of 9-1 (9 is the county number for Bremer County and 1 is the number for the Sheriff).|$|E

25|$|New {{information}} obtained by dbSNP becomes {{available to the}} public periodically in a series of “builds” (i.e. revisions and releases of data). There is no schedule for releasing new builds; instead, builds are usually released when a new genome build becomes available, assuming that the genome has some cataloged variation associated with it. This occurs approximately every 1–2 months. Genome sequences often contain errors so reference SNPs (“refSNP”) from previous builds, as well as new submitted SNPs, are re-mapped to the newly available genome sequence through multiple cycles of BLAST and MegaBLAST. Multiple submitted SNPs, if mapping to the same location, are clustered into one refSNP cluster and are assigned a reference SNP <b>ID</b> <b>number.</b> However, if two refSNP cluster records are found to map to the same location (i.e. are identical), then dbSNP will also merge those records together. In this case, the smallest refSNP number ID (i.e. the earliest record) would now represent both records, and the larger refSNP number IDs would become obsolete. These obsolete refSNP number IDs and are not used again for new records. When a merger of two refSNP records occurs, the change is tracked, and the former refSNP number IDs can still be used as a search query. This process of merging identical records together reduces redundancy within dbSNP.|$|E

Information like his teachers and <b>ID</b> <b>number</b> had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the EXIF data of some of the pictures posted on his profile.
