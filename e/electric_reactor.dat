40|$|The Naval Reactors Program led {{work on the}} {{development}} of a reactor plant system for the Prometheus space reactor program. The work centered on a 200 kWe <b>electric</b> <b>reactor</b> plant with a 15 - 20 year mission applicable to nuclear electric propulsion (NEP). After a review of all reactor and energy conversion alternatives, a direct gas Brayton reactor plant was selected for further development. The work performed subsequent to this selection included preliminary nuclear reactor and reactor plant design, development of instrumentation and control techniques, modeling reactor plant operational features, development and testing of core and plant material options, and development of an overall project plan. Prior to restructuring of the program, substantial progress had been made on defining reference plant operating conditions, defining reactor mechanical, thermal and nuclear performance, understanding the capabilities and uncertainties provided by material alternatives, and planning non-nuclear and nuclear system testing. The mission requirements for the envisioned NEP missions cannot be accommodated with existing reactor technologies. Therefore concurrent design, development and testing would be needed to deliver a functional reactor system. Fuel and material performance beyond {{the current state of the}} art is needed. There is very little national infrastructure available for fast reactor nuclear testing and associated materials development and testing. Surface mission requirements may be different enough to warrant different reactor design approaches and development of a generic multi-purpose reactor requires substantial sacrifice in performance capability for each mission...|$|E

Due to the remaining physical challenges of modeling the GDM system, including a slow systemic relaxation time and localized radiation losses, the computational requirements of the full 3 -D MHD model remains too computationally demanding, which suggests a future approach involving a hybrid of 1 -D and 3 -D models...|$|R
50|$|Plutonium {{and other}} {{transuranic}} isotopes are produced from uranium by neutron absorption during reactor operation. While {{it is possible}} in principle to remove plutonium from used fuel and divert it to weapons usage, in practice there are formidable obstacles to doing so. First, fission products must be removed. Second, plutonium must be separated from other actinides. Third, fissionable isotopes of plutonium must be separated from non-fissionable isotopes, which is more difficult than separating fissionable from non-fissionable isotopes of uranium, not least because the mass difference is one atomic unit instead of three. All processes require operation on strongly radioactive materials. Since there are many simpler ways to make nuclear weapons, nobody has constructed weapons from used civilian <b>electric</b> power <b>reactor</b> fuel, {{and it is likely}} that nobody ever will do so. Furthermore, most plutonium produced during operation is fissioned. To the extent that fuel is reprocessed on-site, as proposed for the Integral Fast Reactor, opportunities for diversion are further limited. Therefore, production of plutonium during civilian <b>electric</b> power <b>reactor</b> operation is not a significant problem.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} criticism {{to the way}} TEPCO handled the crisis. It was reported that seawater was used only after Prime Minister Naoto Kan ordered it following an explosion at one reactor the evening of 12 March, though executives had started considering it that morning.

Referring to that same early decision-making sequence, [...] "Michael Friedlander, a former senior operator at a Pennsylvania power plant with General <b>Electric</b> <b>reactors</b> similar to the troubled ones in Japan, said the crucial question is whether Japanese officials followed G.E.’s emergency operating procedures."

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to investigate the impact different biomasses,Empty Fruit Bunches(EFB) and Palm Kernel Shells(PKS),reaction temperature and air damper setting to the conversion of bio-oil and to determine the compatibility of direct fired reactor used in this system with the electric heated fired used in pyrolysis study worldwide. In this study,pyrolysis of EFB and PKS were investigated by using a direct heated pyrolysis reactor. The comparison of the conversion bio-oil obtained from this two different type of sample were studied. Since,a good EFB samples are very limited, the study of effect on reactor temperature and heating rate to the conversion of bio-oil was investigated by using PKS sample. The reaction temperature examined in this study was varied in the range of 300 - 500 oC. Meanwhile, air damper setting in the range of 2. 0 - 4. 0 with a constant fuel setting at 19 mmbar were studied. In addition,the competiveness of the direct heated reactor also was investigated by making the comparison in term of percentage of bio-oil conversion with <b>electric</b> heated <b>reactor</b> used worldwide. For the conversion of bio-oil between EFB and PKS, PKS recorded higher yields of bio-oil compared to EFB. The highest conversions of bio-oil were gained at the reaction temperature of 400 oC and air damper setting at 4 respectively. The study of the compatibility of direct fired reactor showed that the direct fired reactor was competitive since the conversion of bio-oil was in the range recorded by the <b>electric</b> heated <b>reactor.</b> This study concluded that the conversion of bio-oil was obtained by using PKS sample at the moderate reactor temperature and highest setting of air damper. This study also determined that the direct fired reactor able to become the new potential alternatives in the pyrolysis process since this kind of reactor is cost,energy and time effective compared to the <b>electric</b> heated <b>reactor...</b>|$|R
