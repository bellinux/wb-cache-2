25|$|Layers of {{intermetallics}} {{can form}} between the solder and the soldered material. These layers may cause mechanical reliability weakening and brittleness, increased electrical resistance, or <b>electromigration</b> and formation of voids.

25|$|There {{are several}} methods for purifying and {{isolating}} honokiol. In nature, honokiol exists with its structural isomer magnolol, which differs from honokiol {{only by the}} position of one hydroxyl group. Because of the very similar properties of magnolol and honokiol, purification has often been limited to a HPLC or <b>electromigration.</b> However, methods developed in 2006 by workers in the lab of Jack L. Arbiser, {{took advantage of the}} proximity of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in magnolol, which form a protectable diol, to generate a magnolol acetonide (Figure 1), with a subsequent simple purification via flash chromatography over silica.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{application of}} tungsten fluoride is in semiconductor industry, {{where it is}} widely used for depositing tungsten metal in a chemical vapor deposition process. The expansion of the industry in the 1980s and 1990s resulted in the increase of WF6 consumption, which remains at around 200 tonnes per year worldwide. Tungsten metal is attractive because of its relatively high thermal and chemical stability, as well as low resistivity (5.6 µΩ·cm) and <b>electromigration.</b> WF6 is favored over related compounds, such as WCl6 or WBr6, because of its higher vapor pressure resulting in higher deposition rates. Since 1967, two WF6 deposition routes have been developed and employed, thermal decomposition and hydrogen reduction. The required WF6 gas purity is rather high and varies between 99.98% and 99.9995% depending on the application.|$|E
2500|$|Integrated {{circuit design}} {{involves}} {{the creation of}} electronic components, such as transistors, resistors, capacitors and the metallic interconnect of these components onto a piece of semiconductor, typically silicon. A method to isolate the individual components formed in the substrate is necessary since the substrate silicon is conductive and often forms an active region of the individual components. The two common methods are p-n junction isolation and dielectric isolation. [...] Attention {{must be given to}} power dissipation of transistors and interconnect resistances and current density of the interconnect, contacts and vias since ICs contain very tiny devices compared to discrete components, where such concerns are less of an issue. <b>Electromigration</b> in metallic interconnect and ESD damage to the tiny components are also of concern. Finally, the physical layout of certain circuit subblocks is typically critical, in order to achieve the desired speed of operation, to segregate noisy portions of an IC from quiet portions, to balance the effects of heat generation across the IC, or to facilitate the placement of connections to circuitry outside the IC.|$|E
2500|$|The rule {{regarding}} metallic versus semiconductor {{behavior has}} exceptions, because curvature effects in small diameter tubes can strongly influence electrical properties. Thus, a (5,0) SWCNT {{that should be}} semiconducting in fact is metallic according to the calculations. Likewise, zigzag and chiral SWCNTs with small diameters that should be metallic have a finite gap (armchair nanotubes remain metallic). In theory, metallic nanotubes can carry an electric current density of 4 × 109 A/cm2, {{which is more than}} 1,000 times greater than those of metals such as copper, where for copper interconnects current densities are limited by <b>electromigration.</b> [...] Carbon nanotubes are thus being explored as interconnects, conductivity enhancing components in composite materials and many groups are attempting to commercialize highly conducting electrical wire assembled from individual carbon nanotubes. [...] There are significant challenges to be overcome, however, such as undesired current saturation under voltage, the much more resistive nanotube-to-nanotube junctions and impurities, all of which lower the electrical conductivity of the macroscopic nanotube wires by orders of magnitude, as compared to the conductivity of the individual nanotubes.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1990s {{another type}} of {{electronic}} ink based on a microencapsulated electrophoretic display was conceived and prototyped {{by a team of}} undergraduates at MIT as described in their Nature paper. [...] J.D. Albert, Barrett Comiskey, Joseph Jacobson, Jeremy Rubin and Russ Wilcox co-founded E Ink Corporation in 1997 to commercialize the technology. E ink subsequently formed a partnership with Philips Components two years later to develop and market the technology. In 2005, Philips sold the electronic paper business as well as its related patents to Prime View International. [...] “It has for many years been an ambition of researchers in display media to create a flexible low-cost system that is the electronic analogue of paper. In this context, microparticle-based displays have long intrigued researchers. Switchable contrast in such displays is achieved by the <b>electromigration</b> of highly scattering or absorbing microparticles (in the size range 0.1–5 mm), quite distinct from the [...] molecular-scale properties that govern the behaviour of the more familiar liquid-crystal displays. Micro-particle-based displays possess intrinsic bistability, exhibit extremely low power d.c. field addressing and have demonstrated high contrast and reflectivity. These features, combined with a near-lambertian viewing characteristic, result in an ‘ink on paper’ look. But such displays have to date suffered from short lifetimes and difficulty in manufacture. Here we report the synthesis of an electrophoretic ink based on the microencapsulation of an electrophoretic dispersion. The use of a microencapsulated electrophoretic medium solves the lifetime issues and permits the fabrication of a bistable electronic display solely by means of printing. This system may satisfy the practical requirements of electronic paper.” ...|$|E

Such a mathematical model forms the basis for simulation of <b>electromigration</b> in modern TCAD tools.Usage of TCAD tools for detailed investigations of <b>electromigration</b> induced interconnect degradation is gaining importance.

50|$|The typical {{current density}} at which <b>electromigration</b> occurs in Cu or Al {{interconnects}} is 106 to 107 A/cm2. For solder joints (SnPb or SnAgCu lead-free) used in IC chips, however, <b>electromigration</b> occurs at much lower current densities, e.g. 104 A/cm2.It causes a net atom transport along {{the direction of}} electron flow. The atoms pile up at the anode, voids are generated at the cathode and back stress is induced during <b>electromigration.</b> The typical failure of a solder joint due to <b>electromigration</b> will occur at the cathode side. Due to the current crowding effect, voids form first {{at the corner of}} the solder joint. Then the voids extend and cause a failed circuit. <b>Electromigration</b> also influences formation of intermetallic compounds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electromigration</b> moving atoms out {{of active}} regions, causing dislocations and point defects acting as nonradiative {{recombination}} centers producing heat. This may occur with aluminium gates in MESFETs with RF signals, causing erratic drain current; <b>electromigration</b> {{in this case}} is called gate sinking. This issue does not occur with gold gates. With structures having aluminium over a refractory metal barrier, <b>electromigration</b> primarily affects aluminium but not the refractory metal, causing the structure's resistance to erratically increase. Displaced aluminium may cause shorts to neighbouring structures; 0.5-4% of copper in the aluminium increases <b>electromigration</b> resistance, the copper accumulating on the alloy grain boundaries and increasing the energy needed to dislodge atoms from them. Other than that, indium tin oxide and silver are subject to <b>electromigration,</b> causing leakage current and (in LEDs) nonradiative recombination along chip edges. In all cases, <b>electromigration</b> can cause changes in dimensions and parameters of the transistor gates and semiconductor junctions.|$|E

50|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>electromigration</b> {{has been known}} for over 100 years, having been discovered by the French scientist Gerardin. The topic first became of practical interest during the late 1960s when packaged ICs first appeared. The earliest commercially available ICs failed in a mere three weeks of use from runaway <b>electromigration,</b> which led to a major industry effort to correct this problem. The first observation of <b>electromigration</b> in thin films was made by I. Blech. Research in this field was pioneered by a number of investigators throughout the fledgling semiconductor industry. One of the most important engineering studies was performed by Jim Black of Motorola, after whom Black's equation is named. At the time, the metal interconnects in ICs were still about 10 micrometres wide. Currently interconnects are only hundreds to tens of nanometers in width, making research in <b>electromigration</b> increasingly important.|$|E

50|$|In {{advanced}} {{semiconductor manufacturing}} processes, copper has replaced aluminium as the interconnect material of choice. Despite its greater fragility in the fabrication process, copper is preferred for its superior conductivity. It is also intrinsically {{less susceptible to}} <b>electromigration.</b> However, <b>electromigration</b> (EM) {{continues to be an}} ever-present challenge to device fabrication, and therefore the EM research for copper interconnects is ongoing (though a relatively new field).|$|E
5000|$|A wider wire {{results in}} smaller current density and, hence, less {{likelihood}} of <b>electromigration.</b> Also, the metal grain size has influence; the smaller grains, the more grain boundaries {{and the higher}} likelihood of <b>electromigration</b> effects. However, if you reduce wire width to below the average grain size of the wire material, grain boundaries become [...] "crosswise", more or less perpendicular {{to the length of}} the wire. The resulting structure resembles the joints in a stalk of bamboo. With such a structure, the resistance to <b>electromigration</b> increases, despite an increase in current density. This apparent contradiction is caused by the perpendicular position of the grain boundaries; the boundary diffusion factor is excluded, and material transport is correspondingly reduced.|$|E

The combination of a modest increase in conductivity along with this improvement in <b>electromigration</b> resistance was to prove highly attractive. The overall benefits derived from these performance improvements were ultimately enough to drive full-scale investment in copper-based technologies and fabrication methods for high performance semiconductor devices, and copper-based processes continue to be {{the state of the art}} for the semiconductor industry today.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>electromigration</b> damage {{ultimately}} {{results in}} {{failure of the}} affected IC, the first symptoms are intermittent glitches, and are quite challenging to diagnose. As some interconnects fail before others, the circuit exhibits seemingly random errors, which may be indistinguishable from other failure mechanisms (such as electrostatic discharge damage).

The Blech length must be considered when designing test structures for <b>electromigration.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{conductor}} used in integrated circuits is aluminium, {{due to its}} good adherence to substrate, good conductivity, and ability to form ohmic contacts with silicon. However, pure aluminium is susceptible to <b>electromigration.</b> Research shows that adding 2-4% of copper to aluminium increases resistance to <b>electromigration</b> about 50 times. The effect is attributed to the grain boundary segregation of copper, which greatly inhibits the diffusion of aluminium atoms across grain boundaries.|$|E
