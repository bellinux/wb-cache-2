The {{objective of the}} research reported in this article {{was to assess the}} impact of calibration on the accuracy of <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> measurement systems in Irish forestry conditions. The research was carried out on a site in Co. Cork. The harvester was a Timberjack 1270 D with a 762 C <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> and the Timbermatic 300 control and measurement system. The harvester measurement system was assessed on its accuracy in measuring the length and volume of individual stems and logs in 9 check runs of 7 or 8 stems. The <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> measurements were compared to values obtained by caliper-and-tape measurements. The main point that can be taken from this research is that regular calibration will greatly improve the accuracy of the harvester measurement system. After calibration, length measurement by the harvester measurement system of individual logs was very accurate, while volume measurement was unsatisfactory for the pulp log assortment. The differences between the harvester measurements and the caliper-and-tape measurements fluctuated greatly, varying from positive to negative differences within a check run, even after calibration. These fluctuations could indicate an inherent problem associated with the design of the calibration procedure, as the positive and negative differences cancel each other out and the calibration, based on mean values, appears to indicate accurate measurements. More work needs to be done on reducing to impact of the roughness and branchiness of smaller dimension logs on the accuracy of diameter and length measurements in Irish conditions...|$|E
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a {{collaboration}} between Luleå University of Technology, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Umeå and Sveaskog AB. The primary goal was to develop and verify a mechanical solution for continuous thinning in young dense forests. The combination of silviculture and biomass production shows reduced costs for pre-commercial thinning. One million hectares of forest land is covered with young dense stands in Sweden. The content of those areas consists of {{a large amount of}} biomass. The first yield corresponds to 64 TWh and after that the yearly return could be 5 - 10 TWh. The importance of this energy is highly valued because biomass stands for 31, 7 % of Sweden’s energy usage 2009. During this project a crane mounted concept for continuous thinning was developed. The <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> is designed to be used on 15 - 20 ton harvesters. Within one crane cycle the <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> should harvest an area of 1 x 10 meters. The aim is to use the <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> in stands were the diameter in breast height is between 4 - 10 centimeters and the trees are between 5 - 10 meters tall. Data information about young dense stands showed that the total tree mass in the 1 x 10 meter corridor rarely exceeds 300 kg. The <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> was designed to manage 350 kg within one crane cycle. The required functions for continuous thinning were set to the following sub-functions; separation, accumulation and grading. The main focus was set towards solving problems around continuous accumulation. Earlier studies on conventional harvester heads for thinning showed that felling and positioning for each tree, or groups of trees, stands for 60 - 70 % of the crane work. Existing harvester heads on the market were reviewed. Related technology and patent documents were also investigated. The purpose was to generate alternative solutions for separation and accumulation that differs from conventional techniques. The product development was performed in cooperation with a focus group. The focus group consisted of representatives from Sveaskog and the University of Agricultural Sciences in Umeå. The final concept is equipped with two saw blades and a system for continuous accumulation. The separated trees are pushed upright into the harvesting head with a feeding roller chain. After the feeding mechanism has pushed the trees, a chain made of torus-shaped links accumulates the trees. To verify the sub-function accumulation a physical prototype was built and tested. Conclusions from the test were that the rotation speed of the roller chain should be reduced to a speed under 200 revolutions/minute. Further the feeding system should be improved with four chains instead of two. The prototype tests showed that continuous accumulation is possible. Validerat; 20110209 (anonymous...|$|E

A {{distinction}} is made between the use in motor-manual and highly mechanised timber supply chains. A technical specifications profile is elaborated for both types. As a result it can be summarised that the use of RFID in the timber supply chain is technically feasible. In motor-manual harvesting, it was possible to mark the logs with RFID tags manually. Several tag types could be read out at all stations between the forest and timber industry. A RFID tag-fixing device for <b>harvester</b> <b>heads</b> was developed for the use in highly mechanised timber harvesting. Thus it was possible to attach RFID tags automatically to the logs.

40|$|Regeneration of {{eucalypt}} plantations from coppice {{is increasingly}} {{being used in}} Australia to reduce the costs of re-establishment in subsequent rotations. However, little is known on {{whether there are differences}} between the performance of a cut-to-length harvester felling coppiced and planted eucalypt plantations in Australia. The study compared single-grip harvester cycle times, time elements and post-harvest stump dimensions between first rotation planted and second rotation coppiced Eucalyptus globulus stands with similar sized trees on two comparable sites in the south-west of Western Australia. Cycle times were significantly lower at the coppiced site compared with those at the planted site. At the mean pooled tree volume, harvester productivity at the planted site was 19. 1 Green Metric tonne(GMt) / productive machine hour (PMH 0) and 23. 4 GMt/PMH 0 at the coppiced site. The difference in harvester productivity was believed to be caused by reduced bark adhesion at the coppiced site following 51 mm of rain immediately prior to the study after an extended dry period. Felling time was significantly longer at the coppiced site (8 % more time than at the planted site) because the operator had to spend more time manoeuvring the <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> to avoid or remove small shoots at the base of many coppiced trees. Stump height and volume were significantly greater at the coppiced site (7. 7 m 3 /ha) compared with those at the planted site (4 m 3 /ha) because the shape of the coppiced stumps and the design of the <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> did not allow the stumps to be cut shorter...|$|E

A field study was conducted in Moghan Agricultural Research Centre to study the technical and economical characteristics of harvesting machineries and evaluate Canola harvesting losses in different maturity stages, using three different combine <b>harvester</b> <b>heads.</b> The experiments were conducted in a completely randomized	split split plot design with four replications. The main plot included seed maturity stage at three levels: A) 60 %, B) 70 % and C) 80 %, and the subplot was the harvester’s ground speed at three levels: A) 1. 5, B) 2. 5 and C) 3. 5 km h- 1. The sub-subplot was combine head type with three forms: A) Mechanical, B) Hydraulically Joybar and C) Hydraulically Biso's Head. The results of ANOVA showed that maximum cutter bar losses occurred with Mechanical Head (5. 36 %) while the loss of Hydraulically Joybar's and Biso's head were 4. 28 and 4. 13 %, respectively. The results also showed that the maximum cutter bar losses occurred when 80 % of seeds were matured and adequate time for canola harvesting was 70 % of seeds maturity. The results of analysing the effects of harvesting ground speeds showed that the maximum cutter bar losses occurred with the speed of 3. 5 km h- 1.

In the beginning the plan was to study and measure 20 sites before and after harvest. Due to storms during the summer of 2010, complete data could only be obtained from 8 of these 20 sites. Seven of these sites were privately owned and one was owned by UPM, all of the sites had been pre-commercially thinned. The mean stem density before harvest was 2578 stems per ha and the mean stem volume was 0. 074 m 3 solid over bark. On average 1518 stems/ha was harvested. The mean tree size was 0. 077 m 3 s of harvested stems, which corresponds to a basal area removal of 11 m 2 /ha or biomass removal of 59 raw tonnes /ha of which 41. 2 raw tonnes (raw density) was pulpwood and 17. 9 raw tonnes were energy wood. The thinning quality was good, leaving 1064 stems per ha after harvest and a mean stem volume of 0. 105 m 3 solid over bark and a mean whole tree volume of 0. 129 m 3 solid over bark. The harvesters’ average mean productivity was 5. 1 raw tonnes per hour and on average the harvester harvested 128 stems/h and the forwarders’ average productivity was 7. 8 raw tonnes per hour.

40|$|Due to {{fluctuating}} {{fossil fuel}} prices {{the use of}} forest biomass for energy {{is expected to increase}} considerably in the future. Today, the demand for high quality wood fuel products such as chopped firewood or pellets has increased price pressure on these products. In order to make the production more cost-effective new methods to optimize their production have to be found. Drying of raw material in the forest in order {{to improve the quality of}} the raw material and to reduce transportation costs can considerably improve the overall efficiency of the supply chain. It also enables longer storing periods and decreases GHG emissions and dry matter losses during storing. The purpose of the study was to test natural drying and the effect of different degrees of partial debarking and different methods of bark scarifying as well as covering on natural drying of energywood stems. The test included laboratory tests in Finland and field trials in Finland, Scotland and Italy, using local practices and forest species commonly used as a raw material for different forest energy products. In the laboratory test for birch, partial debarking and scarifying can be as effective drying accelerants as traditional splitting. It is important that scarifying is done all over the stem. During the test, untreated stems were drying from original 48 % of moisture down to 35 % during 6 months of drying between March and September. During the same period, split, partially debarked and scarified stems achieved more than 10 %-units lover moisture. With pine, scarifying does not work as effectively with small percentages of removed or scarified bark. According to the results of the field trials, the debarking using a <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> had a significant effect on moisture content decrease during the drying season especially when the stacks were covered. Covering is more vital in rainier circumstanses, but nevertheless there are also notable differences between tree species. The results show that the tested broad-leaved trees, (Petula pubescens), alder (Alnus incana) and sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) dry faster than pine (Pinus sylvestris) and lodge pole pine (Pinus contorta). The results showed that debarking using, e. g. a <b>harvester</b> <b>head,</b> can be quite demanding due to different characteristics of tree species and diameters. The debarking device should be designed so that it could be switched on only when needed. This would ensure that the <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> could be used to harvest normal timber and also energy wood. In conclusion, the drying season is essential to decrease the moisture content particularly in Finland and Scotland. The results show that the moisture content can be decreased by 15 20 % in several months using only solar and wind power if more bark than normal is removed and the piles are covered.

In order to eliminate the dynamics effects, a new method for estimating actual grain flow, called proportional distribution (PD), is proposed.

Coppice stems had been reduced to one stem or two stems per stool or left untreated. Time and piece counts were used to determine harvester productivity. Harvester cycle and elemental times and the number of logs and <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> passes per stem were obtained from video recordings. Harvester fuel use was determined by refilling the fuel tank to the same point each day. Stem size was the major factor influencing harvester productivity (20. 8 m 3 per productive machine hour without delays [PMH 0], 11. 8 m 3 PMH 0 − 1 and 8. 6 m 3 PMH 0 − 1 in the single-stem (mean stem volume [MSV] 0. 21 m 3), two-stem (MSV 0. 09 m 3) and untreated trial areas (MSV 0. 06 m 3), respectively. Estimated harvester cost (AU$ m– 3) was considerably greater for the two-stem and untreated trial areas, which reflected the lower harvester productivity in these areas. Processing time represented over 60 % of the total cycle time for all trial areas. Coppice characteristics resulted in significantly different moving/positioning times between trial areas. However, this difference had no impact on cycle times.

It is well recognized that measuring wood properties of logs in real time during harvesting would lead to improved log allocation decisions and increased value recovery. Wood stiffness {{is certainly one of}} the attributes defining the quality of forest products such as veneer and lumber. Accurately assessing stiffness in realtime can be a challenge for log supply managers requiring logs segregated into different product classes based on stiffness. Acoustic technology {{has proven to be a}} well established non-destructive technique for assessing potential product performance by identifying logs with high stiffness. Launched by the worldwide trend towards increased mechanization of forest harvesting operations, providing a platform for innovative measurement systems, the interest in incorporating technologies for measuring internal stem features into a <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> is rapidly growing.

30|$|Season effects both {{processor}} and harvester productivity for slightly different reasons. Productivity of the processors is generally lower {{during the summer}} season than the winter season, despite having more natural light. The hot weather (35 ° to 37 °C) produces more mechanical problems through overheating of equipment {{and the need to}} frequently clean air filters due to roadside processing next to dusty roads. Hot weather is also likely to create greater operator fatigue with a possible impact on productivity. Productivity of the harvesters is also generally lower during the summer season than the winter season. Hot weather contributes to more mechanical problems. In addition, debarking the eucalypt logs is much more difficult in summer than winter. In summer, trees have to be passed through the <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> 4 or 5 times to debark the logs properly, in winter only 1 to 2 passes are required. Operator fatigue and mechanical problems are more exacerbated by extended working hours during the summer (up to 34 % drop in average productivity for the total shift) than the winter (up to 29 % drop in average productivity for the total shift) for both {{processor and}} harvester operations.|$|E
40|$|With their {{widespread}} utilization, cut-to-length harvesters {{have become}} {{a major source of}} ‘‘big data’’ for forest management as they constantly capture, and provide a daily flow of, information on log production and assortment over large operational areas. Harvester data afford the calculation of the total log length between the stump and the last cut but not the total height of trees. They also contain the length and end diameters of individual logs but not always the diameter at breast height overbark (DBHOB) of harvested stems largely because of time lapse, operating and processing issues and other system deficiencies. Even when DBHOB is extracted from harvester data, errors and/or bias of the machine measurements due to the variation in the stump height of harvested stems from that specified for the <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> prior to harvesting and diameter measurement errors may need to be corrected. This study developed (1) a system of equations for estimating DBHOB of trees from diameter overbark (DOB) measured by a <b>harvester</b> <b>head</b> at any height up to 3 m above ground level and (2) an equation to predict the total height of harvested stems in P. radiata plantations from harvester data. To generate the data required for this purpose, cut-to-length simulations of more than 3000 trees with detailed taper measurements were carried out in the computer using the cutting patterns extracted from the harvester data and stump height survey data from clearfall operations. The equation predicted total tree height from DBHOB, total log length and the small end diameter of the top log. Prediction accuracy for total tree height was evaluated both globally over the entire data space and locally within partitioned subspaces through benchmarking statistics. These statistics were better than that of the conventional height-diameter equations for P. radiata found in the literature, even when they incorporated stand age and the average height and diameter of dominant trees in the stand as predictors. So this equation when used with harvester data would outperform the conventional equations in tree height prediction. Tree and stand reconstructions of the harvested forest is the necessary first step to provide the essential link of harvester data to conventional inventory, remote sensing imagery and LiDAR data. The equations developed in this study will provide such a linkage for the most effective combined use of harvester data in predicting the attributes of individual trees, stands and forests, and product recovery for the management and planning of P. radiata plantations in New South Wales, Australia...|$|E
40|$|Most {{forestry}} machines {{being produced}} today include a PC that monitors and controls the <b>harvester</b> <b>head,</b> and an information system that stores data on every action the driver or the machine performs. ICT thus {{provides an opportunity}} to improve efficiency and competitiveness and possibly also opens up for new ways of working for actors in the forestry industry. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate how ICT can enable the transformation from selling products to selling services in the forestry industry. The author investigates this through performing a case study including a number of actors from the forestry industry in northern Sweden. First, he investigates the barriers for establishing an open innovation system in forestry. Then he describes the main steps to be taken and how the use of ICT can enable the establishment of such a system. The case study shows that the forestry industry is committed to working according to a traditional value chain and is committed to a closed innovation paradigm. He argues that the ICT component in Timbercut’s forestry machines constitutes a latent potential that can be fully captured through changing the business model and setting up a joint venture with Rewire.

40|$|Reductions in Pinus radiata D. Don. (radiata pine) clearfell age have {{increased}} the juvenile wood proportion in sawlogs, increasing the need to segregate low modulus of elasticity (MOE) material early in the supply chain to avoid the costly processing of low-value, non-structural boards. In Australian radiata pine plantations, variability in MOE is greater between trees than between stands, requiring tests of individual trees to identify those with low MOE. Time of flight of a sound wave in a tree or log {{is known to be}} well-correlated to its MOE. The trial examined the ability of a newly developed acoustic assessment tool, the Hitman PH 330 (PH 330) supplied by Fibre-gen Limited, fitted to a <b>harvester</b> <b>head,</b> to identify and segregate low MOE sawlogs during a cut-to-length harvesting operation in a radiata pine plantation. The impact of using the tool on the harvester’s productivity was also examined. There was a reduction in the mean productivity of the harvester when using the PH 330 compared with normal operations not using the PH 330 but it was not significant. Mechanical MOE testing showed that boards cut from sawlogs which the PH 330 identified as structural, had significantly greater mean MOE than boards from non-structural sawlogs, demonstrating the PH 330 was able to separate high and low MOE sawlog...|$|E
