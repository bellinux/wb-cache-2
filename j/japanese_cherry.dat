50|$|By 1926, {{he was a}} world {{authority}} on <b>Japanese</b> <b>cherries</b> and was asked to address the Cherry Society in Japan on their national tree. It was on this visit that he was shown {{a painting of a}} beautiful white cherry, then thought to be extinct in Japan. He recognised it as one he had seen in a moribund state in a Sussex garden, the result of an early introduction from Japan. He had taken cuttings and so was able to re-introduce it to the gardening world as ‘Tai Haku’, the name meaning 'Great White Cherry'. In March 2016 a book on his contribution to the survival of <b>Japanese</b> <b>cherries</b> was published in Japan. The author is Naoko Abe, the publisher Iwanami Shoten, and the English translation of the title Cherry Ingram: the English Saviour of Japan's Cherry Blossoms. He introduced many <b>Japanese</b> and species <b>cherries</b> to this country, {{as well as a number}} of his own hybrids. His 1948 book Ornamental Cherries became a standard work.Ingram introduced many other new garden plants, the best known of which are probably Rubus x tridel ‘Benenden’ (Rubus deliciosus x Rubus trilobus) and the Rosemary ‘Benenden Blue’, a natural variant of Rosmarinus officinalis which he collected in Corsica. He also raised numerous other new garden plants, including many Rhododendron and Cistus hybrids.|$|R
