25|$|Small {{denomination}} {{currency and}} particularly coins are sometimes {{difficult to come}} by in Argentina, especially in Buenos Aires. The problem has developed to a stage in which some shop owners will not sell items if the transaction involves giving the purchaser change in coins. It has also been exacerbated by ATMs, which tend to give out only 100 peso notes, and by bus companies, some of which will take only coins in payment and sell these at a 5–10% markup {{on the black market}} rather than depositing them at banks. This situation has improved in the years following the Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002). Nowadays nearly all bus lines in Buenos Aires have a SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico; Unified <b>Electronic</b> <b>Ticket</b> System) smartcard reader, allowing passengers to pay electronically without coins.|$|E
