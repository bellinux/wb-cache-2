40|$|Trends {{in fourth}} {{generation}} (4 G) wireless networks are clearly {{identified by the}} full-IP concept where all traffic (data, control, voice and video services, etc.) will be transported in IP packets. Many proposals are being made to enhance IP with the functionalities necessary to manage the mobility of nodes, so that networks can provide <b>global</b> seamless <b>roaming</b> between heterogeneous wireless and wired networks. The most widely known of these proposals is MobileIP. Although Mobile IP offers a mechanism that allows mobile nodes to maintain Internet connectivity while moving through different networks, it causes {{a huge amount of}} control traffic and disruption latency during location update (especially, with wireless interfaces). To resolve this problem, mobility design is often divided into two parts: macro-mobility and micromobility. In this paper, we propose an integrated hierarchical architecture that extends micro-mobility management to an ad-hoc network and connects the ad-hoc network to the existing core network infrastructure and the Internet. The wireless multihop access network of the proposed architecture is based entirely on IP, by using Optimized Link State Routing protocol (OLSR) and meets the requirements of future full-IP wireless networks...|$|R
5000|$|The {{differentiation}} between home network and visited network is technically {{given by the}} type of subscriber entry in a specific network. If a subscriber has no entry in the home subscriber register of the network (e.g. home location register (HLR) in GSM networks or local customer database in WLANs), the required subscriber data must first be requested by the visited network e.g. from the subscriber's home network in order that the subscriber can be authenticated and any authorization for using the network services can be checked. The [...] "visiting" [...] subscriber acquires an entry in a user database of the visited network (e.g. visitor location register (VLR)) and the authorized network services are enabled. For the roaming procedure in practice, the possibility of assigning the subscriber data is always indispensable in order that authentication, authorization and billing of the subscriber can be performed in the corresponding network. Thus, the term roaming is not linked to a specific network standard, but rather to the type of subscriber entry in the home subscriber register of the mobile radio network. If a subscriber can use their personal service profile, which they use in the home network, in the visited network as well, this is also referred to as <b>Global</b> Service <b>Roaming</b> Capability.|$|R

As <b>roaming</b> users expect a seamless handover (HO) experience when switching from one wireless network to another, fast and secure HO operations must be supported by the networks. In this paper, we present and analyze five reauthentication protocols for HOs between WiMAX and WLANs by subscribers of networks conforming to the 3 G Partnership Project (3 GPP) standards. Our proposed protocols achieve outstanding performance results compared to standard protocols in terms of reauthentication signaling traffic and reauthentication delay, while fulfilling essential HO security requirements such as the provision of mutual authentication and forward and backward secrecy.

40|$|Clusters {{of mobile}} (LEO) satellites, flying at a non-geostationary orbit, have been {{recently}} proposed, designed and made operational for achieving a <b>global</b> coverage of <b>roaming</b> users. An example {{of these is}} Teledesic. The satellites of these clusters are equipped with a radio frequency switch and connected via intersatellite links to form a specific topology. Uncoordinated packet transmission in these systems may result in collisions. Collided packets must be retransmitted, with an obvious degradation in performance, {{in terms of both}} bandwidth usage and delay. This performance degradation can be overcome by a proper scheduling of the packets. In this paper, we consider optimal (namely minimum length) packet scheduling in LEO satellite clusters. We present a preprocessing algorithm which, together with the optimal, polynomial time, packet scheduling algorithm for isolated satellites, produces an optimal schedule in tree-connected clusters. The overall algorithm inherit the time complexity of the optimal one for isolated systems, and is O(N- 4) for a cluster serving N roaming users...|$|R
40|$|<b>Global</b> excess {{liquidity}} <b>roaming</b> the world 2 ̆ 019 s financial markets (or its sudden absence) is sometimes believed to limit sovereign monetary policy even in large economies {{such as the}} euro area. However, there is still discussion about what constitutes global {{excess liquidity}} and how exactly it shapes the policy environment. Our approach adjusts liquidity for longerterm interest rate and output effects and focuses on U. S. and Japanese liquidity as relevant proxies for global developments from a euro area perspective. We find that both excess liquidity in Japan and, in particular, the U. S. tend to lead developments in euro area liquidity. U. S. excess liquidity also enters consistently positive as a determinant of euro area inflation and is shown to be Granger-causal for euro area inflation in an out-of-sample forecasting exercise. In part, this result seems {{to be related to}} a weakening of the euro area interest rate channel during times of excessive U. S. liquidity. In contrast, the influence of Japanese and euro area excess liquidity on euro area inflation is more limited...|$|R

50|$|Most UMTS licensees {{consider}} ubiquitous, transparent <b>global</b> <b>roaming</b> {{an important}} issue. To enable {{a high degree}} of interoperability, UMTS phones usually support several different frequencies in addition to their GSM fallback. Different countries support different UMTS frequency bands - Europe initially used 2100 MHz while the most carriers in the USA use 850&#160;MHz and 1900&#160;MHz. T-Mobile has launched a network in the US operating at 1700 MHz (uplink) /2100 MHz (downlink), and these bands also have been adopted elsewhere in the US and in Canada and Latin America. A UMTS phone and network must support a common frequency to work together. Because of the frequencies used, early models of UMTS phones designated for the United States will likely not be operable elsewhere and vice versa. There are now 11 different frequency combinations used around the world—including frequencies formerly used solely for 2G services.|$|E
