40|$|Principle {{component}} analysis (PCA) and a two-way {{analysis of variance}} (ANOVA) were employed {{in the study of}} factors affecting extractability of benzimidazole anthelmintics using supported liquid membrane (SLM) in liver, <b>kidney,</b> <b>milk</b> and urine at four concentration levels. The SLM extraction process was monitored by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometer (LC-MS). The results showed that the extractability of benzimidazoles is dependent on both the concentration levels and the chemical properties of compounds. Based on chemical properties, extraction of the compounds from the liver matrix showed no significant difference (p = 0. 05) for the following pairs; albendazole and oxibendazole, thiabendazole and mebendazole, oxibendazole and fenbendazole, and oxibendazole and mebendazole. At some of the concentration levels, mainly between 1000 and 100, 100 and 10, and 10 and 1 μg/Kg, there was no significant difference. It was also found that, there was significant difference (at p = 0. 05) in the extractability in milk between oxibendazole and albendazole, and also oxibendazole and fenbendazole. For milk also, the concentration range from 10 to 100 μg/L, showed no significant difference (p = 0. 05). Urine matrix on the other hand, showed significant difference in the recoveries at all concentration levels...|$|E
40|$|The excel tool calculates {{the maximum}} and median intake (dietary burden) (in milligrams per {{kilogram}} bodyweight {{per day and}} milligrams per kilogram dry matter) for the following production species; beef cattle, dairy cattle, breeding sheep, meat producing sheep, breeding pigs, finishing pigs, broiler chickens, laying chickens and turkeys. Based on this calculation and considering {{the results of the}} livestock feeding studies, the calculator also derives the highest residue levels (in milligrams per kilogram) in the relevant tissues and products (muscle, fat, liver, <b>kidney,</b> <b>milk</b> and eggs). These values are estimated using three approaches transfer factors, interpolation and linear regression as described in OECD, 2013 and allow the user to derive the maximum residue level (MRL) for each commodity of animal origin. Inputs to the tool are the following; monitoring and risk assessment residue definitions, residue levels measured in muscle, fat, liver, kidney and milk or eggs (at different feeding levels obtained from livestock feeding studies), STMR and HR values for crop groups used as animal feed including; forage, roots and tubers, cereal grains and crop seeds and by-product, for by-products a processing factor (PF) can be entered by user. However, in the absence of this input value, default processing factors are provided for many of the by-product classes. If residue definitions in raw and processed commodities are different, user has to enter the corresponding conversion factor(s). Outputs: dietary burden for the difference classes of animals, median and highest residue levels as well as maximum residue level (MRL) in (milligrams per kilogram) in the relevant tissues and products for the above mentioned species, conversion factors for each of these product (if needed) ...|$|E
40|$|Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one {{of several}} mycotoxins {{produced}} by certain Fusarium species that frequently infect corn, wheat, oats, barley, rice, and other grains in the field or during storage. The exposure risk to human is directly through foods of plant origin (cereal grains) or indirectly through foods of animal origin (<b>kidney,</b> liver, <b>milk,</b> eggs). It has been detected in buckwheat, popcorn, sorgum, triticale, and other food products including flour, bread, breakfast cereals, noodles, infant foods, pancakes, malt and beer. DON affects animal and human health causing acute temporary nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and fever.

40|$|Evidence implicating murine leukemia-like {{virus in}} the {{etiology}} of the hemolytic, renal, and neoplastic disorders of NZB mice has been presented elsewhere (1 - 5). Further substantiation of the relation of virus infection to disease is now afforded {{in the study of}} antigens associated with routine leukemia virus (MuLV). These antigens include MuLV group-specific or nucleocapsid antigen common to the several strains of murine leukemia and sarcoma viruses and detectable by immunoprecipitation (6); MuLV group antigens with group and type specificities detectable by complement fixation (7 - 9); G (Gross, G+) antigen, type-specific cell-surface antigen associated with Gross leukemia virus (10, 11); and G (Gross) soluble antigen, a recently discovered type-specific soluble antigen (12 - 14). MuLV nucleocapsid antigen has already been identified in extracts of spleen, <b>kidney,</b> and <b>milk</b> of NZB mice by immunoprecipitation (15).

40|$|Ice {{cream is}} dairy {{products}} through the freezing process. The raw material is kidney bean ice cream, skim milk and mango kweni. Kidney bean contains 23. 1 g protein, 59. 5 g carbohydrate, 1. 7 g fat and higher in fiber. The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine levels of protein, organoleptic quality and public acceptability composition of kidney bean ice cream and skim milk with the addition of mango kweni. The method used is experimental research with a completely randomized design (CRD) two factors, the first is composition of <b>kidney</b> beans: skim <b>milk</b> (25 %: 75 %, 50 %: 50 %, 75 %: 25 %, 100 %: 0 %) and factor two is mango kweni (10 g and 20 g) with two replications. Data were analyzed with descriptive qualitative and quantitative. Results showed the highest protein content of ice cream in the treatment M 2 K 2 (50 % skim <b>milk,</b> 50 % <b>kidney</b> bean and 20 % mango kweni), amounting to 3. 0 g. While the low protein content of ice cream, the treatment M 2 K 4 (0 % skim <b>milk,</b> <b>kidney</b> bean 100 %, and 20 % mango kweni), 2. 3 g.

Mice and vole species incorporate 350 – 650 μg Mo/kg, whereas shrews store 1500 – 2500 μg Mo/kg, i. e. insectivores have significantly higher molybdenum contents than rodents. The amounts of molybdenum accumulated by wild and domestic mammals are {{highest in the}} liver and kidneys, and lowest in muscle tissue and hair. The molybdenum status of mammals is reflected by all tissues tested except the heart. The best indicators of molybdenum deficiency and intoxication are liver, <b>kidneys,</b> blood and <b>milk.</b> The intrauterine storage of molybdenum in mammals is low. The milk delivers sufficient molybdenum amounts to the new borns. In man, the transfer of molybdenum follows the same rules as those found in mammals...|$|R
50|$|Cow's milk {{by itself}} is not {{appropriate}} for infants less than 1 year old. Cow’s milk {{does not have the}} correct balance of nutrients for infants to grow and develop normally, and it can cause problems with anemia and <b>kidney</b> function. Raw <b>milk</b> is never appropriate for infants - or anyone else. It should not be consumed by anyone at any time for any purpose. Raw milk can harbor dangerous microorganisms, such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Listeria, that can pose serious health risks. Most infant formula is made with cow's milk, but it has been modified and supplemented with additional nutrients. As a result, the formula is more nutritious and easier for the baby to digest than cow’s milk. Other formula options include soy-based formulas and hypoallergenic (or protein hydrolysate and amino acid-based) formulas. Special formulas are available for babies who are premature or have other health problems.|$|R
40|$|Vitamin B 12 {{plays an}} {{important}} role in building of genetic material, in development of normal red blood cells and in maintenance of nervous system. Major deficiency symptoms of Vitamin B 12 include anemia and neurological disorders. The daily recommended intake of vitamin B 12 for an adult is 1. 5 μg a day. Eating a diet containing required amount of vitamin B 12 is the best way to treat the conditions associated with its low level. Vitamin B 12 found only in animal based foods such as meats, liver, <b>kidney,</b> fish, eggs, <b>milk</b> and milk products, oysters and shellfish. Hence, vegetarians are more likely to have low level of Vitamin B 12.

40|$|A simple {{specific}} and rapid confirmatory method {{for determining the}} two amphoteric penicillins, that is, amoxicillin and ampicillin, in bovine muscle, liver, <b>kidney,</b> and <b>milk</b> is presented. This method {{is based on the}} matrix solid-phase dispersion technique with hot water as extractant followed by liquid chromatography (LC) -tandem mass spectrometry. With this instrumentation, the selected reaction monitoring acquisition mode with two fragmentation reactions for each analyte was adopted. After acidification and filtration of the aqueous extracts, 25 microL of the tissue final extracts and 50 microL of the milk final extract were injected into the LC apparatus. Absolute recovery of the two analytes in any biological matrix at the 50 ppb level in tissues and the 4 ppb level in milk was 74 - 95 % with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of no larger than 9 %. When penicillin V was used as surrogate internal standard, relative recovery of the targeted compounds present in bovine tissues and milk at, respectively, 25 and 2 ppb levels ranged between 100 and 106 % with RSDs of no larger than 11 %. When fractionation of analytes by using a short chromatographic run was attempted, remarkable signal weakening for the two analytes was experienced. This effect was traced to polar endogenous coextractives eluted {{in the first part of}} the chromatographic run that interfered with the gas-phase ion formation of the two penicillins. Slowing the chromatographic run eliminated this unwelcome effect. Limits of quantification of the two analytes in bovine milk were estimated to be < 1 ppb, whereas amoxicillin and ampicillin could be quantified in bovine tissues down to 3. 1 and 0. 8 ppb levels, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{assimilation}} of PCDD/Fs and PCBs in chickens, pigs and sheep {{was investigated in}} studies using conventional animal husbandry practices. Closely matched samples of muscle (meat), liver, <b>kidneys,</b> eggs, <b>milk,</b> feed, soil and grass were collected of which 105 were analysed. The data obtained {{were consistent with the}} PCB and PCDD/F TEQ concentrations to be expected in rural background locations. A slight decline in TEQ values in meat with increasing age was evident in pigs, sheep and broiler chickens. Higher TEQ values in meat from outdoor pigs compared to those raised indoors, and an increase in TEQs in eggs as a result of free-range conditions might be attributable to additional contaminant intakes from soil. TEQ values in samples of sheep meat were slightly higher than those for pigs and chickens and market ready lowland sheep showed higher meat TEQs than the highland species. PCDD/F TEQs were considerably higher in the liver than meat. Contaminant transfer from dietary sources was investigated using biotransfer factors (BTFs) which tended to be higher in chickens than in sheep or pigs. BTFs for all animals declined in magnitude with age, but on average, BTFs for pigs and chickens showed a sharper initial decline than for sheep. The relative magnitude of the BTFs usually followed the order: (highest first) PCB 153, PCB 169, PCB 126, 1, 2, 3, 7, 8 -PeCDD/ 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -PeCDF and 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD. This may suggest that higher chlorinated congeners accumulate more readily in meat tissues. Congener-specific BTF variations were found to be associated with variables such as dietary composition during rearing, differences between feed and animal species...|$|R
40|$|A sample work-up and {{enrichment}} technique {{involving the}} use of supported liquid membrane (SLM) and detection by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer operating under positive ion electrospray mode (LC-PI-ESI-MS) has been developed for the determination of six anabolic androgenic compounds in different biomatrices; mainly urine, <b>kidney,</b> liver and <b>milk.</b> Anabolic androgenic compounds analysed included 17 -trenbolone, 17 -trenbolone, 19 -nortestosterone, testosterone, 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione and testosterone benzoate. Several factors affecting the extraction efficiency during SLM enrichment, such as donor pH were studied. The detection limits (DL) were 0. 08 µg L– 1 for 4 -androstene- 3, 17 -dione, 0. 7 ng L– 1 19 -testosterone, 1. 1 ng L– 1 for testosterone, 0. 1 ng L– 1 for 17 -trenbolone, 1. 6 ng L– 1 for 17 -trenbolone and 0. 03 µg L– 1 for testosterone benzoate.

40|$|In Germany and Europe {{veterinary}} {{medicinal products}} are subject to strict regulatory requirements. As part of the authorisation procedure, active substances are investigated in regard to their effects on humans, animals and the environment. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) for humans of each active substance is derived {{on the basis of}} scientific studies. The ADI serves to determine maximum residue levels (MRL) for foodstuff of animal origin (meat, <b>kidney,</b> fat, <b>milk,</b> eggs and honey). The MRL are determined so that the daily intake of veterinary medicinal product residues up to these levels is not expected to endanger the health of the consumer. In light of the discovery that plants are able to take up veterinary medicinal product residues from soil, the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) carried out an expert panel in December 2009. The aim of the panel was to reveal the current state of scientific knowledge on the potential carry-over of veterinary medicinal product residues in foods of plant origin and its effects. It was determined that results from model experiments and modelling have provided initial indications for the behaviour of some active substances and their metabolites (transformation products) in slurry, in soil and in the plant. Yet current data do not allow a reliable estimate for the extent of intake of veterinary medicinal product residues through foods of plant origin. Overall experts agree, however, that based on the present data on antibiotics residues (e. g. sulfonamides, tetracyclines and fluorochinoloni) in foods of plant origin no risk is expected for consumers from a toxicological perspective. Furthermore it was determined that the question of the spread and development of resistance under the influence of individual or several antibiotics at low concentrations and over prolonged periods of time has not been investigated sufficiently...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the United Kingdom received an application from Dow AgroSciences Ltd. {{to modify the}} existing MRLs for aminopyralid in food derived from ruminants in order to account for residues which occur in these commodities when livestock is fed with grass treated with aminopyralid according to the authorized GAPs in the United States, Canada, Bolivia, Argentina and Brazil. The EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for aminopyralid in ruminant meat, fat, liver, <b>kidney</b> and <b>milk.</b> The metabolism of aminopyralid has been elucidated in lactating goats and poultry. Parent aminopyralid is proposed as residue definition for enforcement and risk assessment for all products of animal origin. The residue levels in the imported {{food of animal origin}} should reflect livestock exposure from the intake of all feed crops treated with aminopyralid in the country of origin. Since EFSA does not have a comprehensive overview of the feeding practices and the aminopyralid residues in feed available in these countries, it is more appropriate to calculate the dietary burden on an international level, using internationally agreed methodologies. Thus, livestock dietary burden calculated by the JMPR was used to estimate the potential carry-over of residues into food of animal origin. Data from feeding studies indicate that the existing EU MRLs have to be raised for ruminant meat, fat, kidney and liver. For milk, eggs, poultry and swine products no modification of the existing EU MRLs is required. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that residues in food commodities of animal origin from the use of aminopyralid on grass in third countries and the resulting MRL proposals will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|R
40|$|Membrane {{bound and}} soluble forms of a high-affinity folate binding protein {{have been found}} in <b>kidney,</b> placenta, serum, <b>milk,</b> and in several cell lines. The two forms have similar binding {{characteristics}} for folates, are immunologically cross-reactive and based upon limited amino acid sequence data, are nearly identical. Based upon pulse-chase experiments, a precursor-product relationship has been suggested. The membrane form has been shown to mediate the transport of folate in cells grown in physiological concentrations of folate. A function for the soluble form has not yet been identified. We constructed a cDNA library from a human carcinoma cell line, Caco- 2, which expresses the membrane form abundantly. The library was screened and a near full-length cDNA for the folate binder was isolated. Transfection of COS cells with the cDNA inserted in an expression vector resulted in marked overexpression of a membrane-associated folate binder as assessed by direct binding of radiolabeled folate and by indirect immunofluorescence. The deduced amino acid sequence is not consistent with a typical membrane spanning domain but rather with a signal for anchoring via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol linkage. Release of the binder with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C strongly supports this hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Background Xylene {{is widely}} used in the {{industry}} and medical technology as a solvent, besides occupational exposure. It {{has the potential to}} be toxic in humans and animals. Objectives The present study was carried out to determine the protective effects of buffalo’ milk (BM) against xylene-induced liver and kidney damage. Methods A total 42 male rats were randomly assigned into 7 groups. The rats in group I was the control. Groups II, III and IV were received 1 mL distilled water ten minutes prior to administration of xylene (X) at doses of 0. 81, 0. 162 and 0. 324 mmole/kg. Rats in groups of V,VI and VII were received 1 mL buffalo’s milk 10 minutes prior to administration of X (ip) at doses of 0. 81, 0. 162 and 0. 324 mmole/kg. The experiment repeated for 7 consecutive days. 24 hours after last administrations, all animals were killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The blood was then collected for determination of biochemical tests including alanine aminotransferase (ALT),aspartate aminotransferase (AST),alkaline phosphatase (ALP),blood urea nitrogen (BUN),creatinine (CR),catalase (CAT),superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). The liver and kidney tissues were removed, fixed and processed for light microscopy. Results Biochemical analyses indicated a significant decline in the activities of SOD, CAT and GSH level and markedly increased ALT, AST, ALP, BUN, CR when compared to those in non-treated rats (control). Dose-dependent injuries in rat liver and kidneys were also observed in xylene treated rats. Buffalo’s milk protected all biochemical parameters against xylene-induced toxicity. It also protected liver and kidney tissues against xylene produced cell damage. Conclusions The results of this study supports the view that xylene induces liver and <b>kidney</b> injury. Buffalo’s <b>milk</b> has potential to protect liver and kidney against xylene toxicit...|$|R
40|$|Penicillins and cephalosporines, which {{belong to}} the group of ß-lactam antibiotics, are, {{together}} with tetracyclines and macrolides, the most commonly used antibiotics for the therapy and prophylaxis of bacterical infections in food delivering animals. Therefore, maximum residue limits (MRL) exist in the EU relating to the antimicrobial properties of the ß-lactams. In order to control the application and possible illegal use of ß-lactams, screening methods are useful to get first results cheap and rapidly. In this work, the application of chemiluminescence (CL) as an analytical tool for the detection of residues of ß-lactam antibiotics in porcine kidney juice and other matrices was investigated. The developed method is based on an indirect competitive microtiter plate assay that uses the penicillin-binding protein PBP 2 x* as receptor for ß-lactam antibiotics. The PBP 2 x* were coated on a microtiter plate, and a digoxigenin labeled ampicillin (Dig-Ampi) was used to compete with free beta-lactams in the sample. In a next step, we added anti-digoxigenin F ab fragments (F ab) that were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). These conjugated antibodies can bind to the digoxigenin-moiety of Dig-Ampi. In the last step, a CL based technique was used as detection system. Therefore the luminol oxidation catalyzed by HRP was used. The obtained signal was reversely related to the ß-lactam concentration in the sample. The assay format utilizing PBP 2 x* based on a previous work developed in our research group, but was modified with regard to a CL based technique. In the previously developed colorimetric assay format, an HRP catalyzed oxidation with tetramethylbenzidine as chromogen was used. Experimental parameters of the CL assay, for example amount of PBP 2 x*, Dig-Ampi, F ab, luminol reagent volume, and measurement time were characterized and optimized for low consumption of the expensive assay compounds and for high sensitivity. A variety of food matrices, mainly <b>kidney,</b> but also <b>milk</b> and muscle tissue, were investigated by the CL assay and the results were compared to the colorimetric assay format. Matrix interferences from kidney juice could be minimized by a centrifugation and dilution step. A full factorial design was used to examine significant matrix interferences. For both assay formats, the parameter “texture” (comparison: kidney-muscle) showed a significant matrix effect to the measurement performance. Thus, a calibration in blank matrix is necessary. In contrast to the colorimetric assay, no significant matrix effect was detected for the parameter animal species (comparison: pork-beef), when using the CL assay. The performance criteria limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, repeatability, and working range were investigated for the determination in spiked <b>kidney</b> juice and <b>milk.</b> 20 porcine <b>kidney</b> samples were analyzed for precision of the assay formats. Benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, cefquinom and ceftiofur (measured as desfuroylcefitofur, the active metabolite) were detected at concentrations below their respective MRL. LOD and LOQ were twofold lower for the CL assay than for the colorimetric assay. However, the increased sensitivity of the CL assay leads to a loss of precision and higher interference of matrix compounds. Nevertheless, the CL assay represents a good alternative to the colorimetric test system and is applicable for the screening of ß-lactam residues in a variety of food matrices. Based on the developed CL assay, a test system for single sample measurements was designed by using magnetic beads as surface to immobilize PBP 2 *. For this purpose, a commercial Charm II receptor test equipment was used. The experiments have shown that the CL assay format could not be transferred to this type of equipment. Significant interference of nonspecific interactions and difficulties in the separation technique were observed. In conclusion, the experiments on kidney juice have shown that both microtiter plate assay formats (CL and colorimetric) are suitable for the semi-quantitative screening of ß-lactams. An advantage of the CL assay over the colorimetric assay is the higher sensitivity...|$|R
