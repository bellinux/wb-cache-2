The possibly many devices that are in reach of each other and thus connected constitute a Personal Area Network (PAN). The problem remains that because of radio range setting up such connections is only possible for devices in a limited area. This paper presents the UbiPAN network infrastructure, the goal of which is to overcome this limitation. It relies on the combination of the IP network, SIP and Bluetooth.

In a recently study, Pan and Yang (2002) generalized Goyal’s (1988) model by considering lead time as a decision variable and obtained a lower joint total expected cost and shorter lead time.

25|$|Trippe and his {{associates}} planned to <b>extend</b> <b>Pan</b> Am's network through all of Central and South America. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Pan Am purchased a number of ailing or defunct airlines in Central and South America and negotiated with postal officials to win most of the government's airmail contracts to the region. In September 1929 Trippe toured Latin America with Charles Lindbergh to negotiate landing rights {{in a number of}} countries, including Barranquilla on SCADTA's home turf of Colombia, Maracaibo and Caracas. By the end of the year, Pan Am offered flights along the west coast of South America to Peru. The following year, Pan Am purchased the New York, Rio, and Buenos Aires Line, giving it a seaplane route along the east coast of South America to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and westbound to Santiago, Chile. Its Brazilian subsidiary NYRBA do Brasil was later renamed as Panair do Brasil. Pan Am also partnered with Grace Shipping Company in 1929 to form Pan American-Grace Airways, better known as Panagra, to gain a foothold to destinations in South America. In the same year, Pan Am acquired a controlling stake in Mexicana de Aviación and took over Mexicana's Ford Trimotor route between Brownsville, Texas and Mexico City, extending this service to the Yucatan Peninsula to connect with Pan Am's Caribbean route network.|$|R

40|$|A Personal Network (PN) {{is created}} when the various private {{networks}} {{of a single}} user are always seamlessly interconnected, despite the mobility of the user. To realize this vision we have designed an architecture of a simple, concrete {{example of such a}} PN. It consists of just a home network and a Personal Area Network (PAN), which are interconnected directly or via an intermediate public network. From a set of requirements deduced from a typical usage scenario we conclude that Bluetooth as a PAN technology is not sufficient to <b>extend</b> the <b>PAN</b> to a PN. HiperLAN/ 2 can add the desired extra functionality. Furthermore, UPnP and MobileIP should be used as middleware for autoconfiguration, service discovery and mobility management. Proper functioning of UPnP can only be guaranteed if tunnels are used between the PAN and the home network. User-friendly operation then requires an Automatic Tunnel Setup Protocol to be developed. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of transcriptomic data sequence {{is a key}} step for functional genomics studies. Recently, a repertoire of predicted genes of a Japanese cultivar of fig (Ficus carica L.) was released.

We isolated, sequenced and assembled fig genomic DNA from young fruits of cv. Dottato. Then, putative gene sequences were predicted and annotated. Finally, a comparison was performed between cvs. Dottato and Horaishi predicted transcriptomes. Our data provide a resource (available at the Sequence Read Archive database under SRP 109082) to be used for functional genomics of fig, in order to fill the gap of knowledge still existing in this species concerning plant development, defense and adaptation to the environment...|$|R

This first island-wide inventory and preliminary monitoring of American Samoa seabird populations has produced several significant results. The beginning of a seabird colony catalog has been established in a digital format. The protocol for surveying seabirds around Tutuila Island by boat is described, and future efforts can be compared to baseline results reported here. A detailed survey of the National Park lands around Tutuila is mapped and photographed and seabird distributions found in the 2000 round-island survey and 2003 partial-island survey are discussed. Our results support anecdotal evidence that the inaccessible north shore of Tutuila supports the majority of that island’s resident seabirds. Greater than 90 % of Red-footed Boobies and Great Frigatebird observations during the Tutuila round-island survey were made in NPSA areas. The north shore areas are important for coastal cliff nesters such as Brown, Black Noddies and Blue Noddies, a species of international significance.

40|$|Pan 2 -Pan 3 is a conserved complex {{involved}} in the shortening of mRNA poly(A) tails, the initial step in eukaryotic mRNA turnover. We show that recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pan 2 -Pan 3 can deadenylate RNAs in vitro without needing the poly(A) -binding protein Pab 1. The crystal structure of an active similar to 200 -kDa core complex reveals that Pan 2 and Pan 3 interact with an unusual 1 : 2 stoichiometry imparted by the asymmetric nature of the Pan 3 homodimer. An <b>extended</b> region of <b>Pan</b> 2 wraps around Pan 3 and provides a major anchoring point for complex assembly. A Pan 2 module formed by the pseudoubiquitin-hydrolase and RNase domains latches onto the Pan 3 pseudokinase with intertwined interactions that orient the deadenylase active site toward the A-binding site of the interacting Pan 3.

40|$|AbstractFor {{the design}} of crash {{resistant}} structures for automotive applications, mainly metallic materials are currently considered. However, the advanced specific energy absorption capacity and a high lightweight potential qualifies fiber and textile reinforced thermoplastic composites for such components. With a load adapted material design {{as well as an}} efficient manufacturing concept these properties can be exploited to a full <b>extend.</b> A seat <b>pan</b> is chosen as an exemplary structure to illustrate the four main aspects of the investigations: evaluation of glass fiber polypropylene composite configurations; development of a manufacturing and process chain; crash and impact experiments on structural level and numerical modelling strategy. Hybrid yarn based textiles, such as a commercially available 2 / 2 -twill fabric and novel multi-layered flat bed weft-knitted fabrics have been considered to be combined with a long-fibre reinforced thermoplastic material (LFT, cutting length of 25 mm) for complexly loaded sections like ribbings. A special emphasis is set on a similar to mass-production manufacturing process. A fully automated integral hot pressing process has been developed, where an automated handling system places the conglomerate of extruded LFT-material and preheated hybrid yarn textile in a fast-stroke press, achieving process cycles of 45 s. Finally, the structural evaluation under crash loading conditions is compared against numerical results...|$|R
40|$|The {{fig tree}} {{is one of}} the first species {{cultivated}} by mankind (Kislev et al., 2006). The species of major commercial importance is certainly Ficus carica L., also known as common fig, constituted of numerous varieties with significant genetic heterogeneity and exceptional nutritional and pharmacological properties (Woodland, 1997; Salhi-Hannachi et al., 2006; Barolo et al., 2014). Ficus carica L. is a diploid species (2 n = 2 x = 26) with a genome size of about 0. 36 pg/ 1 C (Falistocco et al., 2009). The present thesis is dedicated to fill the existing gap of knowledge in the genomics of F. carica L., with reference to cultivar Dottato, which is the most widespread in Italy. This work is aimed to: increase knowledge of gene expression in responses to salinity in F. carica cv. Dottato, which is remarkably tolerant to salinity, but in which the molecular genetics of tolerance are largely unknown; increase the genomic resources available for this species, producing a first draft of the genome of the cv. Dottato; evaluate the existing variability between the Italian cv. Dottato and the Japanese cv. Horaishi predicted transcriptomes. Chapter I reports the analysis of response of F. carica L. plants grown under salinity conditions (0, 50, 100, 200 mM NaCl). It presents a transcriptome analysis of leaves of fig plants irrigated with NaCl after 24 and 48 days obtained with Illumina technology. It also describes the genes regulated at different times. It shows the gene regulation of functional pathways affected by salinity treatments comparing genes differentially expressed at 24 days with genes differentially expressed at 48 days. It also reports new genes which were not previously described as involved in response salinity. Chapter II details a comprehensive list and a critical description of genes differentially expressed in leaves of fig plants at early and late stages of irrigation with NaCl. Chapter III presents the first genome sequence of cv. Dottato and its annotation, obtained with a combination of Illumina paired-end HiSeq 2000 reads and MiSeq long reads, which resulted composed for 70 % of repeated sequences. Finally, chapter IV reports a comparative study between the cultivars Dottato and Horaishi predicted transcriptomes, specifically identifying genes occurring in one of the two cultivars and analysing their differences at functional genomics level. Overall, the data obtained in this work contribute to fill the existing gap of knowledge in the genomics of F. carica L., with reference to cultivar Dottato, at both structural and functional levels, <b>extending</b> the <b>pan</b> genome of this species...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{interpretations of}} over 1000 km of {{high-resolution}} seismic reflection data, supplemented by over 100 9 -m vibracores, have delineated the shallow stratigraphic and structural framework for several Miocene depositional sequences overlying the Carolina platform {{in the area}} of Onslow Bay, North Carolina. Comparison of the observed stratigraphy with published seismic, gravity, magnetic, and core hole data indicates that the distribution, thickness and depositional pattern of each sequence has been controlled by: 1) the regional tectonic framework; 2) several, local structural features; and 3) numerous, relative, sea-level functions. A broad zone of phosphate-rich, Miocene sediments and rocks crops out at mid-shelf across the northern segment of the Carolina Platform. This outcrop belt trends northeast-southwest, and <b>extends</b> from Frying <b>Pan</b> Shoals off Cape Fear to the middle shelf off Bogue Banks. Older Tertiary and Cretaceous sequences crop out southwest of Frying Pan Shoals owing to the presence of the Cape Fear Arch, a mid-Carolina Platform high. In the vicinity of Bogue Banks, the Miocene sequences abruptly change strike and run parallel to the north-south oriented White Oak Lineament. North of Bogue Banks, the Miocene depositional sequences thin and/or pinch out over the Cape Lookout High, which is presently thought to be a pre-Miocene, erosion-originated paleoptopographic feature. In southwestern Onslow Bay the Miocene sequences change strike and thicken along a third local structure, herein referred to as the Cape Fear Monocline. Several shallow Miocene outliers, which are the surficial expression of subbottom “flexures,” were also identified in this area. These structures are deformational in origin, and may be a consequence of differential movement along deep-seated structures within the Carolina Platform. 	The Miocene depositional sequences and associated unconformities indicate several cycles of relative sea-level change. Comparison of the Miocene relative sea-level cyclicity with the proposed global eustatic sea-level curve of Vail and others (1977) depicts a potentially strong correlation. However, the present lack of high-resolution biostratigraphic data precludes exact correlations...|$|R
