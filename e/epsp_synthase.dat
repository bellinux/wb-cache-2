The changes in the FT-IR spectrum appear to reflect changes in the environment of the secondary-structural elements rather than alterations in their distribution, because the far-UV CD spectrum changes very little.

Roundup, a common herbicide made by Monsanto, works by inhibiting another enzyme in the shikimate pathway. The shikimate pathway is an ideal choice for herbicides because this pathway does not exist in animals or people so people are not directly affected. Roundup uses an enzyme inhibitor, glyphosate, to block one of the steps of the shikimate pathway.

However, Monsanto developed a bacterial form of <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase</b> that was not inhibited by Roundup.

This meant that all plants without the bacterial gene would die, leading a much higher degree of weed control.|$|E

Following treatment with glyphosate at the three-leaf stage, significant variation in damage, expressed as visual injury ratings scored 7, 14 and 21 days after {{the application of the}} herbicide, was found. Effects on dry weight and shoot height were consistent with visual scores and the carbon-exchange rate was found to be a sensitive index of differential injury. Biochemical characterization of 5 -enol-pyruvyl-shikimate- 3 -phosphate (<b>EPSP)</b> <b>synthase,</b> the main target of the herbicide, ruled out the possibility that this differential susceptibility was due to variations in the sensitivity of the enzyme. On the contrary, a positive correlation was found between in vivo tolerance and <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase</b> levels, measured at different stages during seedling growth. This result suggests that a naturally occurring difference in <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase</b> levels in the tissues may contribute to the differential response observed in vivo in maize inbreds...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Agriculture is the {{backbone}} of economy of Pakistan and cotton is the major agricultural export and supreme source of raw fiber for our textile industry. To combat severe problems of insect and weed, combination of three genes namely Cry 1 Ac, Cry 2 A and EPSPS genes was transferred in locally cultivated cotton variety MNH- 786 {{with the use of}} Agrobacterium mediated genetic transformation. The present study focused on the molecular screening of transgenic cotton plants at T 3 generation in order to confirm integration and expression of all three genes (Cry 1 Ac, Cry 2 A and <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase)</b> into the cotton genome. Initially, glyphosate spray assay was used for screening of transgenic cotton plants containing <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase</b> gene at T 3 generation. Transgenic cotton plants which were healthy and showed no damage on leaves were selected after 07 days of spray. For molecular analysis of transgenic cotton plants in the laboratory, the genomic DNA of these transgenic cotton plants were isolated and subjected to amplification of the three genes. Thus, seventeen out of twenty (Cry 1 Ac gene), ten out of twenty (Cry 2 A gene) and all twenty (<b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase</b> gene) were produced positive amplification. On the base of PCR amplification, ten transgenic plant samples were subjected to protein expression analysis through ELISA. The results showed that eight out of ten plants were actively expressing the three transgenes. Real-time PCR was also done to quantify the mRNA expression levels of Cry 1 Ac and <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase</b> gene. Finally, eight plants were confirmed for the presence and active expression of all three genes at T 3 generation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{glyphosate}} (N-[phosphonomethyl]glycine) -insensitive 5 -enolpyruvylshikimic acid- 3 -phosphate (<b>EPSP)</b> <b>synthase</b> {{has been}} purified from {{a strain of}} Klebsiella pneumoniae which is resistant to this herbicide [(1984) Arch. Microbiol. 137, 121 - 123] and its properties {{compared with those of}} the glyphosate-sensitive <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase</b> of the parent strain. The apparent Km values of the insensitive enzyme for phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and shikimate 3 -phosphate (S- 3 -P) were increased 15. 6 - and 4. 3 -fold, respectively, as compared to those of the sensitive enzyme, and significant differences were found for the optimal pH and temperature, as well as the isoelectric points of the two enzymes. While PEP protected both enzymes against inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide, 3 -bromopyruvate, and phenylglyoxal, glyphosate protected only the sensitive enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Since it {{represents}} {{the target of the}} successful herbicide glyphosate, great {{attention has been paid to}} the shikimate pathway enzyme 5 -enol-pyruvyl-shikimate- 3 -phosphate (<b>EPSP)</b> <b>synthase.</b> However, inconsistent results have been described concerning the sensitivity of the enzyme from cyanobacteria, and consequent inhibitory effects on cyanobacterial growth. •	The properties of <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase</b> were investigated in a set of 42 strains representative of the large morphological diversity of these prokaryotes. Publicly available protein sequences were analyzed, and related to enzymatic features. •	In most cases, the native protein showed an unusual homodimeric composition and a general sensitivity to micromolar doses of glyphosate. In contrast, 8 out of 15 Nostocales strains were found to possess a monomeric <b>EPSP</b> <b>synthase,</b> whose activity was inhibited only at concentrations exceeding 1 mM. Sequence analysis showed that these two forms are only distantly related, the latter clustering separately in a clade composed of diverse bacterial phyla. •	The results are consistent with the occurrence of a horizontal gene transfer event involving an evolutionarily distant organism. Moreover, data suggest that the existence of class I (glyphosate-sensitive) and class II (glyphosate-tolerant) EPSP synthases representing two distinct phylogenetic clades is an oversimplification due to the limited number of analyzed samples...|$|E
