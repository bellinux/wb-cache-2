5|$|The first fur test allowed Sulley {{to run an}} {{obstacle}} course. Results were not satisfactory, as such objects would catch and stretch out the fur due to the extreme amount of motion. Another similar test was also unsuccessful, because, this time, the fur would <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> objects.|$|E
5|$|A local report {{suggested}} that this bridge was used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under construction and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E

5|$|How can I without {{deviating}} {{from my own}} principles undertake {{an additional}} duty of a kind for which I am conscious I am growing every day more unfit, as your Majesty must know what an uncommon stock of spirits and cheerfulness is necessary to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> growing attendance of so many and such very young people in their amusements, as well as behaviour and instruction, besides ordering all {{the affairs of the}} nursery.|$|E
5|$|In all organisms, {{two steps}} are {{required}} to read the information encoded in a gene's DNA and produce the protein it specifies. First, the gene's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA). Second, that mRNA is translated to protein. RNA-coding genes must still <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> first step, but are not translated into protein. The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression, and the resulting molecule is called a gene product.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{settlement}} of the village of Skaneateles began, the Seneca Turnpike route which originally bypassed the village to the north was relocated southward to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> growing settlement. The Seneca Turnpike Company closed its doors in 1852. Modern NY175 does not follow either the original alignment or the relocated alignment, but rather {{the length of a}} former trolley line that went from Skaneateles to Syracuse via Marcellus and Onondaga. This trolley line parallels the relocated alignment.|$|E

5|$|The {{aim of the}} {{publishing}} house was to publish the works of former Waffen-SS members, in cooperation with HIAG. The authors of {{the publishing}} house were former Waffen-SS unit commanders or staff officers, {{who were members of}} HIAG. The Munin Verlag titles did not <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> rigorous fact-checking processes common in the traditional historical literature; they were revisionist accounts unedited by professional historians and presented the former Waffen-SS members' version of events.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not go through Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E
5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control {{goes down to}} West Road by the intersection of Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station on this side {{do not have to}} <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E
30|$|Thirty {{participants}} of driver-improvement-course first-aid trainings {{participated in the}} evaluation.

5|$|At night, Francis spies on Dr. Caligari and observes {{what appears}} to be Cesare {{sleeping}} in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> entrance of an insane asylum.|$|E
5|$|Badmotorfinger was Soundgarden's {{first album}} with bassist Ben Shepherd, {{who joined the}} group in April 1990. Shepherd {{replaced}} previous bassist Jason Everman. The album was recorded {{in the spring of}} 1991 at Studio D in Sausalito, California, Bear Creek Studios in Woodinville, Washington, and A Studios in Los Angeles, California. Soundgarden chose to work with producer Terry Date again as it had on its previous release Louder Than Love (1989). Frontman Chris Cornell said the band decided to work with Date again seeing as the band had a good relationship with him {{and did not want to}} <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> pressure of trying to find a new producer.|$|E
5|$|Gens had {{a dispute}} with a tailor named Weisskopf, who ran a {{tailoring}} workshop in the ghetto. Weisskopf tried to increase his own power base by negotiating directly with the German Army and not going through the ghetto's Labor Department. When Gens ordered all work contracts to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Labor Department, Weisskopf appealed to his German contacts, but the Gebeitskommissar of Vilnius, Hans Hingst, preferred that control of such contracts go through his own office which worked through the ghetto's administration. Hingst thus ruled in Gens' favor. The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E

5|$|Hiring is {{done through}} a civil service examination, {{including}} a written test, a teaching examination, academic history analysis and other additional criteria. The same process {{is required for}} professors changing tiers: an associate professor pursuing a tenure position must <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> same examination process compete with other external candidates for the position. The two initial tiers also include sub levels, and professors are promoted between them for merit. Monthly starting salary for a full-time assistant professorship is around R$ 10 thousand, and for a tenured position around R$15 thousand. Uniquely among public universities in Brazil, Unicamp has a career focused on full-time research. Currently there are approximately 100 full-time researchers at the university.|$|E
5|$|In March 1972, the Mount Saint Peter Parish Council {{was first}} elected. The group {{consists}} of eighteen elected members and it advises and assists the pastor in important decisions concerning {{the affairs of}} the church. It prides itself on having the ability to guide the parish in its mission of following Christ. The main purpose of the council is to give the pastor an insight into what the parish community thinks and how it feels about different issues. All of the parish activities must <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> four standing committees, which are the Liturgy, Education, Apostolic Work, and Temporalities.|$|E
5|$|In Oregon, {{two teenage}} boys (Gary and Richie) are {{exploring}} {{the crash site}} when they encounter Deputy Miles, who denies any crash or the fire that {{was reported in the}} area. While they <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> area on their own, Gary is lifted off the ground and shaken like a rag doll by an invisible force, and Richie, although he stands within a few feet of him, can't see him. Meanwhile, in Washington, Fox Mulder receives a call from Billy Miles, an abductee from Bellefleur whom the agents investigated seven years prior. The younger Miles tells him about Hoese's disappearance, and his concern that the abductions have begun again.|$|E

5|$|In an epilogue, Charlie is {{discovered}} {{by his parents}} in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused {{him when he was}} young, and his love for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. In two months Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize the decorations rather than to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E
