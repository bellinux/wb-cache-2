A major challenge for in vivo <b>high-resolution</b> diffusion <b>MRI</b> is the low signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, we combine two highly compatible methods, ultra-high field and three-dimensional multi-slab acquisition to improve the SNR of <b>high-resolution</b> diffusion <b>MRI.</b> As each kz plane is encoded using a single-shot echo planar readout, scan speeds of the proposed technique {{are similar to the}} commonly used two-dimensional diffusion MRI.

To reduce the sensitivity of auto-calibration signal data to subject motion and respiration, several new adaptions of the fast low angle excitation echo-planar technique (FLEET) that are suitable for 3 D multi-slab echo planar imaging are proposed and evaluated. A modified reconstruction scheme is proposed for auto-calibration with the most robust method, Slice-FLEET acquisition, to make it compatible with navigator correction of motion induced phase errors. Slab boundary artefacts are corrected using the nonlinear slab profile encoding method recently proposed by our group.

Options are also available for integrating CAD and image data, enabling medical device research to be conducted into how CAD-designed implants interact with the human body. High-quality CAE models can similarly be used in biomechanics research to simulate movement and the effect of different forces on anatomies.

5000|$|Examination of {{the brains}} of Broca's two {{historic}} patients with <b>high-resolution</b> <b>MRI</b> has produced several interesting findings. First, the MRI findings suggest that other areas besides Broca's area may also {{have contributed to the}} patients' reduced productive speech. This finding is significant because it has been found that, though lesions to Broca's area alone can possibly cause temporary speech disruption, they do not result in severe speech arrest. Therefore, {{there is a possibility that}} the aphasia denoted by Broca as an absence of productive speech also could have been influenced by the lesions in the other region. [...] Another finding is that the region, which was once considered to be critical for speech by Broca, is not precisely the same region as what is now known as Broca's area. This study provides further evidence to support the claim that language and cognition are far more complicated than once thought and involve various networks of brain regions.|$|E

Methods—Consecutive patients with pontine infarction underwent basilar angiography using time-of-flight and contrast-enhanced 3 -dimensional MR angiography to assess the presence of basilar artery stenosis and <b>high-resolution</b> <b>MRI</b> to assess the presence of atherosclerotic plaque.

Background: Collagen is an essential constituent of aneurysms. Noninvasive MRI of collagen may represent an opportunity to help detect and better characterize AAAs and initiate intervention. Methods: We used an AAA C 57 BL/ 6 mouse model in which a combination of angiotensin II infusion and transforming growth factor–ß neutralization results in AAA formation with incidence of aortic rupture. <b>High-resolution,</b> multisequence <b>MRI</b> was performed to characterize the temporal progression of an AAA. To allow molecular MRI of collagen, paramagnetic/fluorescent micellar nanoparticles functionalized with a collagen-binding protein (CNA- 35) were intravenously administered. In vivo imaging results were corroborated with immunohistochemistry and confocal fluorescence microscopy. Results: <b>High-resolution,</b> multisequence <b>MRI</b> allowed the visualization of the primary fibrotic response in the aortic wall. As the aneurysm progressed, the formation of a secondary channel or dissection was detected. Further analysis revealed a dramatic increase of the aortic diameter.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to provide the {{topography}} of the main gray nuclei and white matter tracts of the human brainstem at 7 Tesla (7 T) high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using structural imaging (T 1) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Both imaging techniques represent a new field of increasing interest for its potential neuroanatomic and neuropathologic value. Brainstems were obtained postmortem from human donors, fixated by intracarotid perfusion of 10 % neutral buffered formalin, and scanned in a Bruker BioSpec 7 T horizontal scanner. 3 D-data sets were acquired using the modified driven equilibrium Fourier transform (MDEFT) sequence and Spin Echo-DTI (SE-DTI) sequence was used for DTI acquisition. <b>High-resolution</b> structural <b>MRI</b> and DTI of the human brainstem acquired postmortem reveals its basic cyto- and myeloar-chitectonic organization, only visualized to this moment by histological techniques and higher magnetic field strengths. Brainstem structures that are usually not observed with lower magnetic fields were now topographically identified at midbrain, pons, and medullar levels.

40|$|International audienceQuantitative MRI {{techniques}} {{have the potential}} to characterize spinal cord tissue impairments occurring in various pathologies, from both microstructural and functional perspectives. By enabling very high image resolution and enhanced tissue contrast, ultra-high field imaging may offer further opportunities for such characterization. In this study, a multi-parametric <b>high-resolution</b> quantitative <b>MRI</b> protocol is proposed to characterize in vivo the human cervical spinal cord at 7 T. Multi-parametric quantitative MRI acquizitions including T 1, T 2 (*) relaxometry mapping and axial diffusion MRI were performed on ten healthy volunteers with a whole-body 7 T system using a commercial prototype coil-array dedicated to cervical spinal cord imaging. Automatic cord segmentation and multi-parametric data registration to spinal cord templates enabled robust regional studies within atlas-based WM tracts and GM horns at the C 3 cervical level. T 1 value, cross-sectional area and GM/WM ratio evolutions along the cervical cord were also reported. An original correction method for B 1 (+) -biased T 1 mapping sequence was additionally proposed and validated on phantom. As a result, relaxometry and diffusion parameters derived from <b>high-resolution</b> quantitative <b>MRI</b> acquizitions were reported at 7 T for the first time. Obtained images, with unmatched resolutions compared to lower field investigations, provided exquisite anatomical details and clear delineation of the spinal cord substructures within an acquisition time of 30 min, compatible with clinical investigations.

However, the mechanism that leads to fibrous cap disruption is not well defined, and there have been few reports in the literature that carotid plaque rupture could be clearly visualized by serial <b>high-resolution</b> <b>MRI.</b> CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a case of a 79 -year-old man who presented with minor ischemic stroke.
