40|$|E. H. Carr {{was one of}} Europe’s preeminent thinkers in {{the field}} of {{international}} affairs. Yet his contribution to International Relations theory is continually questioned. Realists depict Carr as a quintessential realist; revisionists draw from his wider corpus to qualify his contribution. Although not inaccurate, the revisionist literature is incomplete as it neglects a number of Carr’s <b>diplomatic</b> <b>histories.</b> Refocusing on these, especially the manner in which traces of Ranke’s the primacy of foreign affairs tradition are evident, this paper points to a more conservative and less critical Carr. Utilising an interpretivist framework, this shift in traditions of thought is explained by the dilemmas Carr faced. Although works of history rather than theory, the paper contends that Carr’s <b>diplomatic</b> <b>histories</b> remain relevant, particularly with regard to the embedded criticism of realpolitik they contain. This realisation is made evident through a reading of Carr in parallel with the concept of tragedy...|$|R

5|$|In 1982 Edwards, by now an {{established}} scholar of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>history,</b> was appointed Official Historian and general editor of The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948–1975. Based {{out of the}} Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra, the multi-volume history was commissioned to cover Australia's involvement in the Malayan Emergency, Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and Vietnam War. Edwards continued the tradition established by Charles Bean, Gavin Long and Robert J. O'Neill in Australia's earlier official war histories by adopting a holistic approach that sought to analyse the operational, strategic, political, social and medical aspects of the Australian experience. But in dealing with twenty-seven years of history, the series spanned the longest time period of an Australian official history commissioned to that time. The end result was a nine-volume series, published between 1992 and 2012, with contributions from nine historians.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Filitti {{completed}} his Proprietatea solului în Principatele române până la 1864 ("Land Ownership in the Romanian Principalities to 1864") and Contribuții la istoria diplomatică a României în secolul al XIX-lea ("Contributions to the <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>History</b> of Romania in the 19th Century"). In Vechea organizare fiscală a Principatelor Române până la Regulamentul Organic ("On the Ancient Fiscal Order of the Romanian Principalities to Regulamentul Organic"), he discussed {{the proliferation of}} state taxes over the centuries, and the measure to which the Orthodox clergy was exempted. A fourth book, on literary history, saw print with the title Cărți vechi privitoare la români ("Old Books Relating to the Romanians"). Also in 1935, he released a selection of his memoirs, as Câteva amintiri ("Some Recollections"), and set in print his conferences for the state Radio Company: Dezvoltarea politică a României moderne ("The Political Development of Modern Romania"). Building on his previous research in Arhiva Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, Filitti also contributed {{an article about the}} Romanian origins of French diplomat Maurice Paléologue (Adevărul daily, September 29, 1935) and edited for print the letters of Oltenian engineer Petrache Poenaru (Arhivele Olteniei, 74-76/1934).|$|E

5000|$|Namier's {{writings}} on German history have been criticised for being influenced by Germanophobia. His hatred of Germany was legendary; Namier himself wrote in 1942 {{as the war}} raged on: [...] "it did not require either 1914, or 1933, or 1939 to teach me {{the truth about the}} Germans. Long before the last war I considered them a deadly menace to Europe and the civilisation." [...] Like the work of his friend Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, Namier's <b>diplomatic</b> <b>histories</b> are generally poorly regarded by modern historians because he was content to condemn appeasement without seeking to explain the reasons for it; and eager to dismiss political principles as rhetorical posturing.|$|R

Her most impressive accomplishment was the publication of the History of the Balkans in 1983.

Her book Modern Austria appeared in 1994 in a Japanese edition, and she collaborated on the third edition of the American Historical Association’s Guide to Historical Literature (published in 1995). She also wrote a piece on the international position of Romania in 1848 that reflected the standpoints of the Habsburgs, Ottomans, Russians, and southeastern Europeans.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the function of}} the document as proof and the archive as privileged institution of storage and access. It traces a panorama of probing approaches that can constitute or provide tools for forms of representing social reality. For such, it makes use of bibliographic resources and an interdisciplinary perspective, involving theoreticians of Archival Science, <b>Diplomatics,</b> <b>History,</b> and Information Science, to corroborate the following probing values that can relate with the archival document: 1. “Capturing the word/register”; 2. “Representing reality”; and 3. “legitimizing discourses. ” After approaching such perspectives, it identifies the need to deepen the latter approach so as to investigate the materiality of the archival document in an investigation program weighing: the symbolic dimension, the materiality of the utterance – socially permeated amidst the documentation and constitutive or constituting documental phases of memory – and the power-knowledge relation found in the institutional context...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{results from}} {{concerns}} {{about the history of}} uni/bi/multilateral relationships 	between Archival Science and other disciplines and about the tendency to naturalize 	interdisciplinarity as an intrinsic characteristic of disciplines in the contemporaneity. By 	questioning the rejection of relation between Archival Science and other disciplines on behalf of its 	scientific autonomy, as well as part of other discipline as a technique, we intend to shed light on the 	relationships that Archival Science has established (or not) with other disciplines in pursuing its 	scientific autonomy. Both sides instigate us to resume some concepts of interdisciplinarity and its 	ramifications aiming to understand the relations between Archival Science and other disciplines in 	its path of scientific development. Through a literature review we introduce some historical 	landmarks of <b>Diplomatics,</b> <b>History,</b> Computer Science and Information Science which we believe 	have a strong relationship with Archival Science. The results demonstrate an interdisciplinary 	relation between Archival Science and Diplomatics, and relations more specific with the other 	disciplines...|$|R

25|$|While {{generally}} {{not considered a}} separate academic area of study in and of itself, it involves scholars and practitioners from many fields and specialties.

It involves study and discussion of a diverse range of issues including but not limited to: civilian control of the military, military professionalism, war, civil-military operations, military institutions, and other related subjects. International in scope, civil-military relations involves discussion and research from across the world. The theoretical discussion can include non-state actors {{as well as more}} traditional nation-states. Other research involves discerning the details of military political attitudes, voting behavior, and the potential impact on and interaction with democratic society as well as military families.|$|E
