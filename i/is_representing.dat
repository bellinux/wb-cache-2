LaRouche alleges that Kronberg perjured herself and colluded with the prosecutors to frame him in order to cover up a bad check issued in 1979 by her from a New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company account for royalties owed him. One of the prosecutors in the 1988 case, John Markham, <b>is</b> <b>representing</b> Kronberg in the suit.|$|E
5|$|While {{preparing}} for court, attorney Phoenix Wright is attacked from behind, {{resulting in a}} severe case of amnesia. With {{the help of his}} client, policewoman Maggey Byrde, he learns that he <b>is</b> <b>representing</b> her in a case where she faces charges of having murdered her boyfriend, a fellow officer. After narrowly avoiding disaster due to his lack of preparation, Phoenix exposes Richard Wellington, a witness testifying for the prosecution, as the true murderer, saving Maggey. In the aftermath of the trial, he recalls another case that occurred two months prior: Dr. Turner Grey, a private surgeon who lost his reputation due to alleged malpractice, requested his help in contacting Maya Fey, his former secretary who had left the practice to finish training as a spirit medium in her home village. While performing a spirit channeling on Grey's behalf, Maya apparently kills him {{under the influence of the}} spirit's evil. Forced to once again defend her in court, Phoenix learns that Franziska von Karma, the daughter of his old enemy Manfred von Karma, has assumed the role of High Prosecutor from Miles Edgeworth, who is presumed dead. Teaming up with Maya and her young cousin Pearl, Phoenix uncovers a conspiracy between Mimi Miney, a disgruntled nurse who once worked at Grey's clinic, and Maya's aunt Morgan Fey to ruin Maya's chances of succeeding her mother as spiritual leader of her home village. When Miney publicly confesses to the murder, Morgan is sentenced to solitary confinement for her crimes and Phoenix decides to take Pearl in as one of his assistants. Six months later, the firm takes on another high-profile client: circus magician Maximillion Galactica, accused of murdering his employer Russell Berry in a dispute. Despite Franziska's interference, Phoenix and his team prove that Acro, one of Max's fellow performers, framed him after mistakenly killing Russell.|$|E

25|$|The {{exploration}} of female social roles in nineteenth-century {{society is a}} common theme in Davis's works. Her female characters {{can be viewed as}} early proto-feminist symbols because they exemplify the issues surrounding the commodification of women, and the patriarchal society that places restrictions on female identity. These issues {{can be seen in the}} heroine of Davis's novel Margret Howth. Though Howth works in the mills, her issues flow from her relations with her male counterparts. At novel's end she marries Stephen Holmes, which can both symbolize her acceptance of her Christian destiny despite her father's protestations, and her acceptance of the role of wife and mother. Through this character Davis <b>is</b> <b>representing</b> the power that patriarchal society has over the nineteenth-century female, while also presenting a strong female character who recognizes her moral independence. Davis goes further in her {{exploration of}} the true female identity by addressing the role domesticity plays in the lives of her characters. Domesticity, which once defined the roles of nineteenth-century women, is altered by Davis's placement of women in the iron mills. By describing the harsh conditions under which these women labored, Davis is capitalizing on the idea that women are capable of integrating work life into their home life.|$|E

After Nell has an accident at the local park, Sonya receives {{a visit from the}} DHS after someone makes a formal complaint against her. Sonya then realises someone is watching her. When she worries that another complaint to the DHS could result in Nell being taken into care, Sonya is tempted to drink some wine. Sonya's stalker breaks into her bedroom where Nell is sleeping and hits Mark over the head. The stalker breaks in again and is revealed to be Sonya's former best friend Erin Rogers. Erin blames Sonya for introducing her to drugs and the subsequent loss of her daughter to the DHS. Sonya feels guilty and pays Erin's bail. She also offers her a job at her nursery and gets her into a drug treatment program. Sonya lends Erin money to buy a dress, but she suspects Erin is meeting a drug dealer and follows her. She is assaulted and her bag is stolen. Erin later tells Sonya she did not buy drugs. Erin's daughter Cat (Maleeka Gasbarri) visits Erin and Sonya reveals that Erin was present at Cat's cricket games; Cat becomes upset as Erin did not reveal herself and leaves, causing Erin to fallout with Sonya again. Cat later returns and things go much better, but the pressure gets to Erin and she flees. Cat asks to live with Toadie and Sonya, but Sonya helps her reconcile with her foster mother instead. Sonya befriends Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) and invites her and her son to stay at Number 30.|$|E

2500|$|The Idiot is a perfect, and {{her most}} famous, example of this. Her color palette is {{extremely}} vivid and striking. Malfatti makes great use of primary colors, and she outlines her subject in black which clearly defines {{the shape of}} the chair and the woman, but which leaves the background indiscernible as to exactly what it <b>is</b> <b>representing.</b> The brush-strokes are large and imperfect as well and do not lend a solid feeling of spatial organization to the painting. Instead, the woman and the background seem to exist on the same plane, only being separated by color movement and shapes. The subject of a woman seated on a chair is nothing remarkable in the art world, but the subject title of the piece as well as the striking upward glance of the woman's eyes explains how it would be shocking to a conservative Brazilian culture. Not only is Malfatti painting an (as it would seem) underbelly representation of society, but she is doing so at a time when society was searching for a [...] "Brazilian" [...] style. All of a sudden it becomes uncertain what Malfatti <b>is</b> <b>representing</b> of Brazil.|$|E
2500|$|In signal processing, each vector is {{interpreted}} as a signal. In this interpretation, a vector expressed as a linear combination of the frame vectors is a redundant signal. Using a frame, {{it is possible to}} create a simpler, more sparse representation of a signal as compared with a family of elementary signals (that <b>is,</b> <b>representing</b> a signal strictly with a set of linearly independent vectors may not always be the most compact form). Frames, therefore, provide robustness. Because they provide a way of producing the same vector within a space, signals can be encoded in various ways. This facilitates fault tolerance and resilience to a loss of signal. [...] Finally, redundancy can be used to mitigate noise, which is relevant to the restoration, enhancement, and reconstruction of signals.|$|E

2500|$|Vermeer had a {{theoretical}} interest for painting. The subject {{is presumed to}} be Fama, Pictura, or Clio, the Muse of History, evidenced by her wearing a laurel wreath, holding a [...] trumpet, possibly carrying a book by Herodotus or Thucydides, which matches the description in Cesare Ripa's 16th century book on emblems and personifications entitled Iconologia. However, according to Ripa History should look back [...] and not down as in this painting. Following Vermeer's contemporary Gerard de Lairesse, interested in French Classicism and Ripa, there is another explanation; he mentions history and poetry as the main resources of a painter. The woman in blue could be representing poetry, pointing to Plutarch who observed that [...] "Simonides calls painting silent poetry and poetry painting that speaks", later paraphrased by the Latin poet Horace as ut pictura poesis. If so, the map <b>is</b> <b>representing</b> history.|$|E

[...] As the Creator, he is at times {{referred}} to as the father of heaven and earth. This is one sense in which he shares the title [...] "Father" [...] with God the Father. The church also teaches that Jesus is the LORD Jehovah of the Old Testament, and the Holy One of Israel. Because he has the [...] "Divine Investiture of Authority" [...] from the Father, the church teaches that Jesus Christ often speaks in the scriptures as though he were God the Father, because in so doing he <b>is</b> <b>representing</b> the Father.|$|E
2500|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{problems}} regarding studies of free will. Particularly in earlier studies, research relied too much on the introspection of the participants, but introspective estimates of event timing were found to be inaccurate. Many brain activity measures have been insufficient and primitive as there is no good independent brain-function measure of the conscious generation of intentions, choices, or decisions. The conclusions drawn from measurements that have been made are debatable too, as they don't necessarily tell, for example, what a sudden dip in the readings <b>is</b> <b>representing.</b> In other words, the dip might {{have nothing to do with}} unconscious decision, since many other mental processes are going on while performing the task. Some of the research mentioned here has gotten more advanced, however, even recording individual neurons in conscious volunteers. Researcher Itzhak Fried says that available studies do at least suggest consciousness comes in a later stage of decision making than previously expected – challenging any versions of [...] "free will" [...] where intention occurs at the beginning of the human decision process.|$|E
