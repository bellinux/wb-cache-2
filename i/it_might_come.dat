500|$|Planet Nine is {{hypothesized}} {{to follow a}} highly elliptical orbit around the Sun, with an orbital period of 10,000–20,000 years. The period with which it goes around the Sun is a rational multiple of the periods of all the furthest Kuiper belt objects. The planet's orbit would have a semi-major axis of approximately , or about 20 times the distance from Neptune to the Sun, although <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> as close as [...] (30 billion km, 19 billion mi), and its inclination {{is estimated to be}} roughly [...] The high eccentricity of Planet Nine's orbit could take it as far away as [...] at its aphelion.|$|E
2500|$|The 1898 {{edition of}} Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable {{attributes}} the name: [...] "So called {{from being the}} receptacle of the greyhounds of Edward III. Some {{say it is a}} corruption of the Isle of Ducks, and that it is so called in ancient records from the number of wild fowl inhabiting the marshes." [...] Other sources discount this, believing these stories to all derive from the antiquarian John Strype, and believe <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> from one of the following: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Capitol also {{houses the}} National Statuary Hall Collection, {{comprising}} two statues donated {{by each of}} the fifty states to honor persons notable in their histories. One of the most notable statues in the National Statuary Hall is a bronze statue of King Kamehameha donated {{by the state of}} Hawaii upon its accession to the union in 1959. The statue's extraordinary weight of [...] raised concerns that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> crashing through the floor, so it was moved to Emancipation Hall of the new Capitol Visitor Center. The 100th, and last statue for the collection, that of Po'pay from the state of New Mexico, was added on September 22, 2005. It was the first statue moved into the Emancipation Hall.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{in truth}} I have got nothing. Your mother said {{something}} {{to me about the}} Belton estate; as though there was some idea that possibly <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Archie armed {{himself with}} a second leg, and I laid the third up where <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be <b>come</b> at {{conveniently}} in case, by any mischance, one of us should need a spare weapon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--hum--ha! <b>It</b> <b>might</b> not <b>come</b> handy just now, {{seeing that}} Sir George is {{off with the}} King, and all the money and plate with him {{and most of the}} able-bodied servants, but I'm the more bound to look after his interests." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty! I don't {{call her}} pretty," [...] said Miss Layard; [...] "she has fine eyes, that is all, {{and they do}} not look quite right. What an {{extraordinary}} garment she had on, too; <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> out of Noah's Ark." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Stow it!' he says; 'it {{makes me}} shiver for fear <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> true. I'm not {{cut out for}} a respectable cove, and I won't be one neither, if I can help it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Wizard, [...] "if you {{would give me}} a little zosozo in a bottle, I'd like to take it with me on my travels. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> in handy on occasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> in neat." [...] (He {{had said}} in the letter that the weeping-willow {{reminded}} him of the days when Janet's bonny hair hung down kissing her waist just as the willow kissed the grave.) ...|$|E
60|$|And she came--or he {{acquired}} {{the power to}} see her, whichever <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be. She <b>came</b> suddenly, unexpectedly, completely, as a goddess should.|$|R
6000|$|I'm ever so much better, and the jackdaw has come. But why wasn't I {{there to}} meet his pathetic desire for art knowledge? To think of that poor bird's genius and love of scarlet ribbons, shut up in a cage! What <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> to! ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{stood for}} a few seconds like a man who is dazed. It {{occurred}} to me that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> into his mind with Marnham's death that he had lost his hold over Heda. But if so he said nothing of it, but only asked-- ...|$|R
6000|$|She shuddered at this, {{and then}} seized {{him by the}} shoulders. [...] "It has not come about at all," [...] she said, [...] "I was only frightened that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come,</b> and now it can't come, for I won't let it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Evidently {{something}} had happened, and Tommy rose {{to go to}} Grizel without even asking what it was. [...] "Wait," [...] David said, wrinkling his eyebrows, [...] "till Corp tells us what he means by that. I knew <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come,</b> Corp. Go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{twenty years}} <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> to that, {{if we were}} always {{to live in the}} same house; but as he leaves Harrington to-morrow, and we may {{probably}} not meet each other for the next four years, I think the chance is small." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{tears were}} in his eyes. His heart throbbed so violently that he could hardly bear his happiness. How often he had thought of this time - pictured it under all {{circumstances}} - feared that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> never <b>come</b> - yearned, and wearied for it - far away! ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} relaxed the frown {{he had put}} on at {{the greed}} of her suggestion; <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> from ignorance or mere innocence.

60|$|Then again, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> {{into play}} medicinally; and Paracelsus himself stands sponsor for every cup drunk {{for the good}} of the abdomen. So at last, I {{determined}} to let it remain where it was: visiting it occasionally, by myself, for inspection.|$|E
6000|$|I thought <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> to that. I {{heard the}} alarm beating all night [...] to {{assemble}} the National Guard; and I am told that some volunteers [...] have marched out to support Marmot. But they are a mere handful: [...] what can they do? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, my friend,' he said, {{seeing me}} {{staring at his}} belt, 'you are looking at my [...] "carver". I thought <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> in handy if we came to close quarters; it is {{excellent}} steel, and many is the pig I have killed with it.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Several {{different}} root {{words have}} been suggested for the name Fracstein. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> have <b>come</b> from fractus meaning broken.

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Forster said; [...] "led {{horses are}} a nuisance; still, as you say, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>come</b> in useful, {{if it is}} only to loose and turn down a side road, and so puzzle anyone who may be after you in the dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ojala! Heaven send it so," [...] murmured Dom Pedro, {{and would}} have embraced his daughter, but that, {{shrinking}} from him, she slipped out into the moonlit veranda.

6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] he said; [...] "good! I too." [...] He {{passed through}} his study door, closed it {{carefully}} behind him, then {{for some unknown reason}} set {{his back against}} it.

6000|$|... "Then why has {{she treated}} {{me in this}} way? What right have I given her to be my advisor, because I go to her husband's church?

50|$|Castle Danger {{was settled}} in 1890, by three Norwegian fishermen, {{although}} {{the site was}} already occupied by lumber companies.

50|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{as to how}} the community got its name (a name which is no longer used, for the most part).

Jalapa is locally referred to as Rural Vale.|$|R
