50|$|Drugs {{targeting}} the neurotransmitter of major systems affect the whole system, which {{can explain the}} complexity of action of some drugs. Cocaine, for example, blocks the re-uptake of dopamine back into the presynaptic neuron, leaving the neurotransmitter molecules in the synaptic gap {{for an extended period}} of time. Since the dopamine remains in the synapse longer, the neurotransmitter continues to bind to the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, eliciting a pleasurable emotional response. Physical addiction to cocaine may result from prolonged exposure to excess dopamine in the synapses, which leads to the downregulation of some post-synaptic receptors. After the effects of the drug wear off, an individual can become depressed due to decreased probability of the neurotransmitter binding to a receptor. Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI), which blocks re-uptake of serotonin by the presynaptic cell which increases the amount of serotonin present at the synapse and furthermore allows it to remain there longer, providing potential for the effect of naturally released serotonin. AMPT prevents the conversion of tyrosine to L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine; reserpine prevents dopamine storage within vesicles; and <b>deprenyl</b> inhibits monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B and thus increases dopamine levels.|$|E
5000|$|Amine oxidases are {{a family}} of enzymes that {{catalyze}} the oxidation of various endogenous amines, including histamine or dopamine. VAP-1 constitutes the copper dependent class of amine oxidases, such as lysyl oxidase or lysine demethylase, {{and is one of}} the four known in humans. The other class is flavin dependent such as monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. VAP-1, in particular, catalyzes the oxidative conversion of primary amines (methylamine and aminoacetone) to aldehydes (formaldehyde and methylglyoxal) ammonium and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of copper and quinone cofactor. VAP-1 is primarily localized on the cell surface on the adipocyte plasma membrane. However, circulating VAP-1 has been shown to be the main source of SSAO in human serum. Serum VAP-1 originates from many tissues. VAP-1 has adhesive properties, functional monoamine oxidase activity, and possibly plays a role in glucose handling, leukocyte trafficking, and migration during inflammation. [...] This rise in metabolic products contributes to generating advanced glycation end-products and oxidative stress along with the monoamine detoxification in the organism. Like monoamine oxidase (MAO), VAP-1 can deaminate short-chain primary amines, but SSAO enzymes, including VAP-1, can tolerate several selective flavin-dependent MAO-A and MAO-B inhibitors like clorgiline, pargyline, and <b>deprenyl,</b> but are still sensitive to semicarbazide and other hydrazines, hydroxylamine and propargylamine. VAP-1 is found in the smooth muscle of blood vessels and various other tissues, and can mostly be found in two forms: tissue-bound and soluble isoforms. The tissue-bound SSAO is primarily located in the leukocytes, adipocytes, and the endothelium of highly vascularized tissues, including the kidney, liver, and gonads. Thus, this form participates in cellular differentiation, deposition of the ECM (extracellular matrix) in smooth muscle cells, lipid trafficking in adipocytes and control of muscular tone, by mechanisms that are not completely understood. The soluble form, which is commonly known as VAP-1, is a proinflammatory protein derived from shedding of the transmembrane protein. It is highly expressed on the endothelium of the lung and trachea, and absent from leukocytes and epithelial cells. It moderates leukocyte recruitment, is both an adhesion molecule and a primary amine oxidase, and plays a role in clinical disease.|$|E

40|$|<b>Deprenyl</b> is an {{irreversible}} inhibitor of {{monoamine oxidase}} B (MAO-B) frequently {{used as an}} adjuvant therapy in the treatments of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease (PD and AD). Recent evidence, however, has found that certain <b>deprenyl</b> metabolites are associated with an anti-apoptotic action within some neuronal populations. Interestingly, deprenyl's anti-apoptotic actions do not depend upon the inhibition of MAO-B. Due to a paucity of information surrounding ($-$) deprenyl's ability to spare neurons in vivo, {{a series of studies}} were conducted to further investigate this phenomenon in two diverse models of apoptotic neuronal death: hypoxia/ischemia and kainic acid induced excitotoxicity. Results indicated that ($-$) <b>deprenyl</b> reduced delayed neuronal death in a model of unilateral global ischemia/hypoxia within the CA 1 CA 3 and CA 4 subfields of the hippocampus as compared to saline-treated subjects, and that the observed parameters were consistent with an anti-apoptotic action of ($-$) <b>deprenyl,</b> but inconsistent with MAO-B inhibition.

The activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in different brain regions and the dendritic arborization in CA 3 pyramidal neurons of hippocampus were analysed, (-) Deprenyl-treated monkeys showed {{a significant increase in}} the AChE activity by 43 % (p < 0. 001) in the frontal cortex, by 39 % (p < 0. 025) in the motor cortex, by 66 % (p < 0. 001) in the hippocampus and by 26 % (p < 0. 05) in the striatum compared to controls. The branching points and the intersections of both apical and basal dendrites of CA 3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons were also significantly increased in (-) deprenyl-treated monkeys. Enhanced AChE activity may increase dendritic arborization in the hippocampus and it may also play a role in improving cognitive functions observed in AD, following(-) <b>deprenyl</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|The <b>deprenyl</b> and {{tocopherol}} antioxidative treatment (DATATOP) {{study has}} shown that selegiline (<b>deprenyl),</b> with or without tocopherol, reduces physical and psychological deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease within one month of treatment and reduces the probability of reaching a primary endpoint, the decision to treat with levodopa. This paper critically re-evaluates the inference that selegiline has a neuroprotective effect and thus delays progression of Parkinson's disease. Analysis {{is based on a}} simple model which assumes that clinically measured impairment is proportional to degree of cellular dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. The analysis suggests that the reduced probability of reaching an endpoint was due to a direct treatment effect rather than to neuroprotection...|$|E
40|$|On {{the long}} term Parkinson Disease (PD) {{treatment}} is often complicated by the occurrence of motor fluctuations. To find out whether early treatment of PD with levodopa, dopaminoagonists or 1 -deprenyl is associated with any difference in motor fluctuations occurrence, the Italian Parkinson Study Group initiated a multicenter, randomized study. Since November 1988, 475 patients" requiring effective treatment for idiopathic PD have been randomized to re- ceive levodopa, dopamine agonists or <b>deprenyl.</b> After 2 months of therapy, all patients evaluated with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale showed a significant amelioration. Daily living activities were more impaired in pa- tients treated with <b>deprenyl.</b> Study design is presented and first results are discussed...|$|E

Since novel {{synthesized}} deprenyl-related derivatives of nitroxides, named "JSAKs", {{have been}} shown to possess antioxidative properties, their cytotoxicity on neuronal-like PC- 12 cells line was examined. The antiproliferative effect of two selected JSAKs was examined and expressed as IC 10, IC 50 and IC 90, and compared with those of the parent nitroxide (Nx- 640), model nitroxide TEMPO and <b>deprenyl.</b> There were substantial differences in the dose-dependence of all the observed antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects. Compared to anticancer drugs and apoptosis inducers with topoisomerase inhibitor properties (etoposide and camptothecin), novel compounds displayed cytotoxicity at considerably higher concentrations. The dose-dependent anti-apoptotic potency of JSAKs and Nx- 640 was also investigated and compared to TEMPO and <b>deprenyl</b> effects. The observed structure...|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} whether {{food restriction}} or the drugs nimodipine (Ca 2 + antagonist) and <b>deprenyl</b> (a MAO-B inhibitor) prevent {{the development of}} stroke in the spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat (SHR-SP). Forty male SHR-SP rats, {{in the age of}} 34 weeks, were exposed to various treatments. During a period of 27 weeks, survival and blood pressure were followed. In the control and <b>deprenyl</b> group, the blood pressure Values remained unchanged; 50 % had died after 27 weeks. All rats that were treated with nimodipine survived. After food restriction, 7 / 8 rats survived and showed a lower blood pressure. This study in SHR-PR rats shows the superiority of nimodipine on survival, and the potential of food restriction as a stroke-preventing measure. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc...|$|E
