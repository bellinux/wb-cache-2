5000|$|Red {{softening}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} types of cerebral softening. As its name suggests, certain regions of cerebral softening result in a red color. This is due to a <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarct,</b> in which blood flow is restored to an area of the brain that was previously restricted by an embolism. This is termed a [...] "red infarct" [...] or also known as red softening.|$|E
5000|$|Anemic infarcts (also called white infarcts or pale infarcts) {{are white}} or pale infarcts caused by {{arterial}} occlusions, {{and are usually}} seen in the heart, kidney and spleen. These {{are referred to as}} [...] "white" [...] {{because of the lack of}} hemorrhaging and limited red blood cells accumulation, (compare to <b>Hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarct).</b> The tissues most likely to be affected are solid organs which limit the amount of hemorrhage that can seep into the area of ischemic necrosis from adjoining capillary beds. The organs typically include single blood supply (no dual arterial blood supply or anastomoses). The infarct generally results grossly in a wedge shaped area of necrosis with the apex closest to the occlusion and the base at the periphery of the organ. The margins will become better defined with time with a narrow rim of congestion attributable to inflammation at the edge of the lesion. Relatively few extravasated red cells are lysed so the resulting hemosiderosis is limited and results in a progressively more pale area of infarction with time. Ischemic coagulative necrosis results and fibrosis of the affected area develops from the reparative response beginning at the preserved margins and working its way inwards. One exception to coagulative necrosis is the brain, which undergoes liquefactive necrosis in response to infarction.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine whether}} an acute rise in brain perfusion pressure causes hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct without a reopening of the occluded artery. We raised the blood pressure of 22 cats by aortic obstruction 5 - 24 hours after transorbital middle cerebral artery clipping; <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> were induced in 11. Mean arterial blood pressure increased by 57. 2 ± 16. 9 mm Hg (mean±SD) in the 11 cats with <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> and by 40. 4 ± 16. 9 mm Hg in the 11 remaining cats with pale brain infarcts (p< 0. 05). Induction of hypertension increased regional cerebral blood flow in the ischemic cortical gray matter more in three cats with <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> than in seven with pale infarcts. Our results demonstrate that hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct can be induced by a rapid increase in perfusion pressure to brain tissue already exposed to focal ischemia.

40|$|Intracerebral {{hemorrhage}} (ICH) is {{the main}} complication of treatment with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plas-minogen activator (IV-tPA) in acute ischemic stroke. The majority of ICH associated with IV-tPA occurs within or at the margin of ischemic or manifestly infarcted brain tissue. 1 Meanwhile, ICH can also appear in tissue without apparent acute ischemia, in brain areas remote from those affected by the initial stroke. 2 The European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) introduced a radiological classification of post-thrombolytic cerebral hemorrhage.

We included all consecutive patients with CVT between 2006 and 2010 who underwent hemicraniectomy. Outcome was assessed at 12  months with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Ten patients (8 women) with a median age of 41  years (range 26 – 52  years) were included.

The patient was in a critical condition, with progressive symptoms of hypovolemic shock and multiorgan failure. On the next day after admission, signs of electromechanical dissociation progressing to asystole were noted. The instituted resuscitation procedure proved ineffective and the patient died. Autopsy revealed brownish discoloration of the esophageal, gastric, and small intestinal mucous membranes. Numerous ulcerations without signs of perforation were found both in the esophagus and in the stomach. The mucous membrane of the small intestine demonstrated focal rubefactions, whereas no focal lesions of the large intestinal mucosa were seen.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most {{patients}} with cerebral sinus thrombosis (CST) recover after treatment with heparin, but a subgroup has a poor prognosis. Those patients {{may benefit from}} endovascular thrombolysis. METHODS: Prospective case series. Patients with sinus thrombosis were selected for thrombolysis if they had an altered mental status, coma, straight sinus thrombosis, or large space-occupying lesions. Urokinase was infused into the sinuses (bolus 120 to 600 x 10 (3) U; then 100 x 10 (3) U/h) via a jugular catheter, in 15 cases combined with mechanical thrombus disruption or removal. RESULTS: We treated 20 patients (16 women), mean age 32 years. Twelve patients were comatose and 14 had <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> before thrombolysis. Twelve patients recovered (Rankin score 0 to 2), 2 survived with handicaps, and 6 died. Factors associated with a fatal outcome were leukemia (3 / 6 versus 0 / 14, P= 0. 02) and large <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> (4 / 6 versus 2 / 14, P= 0. 04). Seizures were less frequent in the fatal cases (P= 0. 05). Patients who died had a larger mean lesion surface than survivors (30. 5 versus 13. 6 cm(2); P= 0. 03), larger midline shift (5. 2 versus 1. 7 mm; P= 0. 02), and a more rapid course (2. 7 versus 8. 2 days; P= 0. 01). Five patients who died had large hemispheric infarcts and edema before thrombolysis, causing herniation. Five patients had increased cerebral hemorrhage (3 minor, 2 major) after thrombolysis.

On the other hand, cytotoxic oedema is visible only 12 or 24 hours after {{the onset of the}} ischemic stroke.

Described in 1986, diffusion-weighted MRI is a very sensitive technique to detect the cytotoxic oedema few minutes after the onset. The attenuation of the apparent diffusion coefficient must be evaluated with a map. This attenuation appears as hypersignal and its sensibility is close than 100 %.

Here we used modern lesion analysis techniques to examine the naturally occurring lesion patterns caused by ischemic and by <b>hemorrhagic</b> <b>infarcts</b> in a large, representative acute stroke patient sample. Acute MR and CT imaging of 439 consecutively admitted right-hemispheric stroke patients from a well-defined catchment area suffering from ischemia (n= 367) or hemorrhage (n= 72) were normalized and mapped in reference to stereotaxic anatomical atlases. For ischemic infarcts, highest frequencies of stroke were observed in the insula, putamen, operculum and superior temporal cortex, as well as the inferior and superior occipito-frontal fascicles, superior longitudinal fascicle, uncinate fascicle, and the acoustic radiation. The maximum overlay of hemorrhages was located more posteriorly and more medially, involving posterior areas of the insula, Heschl's gyrus, and putamen. Lesion size was largest in frontal and anterior areas and lowest in subcortical and posterior areas. The large and unbiased sample of stroke patients {{used in the present study}} accumulated the different sub-patterns to identify the global topographic and volumetric pattern of right hemisphere stroke in humans...|$|R
