50|$|I {{would take}} them to mean, generally, that the {{tribunal}} which adjudicates upon his rights must act fairly, in good faith, without bias, and in a judicial temper, and must give <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> adequately <b>to</b> state his case.|$|R
5|$|Brought {{up in the}} Rhondda Valley, Paul {{became a}} miner after leaving school, but an offer of a {{professional}} contract from Swansea gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> leave the colliery. His football career was then disrupted by Second World War, during which he was a physical training instructor. After the war, Paul made his League debut, and spent four years playing first team football for Swansea, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948–49.

5|$|The {{existing}} {{design of}} the Piazza del Campidoglio and the surrounding palazzi was created by Renaissance artist and architect Michelangelo Buonarroti in 1536–1546. At {{the height of his}} fame, he was commissioned by the Farnese Pope Paul III, who wanted a symbol of the new Rome to impress Charles V, who was expected in 1538. This offered <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> build a monumental civic plaza for a major city as well as to reestablish the grandeur of Rome.|$|E
50|$|National {{service as}} a gunner in <b>the</b> Army {{deprived}} <b>him</b> of <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> play in <b>the</b> university side in 1956. He played numerous matches for the Army and the Combined Services in 1956 and 1957, four of them first-class.|$|R
50|$|In {{a sequel}} called Destiny's Angels, the Judge Child was {{executed}} {{for attempting to}} assassinate Dredd in revenge for depriving <b>him</b> of <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> rule Mega-City One. In McGruder's eyes this vindicated Dredd's earlier judgement of him, and she authorised the execution herself.|$|R
50|$|The {{youngest}} of two sons of geneticist L. C. Dunn and Louise P. Dunn, Stephen lived {{his life with}} cerebral palsy. His parents provided <b>him</b> with <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> travel in Norway, Sweden, France, England, Ireland, and Italy as a boy and young man.|$|R

He learned the game while playing with his brothers on a frozen pond near the family home and on a backyard rink his father made. As he got older Breslin played in local leagues and Driscoll Catholic High School's club team, which afforded <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> join the Dubuque Fighting Saints in the United States Hockey League.|$|E
5|$|A minor {{knee injury}} which only left Hunt out {{for two weeks}} was enough to deny <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> regain the fullback {{position}} for Australia in the Centenary Test against New Zealand in May 2008. Hunt's place in the Queensland team for the 2008 State of Origin series was assured by Queensland coach Mal Meninga but there was speculation that Hunt could play five-eighth in place of injured teammate Darren Lockyer. While not the best five-eighth possibility for the Queensland representative team, his selection there would {{make way for the}} Australian fullback Billy Slater. Hunt, having never played a senior rugby league game at five-eighth, was controversially selected at the position for Queensland instead of the in-form Scott Prince.|$|E
5|$|Felice Beato (1832 – 29 January 1909), {{also known}} as Felix Beato, was an Italian–British photographer. He {{was one of the}} first people to take {{photographs}} in East Asia and one of the first war photographers. He is noted for his genre works, portraits, and views and panoramas of the architecture and landscapes of Asia and the Mediterranean region. Beato's travels gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> create images of countries, people, and events that were unfamiliar and remote to most people in Europe and North America. His work provides images of such events as the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and the Second Opium War, and represents the first substantial body of photojournalism. He had an impact on other photographers, and his influence in Japan, where he taught and worked with numerous other photographers and artists, was particularly deep and lasting.|$|E

5000|$|His love {{of writing}} blossomed into script writing under the tutorage of Carroll O'Connor {{during his time}} on In the Heat of the Night, which yielded <b>him</b> <b>the</b> unique <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> co-write <b>the</b> {{screenplay}} for the No. 1 Country song [...] "Wolverton Mountain" [...] with Merle Kilgore.|$|R
50|$|Another of {{his early}} films was Der Yoghi (1916), in which he {{played the role of}} a yogi and young inventor, and which {{provided}} <b>him</b> with <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> accommodate three of his interests, trick photography (it {{was one of the first}} films to feature invisibility), the supernatural and Eastern mysticism.|$|R
5|$|In August 1962, Chaffee {{confided in}} his family that he had {{submitted}} an application for the NASA astronaut training program, and informed his superiors he wanted to train as a test pilot for astronaut status. In mid-1962, he was accepted in the initial pool of 1,800 applicants for the third group of NASA astronauts. After his naval tour was over, and he had racked up over 1,800 hours of flying time, the Navy offered <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> continue work on his master's degree. In January 1963, he entered the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, {{to work on his}} Master of Science degree in Reliability Engineering.|$|E
5|$|In February 1972, Nixon and {{his wife}} {{traveled}} to China. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40hours in preparation. Upon touching down, the President and First Lady emerged from Air Force One and greeted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai. Nixon {{made a point of}} shaking Zhou's hand, something which then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had refused to do in 1954 when the two met in Geneva. Over 100television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print. It also gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> snub the print journalists he despised.|$|E
5|$|The {{perpetrators}} were apprehended in 1989 {{under the}} administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving {{at least half of}} their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he failed to provide a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla was released from prison after a Mexico City judge granted <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions. The Mexican government closed the case after the arrests, but many journalists doubted the results of the investigation and believed that the masterminds behind the murder case remained at large.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2001, Benedetto served as an inaugural {{research}} clerk for the newly formed Arizona chapter of the Institute for Justice. Although he did not share the organization’s libertarian political orientation, <b>the</b> experience provided <b>him</b> with <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> work for current Arizona Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, {{a friend}} of Meeks who worked at General Motors, came to him at Edelbrock and {{presented}} <b>him</b> with <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> work on <b>the</b> new Chevy V8. Edelbrock was given 3 of the brand new engines before the public ever saw them and Meeks {{was in charge of}} testing.|$|R

Ten days later, Shuler was dead in an unfortunate motorcycle accident.|$|R
5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1887, Bruce {{travelled}} north to Edinburgh to attend a pair of vacation courses in natural sciences. The six-week courses, at the recently established Scottish Marine Station at Granton on the Firth of Forth, were {{under the direction of}} Patrick Geddes and John Arthur Thomson, and included sections on botany and practical zoology. The experience of Granton, and the contact with some of the foremost contemporary natural scientists, convinced Bruce to stay in Scotland. He abandoned his place at UCL, and enrolled instead in the medical school at the University of Edinburgh. This enabled him to maintain contact with mentors such as Geddes and Thomson, and also gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> work during his free time in the Edinburgh laboratories where specimens brought back from the Challenger expedition were being examined and classified. Here he worked under Dr John Murray and his assistant John Young Buchanan, and gained a deeper understanding of oceanography and invaluable experience in the principles of scientific investigation.|$|E
5|$|Parsons' newfound {{credentials}} and financial security gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> travel more widely throughout the U.S. as an ambassador for Aerojet, meeting with other rocket enthusiasts. In New York {{he met with}} Karl Germer, {{the head of the}} O.T.O. in North America and in Washington, D.C. he met Poet Laureate Joseph Auslander, donating some of Crowley's poetry books to the Library of Congress. He also became a regular at the Mañana Literary Society, which met in Laurel Canyon at the home of Parsons' friend Robert A. Heinlein and included science fiction writers including Cleve Cartmill, Jack Williamson, and Anthony Boucher. Among Parsons' favorite works of fiction was Williamson's Darker Than You Think, a novelette published in the fantasy magazine Unknown in 1940, which inspired his later occult workings. Boucher used Parsons as a partial basis for the character of Hugo Chantrelle in his murder mystery Rocket to the Morgue (1942).|$|E
50|$|In 1976 Langevin won the Prix d'Europe. <b>The</b> award {{provided}} <b>him</b> with <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> take {{graduate studies}} at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg with Aurèle Nicolet. After graduating from that school in 1979, he pursued further studies with Maxence Larrieu in Geneva. In 1980 he was awarded second prize at the Budapest International Competition.|$|R

50|$|Manninen appealed on {{the basis}} that the {{questions}} violated his rights to counsel under section 10(b) as they did not provide <b>him</b> with <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> call a lawyer and due to the violation the evidence obtained in violating his right should be excluded under section 24(2). The Court of Appeal agreed and overturned his conviction.|$|R
5|$|Quackenbush {{became a}} fan {{favourite}} upon {{his arrival in}} Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow Hall of Famer) Eddie Shore. In his first season in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued {{to stay out of}} the penalty box, registering only 4 penalty minutes. However, it marked the first time in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team. The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950–51, forcing the team to use several first year players. While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> play with his brother Max. It was the only time the two played professionally together. He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star. Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year.|$|E
5|$|On the July 3 SmackDown, Ziggler {{defeated}} Alex Riley {{to qualify}} for a spot in the World Heavyweight Championship Money in the Bank ladder match. On July 13, Ziggler, Zack Ryder and Justin Roberts were involved in a car accident in San Diego while driving from Comic-Con; none of them suffered severe injuries. Two days later at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, Ziggler won the Money in the Bank ladder match to guarantee <b>him</b> <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> challenge for the World Heavyweight Championship at a time of his choosing within the next year. Later that night, Ziggler attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus after Alberto Del Rio attacked him after their match, but Del Rio stopped Ziggler from cashing in. On the following episode of SmackDown, Ziggler again attempted to cash in the briefcase on Sheamus following a tag team match with Alberto Del Rio, but was laid out by Rey Mysterio and Sheamus before he could do so. During this time, Ziggler began a feud with Chris Jericho after claiming he had lost his touch, which resulted in Jericho attacking him on two occasions, and defeating him in a singles match at SummerSlam. The night after SummerSlam, Ziggler defeated Jericho in a rematch; as a result Ziggler retained his Money in the Bank contract and Jericho's WWE contract was terminated. Following this, Ziggler began feuding with Randy Orton on SmackDown four days later, after Orton hit him with an RKO when Ziggler tried to cash his Money in the Bank contract on a vulnerable Sheamus. The following week on SmackDown, Ziggler faced Orton in a match that was won by Orton, Ziggler defeated him in a rematch on Raw by pinning him while holding his tights. Ziggler faced Orton again at Night of Champions where he lost again, ending the feud. On November 18 at Survivor Series, Ziggler captained the traditional 5-on-5 elimination tag team match opposite Mick Foley and won the match by last pinning Orton, making him the sole survivor of the match.|$|E
