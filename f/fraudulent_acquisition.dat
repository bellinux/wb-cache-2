500|$|One item of {{importance}} that Governor Osborne had {{been instructed to}} deal with was rising discontent among the Iroquois whose territory abutted New York (and is now central and western Upstate New York). [...] Pownall had studied the matter, and he was consequently invited by his Pennsylvania connections to attend the 1754 Albany Congress as an observer. [...] His observations {{on the nature of}} colonial dealings with the Indians (including political infighting for control of the Indian trade, and the corrupt and <b>fraudulent</b> <b>acquisition</b> of Indian lands) led him to draft a number of proposals related to colonial administration. [...] He proposed the establishment of a crown-appointed superintendent of Indian affairs, specifically William Johnson, New York's commissioner for Indian affairs. [...] He also articulated visions for managing the expansion of the colonies to the west. [...] After the conference he returned to Philadelphia. [...] In this time he apparently cemented a close friendship with Franklin, with whom he began to invest in business ventures. [...] Franklin, who had unsuccessfully proposed colonial union at the Albany conference, may have contributed to Pownall's writings, although the exact nature of his influence is unclear. [...] While in Philadelphia he also established a close collaboration with cartographer Lewis Evans, both of whom recognized the need for accurate maps of the inland regions of North America then being disputed with New France in the French and Indian War. [...] The map Evans published in 1755 was dedicated to Pownall, and brought the latter wide publicity. [...] Pownall's recommendation of Johnson as superintendent of Indian affairs was also implemented by the crown in 1755.|$|E
50|$|The {{mention of}} the place Clotna in the year 965 allows the {{conclusion}} that Klöden is more than 1000 years old, as the document is witness to a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>acquisition</b> of a honey tithe, not to a founding date.|$|E
5000|$|Theft from Interstate Shipment {{is a legal}} {{classification}} used for Section 659 of Title 18 of the United States Code. It prohibits the theft or <b>fraudulent</b> <b>acquisition</b> of goods {{that are part of}} an interstate or international shipment, whether from the carrier or a holding area, and also the wilful buying, selling or possession of goods obtained in this way. [...] Currently, if the value of the goods is under $100, it is punished as a misdemeanor; otherwise, it is a felony.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fraudulent</b> theft: Illegal <b>acquisition</b> of {{a vehicle}} from a seller through {{fraudulent}} transfer of funds that the seller will ultimately not receive (such as by identity theft {{or the use of}} a counterfeit cashier's check), or {{through the use of a}} loan obtained under false pretenses. Many vehicles stolen via fraud are resold quickly thereafter. Using this approach, the thief can quietly evade detection and continue stealing vehicles in different jurisdictions. Car rental and Car dealership companies are also defrauded by car thieves into renting, selling, financing, or leasing them cars with fake identification, checks, and credit cards. This is a common practice in areas near borders which tracking devices do nothing because jurisdiction cannot be applied into a foreign country to recover a lost vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Kozlov and Romanova {{have accused}} Federation Council member Vladimir Slutsker of conspiring to have Kozlov jailed, and lodged a {{complaint}} {{to that effect}} with Russia's Prosecutor General, Yury Chaika. Chairman of Korfinans, he was arrested on 30 July 2008 and charged with the <b>fraudulent</b> <b>acquisition</b> of a factory in North West Moscow called 'Artificial Leather'. He was found guilty by the Moscow City Court and is serving a seven-year sentence at a penal colony in the Perm region. He maintains his innocence, and that documentation supports his case, while arguing {{that he has the}} evidence of translators and notaries that documents used by the prosecution are forgeries. In July 2011 his prospects of release brightened when the Supreme Court ruled that he had not had a fair trial.|$|E

50|$|Away from football, {{the board}} instigated court {{proceedings}} against {{four of its}} former executives and investor Mike Ashley. The case against former chief executives Charles Green and Derek Llambias, former commercial director Imran Ahmad, former financial director Brian Stockbridge and Ashley was brought regarding a loss of income caused by retail deals agreed between the company that owns the club and Sports Direct from 2012 to 2015. Details of Rangers legal claim was revealed on 12 August after Ashley's lawyers succeeded {{in a bid to}} the documents disclosed. According to the papers lodged with the Court of Session, Rangers sought approximately £4.1m in damages caused by alleged negligence by Green and other club staff from which Ashley unfairly benefited. Rangers regained representation at a domestic football level as Managing director Stewart Robertson was appointed to the SFA professional game board, although Robertson had initially signalled his intent to stand for the SPFL board but withdrew {{due to a lack of}} support. Meanwhile the former Rangers owner Craig Whyte was the only person facing fraud charges relating to the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club Plc, proceedings began in June. In a bizarre twist, former Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay QC was appointed to Whyte's legal team and will defend Whyte when he faces charges relating to the acquisition of the club in May 2011 and its subsequent financial mismanagement. On 22 December, at his pre-trial Whyte entered a not guilty plea at the High Court in Glasgow. The trial concerning accusations of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>acquisition</b> of the Club began in April 2017, with former Rangers managers Walter Smith and Ally McCoist called to give evidence about the financial situation at the Oldco preceding Whyte's reign.|$|E
40|$|Phishing {{has been}} defined as the <b>fraudulent</b> <b>acquisition</b> of {{personal}} information by trick-ing an individual into believing the attacker is a trustworthy entity 1. Phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are on the rise. In order to develop effective strate-gies and solutions to combat the phishing problem, one needs to understand the infra-structure in which phishing economies thrive. We have conducted extensive research to uncover phishing networks. The result is detailed analysis from 3, 900, 000 phishing e–mails, 220, 000 messages collected from 13 key phishing–related chat rooms, 13, 000 chat rooms and 48, 000 users, which were spidered across six chat networks and 4, 400 compromised hosts used in botnets. This paper presents the findings from this research as well as an analysis of the phishing infrastructure...|$|E
