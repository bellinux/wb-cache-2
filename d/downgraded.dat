40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that the stock market reacts negatively to bond rating <b>downgrades</b> and that <b>downgrades</b> tend to follow periods of negative returns, indicating that at least some <b>downgrades</b> are partially predictable. Hypothesizing that the reaction to a <b>downgrade</b> depends on both the implications for cash flows and the degree of surprise, we explore how the reaction to <b>downgrade</b> announcements varies across bond issues. We find that the equity market reacts much more negatively to bond rating <b>downgrades</b> to and within the speculative bond category than to <b>downgrades</b> within the investment grade category. Within the speculative category, the reaction is stronger, the lower the old and new ratings are. The reaction to multiple-level <b>downgrades</b> is not very different from that to single-level <b>downgrades.</b> The market reaction is also stronger if the firm has experienced negative pre-downgrade abnormal returns. Our evidence indicates that <b>downgrades</b> are viewed by the market as providing information on likely future earnings before interest charges, not just likely future interest charges. It is also consistent with Billett 2 ̆ 7 s (1996) hypothesis that low rated debt makes a firm less attractive as a takeover target...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{existing}} systems, {{information are}} protected by security models that control the accesses to the information, depending on their security level. In such systems, allowing accesses that were previously denied by diminishing the security level of the information is called <b>downgrading.</b> Controlling this <b>downgrade</b> of sensitive information {{is an important issue}} in computer security, as it requires the definition of formal security models able to express contextual authorisations for some information flows. In traditional security models, information <b>downgrading</b> is however most of the time not taken into account and must be managed by external systems. In some recent security models, information <b>downgrading</b> is defined, but for specific security policies, which limits the <b>downgrading</b> controls. In {{order to be able to}} express a generic information <b>downgrading</b> control, we present in this article a formalization of the different concepts of <b>downgrading</b> and we propose a model to specify and control downgrad operations.

5|$|By August9, {{increasing}} {{wind shear}} further weakened the storm, with Felicia being <b>downgraded</b> to {{a tropical storm}} early that day. The storm rapidly weakened throughout the day as convection gradually dissipated around the center due to the shear. By the late morning hours, little convective activity remained around the low pressure center of Felicia. A weak cyclone, the storm continued to track towards Hawaii with the only deep convection associated with it being displaced to the northeast of the center. The system slowly weakened before being <b>downgraded</b> to a tropical depression on August11 as no areas of tropical storm-force winds were found by Hurricane Hunters. Several hours after being <b>downgraded,</b> the CPHC issued its final advisory on Felicia as it degenerated into a remnant low near the Hawaiian Islands. The system dissipated shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|By September 2, the storm's {{convective}} thunderstorms warmed slightly, indicating weakening to {{just below}} Category5. An eyewall replacement cycle took place, and two eye structures formed as gradual weakening continued. By September 2, {{the storm was}} <b>downgraded</b> to Category3 just before it turned slightly to the west. The storm underwent another eyewall replacement cycle as winds decreased further. As the storm entered cooler waters, winds decreased to 100mph (160km/h), below major hurricane intensity. Soon Hernan was <b>downgraded</b> to Category1, and the eye became cloud-filled. On September 5, Hernan was <b>downgraded</b> to a tropical storm as winds rapidly weakened to 45mph (72km/h) despite developing a new band of convection. That same day, the storm was <b>downgraded</b> to a tropical depression as it began to lose tropical characteristics. Strong wind shear developed, further dissipating the depression. On September 6, the system degenerated into a remnant low-pressure system which spawned a remnant plume of moisture that meandered {{off the coast of}} California, producing light showers.|$|E

5|$|Later on June20, {{convection}} {{near the}} center of circulation began to decrease–an indication of weakening–and the eye was no longer visible.

Taking a more northward track than anticipated, Linfa began to interact with land and was <b>downgraded</b> to a tropical storm by the JTWC on June21. Around 1230UTC, the storm made landfall in southern Fujian as a tropical storm with winds of 85km/h (50mph 10-minute winds). Deep convection rapidly dissipated shortly thereafter due to interaction with land. Several hours later, the JTWC <b>downgraded</b> Linfa to a tropical depression.

In contrast to prior studies that document significant stock price reactions to <b>downgrades</b> but not upgrades, I find that the corporate bond market responds significantly to both <b>downgrades</b> and upgrades. In addition, bond prices continue to drift significantly following rating changes. <b>Downgrades</b> appear to be partially anticipated by the corporate bond market, as bond prices decline significantly prior to <b>downgrades.</b> Cross-sectionally, I show that negative excess bond returns prior to a <b>downgrade</b> indicate greater market anticipation, as evidenced by a weaker market response when the <b>downgrade</b> is announced.

40|$|<b>Downgrade</b> {{operations}} are {{not specifically addressed}} in the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual procedures for two-lane highways. However, traffic operations on long steep <b>downgrades</b> on two-lane highways are becoming increasingly important due to increasing volumes and the higher percent of slow moving vehicles such as recreational vehicles and heavy trucks in the traffic stream. Compounding the slow moving vehicle platooning problem {{is the fact that}} most <b>downgrades</b> on the primary highway system in Western Canada are long no-passing zones. It is noted that most upgrades on the primary highway system have climbing lanes, and passing lanes are being built on level tangent sections which have extended no-passing zones. This paper presents the findings of a study of traffic flow on long <b>downgrades</b> on the primary highway system in Western Canada. <b>Downgrade</b> data was collected on three long, steep <b>downgrades</b> using a time lapse video camera. The findings indicated that while truck speeds on level terrain are only slightly slower than passenger cars, on <b>downgrades</b> the presence of trucks noticeably affects speed-flow relationships. Both the Hyperlang and Schuhl headway distributions produced excellent fits to the headway data. The data yielded over 6000 platoons. The Geometric, Borel-Tanner, and one parameter Miller distributions provided a good representation of traffic flow on <b>downgrades</b> only under some conditions, however, the two-parameter Miller distribution produced very good fits in all cases of platoon size distributions. ...|$|R
