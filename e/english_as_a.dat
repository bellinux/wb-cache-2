5|$|Ain't meaning didn't {{is widely}} {{considered}} a feature unique to African American Vernacular English, although {{it can be found}} in some dialects of Caribbean English as well. It may function not as a true variant of didn't, but as a creole-like tense-neutral negator (sometimes termed generic ain't). Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired <b>English</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> second language; {{it is also possible that}} early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European-Americans, and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage. Ain't is rarely attested for the present-tense constructions do not or does not.|$|E
5|$|Although the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia share <b>English</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> common {{oral and}} written language, ASL is not {{mutually}} intelligible with British Sign Language (BSL) or Auslan.

It {{has been found that}} a relatively high percentage (37–44%) of ASL signs have similar translations in Auslan, which for oral languages would suggest that they belong to the same language family. However, this does not seem justified historically for ASL and Auslan, and it is likely that this resemblance is due to the higher degree of iconicity in sign languages in general, as well as contact with English.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff Castle {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} Richard's son, Henry and Henry's daughter, Anne until 1449. When Anne died, it passed by marriage to Richard Neville, who held it until his death in 1471 during the period of civil strife known as the Wars of the Roses. As the conflict progressed and political fortunes rose and fell, the castle passed from George, the Duke of Clarence, to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to Jasper Tudor, the Duke of Bedford, back to Richard Neville's wife Anne, back to Jasper and finally to Prince Henry, the future Henry VIII. The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne {{at the end of the}} wars heralded a change in the way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and <b>English.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, defensive castles became less important. In 1495 Henry VII formally revoked the Marcher territory status of Cardiff Castle and the surrounding territories, bringing them under normal English law as the County of Glamorgan.|$|E
5|$|English has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of <b>English</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from English into other languages. That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} extant manuscript, the Winchester Chronicle, {{was written}} by a single scribe up to the year 891. The scribe wrote the year number, DCCCXCII, in {{the margin of the}} next line; subsequent material {{was written by}} other scribes. This appears to place the composition of the chronicle at no later than 892; further evidence is provided by Bishop Asser's use of a version of the Chronicle in his work Life of King Alfred, known to have been composed in 893. It is known that the Winchester manuscript is at least two removes from the original Chronicle; as a result, there is no proof that the Chronicle was compiled at Winchester. It is also difficult to fix the date of composition, but it is generally thought that the chronicles were composed during the reign of Alfred the Great (871–99), as Alfred deliberately tried to revive learning and culture during his reign, and encouraged the use of <b>English</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> written language. The Chronicle, as well as the distribution of copies to other centres of learning, may be a consequence of the changes Alfred introduced.|$|E
