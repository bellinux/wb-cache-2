On the 17th {{he sent a}} copy of the verses to Moore, then {{resident}} at Paris; and on September 20 he desired Moore to get [...] "twenty copies of the whole carefully and privately printed off." [...] A copy is in the possession of Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B., and I am indebted to his kindness for the following description: [...] "The pamphlet consists of four 8vo leaves, viz. half-title ('The Irish Avatar,' in bold capitals, with blank verse), pp. [1], [2] + Text, pp. 3-8. The poem begins on the third page with a <b>dropped</b> <b>head,</b> 'The Irish Avatar' again, and the first four verses. Pp. 4-7 contain six verses each, and p. 8 the remaining four, making up thirty-two in all. The date at the end of p. 8 is 'September 16, 1821.' There is no title-page proper; a headline, 'The Irish Avatar,' occurs on pp. 4-8, which pages are numbered in Arabic figures in the outside corners, and the thirty-two stanzas are also numbered in Arabic figures. The poem is printed on a half-sheet of a peculiar fine-ribbed paper." [...] Twenty stanzas of The Irish Avatar were printed by Medwin in Conversations of Lord Byron, 1824, pp. 216-220, and in a second edition, 1824, pp. 332-338.

40|$|BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Flexible <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> {{deformity}} (FDHD) following laminectomy for cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is {{a debilitating}} entity. Patients {{need to support}} their head manually to look forward in standing or sitting position. Flexible <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> deformity is different from rigid <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> deformity in patients with post-laminectomy kyphosis or ankylosing spondylitis and has only once been described after surgery to the cervical spine. PURPOSE: This case report aimed to report a rare, but severe complication of cervical posterior decompressive surgery, to describe its possible etiology, and to review {{the literature on the}} management of FDHD in order to provide recommendations for its treatment. STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective clinical case series. PATIENT SAMPLE: This sample comprises four patients with FDHD. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts with clinical follow-up data of all patients who underwent posteriorly directed spinal interventions and concomitantly developed FDHD and were admitted between January 1998 and September 2015. RESULTS: Cervical decompressive laminectomy is regularly performed in our institution. Four patients with FDHD were identified (3 men and 1 woman). The overall prevalence was less than 1 % (= 4 of 460 total estimated CSM surgeries). Flexible <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> deformity developed within weeks or months after surgery. One patient was treated conservatively, whereas the other three received surgery to reconstruct stability of the cervical spine. Two of the surgically corrected patients eventually required revision surgery as a result of failure of the hardware and because of skin erosion. CONCLUSIONS: Flexible <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> deformity is a rare, but serious complication of posterior decompressive surgery. Its etiology appears multifactorial. Its management needs to be directed toward early surgical intervention...|$|E
40|$|Neutral lipid {{storage disease}} with {{myopathy}} (NLSDM) {{is a rare}} autosomal recessive disorder of neutral lipid metabolism. Clinical manifestations include progressive skeletal myopathy, cardiomyopathy, and liver dysfunction. Clinical severity is variable and additional symptoms may include diabetes mellitus, chronic pancreatitis, hypothyroidism, neurosensory hearing loss, and short stature. We report a 79 -year-old man with progressive proximal arm weakness, lipid storage myopathy, <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> syndrome, and peripheral nervous system involvement. He harboured a novel homozygous missense mutation, c. 570 A>C (p. S 191 R) in the PNPLA 2 gene, confirming the diagnosis of NLSDM.

40|$|The <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> {{syndrome}} (DHS) is a disabling condition {{caused by}} severe {{weakness of the}} neck extensor muscles causing progressive reducible kyphosis of the cervical spine and the inability to hold the head up. Weakness can occur in isolation or in association with a generalized neuromuscular disorder. Isolated cases are owed to the late onset of noninflammatory myopathy designated as INEM, where persistent chin to chest deformity may gradually cause or aggravate preexisting degenerative changes of the cervical spine and ultimately result in myelopathy. In review of the literature, we could find only 5 cases, with no unique guidelines to address the management of these two concomitant pathologies. Herein, a 69 -year-old man who had developed cervical myelopathy 2 years after being affected by isolated <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> syndrome is presented. Chin to chest deformity and cervical myelopathy were managed through three-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) combined with decompressive cervical laminectomy and stabilization with C 2 to C 7 pedicle screw-rod construct. At 4 -month follow-up, despite recovery in patient’s neurological status, flexion deformity reappeared with recurrence of <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> due to C 7 pedicle screws pull-out. However, this was successfully managed with extension of the construct to the upper thoracic levels...|$|E

40|$|SummaryPurpose:Dropped head {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} a gradual forward sagging of the head due to the isolated weakness of the neck extensor muscles. The syndrome has a relatively benign clinical course. To date, there have been no reports of <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> syndrome in epileptic patients. Methods:Nine patients with intractable epilepsy (mean age, 33. 6 ± 9. 91 years), each presenting with apparent <b>dropped</b> <b>head,</b> were evaluated. The duration of the drooping head symptom varied from 3 to 15 years (mean, 7. 4 ± 4. 06 years), with a slowly progressing weakness in most of the patients. In all of the patients, extensive clinical, laboratory, electrophysiological, histopathological, and neuroimaging examinations were performed. Results:The weakness in all of the subjects was strictly limited to the cervical paraspinal muscles. Laboratory studies produced normal results from all subjects. EMG and muscle biopsy were normal or revealed subtle nonspecific myopathic changes without inflammation in the cervical paraspinal muscles. Polymyographic investigation revealed that none of the patients had convincing dystonic spasms of the anterior neck muscles. No atrophy or fatty changes of the neck extensor muscles were observed on CT or MRI. In most of the patients (7 / 9), altered l-carnitine concentrations were observed (four patients displayed a marked decrease in plasma carnitine concentrations, and three other patients showed abnormalities in urinary excretion of carnitine). Conclusions:These findings seem to suggest that a secondary carnitine deficiency, induced by antiepileptic drugs (principally valproic acid), represents a plausible pathogenetic mechanism for the development of <b>dropped</b> <b>head</b> in some epileptic patients...|$|E

We present a case of DHS in a young woman to illustrate this condition, and review the current litera-ture. Although at present the only definitive solution for correction and stabilization of DHS is surgical intervention involving multilevel instrumented fixation and fusion, this condition requires a persistent medical workup and treatment of reversible causes before surgical intervention is contemplated...|$|E
