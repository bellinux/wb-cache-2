25|$|The pilots {{initially}} {{believed that}} a bomb had gone off inside the airplane, as this accident happened just two months after Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie, Scotland. They began an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> {{in order to reach}} an altitude where the air was breathable, while also performing a 180-degree left turn to fly back to Honolulu. The explosion damaged components of the on-board emergency oxygen supply system, as it was primarily located in the forward cargo sidewall area, just aft of the cargo door.|$|E
25|$|Newspapers {{and other}} media criticized the actions taken by the crew {{and said that the}} pilots took too long to {{initiate}} an emergency descent; the initial NTSB report was especially critical of Cameron for not asking about the exact nature of the fire and not immediately initiating <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> when the fire was first reported. Cameron admitted in a press conference following the issuance of the NTSB report that he assumed the problem was a garbage bin fire, a common cause of lavatory fires when smoking was still allowed on flights.|$|E
25|$|The flight left Hong Kong on 25 July 2008 {{shortly after}} 9:00 am HKT (0100 UTC). At 10:17 HKT (0217 UTC), {{passengers}} and crew heard a loud bang; the cabin de-pressurised and {{a hole in the}} floor of the passenger deck appeared, as well as a hole in the outside wall of the cargo deck. During the emergency, parts of the aircraft's floor and ceiling collapsed. Passengers reported that, despite the noise and the deployment of the oxygen masks, there was very little panic. The pilots conducted an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> from 29,000feet to ensure adequate oxygen supply for the passengers, reaching 10,000feet by 10:24 HKT (02:24 UTC).|$|E
2500|$|Strong {{recommendation}} that all US-based air carriers review their fire training and evaluation procedures; procedures {{were to be}} shortened and focused on taking [...] "aggressive actions" [...] to determine the source and severity of suspected cabin fires while finding the shortest and safest possible <b>emergency</b> <b>descents,</b> including landing or ditching; ...|$|R
2500|$|The Trident was {{routinely}} able {{to descend}} at rates {{of up to}} 4500ft/min (23m/s) in regular service. In <b>emergency</b> <b>descents</b> it was permissible to use reverse thrust of up to 10,000ft/min. Below 280kn IAS, it was also possible to extend the main landing gear for use as an airbrake. The Trident's first version, Trident 1C, had the unusual capability of using reverse thrust prior to touchdown. The throttles could be closed in the flare and reverse idle set to open the reverser buckets. At pilot discretion, up to full reverse thrust could then be used prior to touchdown. This was helpful to reduce hydroplaning and give [...] very short landing runs on wet or slippery runways while preserving wheel brake efficiency and keeping wheel brake temperatures low. Brakes were fitted with the Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid system.|$|R
40|$|A partial {{pressure}} suit was evaluated during tests in an F- 104 and F- 15 as a protective garment for <b>emergency</b> <b>descents.</b> The garment is an pressure jerkin and modified anti-g suit combined with an oronasal mask. The garment can be donned and doffed at the aircraft to minimize thermal buildup. The oronasal mask was favored by the pilots due to its immobility on the face during high g-loading. The garment was chosen to provide optimum dexterity for the pilot, which is not available in a full pressure suit, while protecting the pilot at altitudes up to 18, 288 meters, during a cabin decompression, and subsequent aircraft descent. During cabin decompressions in the F- 104 and F- 15, cabin pressure altitude was measured at various aircraft angles of attack, Mach numbers, and altitudes {{to determine the effect}} of the aerodynamic slipstream on the cabin altitude...|$|R
25|$|Southwest Airlines Flight 3472 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight operating from New Orleans International Airport, LA to Orlando International Airport, FL. On 27 August 2016, the Boeing 737-7H4 (WL), with 99 passengers and 5 crew, 12 minutes after departure from New Orleans, was climbing through 31,000 feet and heading east over the Gulf of Mexico when the aircraft's number one CFM International CFM56-7 engine suffered an uncontained engine failure. Debris {{from the engine}} punctured {{the left side of}} the fuselage causing a loss of cabin pressure and damaged the wing and empennage. Oxygen masks were deployed to passengers while the crew initiated an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> to 10,000 feet. The aircraft then diverted to Pensacola International Airport for a safe landing on runway 17 about 20 minutes later without further incident. While the aircraft sustained substantial damage, there were no injuries.|$|E
500|$|At 1711:01Z, the Lear began a {{right turn}} and descent. NODAK 32 {{airplane}} remained to the west, while TULSA 13 airplane {{broke away from}} the tanker and followed N47BA down. At 1211:26 CDT, the NODAK 32 lead pilot reported, [...] "The target is descending and he is doing multiple aileron rolls, looks like he's out of control...in a severe descent, request an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> to follow target." [...] The TULSA 13 pilot reported, [...] "It's soon to impact the ground; he is in a descending spiral." [...] The fighter planes were forced to break off their pursuit at this point and had to land at local airports, having reached the limit of their endurance.|$|E
500|$|On 17 January 1977, Vulcan B.2 XM600 of No. 101 Squadron crashed near Spilsby, Lincolnshire. During a {{practice}} <b>emergency</b> <b>descent,</b> the bomb bay fire warning light flashed on followed by No.2 engine fire warning light. The captain shut the engine {{down and the}} AEO reported flames coming from the area of No.2 engine, just behind the deployed Ram air turbine (RAT). As the fire intensified, the captain ordered the aircraft to be abandoned. The three rear crew members escaped at around [...] After ordering the co-pilot to eject, the captain ejected at around , as control was lost. The cause was due to arcing on the RAT's electrical terminals, burning a hole in an adjacent fuel pipe and setting the fuel on fire.|$|E
50|$|He was {{a member}} of a test group for the British Gliding Association (BGA) and tested a number of {{prototype}} gliders and foreign machines for approval to be imported. He made a successful <b>emergency</b> parachute <b>descent</b> from a damaged SZD-9 Bocian making him a member of the Caterpillar Club. He researched the effect of sub-gravity sensations as a cause for many serious and fatal gliding accidents.|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of a proposed configuration of a high-speed civil transport was conducted by using NASA and industry research pilots. The assessment was conducted to evaluate operational aspects of the configuration from a pilot's perspective, with the primary goal being to identify potential deficiencies in the configuration. The configuration was evaluated within and at {{the limits of the}} design operating envelope to determine the suitability of the configuration to maneuver in a typical mission as well as in emergency or envelope-limit conditions. The Cooper-Harper rating scale was used to evaluate the flying qualities of the configuration. A summary flying qualities metric was also calculated. The assessment was performed in the Langley six-degree-of-freedom Visual Motion Simulator. The effect of a restricted cockpit field-of-view due to obstruction by the vehicle nose was not included in this study. Tasks include landings, takeoffs, climbs, descents, overspeeds, coordinated turns, and recoveries from envelope limit excursions. Emergencies included engine failures, loss of stability augmentation, engine inlet unstarts, and <b>emergency</b> <b>descents.</b> Minimum control speeds and takeoff decision, rotation, and safety speeds were also determined...|$|R
5|$|Henri L'Estrange, {{known as}} the Australian Blondin, was an Australian {{successful}} funambulist and accident prone aeronautical balloonist. Modelling himself on the famous French wire-walker Charles Blondin, L'Estrange performed a number of tightrope walks in the 1870s, culminating in three walks across Sydney's Middle Harbour in 1877. He remains the only tightrope performer ever to have walked across a part of Sydney Harbour. L'Estrange was an early balloonist, and attempted a series of flights in the early 1880s â€“ one being successful, one ending in Australia's first <b>emergency</b> parachute <b>descent,</b> and the last culminating in a massive fireball causing property damage, personal injury and a human stampede. He tried {{to return to his}} original career of tightrope walking but, with new forms of entertainment, humiliating falls and other Blondin imitators, he found success elusive. Public benefits were held in his honour to recoup financial losses and he dabbled in setting up amusement rides but ultimately he faded from public attention and was last recorded to be living in Fitzroy, Victoria in 1894.|$|R
500|$|L'Estrange survived an {{even more}} {{disastrous}} attempt in Melbourne {{less than six months}} later at the grounds of the Agricultural Society in a balloon named Aurora. Having been supplied with a much higher quality gas from the Metropolitan Gas Company he miscalculated the speed at which the balloon would ascend. Having floated much higher than originally anticipated the balloon greatly expanded and a weak seam in the calico fabric suddenly burst. L'Estrange had {{the presence of mind to}} deploy the silk parachute which slowed the rate of descent. His landing was softened by a tree and although severely shaken, L'Estrange was uninjured. The whole journey took nine minutes. The [...] "catastrophe" [...] was widely reported with the story appearing in local newspapers in Adelaide, Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane within the week. This was the first <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> by parachute in Australia, predating the Caterpillar Club by over 50 years.|$|E
500|$|A sudden {{reduction}} in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew. Above , a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a [...] "time of useful consciousness" [...] up to 10â€“15 seconds for a conditioned athlete. At Concorde's altitude, the air density is very low; {{a breach of}} cabin integrity {{would result in a}} loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them. Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss {{in the event of a}} breach, a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude. The FAA enforces minimum <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> rates for aircraft and noting Concorde's higher operating altitude, concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent. Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks.|$|E

2500|$|While it was {{climbing}} away from Syktyvkar, {{at an altitude}} of , the aircraft's rear cargo hold smoke alarm annunciated. The captain sent the flight engineer to verify the alert. Violating procedure, the captain left the cockpit to investigate with the flight engineer. Having returned to the cockpit, the captain dispatched the first officer to extinguish the fire. The captain then initiated an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> and return to Syktyvkarâ€”which by that time was at a distance of â€”from an altitude of [...] During the <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> the captain and the navigator were in the cockpit, while the flight engineer and the first officer fought the fire. When the aircraft was {{at an altitude of}} [...] the flight engineer and the first officer returned to the cockpit and announced that the fire had not been extinguished, although two fire extinguishers had been deployed. The captain decided to make an immediate forced landing and informed air traffic control of his decision. The smoke in the aircraft cabin induced coughing, suffocation and bleeding from the nasopharynx. Some of the passengers fainted.|$|E

2500|$|Qantas Flight 30 (QF30, QFA30) was a Qantas Boeing 747-438, {{construction}} number 25067, {{registered in}} Australia as VH-OJK. QF30 was a scheduled flight from London Heathrow Airport to Melbourne Airport with a stopover in Hong Kong International Airport on 25 July 2008. [...] The flight was interrupted when an oxygen tank exploded causing a fuselage rupture just {{forward of the}} starboard wing root. There were no injuries and the plane made an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> to a breathable altitude of about 10,000 feet and eventually made an emergency landing at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Metro Manila, Philippines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{depressurization}} {{was caused}} by the structural failure of a lap joint in the fuselage skin due to metal fatigue. The aircraft made an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent,</b> and after landing, was found to have a [...] hole approximately [...] long on top of the fuselage above the passenger cabin. The NTSB investigation revealed evidence of pre-existing fatigue, and determined the probable cause of the incident to be related to an error in the manufacturing process for joining fuselage crown skin panels. This incident led to the FAA increasing the inspection rate of certain airframes. The incident followed a similar one, Southwest Airlines Flight 2294, in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 September 1966 a Vickers Viscount {{departed}} from Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia for a 73-minute flight to Longreach.

[...] The fire spread to the fuel tank and weakened the wing structure so that {{a large part of the}} left wing broke away and the aircraft crashed. [...] All twenty-four occupants were killed. The accident remains the fifth-worst in Australia's civil aviation history.|$|E
2500|$|Flight 812 was a {{domestic}} scheduled passenger flight from Phoenix, Arizona to Sacramento, California. On April 1, 2011, it was carrying five crew and 117 passengers. Takeoff and initial climb-out were normal. As the aircraft approached its cruising altitude, at approximately 15:58 local time (22:57 UTC), while climbing through FL344 to reach FL360, a loud bang was heard, recorded as an unidentified noise on the cockpit voice recorder. According to eyewitnesses, {{one of the}} ceiling panels dislodged. About two seconds later, the captain announced that cabin pressurization had been lost, and called for oxygen masks on. At this point, sounds of increased wind noise were heard on the CVR. Cabin oxygen masks deployed. The captain declared an emergency to air traffic control, and received clearance to make an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent.</b> The pilots performed a rapid descent to , where atmospheric pressure is sufficient to prevent hypoxia. At this point the flight attendants began relaying reports to the pilots of an injury and a [...] "two-foot hole" [...] in the fuselage.

50|$|In 1948, {{while on}} a flight home to New York City, the {{aircraft}} {{that he was on}} entered an emergency decent after the crew mistook an indicator light and released carbon dioxide extinguishers into the baggage compartment. The crew failed to vent the CO-2 from the plane as they were supposed to do in such a situation. The carbon dioxide then leaked into the main cabin of the plane and incapacitated the crew. The crew then became disoriented and declared an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent,</b> not realizing the problem. The aircraft hit power lines in its <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> and burst into flames, killing all 43 people on board.|$|E
50|$|Descents {{are part}} of normal procedures, but also occur during emergencies, such as rapid or {{explosive}} decompression, forcing an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> to below 10000 ft and preferably below 8000 ft, respectively the maximum temporary safe altitude for an unpressurized aircraft and the maximum safe altitude for extended duration.|$|E
50|$|On 22 May, the French {{television}} station M6 reported that, contrary to official statements, {{one of the}} pilots told Cairo air traffic control about smoke in the cabin, and decided to make an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent.</b> Later that day, the report was dismissed as false by the Egyptian Civil Aviation Ministry.|$|E

Two passengers were killed when they were ejected {{through the hole in the}} cabin floor.|$|E
50|$|The {{emergency}} oxygen {{supply in the}} passenger cabin of this model of Boeing 737 is provided by chemical generators that provide enough oxygen, through breathing masks, to sustain consciousness for about 12 minutes, normally sufficient for an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> to 10,000 feet (3,000 m), where atmospheric pressure is sufficient to sustain life without supplemental oxygen. Cabin crew have access to portable oxygen sets with considerably longer duration.|$|E
50|$|If a {{pressurized}} aircraft {{suffers a}} pressurization failure above 10,000 feet (~3,000 meters), then {{it could be}} deemed as an emergency. Should this situation occur, the aircraft should begin an <b>emergency</b> <b>descent</b> and oxygen masks should be activated for all occupants. In the majority of passenger aircraft, the passengers' oxygen masks are activated automatically if the cabin pressure falls below the atmospheric pressure equivalent of 14,000 feet (~4,500 meters).|$|E
