During the public lectures he presented research on valuing sustainable certification and corporate social responsibility using risk/reward options, applying measurement ranges to audit (Confidence Accounting), developing standards markets, liquidity estimation through supply-demand curve prediction, and discerning the role of 'feedforward' in creating leptokurtic market outcomes. [...] During the series he made observations about sustainability, market solutions to social problems, risk, the role of government, the rising paradox of money as a positional good, taxation, long term discount rates, intellectual property managed as an option, corruption, and lotteries as misery indicators.

However, private motopumps tend to be distributed inequitably. This paper investigates the success of explicit pro-poor interventions with emphasis on small-scale irrigation in the semi-arid Limpopo Basin in Mozambique. It reveals that high irrigation costs are progressively excluding the poor, who are unable to generate a cash income from other activities they need to fund irrigation. In addition, the operation of collective schemes involving the poor is being jeopardized by the development of private irrigation schemes, which benefit from <b>hidden</b> <b>subsidies</b> appropriated by local elites. This results in unequal access to irrigation, which can cause resentment at community level. This weakens community cohesiveness, as well as communities' capacities for collective action and coordination, which are crucial for collective irrigation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|Agriculture as {{a source}} of food has a {{substantial}} spillover that affects the Earth's ecosystems. This results in an ‘ecological footprint’ of food: negative environmental impacts per capita. The footprint depends on the dietary choice of types and amounts of food, on the non-consumed part of product flows and its fate (‘waste’ or ‘reused’), on transport and processing along the value chain, on the environmental impacts of production per unit area, and on the area needed per unit product. Yield gaps indicate inefficiency in this last aspect: resource-use efficiency gaps for water and nutrients indicate that environmental impacts per unit area are higher than desirable. Ecological intensification aimed at simultaneously closing these two gaps requires process-level understanding and system-level quantification of current efficiency of the use of land and other production factors at multiple scales (field, farm, landscape, regional and global economy). Contrary to common opinion, yield and efficiency gaps are partially independent in the empirical evidence. Synergy in gap closure is possible in many contexts where efforts are made but are not automatic.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the current}} {{problems of the}} Soviet economy’s reform process. The process of transition {{to a market economy}} in the Soviet Union, where an extreme degree of monopoly prevails, has been characterised by declining production and accelerating inflation. The rapid growth of the market sector in the situation of highly distorted and heavily regulated prices, dominance of state enterprises, and unclear property rights, leads to the concentration of entrepreneurial activity mainly in speculative operations involving the redistribution of state property, to the deterioration of the macroeco-nomic situation and to the deepening of the structural crisis in the economy. In fact, the growth of the market sector is based mainly on <b>hidden</b> <b>subsidies</b> from the state enterprises. The failure of four years of economic reforms is due to inappropriate economic policy based on mythical ideas about the market economy. Rapid, radical reforms, including large-scale privatisation on the basis of development of financial intermediates, are of crucial importance in overcoming the further deterioration of the economic situation and in preventing the collapse of the Soviet economy. The most characteristic feature of structural change in the Soviet economy is its spontaneous, unman-ageable character. None of the officially-adopted programmes of economic reform have bee...|$|R

The analysis demonstrates that the conventional figures for elderly health expenditures in Japan systematically underestimate the real costs by excluding the costs of uninsured services, nursing homes, and home health care. The paper estimates these costs and shows that they add about 10 % to the conventional figure for elderly health care costs in Japan. This inquiry also shows how government policy for health care financing shaped distinctive Japanese patterns of elderly care provision. The financing system provided a <b>hidden</b> <b>subsidy</b> [...] through national health insurance coverage of long-term hospitalization [...] that encouraged high institutionalization rates of elderly in medical facilities. Public financing for long-term elderly hospitalization, however, has not been matched by government attention to quality of care, resulting in serious quality problems and reflecting a social trade-off between cost and quality. Also, until recently the financing system rarely reimbursed home health care, thereby creating strong disincentives {{to the development of}} formal home health care services. This analysis has important implications for reforms now being considered by the Japanese government in the financing and provision of health care for the elderly, especially the limitations of relying on reimbursement price policy.

40|$|In the administration, planning, design, and {{maintenance}} of road systems, transportation professionals often need to choose between alternatives, justify decisions, evaluate tradeoffs, determine how much to spend, set priorities, assess how well the network meets traveler needs, and communicate the basis for their actions to others. A variety of technical guidelines, tools, and methods {{have been developed to}} help with these activities. Such work aids include design criteria guidelines, design exception analysis methods, needs studies, revenue allocation schemes, regional planning guides, designation of minimum standards, sufficiency ratings, management systems, point based systems to determine eligibility for paving, functional classification, and bridge ratings. While such tools play valuable roles, they also manifest a number of deficiencies and are poorly integrated. Design guides tell what solutions MAY be used, they aren't oriented towards helping find which one SHOULD be used. Design exception methods help justify deviation from design guide requirements but omit consideration of important factors. Resource distribution is too often based on dividing up what's available rather than helping determine how much should be spent. Point systems serve well as procedural tools but are employed primarily to justify decisions that have already been made. In addition, the tools aren't very scalable: a system level method of analysis seldom works at the project level and vice versa. In conjunction with the issues cited above, the operation and financing of the road and highway system is often the subject of criticisms that raise fundamental questions: What {{is the best way to}} determine how much money should be spent on a city or a county's road network? Is the size and quality of the rural road system appropriate? Is too much or too little money spent on road work? What parts of the system should be upgraded and in what sequence? Do truckers receive a <b>hidden</b> <b>subsidy</b> from other motorists? Do transportation professions evaluate road situations from too narrow of a perspective? In considering the issues and questions the author concluded that it would be of value if one could identify and develop a new method that would overcome the shortcomings of existing methods, be scalable, be capable of being understood by the general public, and utilize a broad viewpoint. After trying out a number of concepts, it appeared that a good approach would be to view the road network as a sub-component of a much larger system that also includes vehicles, people, goods-in-transit, and all the ancillary items needed to make the system function. Highway investment decisions could then be made on the basis of how they affect the total cost of operating the total system. A concept, named the "Total Cost of Transportation" method, was then developed and tested. The concept rests on four key principles: 1) that roads are but one sub-system of a much larger 'Road Based Transportation System', 2) that the size and activity level of the overall system are determined by market forces, 3) that the sum of everything expended, consumed, given up, or permanently reserved in building the system and generating the activity that results from the market forces represents the total cost of transportation, and 4) that the economic purpose of making road improvements is to minimize that total cost. To test the practical value of the theory, a special database and spreadsheet model of Iowa's county road network was developed. This involved creating a physical model to represent the size, characteristics, activity levels, and the rates at which the activities take place, developing a companion economic cost model, then using the two in tandem to explore a variety of issues. Ultimately, the theory and model proved capable of being used in full system, partial system, single segment, project, and general design guide levels of analysis. The method appeared to be capable of remedying many of the existing work method defects and to answer society's transportation questions from a new perspective...|$|E

The first measure, implemented in 1939 and 1940, was granting tax reliefs to exporters of several cork products; its impact on commercial traffic of cork was very low. The second measure was the establishment, between 1946 and 1950, of a subsidies system for cork exports, which allowed the recovery of the Spanish cork exports. Yet, these were classified as dumping by the United States and created a trade conflict, which forced its repeal. Immediately after this repeal, cork products were incorporated into the multiple exchange rates mechanism in force in Spain since 1948, a system of <b>hidden</b> <b>subsidies</b> that allowed an improvement in cork exports during the 1950 's.
