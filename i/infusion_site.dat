40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{emergent}} intravenous {{access is}} not available an intraosseous (IO) infusion is performed. To accurately perform an IO infusion the provider must precisely palpate and identify the associated anatomical landmark for placement. A thicker layer of subcutaneous tissue over the insertion site can make this process difficult, therefore, leading to {{an increased risk of}} misplacement and dislodgment. PURPOSE: To identify and rank the depth of subcutaneous tissues overlying each IO <b>infusion</b> insertion <b>sites,</b> to better understand where to attempt IO placement first, in relation to subcutaneous tissue depth. The hypothesis to relate the subcutaneous tissue depth with the level of obesity was tested. SUBJECTS: Male and female cadavers (n= 22) between the ages of 54 - 95 years old were provided by the Willed Body Program in association with Michigan State University College of Human Medicine in Grand Rapids, MI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Subcutaneous tissue depth was measured by the insertion of a taper gauge into the skin over six IO <b>infusion</b> <b>sites.</b> Five bilateral skinfold measurements per cadaver were taken using a Lange skinfold caliper to obtain percent body fat which was converted into level of obesity. RESULTS: The distal tibia has the thinnest subcutaneous tissue depth, whereas, the calcaneus has the thickest. There is a correlation between increased subcutaneous tissue depth and increase percent body fat and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that an increase of subcutaneous tissue depth correlates with an increased range of obesity. When assessing where to place an IO <b>infusion,</b> <b>sites</b> with the least amount of subcutaneous tissue should be considered first, with consideration of injuries...|$|R

Our aim was to compare the hormonal, glycemic and appetite responses to different sites of glucose delivery. METHODS: Ten healthy males were each studied twice, in randomized order. A catheter was positioned with openings 15 cm beyond the pylorus ("duodenal"), and 100 cm beyond ("mid-jejunal"). On one day, glucose was infused into the duodenum (1 kcal/min) and saline into the mid-jejunum, for 90 min. On the other day, the <b>infusion</b> <b>sites</b> were reversed. Blood was sampled frequently, and hunger was scored by questionnaires. The tube was removed and energy intake measured from a buffet meal. RESULTS: Stimulation of CCK and suppression of hunger were greater (each P< 0. 05), and energy intake less (P= 0. 05), with duodenal compared to mid-jejunal glucose infusion. Blood glucose, GIP, and insulin did not differ, and there was minimal GLP- 1 increment on either day.

In the present study, we infused U 50, 488 into the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) and investigated the effects of this drug on behavior and heart rate of 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -week-old rats. U 50, 488 increased activity most potently in 1 - and 2 -week-old subjects. Ultrasonic vocali-zation (USV) production was increased in 1 -week-old subjects, but not in 2 - or 3 -week-old pups. Heart rate changes were similarly seen in younger aged subjects. At 1 week, U 50, 488 decreased heart rate, but at 2 weeks it increased heart rate. There was no effect of this drug on heart rate at 3 weeks.

Stage 1, 85 % of the subjects aged > 12 years and 93 % of the subjects aged < 12 years achieved IgG levels ≥ 6 and ≥ 4 g/L, respectively at all observations. There were 3. 62 infections/patient/year during Subgam treatment. The most common product-related events were <b>infusion</b> <b>site</b> reactions (50 % of patients). Recent post-hoc pharmacokinetics analysis of the post-infusion serum total IgG concentration indicated that the mean dose-normalised incremental IgG AUCτ following intravenous dosing (120. 5 g. day/L) was 1. 64 -fold that of the dose-normalised mean incremental IgG AUCτ following subcutaneous dosing (73. 6 g. day/L), corresponding to an estimated IgG bioavailability for subcutaneous dosing of 61 %. Only 34 post-licensing adverse reactions have been received in 30 patients over a period of 10 years; fourteen were classed as serious as defined by the ICH guidelines on good clinical practice. The most common post-licensing adverse reaction was <b>infusion</b> <b>site</b> reaction (7 reports).

40|$|Background: Subcutaneous {{immunoglobulin}} (IGSC) {{replacement therapy}} for primary immunodeficiency (PI) is equally efficacious to intravenous immunoglobulin (IGIV), induces fewer systemic reactions, {{and may be}} self-infused. Limited SC infusion volumes and reduced bioavailability, however, necessitate multiple <b>infusion</b> <b>sites,</b> more frequent treatment, and dose adjustment to achieve pharmacokinetic equivalence. Recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH 20) increases SC tissue permeability and facilitates dispersion and absorption, enabling administration of monthly doses in one site. Objective: This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of rHuPH 20 -facilitated IGSC (IGHy) in patients with PI. Methods: In this open-label, multicenter phase III study, 87 patients with PI aged ≥ 2 years received 10 % IGIV for 3 months, then IGHy (n 5 83) for approximately 14 to 18 months at 108 % of the IGIV dose. IGHy infusions began weekly, increasing to 3 - or 4 -week intervals. Results: The majority (94. 0 %) of IGHy infusions were administered every 3 or 4 weeks, using one site (median, 1. 09 / month), with a mean volume of 292. 2 mL. The bioavailability of IGHy measured by area under the concentration versus time curve was 93. 3 % of IGIV, which is pharmacokinetically equivalent. Systemic reactions were less frequent with IGHy than with IGIV (8. 3 % vs 25. 0 % of infusions). Local reactions to IGHy were generally mild to moderate, with a rate of 0. 203 per infusion. The acute serious bacterial infection rate per subjectyear for IGHy was low (0. 025; upper 99 % CI limit, 0. 046). Overall infection rates per subject-year were 2. 97 for IGHy and 4. 51 for IGIV. Conclusion: IGHy was effective, safe, and pharmacokinetically equivalent to IGIV at the same administration intervals, but it caused fewer systemic reactions. Tolerability was good despite high infusion volumes and rates. © 2012 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology...|$|R
40|$|Background: It is {{well known}} that opioids induce coughing. Many drugs such as {{lidocaine}} and ketamine are used to effectively prevent the coughing induced by opioids and this has been revealed to be effective. In this study, we evaluated the preventive effect of a graded escalation of the remifentanil concentration using a target controlled infusion pump and we compared this with the effect of lidocaine. Methods: One hundred fifty ASA I and II patients who were scheduled for elective surgery were randomly divided into 3 groups. The patients were pretreated with 2 % lidocaine 1 mg/kg (Group L) or saline (Group S) and remifentanil <b>infusion</b> (an effect <b>site</b> concentration of 4. 0 ng/ml) was followed 1 minute later by using a target controlled infusion pump. Group R was pretreated with saline and this was followed by remifentanil <b>infusion</b> (effect <b>site</b> concentration of 2. 0 ng/ml at first and then it was reset to 4. 0 ng/ml). We evaluated the incidence, severity and onset time of cough after remifentanil infusion. Results: The incidence of coughing was significantly decreased in Group R (6 cases, 12 %) and Group L (7 cases, 14 %), as compared to that of Group S (17 cases, 34 %) (P < 0. 05), but {{there was no significant difference}} between Group R and Group L. The groups showed no significant difference in the severity and the onset time of coughing. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that administering graded escalation of the remifentanil concentration suppresses remifentanil-induced coughing as effectively as lidocaine 1 mg/kg pretreatment.
