500|$|The {{majority}} of both teams' supporters reacted negatively to the merger proposal. While many Oxford supporters acknowledged that Maxwell had {{been instrumental in}} saving the club the previous year, most perceived merging with another club as tantamount to killing both Oxford United and professional football in the city. A spokesman for the Oxford United Supporters Club called the idea [...] "crazy and unworkable". Most Reading fans likewise reacted to the scheme with revulsion; Mike Habbits, chairman of the Reading Supporters Club, said [...] "Our fans can't stand Oxford fans and I can't see them travelling to Oxford to watch the new team". Supporters and pressmen alike ridiculed the [...] "Thames Valley Royals" [...] name, which the sports historian John Bale later described as [...] "mid-Atlantic"; observers at the time variously perceived it as sounding more like an American football, ice hockey or speedway team than a football club. Some Oxford fans supported Maxwell's proposal, saying that with a new stadium and the pooled financial resources of Oxford and Reading, an amalgamated team might be successful, but these were a minority. One angry fan wrote to the Oxford Mail that [...] "I will not follow Thames Valley Royals or whatever their name <b>is</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> played {{at the end of}} my street".|$|E
