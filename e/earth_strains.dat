40|$|International audienceSensitive {{instruments}} like strainmeters and tiltmeters {{are necessary}} for measuring slowly varying low amplitude Earth deformations. Nonetheless, laser and fibre interferometers are particularly suitable for interrogating such instruments due to their extreme precision and accuracy. In this paper, a practical design of a simple pendulum borehole tiltmeter based on laser fibre interferometric displacement sensors is presented. A prototype instrument has been constructed using welded borosilicate with a pendulum length of 0. 85 m resulting in a main resonance frequency of 0. 6 Hz. By implementing three coplanar extrinsic fibre Fabry-Perot in-terferometric probes and appropriate signal filtering, our instrument provides tilt measurements that are insensitive to parasitic deformations caused by temperature and pressure variations. This prototype has been installed in an underground facility (Rustrel, France) where results show accurate measurements of <b>Earth</b> <b>strains</b> derived from Earth and ocean tides, local hydro-logic effects, {{as well as local}} and remote earthquakes. The large dynamic range and the high sensitivity of this tiltmeter render it an invaluable tool for numerous geophysical applications such as transient fault motion, volcanic strain and reservoir monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{there are}} two types of {{measurements}} that are routinely used to monitor global and regional seismic wave fields. Standard inertial seismometers measure three components of translational ground displacement (velocity, acceleration) and form the basis for monitoring seismic activity and ground motion. The second type aims at measuring the deformation of the <b>Earth</b> (<b>strains).</b> It has been noted for decades (Aki and Richards, 2002, and previous edition) that there is a third type of measurement that is needed in seismology and geodesy in order to fully describe the motion at a given point, namely the measurement of ground rotation. The three components of seismically induced rotation have been extremely difficult to measure, primarily because previous devices did not provide the required sensitivity to observe rotations in a wide frequency band and distance range. The rotational motion amplitudes were expected to be small even in the vicinity of faults (Bouchon and Aki, 1982) whereas there is growing evidence that these amplitudes have been underestimated. Following the pioneering observations with ring laser rotation sensor in Christchurch, New Zealand (Pancha et al., 2000, McLeod et al., 1998) a ring laser for the observations of the Earth’s rotation rate located at Wettzell, Germany (Schreiber et al., 2006, 2009) was adapted to the sampling rate requirements in seismology allowing the observations of earthquake-induced rotational ground motions over a wide magnitude and epicentral distance range (Igel et al., 2005, 2007, Cochard et al., 2006).

40|$|The {{response}} of hitherto known practical forms of seismographs {{depends upon the}} relative motion of a pendulum and the moving ground to which its supporting structure is fastened. The various kinds of seismographs differ {{in the type of}} pendulum used, such as gravity, spring, torsion, and/or they differ in the type of magnifying and recording elements which they employ. They all measure or indicate the vibratory motion of the ground at a giver point. In contrast to these earlier forms, the strain seismograph is a nonpendular instrument. It does not respond directly to vibratory movements Its operation depends upon variations in the distance between two points of the ground. Such variations or linear strains are set up by seismic waves. A schematic drawing of the seismometer is shown in figure 1. A and B are two piers separated by a distance of 20 meters. One end of the rod R is rigidly fastened to the pier B. The other end extends to within a short distance of pier A. <b>Earth</b> <b>strains</b> resulting from a seismic wave train produce variations in the separation of the two piers, and these variations are observable as changes in the distance between the free end of the rod and pier A. These small movements {{of the end of the}} rod relative to the adjacent pier actuate an electromechanical transducer which generates an e. m. f, proportional to the rate of change of the relative displacement. Recording is accomplished by means of galvanometers. A photograph of the seismometer is reproduced in figure 2...|$|E
40|$|A ring laser {{gyroscope}} (gyro) {{is an active}} laser interferometer designed to sense rotation through the Sagnac frequency shift encountered by two beams travelling in opposite directions around a closed path. The classes of devices considered in this thesis are the large and ultra-large ring laser gyros. These instruments are designed for direct measurement of earth rotation rate and find applications in geodesy, geophysics, and tests of physical theories. The research presented in this thesis focuses on the demonstration of new techniques for operating ring laser gyros. The main goal of these techniques has been the correction for variations in the geometry of an ultra-large ring laser gyro, UG- 3. This instrument is a 77 m perimeter ultra-large ring laser gyro of heterolithic construction and is the primary instrument used in the experiments presented here. UG- 3 {{has been used to}} demonstrate measurement of <b>earth</b> <b>strains</b> which have been used to correct for changes in the geometry of the instrument. It has also been used to demonstrate a control technique where the co-rotating beams were alternately offset allowing the number of wavelengths around the perimeter to be counted and a Sagnac rotation signal to be obtained. Among the most important outcomes of this research of interest to the large ring laser gyro community is that we now understand most of the problems that would affect a next generation ring laser gyro. This understanding allows us to choose an operational technique best suited to the measurements being made and thus maximise the scientific potential of the instrument. Additionally, {{the development of a new}} standard for data storage and an associated suite of software to acquire, query and analyse ring laser data is expected to improve collaboration with the wider research community. Other research outcomes of more general interest include the analysis of how oscillation of a single mode is established in a high finesse laser cavity. We demonstrate that the ultimate mode of operation can be selected with a ‘seed’ beam of exceptionally low intensity. An interesting related outcome is the demonstration of Sagnac beat frequency measurement during the ring down of a ring cavity, a type of measurement immune to dispersive and flow related frequency shifts...|$|E
40|$|Current {{techniques}} for manual and automated determination of decametre-range are reviewed from information gained by extensive literature search and from visits {{made to a}} wide cross section of European establishments concerned with large-scale dimensional measurements. The reviews, which contain nearly 200 references, provide background information needed by systems designers. A 12 m steel measuring base is described which was length stabilised to within 3 parts in 10 for periods in excess of 500 hours. Temperature of the internal water flow is monitored by a contact thermometer which controls the heat input. The {{theory and practice of}} tensioned-wire dimensional transducers are given which enables this new-class of dimensional measuring instrument to be designed. Two distinct groups of instrument described are those for transducing continuous length changes into electrical signals with better than 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 error and those for detecting changes of 1 part in 10 ^ 10 or smaller, of a nominally fixed length. Continuous subdivision transducers with 12 m and 1 m range are reported which incorporate mechanical mechanisms for obtaining adjustable absolute length, reduction of in-scale accuracy, errors, linear rotary output, rapid following response and simple temperature compensation. A method and practical apparatus are described which uses this type of transducer for automatic control of the position of a workhea moved on a cartesian-frame manipulator. Actual two-dimensional position is measured on a trilateral basis, a technique which eliminates the need for a massive framework when machining or inspecting large workpieces. In-situ numerically-controlled machining is possible with this system. A second frameless technique is described for automatically recording roundness variations of large rings or spigots. Repeatability of 5 parts in 10 ^ 6 or better has been proven to be possible with inexpensive equipment. This method illustrates the use of deformation wire-transducers for dynamic dimensional measurement. A similar type of instrument was used for creep determination of invariwires and carbon-fibres supported on the 12 m base. Results are given which have shown that 1 part in 10 ^ 8 length stability is attainable over considerable periods. It is shown that measurement of <b>earth</b> <b>strains</b> is possible with an invar wire tensioned by a simple beam-balance.

The body wave parts of the strain seismograms from 14 earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 4. 7 to 7. 7 recorded by the system were compared with the synthetic strain seismograms generat-ed by a point shear dislocation in an infinite homogeneous medium. The waveform and amplitude of the observed strain seismogram could be well explained by the synthetic one calculated for appropriate source parameters deduced from the conven-tional method. Based on this result it can be shown that the period of the observed S-wave approximately represents the source process time of an earthquake and the S-wave amplitude is proportional to the seismic moment of the event. The seismic moment (Mo: dgne • cm) of the earthquake can be estimated within a factor of 2 from the amplitude (e,: 10 - 9 strain) and period (1 'e: sec) of the S-wave observed at the hypocentral distance (r: km) using the following equation, Mo = 4. 5 X 1019 • e, • r 1 '~.

This work presents the development and results from four new systems: one in atmospheric acoustics and three in <b>Earth</b> <b>strain.</b> Turbulent pressure fluctuations (wind noise) are a significant limiting factor in low-frequency atmospheric acoustic measurements. The Optical Fiber Infrasound Sensor (OFIS) provides an alternative to traditional infrasonic wind noise reduction (WNR) techniques by providing an instantaneous average over a large spatial extent. This study shows that linear OFISs ranging in length from 30 to 270 m provide a WNR of up to 30 dB in winds up to 5 m/s, in good agreement with a new analytical model. Arrays of optical fiber strainmeters were deployed to measure sediment compaction at two sites in Bangladesh. One array at Jamalganj (in the north) consists of 20, 40, 60, and 100 m long strainmeters, while the second near Khulna (in the south) also includes lengths of 80 and 300 m. Two years of weekly measurements show a clear seasonal signal and subsidence at both sites that is in reasonable agreement with collocated GPS receivers. A new 250 -meter, interferometric vertical borehole strainmeter has been developed based completely on passive optical components. Details of the prototyping, design, and deployment at the Piñon Flat Observatory (PFO) are presented.

[...] The bomb destroys the alternate Earth, killing Owlman in the process. Batman returns to the Syndicate's <b>Earth,</b> where the <b>strain</b> of acting as a vibratory conduit has aged Johnny Quick to near death. Before dying, Johnny correctly deduces Batman lied about Flash not being fast enough and knew what would happen. Despite this, he shows no ill will toward Batman, dying with a smile. Martian Manhunter returns, accompanied by President Wilson and the U.S. Marines, and together they arrest Ultraman, Superwoman, and Power Ring.|$|R
40|$|<b>Earth</b> tidal <b>strains</b> {{observed}} concurrently at two {{stations in}} the western Chubu region have been analyzed {{to see if there}} are any temporal variations of their amplitude in relation to major earthquakes in the region. The tidal strain records obtained at Kamitakara during 7 years and at Inuyama during 2 years are bandpass-filtered, and correlated with the corresponding theoretical tidal function predicted for a solid earth, using least squares mainly in the time domain, to estimate the tidal admittance over the periods. The admittances determined for the two-component Kamitakara strains appear to show a consistent and gradual increase during 10 - 11 months prior to the central Gifu earthquake of 1969 (M= 6. 6), with a maximum variation reaching about 15 %, and after the earthquake they seem to decrease and recover their normal value a half year later. No such significant variations as in this period can be found over the entire period. The resolved amplitudes of the semidiurnal M 2 and diurnal O 1 waves show similar trends. The results from the Inuyama observations involve somewhat larger fluctuations, but appear to reach a peak 3 - 4 months before the earthquake and then decrease to the time of its occurrence. Secular strains and tilts observed at the above two stations also indicate appreciable changes during the corresponding periods. If these temporal variations of the tidal strain amplitudes are not spurious but real phenomena, they might be interpreted as a manifestation of some precursory changes in crustal rigidity around the seismic source region...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAfter {{giving a}} {{complete}} analytical {{solution for the}} strain softening model associated to Mohr-Coulomb non associated elasto-plastic flow rule (MC-model), the paper demonstrates that this rheology possesses a finite limit load which allows solving for strength drop as a boundary value problem. The MC-model produces a non-dimensional strength drop, which depends on three parameters: {{the orientation of the}} shear band versus the least principal stress axis outside the band a 0, the peak friction angle f and the dilatation angle Y. The maximum reduction of strength obtained with that strain-softening model is on the order of the confining stress p 0. For this weakest regime, the effective friction of the shear band drops from µ ini = 0. 85 at peak to µ ss = 0. 64 {{at the end of the}} softening phase. In this model, which con-siders thick shear bands, the weakest regime is not obtained for an orientation corresponding to the exact Coulomb ori-entation. Instead, the orientation of the weakest shear zone systematically deviates from the coulomb orientation by an angle, which rises with its internal friction angle. The characteristic shear strain needed to achieve steady state is quanti-fied semi analytically and in the range of parameters valid for <b>Earth,</b> this <b>strain</b> is found to be of the order of 7 - 8 %. These numbers are typical of what is observed in the laboratory, which give us confidence on that MC-model is a good and probably the simplest model to localize strain in numerical codes aimed at modeling the brittle part of the Earth.

40|$|Seismographs near Mount St. Helens Volcano {{recorded}} {{an earthquake}} swarm lasting nearly 2 {{months prior to}} the catastrophic May 18, 1980, eruption. The earthquakes are divided into four classes based on station CPW (Δ = 116 km) seismogram characteristics: (1) events with Sv:P amplitude ratio 3 ̆e 3 and dominant frequency 3 ̆e 3 Hz; (2) events with Sv:P ratio between 1 and 3 and dominant frequency 3 ̆e 2 Hz; (3) events similar to characteristic 2 but with a strong (probably surface wave) phase just after the S phase; and (4) events with frequencies between 1 and 2 Hz lacking a clear S phase. The seismicity pattern {{for each of the four}} classes is unique, and we assume each group of events with similar wave-forms represents a common physical process, depth, source area, or fault orientation. Maximum likelihood b values range between 0. 97 ± 0. 05 and 1. 81 ± 0. 09 for the four groups. We calculate solid <b>earth</b> stress and <b>strain</b> tides at the average hypocentral depth of 4 km.
