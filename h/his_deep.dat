5|$|Tony Todd, {{who played}} Candyman in the 1992 film Candyman, was cast as {{mortician}} William Bludworth. Morgan initially wanted Todd {{for the role}} because he felt <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> voice would give the film an eerie tone.|$|E
5|$|During {{this period}} Gaudí perfected his {{personal}} style, {{inspired by the}} organic shapes of nature, putting into practise {{a whole series of}} new structural solutions originating from <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> analysis of ruled geometry. To this he added a great creative freedom and an imaginative ornamental style. His works acquired a great structural richness, with shapes and volumes devoid of rational rigidity or any classic premise.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Miller (1802–56) from Cromarty was a stonemason and self-taught geologist. His 1841 {{publication}} The Old Red Sandstone {{became a}} bestseller.

5|$|At 1:00 pm on December 10, General Matsui {{ordered all}} units {{to launch a}} {{full-scale}} attack on Nanking. That day the SEA assaulted China's super-elite Training Brigade on the peaks of Zijinshan, which dominate Nanking's northeast horizon. Clambering up the ridges of the mountain, {{the men of the}} SEA had to painstakingly wrest control of each Chinese encampment one by one in bloody infantry charges. Advancing along the south side of Zijinshan was no easier as General Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there due to <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> conviction that no damage should come to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Black Elk (Lakota) was a {{medicine}} man and heyokha, whose life spanned {{the transition to}} reservations. His accounts of the 19th-century Indian Wars and Ghost Dance movement, and <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> thoughts on personal visions and Native American religion, {{form the basis of}} the book Black Elk Speaks, first published in 1932. (Among several editions, a premier annotated edition was published in 2008.) Paul Goble, an award-winning children's book author and illustrator, has been based in the Black Hills since 1977.|$|E
5|$|Himmler was a main {{architect}} of the Holocaust, using <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> belief in the racist Nazi ideology to justify the murder of millions of victims. The Nazis planned to kill Polish intellectuals and restrict non-Germans in the General Government and conquered territories to a fourth-grade education. The Nazis wanted to breed a master race of racially pure Nordic Aryans in Germany. As an agronomist and farmer Himmler was acquainted {{with the principles of}} selective breeding, which he proposed to apply to humans. He believed that he could engineer the German populace, for example, through eugenics, to be Nordic in appearance within several decades {{of the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|In April 2006 Gillan {{released}} a CD/multimedia project to document his 44-year career called Gillan's Inn. Tony Iommi, Jeff Healey, Joe Satriani, Dean Howard, {{as well as}} current and former members of Deep Purple such as Jon Lord, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, Don Airey and Steve Morse are featured on this 2006 CD and DVD. The project, produced by Nick Blagona, includes a re-recorded selection of <b>his</b> <b>Deep</b> Purple, Black Sabbath and solo tracks. At {{the same time as}} Gillan's Inn, Gillan announced that his solo albums with the Ian Gillan Band and Gillan from the 1970s and 1980s would be re-issued late in 2006 and early 2007 through Demon Records.|$|E
5|$|Queen Gertrude showed blatant favoritism {{towards her}} German {{relatives}} and courtiers, causing widespread discontent among the native lords. Taking {{advantage of her}} husband's campaign in the distant Principality of Halych, a group of aggrieved noblemen seized and murdered her in the forests of the Pilis Hills on 28 September 1213. King Andrew only punished one of the conspirators, a certain Count Peter, after his return from Halych. Although Béla was a child when his mother was assassinated, he never forgot her and declared <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> respect for her in many of his royal charters. In his correspondence with his sister, the noted Franciscan saint, Elizabeth of Hungary, he was often counseled to restrain his anger at the nobles {{for the death of}} their mother.|$|E

5|$|A seventh-century work, the Sandong Zhunang ("Pearly Bag of the Three Caverns"), embellished the {{relationship}} between Laozi and Yinxi. Laozi pretended to be a farmer when reaching the western gate, but was recognized by Yinxi, who asked to be taught by the great master. Laozi was not satisfied by simply being noticed by the guard and demanded an explanation. Yinxi expressed <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> desire to find the Tao and explained that his long study of astrology allowed him to recognize Laozi's approach. Yinxi was accepted by Laozi as a disciple. This is considered an exemplary interaction between Daoist master and disciple, reflecting the testing a seeker must undergo before being accepted. A would-be adherent is expected to prove his determination and talent, clearly expressing his wishes and showing {{that he had made}} progress on his own towards realizing the Tao.|$|E
5|$|As Crown Prince Nguyen Canh {{had died}} of {{smallpox}} during {{the war against the}} Tây Sơn, it was assumed that Canh's son would succeed Gia Long as emperor, but in 1816 Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, the son of his second wife, was appointed instead, and ruled as Minh Mạng. Gia Long chose him for his strong character and <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> aversion to westerners, whereas Canh's lineage had converted to Catholicism and were reluctant to maintain their Confucian traditions such as ancestor worship. Before his accession, Nguyễn Phúc Đảm was reported to have praised the Japanese for having expelled and eradicated Christianity from their country. Gia Long told his son to treat the Europeans respectfully, especially the French, but not to grant them any position of preponderance. Gia Long died on 3 February 1820 and was buried at the Thien Tho Tomb and posthumously named Thế Tổ Cao Hoàng đế.|$|E
5|$|Piso {{was rumored}} to have been {{responsible}} for his death and with accusations coming in it wasn't long before the well known accuser, Lucius Fulcinius Trio, brought charges against him. The Pisones were longtime supporters of the Claudians, and had allied themselves with Octavian early on. The continued support of the Pisones and his own friendship to Piso made him hesitant to hear the case himself. After briefly hearing both sides, Tiberius deferred the case to the Senate, making no effort to hide <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> anger toward Piso. Tiberius made allowances for Piso to summon witnesses of all social orders, including slaves, and he was given more time to plea than the prosecutors, but it made no difference: before the trial was over Piso died ostensibly by suicide, but Tacitus supposes Tiberius may have had him murdered before he could implicate the emperor in Germanicus' death.|$|E

5|$|York moved {{two points}} above the relegation zone with a 3–0 away win over Cambridge, Fletcher giving York {{the lead on}} 43 minutes after {{collecting}} a loose ball {{on the edge of}} the penalty area and scoring with a powerful shot. Coulson scored soon after the second half began when <b>his</b> <b>deep</b> cross dropped into the far corner of the goal, and Hyde finished the scoring in the 55th minute when diverting Fletcher's shot from inside the six-yard box. York went behind away to AFC Wimbledon when Deji Oshilaja scored a header in the 19th minute, before Hyde scored an equaliser after goalkeeper Joe McDonnell dropped Sinclair's cross in the 43rd minute. However, Jack Smith scored the winning goal for the home team with a volley in the 90th minute, meaning the match ended in a 2–1 win for AFC Wimbledon. Shaq Coulthirst, who scored Southend's winning goal against York in January, joined on loan from Tottenham Hotspur for the rest of the season, after Fletcher was ruled out for six weeks with a hamstring injury. York drew 0–0 at home to relegation rivals Carlisle, and the team's best chances came in the 74th minute when Coulson and Sinclair had shots cleared off the line. Having made nine appearances for York, Benning was recalled by Walsall due to an injury to Andy Taylor. Tom Soares scored early as York were beaten 1–0 at home by Bury, resulting in the team only being above the relegation zone on goal difference.|$|E
