25|$|Why did {{the date}} of Benjamin Britten's death – 4 December 1976 – touch such a chord in me? During this time I was {{obviously}} {{at the point where}} I could recognise the magnitude of such a loss. Inexplicable feelings of guilt, more than that even, arose in me. I had just discovered Britten for myself. Just before his death I began to appreciate the unusual purity of his music – I had had the impression of the same kind of purity in the ballads of Guillaume de Machaut. And besides, for a long time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> meet Britten personally – and now it would not come to that.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{the return of}} Black's near-psychic visions; a phenomenon which had been used with much less frequency in the second season. Executive producer Glen Morgan begrudgingly allowed Maher and Reindl to show the ability in this episode, saying [...] "I felt last year those visions were a cheat. The camera {{would go to a}} coffee cup and Frank would say, 'The murderer used a coffee cup.' It drove me nuts. What we were trying to do this year was elevate Frank's visions to a dream-like state, so he would have to interpret what he's seeing. There would be more mystical, symbolic imagery that might give him more of a sense of what's going on. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> strip away the gift {{for a long time and}} see if the show really played without it. But we got back into that".|$|E
2500|$|On September 18, 2015, T.I. {{announced}} his departure from Columbia Records. In {{an interview with}} HitsDailyDouble.com, he addressed his situation: [...] "Having just exited my deal at Columbia, I was a rogue artist, busting creativity, just waiting to put music in the marketplace, so while I'm sorting out my next situation, I'm blessed {{enough to be able}} to control my destiny and put music out as quickly as I want to, and was able to release a Tip album, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do for a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vyjayanthimala {{commented that}} [...] "his {{death is a}} big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't {{have the chance to}} work with him because he came much later. I {{remember}} when he came to Chennai for some film shoot, the college girls went crazy {{to catch a glimpse of}} him when he was going to his studio." [...] Manna Dey said: [...] "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity." [...] Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. [...] "We had met several times. Once <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> cast him in one of my films, but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|Koceski was {{recruited}} {{as a football}} player by Pitt, Penn State, Army, Navy, Notre Dame, Alabama, Tennessee, and Columbia, but he chose the University of Michigan. [...] In a 1948 interview, Koceski explained his selection of Michigan, [...] "Ever since I was {{in the sixth grade}} at First Ward public school, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go to Michigan. [...] It seemed {{too good to be true}} when they accepted me." [...] In 1947, he played on the freshman team coached by Wally Weber. [...] Koceski joined the varsity team in 1948 and helped the Wolverines to an undefeated season and national championship. [...] In Michigan's 28–0 victory over Northwestern in 1948, Koceski scored three touchdowns. [...] Michigan's fourth touchdown in the Northwestern game resulted from a Koceski fumble as he crossed the goal line, with the ball being recovered in the end zone by teammate Bob Erben. [...] Following the Northwestern game, the Associated Press wrote:"Koceski carried the ball only six times for 20 yards, a running figure exceeded by both Ortmann and End Dick Rifenburg, but the little right halfback who stepped into the man-sized shoes of the departed Bump Elliott and fills 'em like they were made for him caught three passes for 40 yards more." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a May 17, 2010 {{article in}} The Daily Bruin, writer Tyler Dosaj noted that numbers of both {{supporters}} and {{critics of the}} protest movement were increasing: [...] "The Facebook group is 35,000 strong. To compare, the anti-Draw Mohammed Day group is almost 30,000 strong. Both are gaining members rapidly." [...] In a May 18, 2010 article, [...] "Why We're Having an Everybody Draw Mohammed Contest on Thursday May 20", Reason editor Nick Gillespie explained: [...] "No one {{has a right to}} an audience or even to a sympathetic hearing, much less an engaged audience. But no one should be beaten or killed or imprisoned simply for speaking their mind or praying to one god as opposed to the other or none at all or getting on with the small business of living their life in peaceful fashion. If we cannot or will not defend that principle with a full throat, then we deserve to choke on whatever jihadists of all stripes can force down our throats." [...] Gillespie asserted, [...] "Our Draw Mohammed contest is not a frivolous exercise of hip, ironic, hoolarious sacrilege toward a minority religion in the United States (though even that deserves all the protection that the most serioso political commentary commands). It's a defense of what {{is at the core of}} a society that is painfully incompetent at delivering on its promise of freedom, tolerance, and equal rights." [...] As May 20, 2010, came closer, Molly Norris stated she was staying away from being directly involved in the protest movement. Norris told Dave Ross, [...] "I'm against my own concept becoming a reality.... If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be taken seriously, I would be thrilled, but now I'm horrified because people did take it as an actual day. The one-off cartoon is not good as a long term plan because it's offensive." [...] Fox News Channel reported that on May 19, 2010, a Facebook group supporting the protest movement had 41,000 members, and The Register reported this increased to 43,000 the same day. Norris told Fox News Channel in a statement on May 19, [...] "It's turned into something completely different, nothing I could've imagined it morphing into. I'm happy some people are talking, because obviously this needs to be addressed." [...] By May 20, the Toronto Sun reported that both the [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] group and the [...] "Against 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'" [...] Facebook group protesting against the initiative had attracted more than 100,000 supporters, at 101,870 members and 106,000 members respectively.|$|E

6000|$|... "You can't. You must {{listen to}} me first. I came here <b>to</b> say what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> tell you for a long time. I love you, and I ask you to marry me." ...|$|R

60|$|I kind of dodged, and the boot-jack {{broke the}} looking-glass. I could have {{waited to see}} what became of the other {{missiles}} if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to,</b> but I took no interest in such things.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Who wants {{not to act}} straight?' {{the other}} said angrily. 'Haven't I brought her {{all the way out}} here because I thought she would be useful?

60|$|Just as I was ending-up these reflections, Clarence came back. I remarked {{upon the}} barren {{result of my}} efforts with the girl; hadn't got hold of a single point that could help me to find the castle.

6000|$|... "Mother," [...] I cried, with glowing {{cheeks and}} voice {{trembling}} with eagerness, [...] "what is the matter? Why {{do you not}} say 'yes'? You know how <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> go to college! There {{is no reason why}} you should not consent, is there?" ...|$|R

60|$|He {{was also}} a man of much experience, which he liked to trot out; but no greater {{contrast}} with Captain Giles could have been imagined. He would have amused me if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be amused. But I {{did not want to}} be amused. I was like a lover looking forward to a meeting. Human hostility was nothing to me. I thought of my unknown ship. It was amusement enough, torment enough, occupation enough.|$|E
60|$|In {{that matter}} {{of her clothes}} {{there had been a}} great improvement, but made very gradually. She had laughed at her own precautions, saying, that in her poverty she had wished to save {{everything}} that could be saved, and that she had only intended to make herself look like others in the same class. 'And <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid all attention,--at first,' she said, smiling, as she looked up at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to assist a nurse who had come in, and all that night we had our hands full with my husband.
