5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E

5|$|Bravely Default is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{which features}} a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation <b>in</b> <b>towns,</b> dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of environments, party stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a day-night cycle alters the types of enemies present, and after {{a certain point in}} the story an airship can be used to speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. <b>In</b> <b>towns,</b> players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or rest at an inn to restore health points (HP) and magic points (MP). In all environments, the party can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies appear through random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle.|$|E

5|$|Elementary {{education}} was widely available {{throughout most of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence, <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at least until the twelfth century. Secondary {{education was}} confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>towns</b> {{and central}} country districts during the 18th century, log walls were {{increasingly}} covered by weatherboards, a fashion {{made possible by}} sawmill technology. These buildings were better insulated and better protected against the harsh climate. But {{the main reason for}} the rapid adoption of this custom was the more fashionable appearance of boarded walls, which were more suitable than bare log walls as a background to details and ornaments borrowed from classical architecture.|$|E

5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets <b>in</b> <b>towns</b> and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E
