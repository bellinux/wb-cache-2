40|$|The thesis work {{is carried}} out in Innventia AB and Royal Institute of Technology (KTH). The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to numerically simulate the flow inside the <b>disc</b> <b>refiner</b> and to determine the factors influencing the development of flow in the rotor and the stator of the <b>disc</b> <b>refiner.</b> Simplified single groove model is used to analyze the flow in the rotor and stator of the refiner. Fluid is assumed to be Newtonian and single phase with dynamic viscosity 100 times higher than water. Model and mesh used for the rotor and stator are identical with different wall boundary conditions and fluid zone conditions. Simulations were performed with different pressure gradients and angular speed of the refiner. The study shows that the flow in the rotor depends on the pressure difference and the speed of the refiner. Flow in the stator depends on the pressure difference; speed has little effect on the flow in the stator. In the rotor fluid flows towards the periphery while in the stator direction of flow is towards origin. Rotational motion is observed both in the rotor and the stator groove. This rotational motion carries the fluid into the gap, fibres present in the fluid form flocs and got stapled at the bar edge. They get treated every time a rotating bar crosses a stationary bar. To study the intensity of refining, strain rate and shear force is determined. Shear force is due to the rotation of the rotor and due to the motion of the fluid down into the groove along its wall i. e. fluid that is carried along with the rotating plate...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} low dosage sulfite {{pretreatment}} combined with modern high consistency double <b>disc</b> <b>refining</b> were evaluated for production of thermomechanical pulp in a mill scale trial using Norway spruce wood at the Braviken paper mill (Holmen Paper AB, Sweden). Spruce wood chips were mechanically pretreated in an Impressafiner before impregnation with different dosages (0 - 1. 2 %) of sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) at pH 9. Approximately 23 % of the added sulfite was converted to sulfonate groups in pulp, {{resulting in a}} sulfonate content of 0 - 0. 28 % (as Na 2 SO 3).  The low dosage sulfite addition increased tensile index, elongation, density, brightness and decreased shive content, light scattering and light absorption coefficients when compared at equal specific energy consumption (SEC). The increase in tensile index was proportional to dosage of sulfite.  Further analyses showed that low dosage sulfite addition {{did not affect the}} distribution of the Bauer-McNett fractions nor the fibre length for pulps refined with equal SEC. However, the low dosage sulfite addition increased fibre delamination/internal fibrillation (D/IF).  With the addition of 1. 2 % Na 2 SO 3, it was possible to produce pulp with a tensile index of 47 Nm/g using ~ 320 kWh/bdt (~ 15 %) lower refining energy, compared with pulps produced without sulfite addition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this thesis was to obtain new information about mechanisms of thermomechanical pulp refining in the inner area of a <b>refiner</b> <b>disc</b> gap by studying inter-fibre refining and by calculating the distribution of energy consumption in the <b>refiner</b> <b>disc</b> gap. The energy consumption of thermomechanical pulping process is very high although theoretically {{a small amount of}} energy is needed to create new fibre surfaces. Mechanisms of refining have been widely studied {{in order to understand the}} high energy consumption of the process, however, phenomena in the inner area of disc gap has had less attention. It is likely that this important position is causing high energy consumption due to the high residence time of pulp located there. The power distribution as a function of the <b>refiner</b> <b>disc</b> gap was calculated in this work. The calculation was based on mass and energy balances, as well as temperature and consistency profiles determined by mill trials. The power distribution was found to be dependent on segment geometry and the refining stage. However, in the first stage refiner with standard refiner segments, a notable amount of power was consumed in the inner area of the <b>disc</b> gap. Fibre-to-fibre <b>refining</b> is likely to be the most important mechanism in the inner area of disc gap from the point of view of energy consumption. In this work the inter-fibre refining was studied using equipment for shear and compression. Fibre-to-fibre refining was found to be an effective way to refine fibres from coarse pulp to separated, fibrillated and peeled fibres if frictional forces inside the compressed pulp were high enough. It was proposed that high energy of today’s thermomechanical pulping process could derive from too low frictional forces that heated pulp and evaporated water without any changes in fibre structure. The method to calculate power distribution and results of fibre-to-fibre refining experiments may give ideas for developing today’s thermomechanical pulp refiners’ or for developing totally new energy saving mechanical pulping processes...|$|R

40|$|Many {{studies have}} been carried out with the goal of {{improving}} pulp quality control in TMP refining processes without a deeper understanding about the physical conditions inside the refining zone. The refiner is thereby considered as a black box where the chips are defibrated to fibers. In this paper, a non-linear model for the estimation of thermodynamic and defibration/fibrillation work is presented. It is shown that the model requires temperature measurements to span the energy balances and obtain reliable pressure gradients inside the refining zone. Based on process data from a single <b>disc</b> <b>refiner,</b> it is shown that the defibration/fibrillation work varies substantially along the radius of the refining segments, even though the total work, i. e. the motor load, is almost the same over the specific time sequences. This is a consequence of variations in the concentration of the fiber pad built up inside the refining zone. Moreover, it is shown that the commonly used control concept, where the traditional specific energy is used as a control variable should be reconsidered. Besides a deeper analysis about the assumptions made in the refiner modeling procedure, obtained results regarding estimated fiber concentration along the radius, consistency and steam efficiency are discussed...|$|E

Fibres were dried in a flash drier to a moisture content of approximately 12 percent. The mechanical properties of single fibres from each refining pressure were determined using a tensile strength tester. The tensile tester is a custom-built screw-driven cross-head fitted with a 5 Newton-capacity load cell. Fibres were tested at an elongation rate of 80 ~-i~icronsIminute. Load-elongation traces were converted to stress-strain curves with tensile span and cross-sectional area. Tensile span was measured as cross-head movement and was approximately lmm. The cross-sectional area of each tested fibre was measured using confocal microscopy. Fibre modulus of elasticity and ultimate tensile stress were then detelmined from the stress-strain curves. Fibre stiffness and strength were further studied to evaluate their effect on structural fibreboard panels. Small MDF panels were prepared with a urea-formaldehyde adhesive at an addition level of 12 percent solids to determine this effect.

40|$|The {{effects of}} low dosage sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) {{pretreatment}} (0, 0. 6 and 1. 2 % on bone dry wood, pH 9) at two different refining temperatures (4. 6 and 6. 4 bar(g) refiner housing pressure) were evaluated for production of thermomechanical pulp {{with a double}} <b>disc</b> <b>refiner</b> in mill scale using Norway spruce wood at Braviken paper mill (Holmen Paper AB, Sweden). The sulfonate content of the pulps was not affected by the different refining temperatures and was 0. 29 % (as Na 2 SO 3 equivalents) for the highest sulfite addition. Tensile index at constant SEC was increased by 3. 2 Nm/g when the refining temperature was increased, and by 8. 6 Nm/g when 1. 2 % sodium sulfite was added. The effects were additive and led {{to an increase in}} tensile index of similar to 12 Nm/g at constant SEC when combined and would enable a reduction in SEC of 380 kWh/bdt (similar to 20 %) to similar tensile index. The degree of delamination and internal fibrillation of the fibers was increased by both increased refining temperature and sulfite addition. Pulp brightness was slightly reduced (<= 0. 4 % ISO) by increased refining temperature and increased (2 - 3 % ISO), when sodium sulfite was added.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{electric}} energy efficiency of single stage double <b>disc</b> <b>refining</b> for production of printing grade mechanical pulp from Norway spruce wood chips. The thesis {{is based on the}} hypothesis, that more energy efficiency refining can be attained by balanced increases of wood softening and refining intensity. Five mill scale trials were performed where wood softening and refining intensity was varied by applying or changing the following process parameters and variables: Chip pretreatment/impregnation with water Low dosages of sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) added to impregnation Temperature and retention time in the atmospheric preheater bin Refining temperature (housing pressure) Feeding segment design combined with increased production rate By combining suitable increases in wood softening and refining intensity, it was possible to reduce the specific electric energy consumption in refining by 15 % (~ 290 kWh per bone dry ton (bdt)) while preserving important pulp properties within ± 5 %, compared to the standard double <b>disc</b> <b>refining</b> process. This was done by combining chip impregnation, using an addition of 0. 36 % (on bone dry basis) sodium sulfite, with a new feeding segment design which enabled 25 % higher production rate. When using the new feeding segment design at an increased production rate at unchanged wood softening, it led to reduced fiber length and increased sheet light scattering coefficient at certain tensile index, compared with the standard segment design at normal production rate. This is consistent with the effects normally seen when the refining intensity is increasing. The specific electric energy consumption was 8 % lower at a tensile index of 43. 5 Nm/g (on Rapid Köthen laboratory sheets) compared to refining at lower intensity using the standard segment design at normal production rate. Mechanical chip pretreatment with subsequent water impregnation showed a reduction in specific electric energy consumption of 6 % (~ 120 kWh/bdt). When chip impregnation was applied in a later trial with a milder chip compression, it led to increased wood softening seen as better preserved fiber length and reduced light scattering coefficient. This resulted in a reduction in tensile index at certain specific electric energy consumption when applied with the standard refining condition but to an increase in tensile index when applied with refining at higher intensity using the feeding segment design at higher production rate. An addition of 1. 2 % sodium sulfite during impregnation led to a sulfonate content of pulps of ~ 0. 28 % (as Na 2 SO 3 equivalents, including post sulfonation) and an average increase in tensile index of about 8. 3 Nm/g, when compared to unsulfonated pulps at certain specific electric energy consumption. The increase in tensile index correlated with increased delamination and internal fibrillation of fibers (measured by Simon’s staining), which indicate that the increase in tensile index for sulfonated pulps was a result of improved fiber flexibility and collapsibility. The reduction in disc gap at certain specific electric energy consumption in refining due to an increased wood softening after sulfonation may explain the increase in delamination and internal fibrillation for sulfonated pulps. The smaller disc gap probably led to a more intense refining, i. e. loading at higher deformation rates due to a higher degree of deformation in bar crossings. Different temperatures (80 vs. 97 °C) and retention times (6 vs. 9 min.) in the atmospheric preheater bin were studied. This showed that the lower temperature and shorter retention time was beneficial for the tensile strength and light scattering of pulp when applying low dosage sodium sulfite pretreatment. This was most likely a result of too high degree of wood softening prior to defibration in the breaker bar zone when combining low dosage sodium sulfite pretreatment with the higher preheating bin temperature at longer retention time. Different refining temperatures (4. 6 and 6. 4 bar(g) refiner housing pressure) were evaluated both without and with low additions (0. 6 % and 1. 2 %) of sodium sulfite. Raising the refining temperature increased tensile index by 3. 2 Nm/g and the addition of 1. 2 % sodium sulfite by 8. 6 Nm/g. The combined increase (~ 12 Nm/g) was similar to the effect of increasing the specific electric energy consumption by 380 kWh/bdt, when comparing pulps at equal tensile index. However, the pulps produced with increased refining temperature and sodium sulfite addition had lower light scattering coefficient at certain tensile index. The combination of increased refining temperature and addition of 0. 6 % sodium sulfite was interesting and resulted in pulp with higher tensile index, light scattering coefficient and brightness together with lower shives content at certain specific electric energy consumption, compared with pulp produced at the lower refining temperature without addition of sodium sulfite. Finally, an implementation of the technology presented here is discussed in relation to the Braviken mill (Holmen Paper AB, Norrköping, Sweden) concerning reduction in electric energy consumption and steam recovery. The technology has potential to reduce the electrical energy use by ~ 100 GWh/year at the Braviken paper mill, where this study was performed.

For preparing TMP pine chips {{as well as}} UF-bonded MDF were digested under pressure at 170 degrees C. Thereafter, the digested chips and MDF were defibrated at 170 degrees C using a single <b>disc</b> <b>refiner.</b> CTMP was prepared from pine wood with 0. 25 % NaOH (based on dry wood) under the conditions set forth above. CTMP was also made from MDF under two conditions using 0. 15 % sodium hydroxide (% based on dry MDF) and a mixture of sodium sulphite (1 %) and sodium hydroxide (0. 25 %). The pulps show distinct differences in their properties: TMP from UF-bonded MDF shows lower extractive content in cold and hot water, lower pH-value and higher buffering capacity towards alkali of the cold water extractives than the CTMP counterpart. Moreover, CTMP prepared by using sodium hydroxide alone as a pulping agent increases the content of formate and acetate ions in the cold water extractives. The use of a mixture of sodium sulfite and sodium hydroxide as a pulping agent decreases, however, significantly the content of formate and acetate ions in the cold water extractives. This {{may be due to}} the buffering action of sodium sulfite. In general, CTMP decreases the formaldehyde release of the fibres, as measured by the flask method. In presence of sodium sulfite as a pulping agent for recycled MDF, the formaldehyde release is slashed to almost 30 % of its original value.

40|$|The {{correlation}} between the fibre flexibility and cross-sectional area moment of inertia of thermomechanical pulp fibres was investigated. The main effects of refining {{were found to be}} internal fibrillation, external fibrillation, and fibre shortening. Internal fibrillation increases fibre flexibility and fibre collapsibility, improving fibre-to-fibre contact in a paper sheet. The raw materials used were pulps produced from six different Norway spruce logs and six different Scots pine logs, chosen in a manner that allowed variation of fibre wall thickness and fibril angle independently. Each wood sample was refined in four stages using a pressurized 12 " Sprout Waldron single <b>disc</b> <b>refiner.</b> Fibre flexibility was assessed by FiberMaster bendability measurements. Fibre bendability was measured on the + 48 Bauer McNett fractions of the twelve 2 nd, 3 rd, and 4 th stage thermomechanical pulps (TMP). The fibre cross-sectional samples were imaged using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). An image analysis method to calculate the area moment of inertia of each fibre using numerical integration was developed. Fiber bendability increased with specific energy consumption for both wood species (spruce and pine) from the 2 nd refining stage to the fourth refining stage. Spruce had a higher rate of bendability increase than pine upon refining. It was expected that fibres with a low area moment of inertia would result in higher bendability, but no such correlation was found for either spruce or pine. Fibre bendability increased with internal fibrillation, as assessed from Simons staining. These results imply that local damage of the fibre wall such as delaminations, kinks, and compressions was the main effect in increasing the flexibility through refining of TMP...|$|E

40|$|Peat based {{growing media}} are not {{sustainable}} and not easily colonized by biocontrol organisms. Plant fibers may allow for partially replacing peat in growing media {{and they may}} have the potential to carry biocontrol organisms. However, they may also carry plant pathogens and they may vary in their degree of biodegradability and their interaction with N, and thus they may affect the quality of growing media. Several defiberization techniques were tested for flax shives, miscanthus and reed straw for their ability to (1) kill plant pathogens present on the plant fibers, (2) reduce the N-fixation risk of the fibers and (3) provide fibers serving as carrier of biocontrol fungi. Flax shives obtained from various sources were colonized by viable microsclerotia of the plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae. However, when sufficiently high temperatures were reached during defiberization, this technique killed the plant pathogen on the shives, allowing the use of defiberized flax shives in growing media. Untreated flax shives, miscanthus or reed straw were characterized by high N immobilization. Using these plant fibers as peat replacement in growing media may thus reduce N availability for plants. According to the incubation trials results, extruding, retruding and applying <b>disc</b> <b>refining</b> significantly reduced the N immobilization for miscanthus straw without affecting the pH of the fiber, while steam explosion significantly reduced the pH and resulted in higher N immobilisation. Extruding and retruding the flas shives increased the N fixation. Defiberized pure miscanthus or reed straw and flax shives were easily colonized by fungal biocontrol strains, e. g. Trichoderma spp.. The effect of inoculation with fungi or acidification on N fixation was tested for extruded miscanthus fibers. Inoculation with shiitake (Lentinula edodes) or Agrocybe aegerita, i. e., 2 fungi without biocontrol properties was effective in reducing the N immobilization only in a specific pH range and at high colonization degree and/or for fungi with fast colonization, but never increased the N fixation when successfully inoculated. Inoculation of extruded Miscanthus fibers with different strains of biocontrol fungi did not increase nor decrease the N immobilization. Reducing the pH of the fibers between pH 2. 5 and 4. 7 was effective in reducing the microbial activity and the N fixation. Finetuning the conditions is necessary when applying acidification or inoculation for reducing the N fixation in plant fibers. N immobilization in growing media is related to biological activity. We compared 3 methods to determine the microbial biomass on plant fibers in growing media incubated with mineral N fertilizers, i. e., fumigation-extraction, plfa and Q-PCR, and used water-extractable C to measure the easily available C in the plant fibers. The extrusion of miscanthus straw with or without inoculation of a biocontrol organism reduced the N immobilization when compared with the pure fiber. In case of flax shives, defiberization of plant fibers kills plant pathogens that may be present on the fibers when sufficiently high temperatures are reached during defiberization. Inoculation of plant fibers with biocontrol fungi may be beneficial for increasing the disease resistance in growing media, and we found that inoculation of extruded Miscanthus fibers with biocontrol fungi did not increase nor decrease the N immobilization.

The testing results also showed that during the experimental period from the 7 th to 14 th day, the lignin content was no longer degraded while the holocellulose content expressed a manifest reduction. At the 7 th day, the removal ratios of lignin to the holocellulose were all larger than one for the testing groups CH 05, CH 06 and CH 07 whereas the control group was less than one, indicating that the reduction rate of lignin was faster than that of holocellulose for the testing groups. The testing groups CH 05, CH 06 and CH 07 with Bacillus spp. could effectively degrade lignin with no extra holocellulose lost as compared to the control group during the test of the first 7 days. Consequently, the optimal time obtained for the Bacillus spp. to degrade rice straw was 7 days. According to the testing results under CNS (Chinese National Standards), both handsheets with basis weights 115 and 160 g/m 2 of the bio-mechanical pulp of rice straw did not pass the relative parameters of properties for the corrugating medium paper and linerboard, respectively. On the other hand, except CH 06 group, all the properties of handsheets of basis weights 115 and 160 g/m 2 using the 1 : 1 mixture composed of the bio-mechanical pulp of rice straw and kraft pulp were respectively classified as level B corrugating medium paper and level C linerboard. During the treatment of mechanical pulping processes as using one ton of absolutely dried rice straw, the energy consumption saving and carbon dioxide CO 2 emissions reduction of testing groups CH 05, CH 06 and CH 07 were about 29. 73, 24. 73 and 32. 27 kWh and 18. 52, 15. 28 and 20. 10 kg, respectively at the <b>disc</b> <b>refining</b> stage, while at the PFI mill stage, both were about 13336. 8, 13336. 8 and 4445. 6 kWh and 8308. 83, 8308. 83 and 2769. 61 kg, respectively as compared to the control group. Based on the testing results analyzed in this research, only Bacillus spp. CH 05 group could hold a larger reduction rate of lignin degradation than that of holocellulose and also save tremendous energy consumption simultaneously at the PFI mill stage. Both handsheets made of basis weights 115 and 160 g/m 2 using the 1 : 1 mixture composed of the bio-mechanical pulp of rice straw and kraft pulp could also passed the criteria of CNS standard of corrugating medium paper and linerboard, respectively as using the bio-mechanical pulp from the group CH 05. Therefore, the Bacillus spp. CH 05 group was the optimal group obtained in this research as the best strain used in the biodegradation for rice straw. 本研究旨在探討利用Bacillus spp. 芽孢桿菌屬CH 05 、CH 06 及CH 07 菌株，來進行稻草生物分解之研究及篩選生物-機械製漿之最佳菌株。當利用Bacillus spp. 芽孢桿菌屬之菌株與無添加菌株之對照組分解稻草試驗，分析重量損失與成分變化，結果顯示CH 05 與CH 07 組於 7 天時木質素含量可有效減少，與對照組間有顯著差異，且全纖維素含量彼此間並無顯著差異，但至第 14 天時木質素不再降解，而全纖維素卻有減少之現象；且試驗 7 天時三組之木質素對全纖維素之降低比例皆大於 1 ，而對照組則小於 1 ，顯示試驗組在 7 天的分解時間時，其木質素之降解量較全纖維素之降解量多，推論在試驗 7 天的微生物降解時Bacillus spp. 芽孢桿菌屬之菌株可有效降解木質素，且不會額外造成全纖維素之損失，因此Bacillus spp. 芽孢桿菌屬分解稻草之時間以 7 天為最佳。 本研究稻草生物-機械紙漿製作基重 115 與 160 g/m 2 之手抄紙，其性質測試結果，顯示相關指標參數皆分別未達CNS(Chinese National Standards) 瓦楞芯紙與裱面紙板之標準；而以 1 : 1 混合稻草生物-機械與牛皮紙漿製作之基重 115 與 160 g/m 2 之手抄紙，除了CH 06 組皆未達標準外，其餘組別依照CNS標準可個別分級為B級瓦楞芯紙與C級裱面紙板；且當機械製漿處理相當於絕乾重 1 公噸之稻草時，於盤磨階段CH 05 、CH 06 及CH 07 三組與對照組相比，分別可節省 29. 73 、 24. 73 及 32. 27 kWh之能量消耗與 18. 52 、 15. 28 及 20. 10 kg之CO 2 排放量；而於PFI打漿階段CH 05 、CH 06 及CH 07 三組與對照組相比，分別可節省 13336. 8 、 13336. 8 及 4445. 6 kWh之能量消耗與 8308. 83 、 8308. 83 及 2769. 61 kg之CO 2 排放量。 本研究綜合上述之試驗結果，顯示Bacillus spp. 芽孢桿菌屬CH 05 、CH 06 及CH 07 三組菌株中，唯有CH 05 組同時具有較大之木質素對全纖維之降低比例與打漿過程明顯節省能量消耗，且其兩種基重之 1 : 1 混合稻草生物-機械與牛皮紙漿手抄紙，亦可分別通過CNS(Chinese National Standards) 之B級瓦楞芯紙與C級裱面紙板標準，因此獲致 Bacillus spp. 芽孢桿菌屬CH 05 組為稻草生物分解之最佳應用菌株。謝誌…………………………………………………………. ……………I 摘要……………………	II Abstract………………………………	IV 目錄…………………………………………………………………… [...] VI 表目錄……………………	X 圖目錄. ……………………………………………………………… [...] XII 符號對照表	……….

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pressurised}} compressive chip pre-treatment and low dosage sulphite pre-treatment were evaluated for production of thermomechanical pulp in mill scale trials using Norway spruce (Picea abies) at the Braviken paper mill (Holmen Paper AB, Sweden). The general {{aim of the}} study was to improve the energy efficiency during the production of mechanical pulps suitable for news and improved news grade papers. The pressurised compressive chip pre-treatment performed in an Impressafiner, resulted in a reduced acetone extractive content for first stage blow line pulp by up to 24 %. Furthermore, pulp produced from mechanically pre-treated chips had higher tensile- and tear indices, elongation and light scattering and lower freeness compared to pulps from untreated chips produced with equal total specific energy consumption. The total specific energy consumption was reduced by 120 kWh/bone dry ton (6 %) at equal tensile index, when pulps were produced together with the Impressafiner pre-treatment. Sulphite pre-treatment increased tensile index, elongation, density and brightness and reduced light scattering and shive content compared to pulps produced with only mechanical pre-treatment at equal specific energy consumption. The increase in tensile index and reduction in light scattering followed linear relations to the dosage of sodium sulphite in the measured dosage range (0 - 1. 2 % Na 2 SO 3). The addition of ~ 1. 2 % sodium sulphite gave a sulphur content in pulp of ~ 0. 67 % (as Na 2 SO 3) and reduced the specific energy consumption by 210 - 320 kWh/bdt (12 - 15 %) when compared at equal tensile index. However, light scattering was not retained for this energy reduction. Further analyses showed that sulphite pre-treatment did not significantly affect the distribution of the Bauer-McNett fractions or the fibre length for pulps refined with equal specific energy consumption but did increase fibre delamination/internal fibrillation as measured by Fernando and Daniel’s (2010) version of Simons’ staining. The specific energy consumption for pulps produced with sulphite pre-treatment (1. 2 % Na 2 SO 3) and double disc refining were 650 kWh/bdt (30 %) lower than for pulps produced in a two stage single <b>disc</b> <b>refiner</b> line (no pre-treatment), when compared at a similar tensile index and light scattering coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find out reliable laboratory methods to predict the effect of enzymes on specific energy consumption and fiber properties of TMP pulp. The second one was to find with interactive software called “Knowledge discovery in databases” enzymes or other additives that can be used in finding a solution to reduce energy consumption of TMP pulp. The chemical composition of wood and enzymes, which have activity on main wood components were presented in the literature part of the work. The results of previous research in energy reduction of TMP process with enzymes were also highlighted. The main principles of knowledge discovery have been included in literature part too. The experimental part of the work contains the methods description in which the standard size chip, crushed chip and fiberized spruce chip (fiberized pulp) were used. Different types of enzymatic treatment with different dosages and time were tested during the experiments and showed. Pectinase, endoglucanase and mixture of enzymes were used for evaluation of method reliability. The fines content and fiber length of pulp was measured and used as evidence of enzymes' effect. The refining method with “Bauer” laboratory <b>disc</b> <b>refiner</b> was evaluated as not highly reliable. It was not able to provide high repeatability of results, because of uncontrolled feeding capacity and refining consistency. The refining method with Valley refiner did not have a lot of variables and showed stable and repeatable results in energy saving. The results of experiments showed that efficient enzymes impregnation is probably the main target with enzymes application for energy saving. During the work the fiberized pulp showed high accessibility to enzymatic treatment and liquid penetration without special impregnating equipment. The reason was that fiberized pulp has larger wood surface area and thereby the contact area between the enzymatic solution and wood is also larger. Standard size chip and crushed chip treatment without special impregnator of enzymatic solution was evaluated as not efficient and did not show visible, repeatable results in energy consumption decrease. Thereby it was concluded that using of fiberized pulp and Valley refiner for measurements of enzymes' effectiveness in SEC decrease is more suitable than normal size chip and crushed chip with “Bauer” refiner. Endoglucanase with 5 kg/t dosage showed about 20 % energy consumption decrease. Mixture of enzymes with 1. 5 kg/t dosage showed about 15 % decrease of energy consumption during the refining. Pectinase at different dosages and treatment times did not show significant effect on energy consumption. Results of knowledge discovery in databases showed the xylanase, cellulase and pectinase blend as most promising for energy reduction in TMP process. Surfactants were determined as effective additives for energy saving with enzymes...|$|E
40|$|When {{producing}} thermomechanical pulps (TMP), {{wood chips}} and fiber material are loaded mechanically in a disc-refiner {{to separate the}} fibers and to make them flexible. In the process, much of the energy supplied is transferred to the fiber material through cyclic compression, shear and friction processes. Therefore, compression and friction characteristics are {{needed in order to}} gain a better grasp of the forces acting during refining. To this end, in this thesis, the compressive and frictional behaviors of wood were investigated under simulated chip refining conditions (i. e., hot saturated steam, high strain rate compression, and high sliding speed). Two new, custom-designed, experimental setups were developed and used. The equipment used for compression testing was based on the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) technique and the friction tester was a pin-on-disc type of tribotester (wear rig). Both pieces of equipment allow a testing environment of hot saturated steam.   In the wood–steel friction investigation, the influence of the steam temperature (100 - 170 °C) was of primary interest. The wood species chosen for the friction tests were spruce (Picea abies), pine (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus radiata), and birch (Betula verrucosa). When performing measurements in the lower-temperature region (100 - 130 °C), the friction coefficients registered for the softwoods were generally low and surface properties such as lubrica­tion were suggested to have a great influence on the results; however, in the higher-tempera­ture region (~ 130 - 170 °C), the friction coefficients of all investigated wood species were probably determined by bulk properties to a much greater extent. When most of the wood extractives had been removed from the specimens, testing results revealed distinct peaks in friction at similar temperatures, as the internal friction of the different wood species are known to have their maxima at ~ 110 – 130 °C. One suggested explanation of these friction peaks is that reduced lubrication enabled energy to dissipate into the bulk material, causing particularly high friction at the temperature at which internal damping of the material was greatest. During the friction measurements in the higher-temperature region, the specimens of the different wood species also started to lose fibers (i. e., produce wear debris) at different characteristic temperatures, as indicated by peaks in the coefficient of friction. In refining, the generally lower shives content of pine TMP than of spruce TMP could partly be explained by a lower wear initiation temperature in the pine species.   Wood stiffness is known to decrease with temperature, when measured at low strain rates. The results presented in this thesis can confirm a similar behavior for high strain rate compression. The compressive strain registered during impulsive loading (using a modified split Hopkinson equipment) increased with temperature; because strain rate also increased with temperature. Accordingly, the strain rates should determine the strain magnitudes also in a refiner, since the impulsive loads in a refiner are of similar type. Larger strains would thus be achieved when refining at high temperatures. The results achieved in the compression tests were also considered in relation to refining parameters such as plate clearance and refining intensity, parameters that could be discussed in light of the stress–strain relations derived from the high strain rate measurements. Trials recorded using high-speed photography demonstrated that the wood relaxation was very small in the investigated time frame ~ 6 ms. As well, in TMP refining the wood material has little time to relax, i. e., ~ 0. 04 – 0. 5 ms in a large single <b>disc</b> <b>refiner.</b> The results presented here are therefore more suitable for comparison with the impulsive loads arising in a refiner than are the results of any earlier study. It can therefore be concluded that the modified SHPB testing technique combined with high-speed photography is well suited for studying the dynamic behavior of wood under conditions like those prevalent in a TMP system...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on an {{experimental}} study of the pressure conditions in the refining zone of high-consistency refiners used in paper making. The work presents the findings from two different mill-scale experiments in addition to results obtained from a pilot refiner study. The experiments have been performed using two different types of pressure sensors: • Fibre-optic pressure sensors based on extrinsic Fabry Perot interferometer (EFPI). • Piezoresistive temperature and pressure transducers. This study has shown {{that it is possible to}} establish high-frequency pressure measurements in the refining zone of high-consistency refiners. Data have been collected at rates up to 20 million samples per second. The fibre-optic sensors seem to be preferable to the piezoresistive transducers as the fibre-optic sensors were working well after long exposure to the harsh environment inside the refining zone. Reliable measurements were still obtained after 1000 operating hours. On the other hand, the piezoresistive sensors suffered from problems caused by the wet environment inside the refiner as well as from the electrical dependent circuits and transmission cables. However, in the pilot refiner under less harsh environment, the piezoresistive transducer functioned well. The main focus in this thesis has been related to the second mill-scale experiment which used fibre-optic pressure sensors. The results obtained from this experiment are considered to be more valuable than those from the first mill-scale experiment which used combined piezoresistive pressure and temperature transducers. Furthermore, pulp samples were collected during the second mill-scale experiment allowing an even more comprehensive analysis. However, the results from the first mill-scale experiment are shown as a comparison and in order to demonstrate the challenge of selecting the appropriate technology. Results from a successfully test performed in the pilot refiner, which also used a combined piezoresistive pressure and temperature transducer, are shown as well. In addition, as a supplement to the results from the mill-scale experiment with fibre-optic sensors, an experiment which employed external accelerometers for measuring the high-frequency vibrations in the mill refiner is discussed. Another supplement was made through an experiment measuring the deviation of the rotational speed of the refiner shaft. The main objective of this study has been to find out how to make high-frequency pressure measurements in the refining zone of a mill-scale high-consistency TMP refiner. The study has particularly focused on the signal analyses and the reliability of the pressure measurements. Since the investigations have been focused on the experimental issues, assessments are primarily made regarding the recorded data and the related process observations. One of the challenges was to find suitable technology for use in a harsh environment. Obtaining and selecting an appropriate sensor was extremely important. A fast responding sensor was prerequisite. It was of particular interest to investigate the pressure pulses generated from the squeezing of wood particles between the sensor surface and the bars on the opposite disc. In addition, the dimension of the sensor surface had to be small so that the peak pressures could be determined. The size should preferably be smaller than a width of a bar. Especially the fibre-optic sensors met this criterion as they had a surface diameter of approximately 1 mm. The piezoresistive sensors had a surface diameter of 3. 8 mm. Mill-scale experiments were conducted to test the sensors in a realistic environment. The design of the experiments was important in the assessment of the performance of the sensors during different controlled conditions. Collecting of pulp samples to assess the pulp quality of the primary refining in comparison to the process behaviour and the pressure signals were matters of additional interest. The analyses of the experiment should give conclusions about the reliability of the sensors. A goal of the present work has also been to examine the behaviour and the properties of the pressure signals, and investigate the origin of the pressure pulses. Most of the results are from high-frequency measurements of pressure in the refining zone of a high-consistency TMP refiner. Combined temperature and pressure measurements are shown from the test in the pilot refiner. The fast development within sensor and computer technology has made it possible to achieve measurements that have not been performed earlier. The use of fibre-optic sensor technology in chip refiners has not been reported earlier. The high-frequency recordings using sample rates of up to 20 MSamples/s suffered from the lack of demodulation technology such that the accuracy of the absolute pressure readings is limited. However, this study indicates average pressures between 20 and 30 bar in the intermediate zone. Even more interesting is the fast pressure changes obtained using frequency analysis. Common frequencies indicating vibrations in the discs appearing from the pressure pulses when the pulp is squeezed between the bars of the stator and rotor disc have been observed. This observation was supported by vibration analysis using external accelerometers. It is claimed that there is a relationship between vibrations in the <b>refiner</b> <b>discs</b> and the pressure pulses that are generated from the squeezing of pulp between bars on the rotor and stator disc. However, nobody has investigated this particular relationship although this study strongly indicates that this relationship exists. Furthermore, it is shown that the pressure sensors were not affected by vibrations operating in resonance. This strongly supports the conclusion that the fibre-optic pressure sensors were solely measuring the activities in the refining zone. The frequency analysis of the different recordings gave firm evidence of the process related influences of the pressure readings. The reliability of the performance of the sensors was clearly visible through this analysis technique. Several analyses found that the shift in the bar crossing frequencies was directly proportional to and caused by fluctuations in the rotational speed of the refiner. However, local bar crossing frequencies were generally not as clear as expected. The measurements indicated that some specific radial positions determined by the tapered plate pattern, dominated the responses. Among the most dominating frequencies were periodicities associated with the rotational speed of the refiner, the number of bars in the breaker bar and coarse zones as well as the transition zone between the intermediate and fine bar zones. When the plates were new, a 25. 2 kHz periodicity that arose from a bar-to-bar passage in the fine bar zone dominated the pressure readings. These pulses probably propagated in the disc so that the whole disc vibrated. It is not assumed that these vibrations generated large plate gap variations. However, these fluctuations were predominant compared with the local generated pressure pulses. The pressure variations probably propagated through the steam and pulp pad as pressure waves. Thus the pulp and steam flow through the whole refining zone was affected. The local bar crossing frequencies were suppressed and only visible to a minor extent. It is conceivable that the steam and pulp interacts through a two-phase flow. Thus the steam may have a repressive effect on the interaction between the pulp pad and the bar patterns on the discs. Recordings during different controlled operating conditions were used to study the reliability of the sensors. The relationship between the pressure signals and the process variables has been investigated as well. The most reliable relationship was obtained when changing the chip flow to the refining zone after 1000 hours of operating time. The motor load and acceleration variables were strongly correlated with the pressure readings. No strong correlations were found between the data from the pressure sensors and the process variables shortly after start-up using new plates. The pulp samples that were collected and analysed did not give a good relationship between the pressure signals and the quality data. However, during this period other process disturbances affected the conditions in the refining zone more than the randomized manipulation of the control variables. This was observed as time dependent variations in the pressure recordings as well as several process variables. The most probable disturbance was the amount of chips fed to the refiner and subsequent changes of the plate gap. Further indications imply that the pressure sensors were sensitive to variations in the incoming stream of chips. Besides the successful test when changing the chip flow to the refining zone, frequency analyses have showed that the sensors also were affected by periodicities in the pulp flow that were related to the inner part of the refining zone and the breaker bar section. This was shown both as sideband effects as well as plain peak frequencies. Sideband effects are interpreted as periodic waves of pulp flow propagated through the refining zone. This study indicates that the average pressure in the intermediate zone of the refining zone of the mill-scale TMP refiner was as high as 20 - 30 bar. This was somewhat higher than expected from the theoretical considerations. However, the theoretical calculations have some limiting factors, which there are some disagreement in the literature. The area where the energy is applied in the refining zone as well as the tangential friction coefficient is not clearly determined. Both are included in one of the theoretical approaches. Thus there are some uncertainties associated with the models. However, some uncertainties are related to the determination of the pressure levels for the measurements using the fibre-optic sensors as well. This is mainly due to the lack of well-established demodulation techniques for the sinusoidal relation between the sensor signal and the pressure. This is the greatest weakness in this part of the investigation. The pressure levels obtained using the piezoresistive sensors were to some extent agreeable with the fibre-optic measurements. However, there was greater uncertainty in the piezoresistive measurements due to probable disturbances related to electromagnetic noise or moisture having a detrimental influence on electric circuits in the sensors. The most interesting results obtained using the piezoresistive sensors in the mill-scale experiment have been observations of process relevant periodic signal patterns. Stable average pressures between 2 and 4. 5 bar were found in the atmospheric pilot refiner during normal operating conditions. Since the local bar crossing frequency did not dominate the periodicities obtained from these recordings it is assumed that the steam affected the pressure conditions in the refining zone. This is assumed despite the fact that the refiner was atmospheric. Pressure peaks above 10 bar were observed frequently. When the plate gap decreased, the pressure pulses were considerably higher. Pressure peaks up to 60 bar were observed during operation with a small plate clearance. The local bar crossing frequency was clearly visible under such conditions, not otherwise. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical pulps {{are used}} in paper {{products}} such as magazine or news grade printing papers or paperboard. Mechanical pulping gives a high yield; nearly everything in the tree except the bark {{is used in the}} paper. This means that mechanical pulping consumes much less wood than chemical pulping, especially to produce a unit area of printing surface. A drawback of mechanical pulp production is the high amounts of electrical energy needed to separate and refine the fibers to a given fiber quality. Mechanical pulps are often produced from slow growing spruce trees of forests in the northern hemisphere resulting in long, slender fibers that are well suited for mechanical pulp products. These fibers have large varieties in geometry, mainly wall thickness and width, depending on seasonal variations and growth conditions. Earlywood fibers typically have thin walls and latewood fibers thick. The background to this study was that a more detailed fiber characterization involving evaluations of distributions of fiber characteristics, may give improved possibilities to optimize the mechanical pulping process and thereby reduce the total electric energy needed to reach a given quality of the pulp and final product. This would result in improved competitiveness as well as less environmental impact. This study evaluated the relation between fiber characteristics in three types of mechanical pulps made from Norway spruce (Picea abies), thermomechanical pulp(TMP), stone groundwood pulp (SGW) and chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP). In addition, the influence of fibers from these pulp types on sheet characteristics, mainly tensile index, was studied. A comparatively rapid method was presented on how to evaluate the propensity of each fiber to form sheets of high tensile index, by the use of raw data from a commercially available fiber analyzer (FiberLabTM). The developed method gives novel opportunities of evaluating the effect on the fibers of each stage in the mechanical pulping process and has a potential to be applied also on‐line to steer the refining and pulping process by the characteristics of the final pulp {{and the quality of the}} final paper. The long fiber fraction is important for the properties of the whole pulp. It was found that fiber wall thickness and external fibrillation were the fibercharacteristics that contributed the most to tensile index of the long fiber fractions in five mechanical pulps (three TMPs, one SGW, one CTMP). The tensile index of handsheets of the long fiber fractions could be predicted by linear regressions using a combination of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation. The predicted tensile index was denoted BIN, short for Bonding ability INfluence. This resulted in the same linear correlation between BIN and tensile index for 52 samples of the five mechanical pulps studied, each fractionated into five streams(plus feed) in full size hydrocyclones. The Bauer McNett P 16 /R 30 (passed 16 meshwire, retained on a 30 mesh wire) and P 30 /R 50 fractions of each stream were used for the evaluation. The fibers of the SGW had thicker walls and a higher degree of external fibrillation than the TMPs and CTMP, which resulted in a correlation between BIN and tensile index on a different level for the P 30 /R 50 fraction of SGW than the other pulp samples. A BIN model based on averages weighted by each fiber´s wall volume instead of arithmetic averages, took the fiber wall thickness of the SGW into account, and gave one uniform correlation between BIN and tensile index for all pulp samples (12 samples for constructing the model, 46 for validatingit). If the BIN model is used for predicting averages of the tensile index of a sheet, a model based on wall volume weighted data is recommended. To be able to produce BIN distributions where the influence of the length or wall volume of each fiber is taken into account, the BIN model is currently based on arithmetic averages of fiber wall thickness and fibrillation. Fiber width used as a single factor reduced the accuracy of the BIN model. Wall volume weighted averages of fiber width also resulted in a completely changed ranking of the five hydrocyclone streams compared to arithmetic, for two of thefive pulps. This was not seen when fiber width was combined with fiber wallthickness into the factor “collapse resistance index”. In order to avoid too high influence of fiber wall thickness and until the influence of fiber width on BIN and the measurement of fiber width is further evaluated, it is recommended to use length weighted or arithmetic distributions of BIN and other fiber characteristics. A comparably fast method to evaluate the distribution of fiber wall thickness and degree of external fibrillation with high resolution showed that the fiber wallthickness of the latewood fibers was reduced by increasing the refining energy in adouble <b>disc</b> <b>refiner</b> operated at four levels of specific energy input in a commercial TMP production line. This was expected but could not be seen by the use of average values, it was concluded that fiber characteristics in many cases should be evaluated as distributions and not only as averages. BIN distributions of various types of mechanical pulps from Norway spruce showed results that were expected based on knowledge of the particular pulps and processes. Measurements of mixtures of a news‐ and a SC (super calendered) gradeTMP, showed a gradual increase in high‐BIN fibers with higher amounts of SCgrade TMP. The BIN distributions also revealed differences between the pulps that were not seen from average fiber values, for example that the shape of the BINdistributions was similar for two pulps that originated from conical disc refiners, a news grade TMP and the board grade CTMP, although the distributions were on different BIN levels. The SC grade TMP and the SC grade SGW had similar levels of tensile index, but the SGW contained some fibers of very low BIN values which may influence the characteristics of the final paper, for example strength, surface and structure. This shows that the BIN model has the potential of being applied on either the whole or parts of a papermaking process based on mechanical or chemimechanical pulping; the evaluation of distributions of fiber characteristics can contribute to increased knowledge about the process and opportunities to optimize it...|$|E
