5|$|In July 1968, Nelson {{failed to}} appear for a planned meeting {{with an old}} friend. John DuBois, at whose house the meeting was {{supposed}} to take place, became worried and drove to Nelson's camp.

5|$|Brunner {{returned}} {{to the mouth of}} the Buller River in March 1861 but this time aboard a ship. Working in much greater comfort than on his last visit to the area in 1848, with other members of his staff <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> and laid out sections for what would become the town of Westport. Later that month he did the same for Greymouth. The work was soon completed and the party {{returned to}} Nelson in April 1861.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe charged Jones {{with the}} {{surveying}} {{and construction of}} a new road from Lake Ontario to the Thames River. Simcoe employed the Queen's Rangers led by Captain Samuel Smith for the road's construction, from Hamilton to Woodstock. This road would become Dundas Street. The same year, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> Flamborough Township, Beverley Township, Ancaster Township and York Township. Jones spent 1794 surveying Flamborough, Glanford, Binbrook, Delaware, Oxford, Dorchester, Burford, Grimsby and Windham.|$|E

5|$|Racism was {{the main}} target of DuBois's polemics, and he {{strongly}} protested against lynching, Jim Crow laws, and discrimination in education and employment. His cause included people of color everywhere, particularly Africans and Asians in colonies. He was a proponent of Pan-Africanism and helped organize several Pan-African Congresses {{to fight for the}} independence of African colonies from European powers. DuBois made several trips to Europe, Africa and Asia. After World War I, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> the experiences of American black soldiers in France and documented widespread prejudice in the United States military.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{creation}} of Woodford County, Marshall moved within its borders and was appointed county surveyor by Virginia Governor Beverley Randolph. In this capacity, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> and claimed significant additional tracts of land, becoming one of Kentucky's most wealthy citizens. According to tradition, Marshall was known to boast that he could ride from Frankfort to Versailles, a distance of some , and never enter a tract of land that he didn't own. He was also supposed to have boasted that he measured his silver coinage by the peck, not having time to count the individual coins.|$|E
5|$|To {{test this}} idea <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> {{hundreds}} of stone rows and circles. Any individual alignment could indicate a direction by chance, but {{he planned to}} show that together the distribution of alignments was non-random, showing {{that there was an}} astronomical intent to the orientation of {{at least some of the}} alignments. His results indicated the existence of eight, sixteen, or perhaps even thirty-two approximately equal divisions of the year. The two solstices, the two equinoxes and four cross-quarter days, days half-way between a solstice and the equinox were associated with the medieval Celtic calendar. While not all these conclusions have been accepted, it has had an enduring influence on archaeoastronomy, especially in Europe.|$|E

5|$|While in office, in 2001 Reed {{served as}} the {{campaign}} manager in Shirley Franklin's successful election campaign to become the 58th Mayor of Atlanta. As a campaign manager in an election occurring {{in the shadow of}} the September 11 attacks, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> potential voters' perceptions of the propriety of the campaign's advertising broadcasts. At the time certain ads were thought to focus on sensitive topics. After winning the election, Franklin chose Reed as one of two co-chairs on her transition team. In this role he was charged with identifying and reviewing candidates for cabinet-level positions.|$|E
5|$|As chief {{engineer}} to the Military Division of the Pacific, {{he was the}} top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officer on the entire American Pacific Coast. Upon his arrival on the West Coast, he visited locations from Alaska to the Mexican border in order to analyze the work that would be needed. Between 1868 and 1870, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> numerous California harbors and made engineering suggestions as required. One of these suggestions resulted {{in the construction of}} a 7,000-foot breakwater that made Long Beach harbor accessible to large amounts of shipping for the first time. In 1870, he suggested that landowners near Colusa, California, construct levees to contain the Sacramento River within a single channel. The plan would reclaim swampland and control the river's annual floods, making large-scale farming possible. The plan was eagerly seized upon by local residents.|$|E
5|$|Following {{improvements}} to the River Arun in 1615, which allowed boats to reach Pallingham, they could also navigate part of the Rother, as far upstream as Fittleworth. The canal engineer William Jessop was asked to survey the river below Petworth Mills in 1783, and was recalled in 1790, when <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> it below Midhurst. In the same year, {{the construction of the}} Arun Navigation was finished, and in 1791, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont, who was based at Petworth House, obtained an Act of Parliament which would enable him to improve the Rother. The Act also authorised a branch canal to Petworth. Since he owned most of the land adjacent to the river, the precise route of the navigation was not specified, and he was free to improve the channel or make cuts as he saw fit. The only restriction was that cuts could not be made through gardens or enclosed grounds. Compared to most other canals at the time, the charges for using the navigation were low, as the Earl wanted to develop the region rather than make a profit.|$|E

5|$|Monroe studied {{surveying}} {{and began}} his career in public service as the county surveyor for Hampshire County. During his tenure, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> {{the majority of the}} county's land tracts. Monroe read law in Romney under prominent local attorney, Alfred P. White. While studying law, he was elected to represent Hampshire County in the Virginia House of Delegates alongside William P. Stump between 1850 and 1851. Monroe {{was a member of the}} Virginia House of Delegates during the 1851 reform of the Constitution of Virginia. In 1857, he was nominated as a Democratic candidate to represent the Hampshire County district in the Senate of Virginia. Monroe was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1858 at the age of 41 and engaged in a law practice in Romney. In 1859, he was elected the Commonwealth's Attorney for Hampshire County.|$|E
5|$|Harald {{became the}} first of the two Bohr {{brothers}} to earn a master's degree, which he earned for mathematics in April 1909. Niels took another nine months to earn his. Students had to submit a thesis on a subject assigned by their supervisor. Bohr's supervisor was Christiansen, and the topic he chose was the electron theory of metals. Bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger Doctor of Philosophy (dr. phil.) thesis. <b>He</b> <b>surveyed</b> the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by Paul Drude and elaborated by Hendrik Lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. Bohr extended Lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the Hall effect, and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. The thesis was accepted in April 1911, and Bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 May. Harald had received his doctorate the previous year. Bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside Scandinavia because it was written in Danish, a Copenhagen University requirement at the time. In 1921, the Dutch physicist Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from Bohr's thesis that is today known as the Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem.|$|E

25|$|By 1845, he had {{completed}} the railroad from Augusta to Marthasville (present-day Atlanta). At 173 miles (278.4km), it was the longest railroad {{in the world at}} the time. Thomson later bought control of the Montgomery and West Point Railroad and helped finance and locate the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. Also in 1845, <b>he</b> <b>surveyed</b> and designed the Augusta Canal for lawyer Henry Cumming, which was completed two years later.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field, Hadamard uses introspection to {{describe}} mathematical thought processes.
