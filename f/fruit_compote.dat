These and many other desserts will be on offer {{at one of the}} many Konditorei of Vienna, where they are generally eaten with coffee in the afternoon.|$|R
50|$|The pancake {{is split}} with two forks into pieces while frying and usually {{sprinkled}} with powdered sugar, then served hot with apple or plum sauce or various <b>fruit</b> <b>compotes,</b> including plum, lingonberry, strawberry, or apple. Kaiserschmarren is eaten like a dessert, {{or it can}} also be eaten for lunch at tourist places like mountainside restaurants and taverns in the Austrian Alps, as a quite filling meal.|$|R
50|$|Bramley apples {{work well}} in pies, cooked <b>fruit</b> <b>compotes</b> and salads, crumbles, and other dessert dishes. They are also used {{in a variety of}} chutney recipes, as well as in cider making. Whole Bramley apples, cored and filled with dried fruit, baked, and then served with custard is an {{inexpensive}} and traditional British pudding. Cooked apple sauce is the traditional accompaniment to roast pork. Hot apple sauce goes very well with ice cream.|$|R
50|$|As for beverages, {{traditionally}} dried <b>fruit</b> <b>compote</b> or cranberry kisiel (spanguolių kisielius) are common. In {{earlier times}} oaten kisiel was more common.|$|E
5000|$|Differently from kompot, hoşaf {{is always}} served cold. Whereas, the similar, and more universal, fresh <b>fruit</b> <b>compote</b> is called [...] "komposto" [...] in Turkish.|$|E
50|$|The cuisine {{was largely}} Eastern European, {{including}} pierogi, challah, matzah brei, kasha varnishkis (Kasha over bow-tie pasta), blintzes, <b>fruit</b> <b>compote</b> and so on, though typically American {{items such as}} french fries were also available.|$|E

5000|$|Müller Corner (German: Joghurt mit der Ecke, lit. Yogurt {{with the}} Corner), {{launched}} in the 1980s, is a range of yogurts. There are three main varieties: Fruit, Healthy Balance and Crunch!. Within each of these divisions, a number of flavours are produced, for instance Fruit Corners are available in Blackberry & Raspberry, Blueberry, Cherry, Peach & Apricot, Raspberry and Strawberry flavours. The name [...] "corner" [...] is {{in reference to the}} design of the product. In many of the varieties the yogurt is plain and unflavoured. It comes with an attached portion of 'flavour', <b>fruit</b> <b>compote</b> for example, to add to the plain yogurt.|$|E
5000|$|United Kingdom and Ireland: In the United Kingdom and Ireland, cheesecake is {{typically}} {{made with a}} base of crushed, buttered biscuits and often topped with a <b>fruit</b> <b>compote.</b> The most common commercial varieties are black cherry, blackcurrant, strawberry, passionfruit, raspberry, and lemon curd. The usual filling {{is a mixture of}} cream cheese, sugar, and cream and it is not baked, but refrigerated. Gelatine (sometimes in the form of fruit-flavored dessert jelly) may also be mixed in with the cheese/cream mixture to keep the filling firm. Variations are common, and include banoffee, coffee, tea, chocolate, Irish cream, white chocolate, and marshmallow flavors. Savory smoked salmon cheesecake is made in Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fruits of}} the Cavendish bananas are eaten raw, used in baking, <b>fruit</b> salads, <b>fruit</b> <b>compotes,</b> and to {{complement}} foods. The outer skin is partially green when sold in food markets, and turns yellow when it ripens. As it ripens the starches turn to sugar making a sweeter fruit. When it reaches its final stage (stage 7), brown/black [...] "sugar spots" [...] develop. When overripe, the skin turns black and the flesh becomes mushy. Bananas ripen naturally until they are picked. Once picked they no longer turn yellow on their own, {{and need to be}} gassed with ethylene gas to start up ripening again. Bananas which are turning yellow emit ethylene. Most retailers sell bananas in stages 3-6, with stage 4 being the most ideal.The PLUs used for Cavendish bananas are 4011 (yellow) and 4186 (small yellow). Organic Cavendish bananas are assigned PLU 94011. Due to their cylindrical shape, they are sometimes used in sexual education classes in order to demonstrate correct usage of a condom.|$|R
5000|$|The {{choice of}} desserts in Uzbek cuisines are limited. A typical festive meal ends with <b>fruit</b> or a <b>compote</b> of fresh or dried fruit, {{followed}} by nuts and halvah with green tea.|$|R
5|$|Fruit {{is served}} as a snack or dessert {{alongside}} other items or by themselves. Fresh-squeezed fruit juices are prepared at street kiosks, and sold bottled in supermarkets. Various fruits are added to chicken or meat dishes and fresh <b>fruit</b> salad and <b>compote</b> are often served {{at the end of}} the meal.|$|R
50|$|In France, {{a typical}} {{domestic}} breakfast {{consists of a}} cup of coffee, often café au lait, or hot chocolate, sometimes accompanied by a glass of orange or grapefruit juice. The main food consists of sweet products such as tartines (slices of baguette or other breads spread with butter, jam or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink. Brioches and other pastries such as croissants, pains au chocolat (chocolatine) and pains aux raisins are also traditional, but more of a weekend special treat. Other products such as breakfast cereals, <b>fruit</b> <b>compote,</b> fromage blanc, and yogurt are becoming increasingly common {{as part of the}} meal. A traditional French breakfast does not include any savory product, but breakfast buffets in hotels often include ham, cheese and eggs.|$|E
5000|$|Jewish {{law also}} {{requires}} that kosher wines {{that are to}} be served to observant Jews by non-Jewish waiters must be mevushal, which means [...] "boiled" [...] in Hebrew. Israeli wine critic Daniel Rogov described the common wisdom about the shortcomings of mevushal kosher wines: [...] "nearly everyone knows that that after a few months in bottle, most mevushal (flash pasteurized) wines tend to offer cooked aromas and flavors, and too often remind one more of oxidized <b>fruit</b> <b>compote</b> than of fine wine." [...] Rogov praises Weir's success at the process: [...] "No one is quite sure how Hagafen winemaker Ernie Weir does it, but his are among the very few flash pasteurized wines to have escaped this fate, and his wines, frequently earning scores of 90 or above, tend to be rather long lived. Some may think that shipping kosher wines to Israel is somewhat akin to selling ice to Eskimos, but in this case the Hagafen wines are a most welcome addition to local shelves." ...|$|E
50|$|Christmas Day is a {{national}} holiday in Poland and most Poles spend the day feasting with their family. The Christmas meal is quite a feast, served in the evening on 24 December, offering large quantities of food. This Christmas Eve meal is called Wigilia. After the first star appears in the sky, everyone shares the Christmas wafer (opłatek) and wishes good things for the coming year. Then supper begins. The meal is meatless, honoring Catholic tradition. Many households also prepare {{a great variety of}} special Christmas dishes, typically numbering 12 in honor of the 12 apostles. Dishes include: stuffed carp, fried carp, herring in wine sauce, herring in cream sauce, <b>fruit</b> <b>compote,</b> vegetable salad, soup (beetroot, mushroom, or fish) with uszka, pierogi, peas and carrots, boiled potatoes, mushroom cream sauce, sauerkraut, and makowiec (poppy seed rolled cake). Most households leave an empty plate at the table for an unexpected guest. Straw or hay is usually on the table to symbolize the manger. During the season, pierniczki, or honey ginger cookies, are baked.|$|E
50|$|Packaged muesli is a loose {{mixture of}} mainly rolled oats or {{cornflakes}} together with various dried fruit pieces, nuts, and seeds. It commonly contains other rolled cereal grains such as wheat or rye flakes. There are many varieties, which may also contain honey, spices, or chocolate. This dry packaged muesli can store {{for many months}} and served quickly after mixing with milk, filmjölk, yogurt, coffee, hot chocolate, fruit juice, or water. If desired, pieces of fresh fruit may be added. Alternatively, the mix may be soaked overnight in milk and then served with fresh <b>fruit</b> or <b>compote</b> to taste.|$|R

5000|$|After the First Star {{appears in}} the sky and after sharing the Christmas wafer (opłatek), the Supper begins. A {{traditional}} Christmas meal in Poland includes fish dishes and Borscht (beetroot soup) with Uszka (tortellini). Fish provides a main component of the Christmas Eve meal across Poland; since 1940 more popular are carp fillet, carp in aspic, [...] "carp Jewish-style" [...] (gefilte fish) etc. Wigilia is observed as a Black Fast meaning that most Poles abstain from eating meat on this day. Many households also prepare a great variety of special Christmas rollmops, matjas herring, poppy seed cakes (makowiec), dried <b>fruit</b> <b>compote</b> and other delicacies including edible Christmas ornaments. Common dishes are various fruits (dried apples, plums, apricots, dates, etc.) and salads. Regional dishes include żurek, siemieniotka (in Silesia), mushroom soup, different salads, pierogi filled with cheese and potatoes as well as cooked dried mushrooms and cabbage (kapusta) or cabbage and yellow peas; stuffed cabbage with mushrooms and rice gołąbki (cabbage rolls), kluski with poppyseed, kutia, and makówki (in Silesia).|$|E
5000|$|Since sponge cakes are not leavened with yeast, {{they are}} popular dessert {{choices for the}} Passover feast. Typically, Passover sponges are made with matzo meal, {{shredded}} coconut, matzo flour, potato flour, or nut flour (almond, hazelnut etc.) since raw wheat products may not be used. [...] No raising agent may {{be used due to}} the strict prohibition of even the appearance of a leavening effect. Therefore, the beating of egg whites in the mix to achieve the aeration is an essential characteristic of any Passover sponge recipe. So popular is the sponge cake at Passover that many families have at least one recipe they pass down through generations which {{is referred to as the}} Passover sponge cake, and matzo meal-based cake mixes are available commercially. Several brands are easily found in kosher stores, especially before Passover. Typical flavorings include almonds, apples, dark chocolate, lemon, pecans, and poppy seeds. Apple or orange juice is the liquid ingredient. Milk is avoided, because it cannot be included in a dessert to be served after a meat based meal. The sponge, or a heavier variant in the form of an almond pudding, may be included as an element of the dessert in the Passover meal during the Seder service, when it is often combined in serving with a <b>fruit</b> <b>compote.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{choice of}} desserts in Bukharan Jewish and Uzbek cuisines are limited. A typical festive meal ends with <b>fruit</b> or a <b>compote</b> of fresh or dried fruit, {{followed}} by nuts and halvah with green tea. A Bukharan Jewish specialty for guests on a Shabbat afternoon is Chai Kaymoki - green tea mixed, {{contrary to the}} standard Uzbek practice, with a generous measure of milk (in 1:1 proportions) and a tablespoon of butter in the teapot. The tea is sometimes sprinkled with chopped almonds or walnuts before serving.|$|R
50|$|A lot of Israelis keep {{fruit trees}} in their yards, citrus (especially orange and lemon) {{being the most}} common. Mangos are also now popular as {{household}} trees. Mulberry trees are frequently seen in public gardens, and their fruit is popularly served alongside various desserts and as a juice. Fruit is served as a snack or dessert alongside other items or by themselves. Fresh-squeezed fruit juices are prepared at street kiosks, and sold bottled in supermarkets. Various fruits are added to chicken or meat dishes and fresh <b>fruit</b> salad and <b>compote</b> are often served {{at the end of}} the meal.|$|R
5000|$|... 1866 was an {{important}} year for Halse because he was commissioned to design part of Copeland's dessert service for the Prince and Princess of Wales. He modelled four female figures supporting <b>fruit</b> dishes (or <b>compotes)</b> and representing the four elements 'Earth, Air, Fire and Water'. The service is in the Royal Collection at Sandringham House but at present Halse's contributions are not on public display because they are damaged. The figures are amongst his most successful showing a gentle lyricism and a light touch. His Trysting Tree Boy and the companion girl also made for Copeland share the charm and lightness of the elemental figures.|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of some metals in fruit compotes packed in cans. There is described the production of fruit compotes and metal packaging legislation relating to the studied issues, the possibility of contamination of food packaging components, packaging corrosion, metal migration from packaging and techniques used {{for the analysis of}} metals in the food industry. Concentrations of metals in 14 different fruit compotes from a commercial network in the Czech Republic were determined by ICP-MS technique in the experimental part. Concentrations of metals were detected only in the juice of stewed fruit, because the juice is in direct contact with the surface of packaging, and metals are transferred first into it. The measured values were compared with the maximum permissible levels of metals in <b>fruit</b> <b>compote</b> determined by European legislation. In some cases there were found higher concentrations of tin, but other metals did not exceed the allowable amounts. Concentrations of metals in the compote varied depending on the kind of compote, which could be due to a different chemical composition of compotes depending on the origin of food and process of the fruit production, or a different cans coating material...|$|E
40|$|Sensitive and {{reliable}} analytical methodology {{has been developed}} for the measurement of patulin in regulated foodstuffs by using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS) with triple quadrupole analyser. Solid samples were extracted with ethyl acetate, while liquid samples were directly injected into the chromatographic system after dilution and filtration without any clean-up step. Chromatographic separation was achieved in less than 4 min. Electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) sources were evaluated, {{in order to assess}} matrix effects. The use of ESI source caused strong signal suppression in samples; however, matrix effect was negligible using APCI, allowing quantification with calibration standards prepared in solvent. The method was validated in four different apple matrices (juice, <b>fruit,</b> puree and <b>compote)</b> at two concentrations at the low μg kg− 1 level. Average recoveries (n = 5) ranged from 71 % to 108 %, with RSDs lower than 14...|$|R
60|$|We {{returned}} to Paris, after a pleasant visit of three days at Lagrange, during {{which we had}} delightful weather, and altogether a most agreeable time. The habits of the family are very regular and simple, but the intercourse has the freedom and independence of a country-house. We {{were all in the}} circular drawing-room a little before ten, breakfast being served between ten and eleven. The table was French, the morning repast consisting of light dishes of meat, <b>compotes,</b> <b>fruits,</b> and sometimes soupe au lait, one of the simplest and best things for such a meal than can be imagined. As a compliment to us Americans, we had fish fried and broiled, but I rather think this was an innovation. Wine, to drink with water, as a matter of course, was on the table. The whole ended with a cup of café au lait. The morning then passed as each one saw fit. The young men went shooting, the ladies drove out, or read, or had a little music, while the general and myself were either walking about the farm, or were conversing in the library. We dined at six, as at Paris, and tea was made in the drawing-room about nine.|$|R
