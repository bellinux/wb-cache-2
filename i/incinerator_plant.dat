It {{remained}} submerged for over a week, {{with much of the}} equipment suffering catastrophic damage. Once the water subsided, imaginative ways had to be found to return it to operation within a reasonable time. The analyser which measures emissions from the <b>incinerator</b> <b>plant</b> had been completely destroyed, and in order to mitigate a 16-week delivery time, the manufacturers removed one from a training centre at Telford, and it was hired by Yorkshire Water until a new unit could be supplied. The plant was recommissioned and operational just 18 days after its inundation.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 1968, {{a fire at}} {{the former}} <b>incinerator</b> <b>plant</b> off Route 611, where the Peace Candle was being stored, {{destroyed}} the four smaller candles that surround {{the base of the}} larger candle. The fire was believed to have started by someone playing with matches inside the building. Firefighters battled the blaze for more than an hour. Damage was estimated at a cost of $1,200. Initially, city officials announced the fire would not delay the lighting ceremony planned for December 1. However, the Easton Area Christmas Committee had already been debating {{the construction of a new}} Peace Candle prior to the fire. On October 29, Henry Schultz, now chairman of the Christmas committee, announced the four smaller candles were damaged beyond repair and no effort would be made to rebuild them. Instead, the committee would build an entirely new candle within a year.|$|E

500|$|In 1961, the Christmas Candle {{fell into}} a state of disrepair, and the {{contractors}} who assemble the candle for discounted prices in previous years informed the city they could not handle the project again. The Easton Area Christmas Committee also had trouble raising additional money needed for the repairs, For all these reasons, they decided not to assemble the candle again. The candle was placed into storage at an old <b>incinerator</b> <b>plant</b> on Pennsylvania Route 611, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee sought alternative decorations for its holiday program. In 1961, 24 streams of multi-colored Christmas light strands (totaling 2,650 bulbs) were draped {{from the top of the}} monument to the edges of Centre Square, creating an umbrella-like shape of lights. More than 200 Christmas Trees were also placed around the base of the monument, along with a nativity scene and Christmas light decorations on the nearby bridges. The set-up cost only $2,000, compared to the average $3,000 for the Christmas Candle display. This display was used for the next five years, and the decorations around the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument came to be known as [...] "the umbrella of Christmas lights".|$|E

The cement kiln has a high temperature, long remaining time, and can solidify the heavy metals, dispose the solid, semi-solid or liquid wastes. To dispose the wastes in cement kiln will not cause the new emissions. In addition, it is cheaper than building the new <b>incinerator</b> <b>plants.</b> So utilizing the cement kiln is good way to dispose wastes in environment and economy. Now China has more than 600 NSP cement kilns. If each kiln can dispose 100 000 tons wastes, China cement industry would dispose about 60 million tons wastes per year...|$|R

30|$|With {{the ever}} {{increasing}} population of Nigerians, {{there is a}} corresponding increase in health care delivery/facilities; the amount of hospital waste generated is also increasing substantially. About 2.5 million tons of waste is generated per year around OAUTHC complex (Inyang, 2010). A large amount of solid waste is generated in the hospital during {{diagnosis and treatment of}} diseases. The solid waste may contain human organs, bandages, syringes, test tubes, tissues cell culture and other plastic materials. These wastes can cause health hazards and indeed, is a veritable source of transmission of HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B and other diseases. The incinerator is an effective and hygienic way for disposal of hospital waste. It is only in very few teaching hospitals in Nigeria that there exits functional incinerators. In Western Europe more than 600 <b>incinerator</b> <b>plants</b> are in operation Li et al., 2003.

METHODS 1 Year changes in frequency of PVCs and HRV were measured in 49 shift workers and 22 control subjects working in daytime. All respondents were starting in a new job in integrated circuit or waste <b>incinerator</b> <b>plants.</b> RESULTSThe incidence of PVC increased significantly in shift workers over the 1 year follow up, compared with daytime workers. The frequency of ventricular extrasystoles increased in 48. 9 f the shift workers, and in 27. 3 f the daytime workers. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the number of nights worked and the change in PVCs was 0. 33 (p= 0. 004). A small non-significant unfavourable change in HRV was found in both the shift and daytime workers.
