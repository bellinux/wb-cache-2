5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

After starting in row 2 Andretti got victimized by a controversial wreck during the pace-laps when rookie Kevin Cogan suddenly spun out for no apparent reason.

500|$|Vandalism from [...] "Soaping", putting dish {{detergent}} in the fountain, {{has been}} common, {{and the massive}} amounts of generated foam cause more than $1000 damage, due {{to the need to}} drain and clean the fountain. In the first [...] "soaping" [...] incident soap and green dye was placed in the fountain the night before it opened. Another incident happened in September 2002. In 2007, the Portland Water Bureau posted the name and photograph of a 19-year-old who placed dish soap in the fountain and received a misdemeanor criminal mischief. The public shaming of the teen caused the incident to be discussed in many places, including KATU, The Oregonian, The Portland Mercury ("This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> you screw with the Water Bureau"), and The New York Times ("Don't mess with the Portland Water Bureau"). The fountain was soaped at least four times in August 2007 alone.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1982 Indianapolis 500, second-year driver Kevin Cogan, {{teammate}} to polesitter Rick Mears, suddenly spun right when accelerating for the green flag. Cogan bounced off A. J. Foyt, slamming Foyt's steering rod. That contact turned Cogan's car left at a 90 degree angle to the field where he was promptly t-boned by Mario. Andretti was livid and engaged in a shoving match with Cogan before walking off. In an interview, 3 minutes after the wreck, an irked Andretti was heard saying [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> you have children doing a man's job up front." [...] Andretti's Patrick Racing teammate that year was the eventual race winner, Gordon Johncock, who started next to Andretti in the middle of row two. In later years, Johncock pointed out that Andretti had jumped the start, and could have avoided the spinning car of Cogan had he been lined up properly in the second row next to Gordy.|$|E

One night, he encountered Keith Lawler, who played guitar in another band at the time, and Lawler began drumming with Ryan. In 2002, the duo released a split single with Mr. Creosote titled [...] "Darko Filopovic", a song which would later feature as the final track on their debut album. By 2003, they had supported several more established acts, including Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Rocket from the Crypt. In 2003, {{there were reports that}} the duo's debut album, titled Is it ok to be loud, Jesus?, would be released on a label called Larry Gogan Records but this later emerged to be a joke published by a fledgling Foggy Notions. The duo's debut album was in fact published on 3 July 2003 with that same title by the independent label Out On A Limb Records as the label's first release, with Giveamanakick having finished recording it in January that year. It received two out of five stars in a review by RTÉ's Tom Grealis who wrote, [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> rawness comes without any real sense of purpose".

According to Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, Shelton {{was the source}} of inspiration for the track, which reveals Stefani's [...] "giddy new-crush enthusiasm". Both [...] "Truth" [...] and lead single [...] "Used to Love You" [...] are described as [...] "truth-telling" [...] songs by Kitty Empire of The Guardian. With [...] "Used to Love You", Stefani comes to terms with herself, dealing with the aftermath of her divorce, and realizing that her relationship with Rossdale is over. Produced by Rotem, the track is a [...] "vulnerable" [...] and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, designed to [...] "showcase her passionate, conflicted vocals". In an interview with Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, and claimed that the song was only written a few weeks before its release. The seventh track, [...] "Send Me a Picture", has dancehall elements, and was described as a sexting ode by several publications; furthermore, Mapes stated the song has a [...] "Bieber-hits-the-islands vibe", while Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club summarized its meaning as [...] "captur the delicious anticipation of a crush potentially texting a snap". [...] "Red Flag" [...] is an [...] "upbeat in-your face track" [...] beginning with [...] "an intro that sounds like a melting violin", followed by Stefani scorning her ex: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> you don't listen to what your mother say." [...] Amanda Dykan of AltWire.net found it reminiscent of 2000's [...] "Ex-Girlfriend" [...] and compared Stefani's rapping style to that of Lady Gaga's.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from initial stress. When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns).
