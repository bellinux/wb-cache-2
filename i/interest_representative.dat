40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} the presence of proteomic signatures of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) in saliva and their use as potential biomarkers for early and non-invasive diagnosis, as well as prognostication. Methods. Saliva from 45 OSCC patients and 30 healthy controls was analysed by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry and ProteinChip® technology. Proteomic profiles were tested with differential expression analysis and fold change of protein peaks, principal component analysis, Spearman rank correlation test and hierarchical clustering in order to identify a list of peaks of <b>interest</b> <b>representative</b> of controls, N- and N+ cases. Those peaks were used in a supervised artificial neural network in order to classify samples according to the following conditions: controls vs OSCC, controls vs N-, and controls vs N+. Results. When compared with controls, four peaks (i. e. 6913, 11948, 13287 and 27280 m/z) were significantly altered in both N- group and N+ group; four peaks (i. e. 3353, 3433, 3482 and 4136 m/z) were selectively altered in Ngroup; eight peaks were selectively altered in N+ group (i. e. 4038, 7133, 11755, 13746, 13841, 14264, 16807, 17127 m/z).

3000|$|Generally, {{the road}} edges are {{characterized}} by a high-contrast region with low curvature and constant width. With real road images, a determinist description of the road geometry {{can be a challenge}} since the road may vary in the form of various road conditions and quality of road markings used to demarcate lane boundaries. Actually, detection strategy proposed by [14] presents a conceptually simple approach for edge detection, followed by edge grouping and pruning. However, as a single hypothesis is used, the recognition process still has problems to follow the lane road through video sequence due to false detections. To keep track of the roadsides, a multihypotheses approach of road recognition can be employed by using various classifications of zones of <b>interest</b> (<b>representative</b> of the road region in image). In fact, this method allows eliminating all the false detections of road edges. The algorithm of sequential recognition is obtained {{on the basis of the}} recursive recognition approach presented in [14] applied to accomplishing the different hypotheses in order to identify an optimal hypothesis before the algorithm converges. In addition, the recognition of the roadsides is performed by two main steps: learning and multiple hypothesis recognition. The main feature of this algorithm can be summarized into three phases: [...]...|$|E

40|$|European Union (EU) {{funding of}} civil society {{organizations}} (CSOs) is a substantial and important part of EU governance, but study of such funding is scarce and theoretically underdeveloped. To fill this gap, this article analyzes the main features of EU funding of CSOs {{and its effects on}} the EU system of interest representation, drawing on policy documents and the EU register of <b>interest</b> <b>representatives.</b> The resulting analysis shows that EU funding of CSOs in the social sector tends to reflect many of the characteristics of the model of associative democracy. European funds are being directed to groups that voice the concerns of excluded groups and, in this way, address imbalances in EU interest representation. The EU also promotes certain healthy features among CSOs, since it restricts access to funding opportunities to interest groups fulfilling key normative criteria. Hence, the EU helps sustain, but does not significantly constrain, the development of European CSOs...|$|R
