25|$|The Transfer System on {{the other}} hand, was never popular with the racers. While very {{efficient}} and less error prone than the cumulative method (and allowing the ABA to run much quicker events with fewer finish line scores), the good racers generally did not like it since they would only get to race once, win their transfer moto and wait for hours if the races are big enough to race the mains ({{on the other}} <b>hand</b> <b>you</b> get to relax a little without the anxiety of doing poorly {{in the next two}} qualifying motos). This means the racers race less often in the ABA and the fun of BMX is in the racing, even if you are losing. Even racers who do not do well did not like the transfer system because the fewer actual races you are in, the less chance you will have to improve your skills in actual race conditions You also race two times less for your money paid for in entrance fees in the ABA in the Transfer system if you win your first moto.|$|E

500|$|The album's muddy, gritty {{sound was}} {{due in part to}} this overdubbing and erasing and mixing {{techniques}} nearly drowned out undubbed sounds. Miles Marshall Lewis stated [...] "Never before on a Sly and the Family Stone album were songs open to so much interpretation, and even more so, dripping with cynicism. On the other <b>hand</b> <b>you</b> can hardly hear what he's saying for most of the album. Like Radiohead's Kid A or even the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. more recent to the time, a murkiness in the mix of the record inhibits complete comprehension of the words." [...] Stone felt that the rhythm box made unrealistic sounds if used as designed, so he resorted to overdubbing the drum sounds manually, again contributing to the difficult mix.|$|E

At 17 years old, in his journal Sirius, she published her first poem which could be translated as [...] "On his <b>hand</b> <b>you</b> may see many glittering rings", (1907) signing it [...] "Anna G." [...] She soon became known in St Petersburg's artistic circles, regularly giving public readings. That year, she wrote unenthusiastically to a friend, “He has loved me for three years now, and I {{believe that it is}} my fate to be his wife. Whether or not I love him, I do not know, {{but it seems to me}} that I do.” [...] She married Gumilev in Kiev in April 1910; however, none of Akhmatova’s family attended the wedding.

[...] Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly {{said he would have}} advised Parker and Stone not to do the episode out of fear of retaliation: [...] "On the one <b>hand</b> <b>you</b> do have to admire their courage. But I don't know whether the risk–reward [...] is worth it." [...] The Daily Telegraph writer Douglas Murray said the entry only gave [...] "200" [...] more legitimacy, writing, [...] " [...] of course just confirms the point that the South Park boys were making. [...] I'd have said that was point proved. South Park 1: Islamists 0." [...] On the April 22, 2010, episode of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, host Jon Stewart went into a ten-minute tirade about the alleged death threats, expressing disgust at the alleged hypocrisy of Revolution Muslim's speech while its members enjoy the American lifestyle and freedom of speech.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} linger on Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of what looks like a {{thousand}} mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick you before they <b>hand</b> <b>you</b> the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience [...] "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".|$|E

500|$|The initial {{location}} for principal photography for True Detective was Arkansas; however, Pizzolatto later opted to film in southern Louisiana {{to capitalize on}} generous statewide tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape, which he felt illustrated a striking paradox. [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all," [...] the native Louisianan noted. [...] "Everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other <b>hand</b> <b>you</b> have {{the beauty of it}} all from a distance." [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] and subsequent episodes were shot in 35 mm film, and principal photography for the season consumed 100 consecutive days. The crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside of Erath, Louisiana which, because it was partially burned, inspired a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for corresponding scenes. Fukunaga recruited Adam Arkapaw, previously director of photography for Top of the Lake, as project cinematographer and employed minimalistic lighting for layering composition. Also involved in production was Alex DiGerlando, who Fukunaga had previously worked with on Benh Zeitlin Glory at Sea (2008). The director remarked in an interview, [...] "I knew what Alex accomplished in the swamps of Louisiana and given some money, how much more amazing he could be in building sets that would just be used for one or two days and be abandoned again." ...|$|E
500|$|The concerts held on October18,2007 at the Scottrade Center in St. Louis and October26,2007 in the EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City were filmed for a Disney Digital 3D release, a {{group of}} {{three-dimensional}} films distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. The film, entitled , was directed by Bruce Hendricks and produced by Art Repola. The film compiled some of the show's performances, along with backstage footage. Cyrus said Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert was made for individuals who did not attend a concert during the tour due to ticket scalping. She continued, [...] "This is like better than front row. You could reach out and feel like you can touch my <b>hand,</b> <b>you</b> could see me right then, right there, {{right in front of}} you, which is so fun." [...] It was released on February1,2008 to American cinema, with an intended span of one week at theaters. The film was released to a total of 683, with an extra four being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed over $31.1million. With its opening week sales, the film set multiple records. It became the highest box office total for Super Bowl weekend, the highest-grossing opening for a three-dimensional film, and highest per-screen average ever– $42,000 per screen. It went on to gross over $42.8million in its entire opening week, becoming the highest-grossing film of that week and the film with the fewest theaters to debut at number one. Following its commercial success, the film's run was extended; it eventually closed on May15,2008, playing in theaters for 15 weeks. With a total gross of $70.6million worldwide, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert was once the highest-selling concert film of all time, until surpassed by Michael Jackson's This Is It (2009), which sold over $189million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Initially, True Detective {{first season}} {{was due to}} shoot in Arkansas, but Pizzolatto later chose to film in Louisiana to take {{advantage}} of state tax incentives and the area's distinctive landscape: [...] "There's a contradictory nature to the place and a sort of sinister quality underneath it all...everything lives under layers of concealment. The woods are thick and dark and impenetrable. On the other <b>hand</b> <b>you</b> have the beauty of it all from a distance." [...] Principal photography took three months (between 100 and 110 days), from January to June 2013. Approximately five minutes of film were shot per day. Production staff constructed various set pieces, among them a scorched chapel, Joel Theriot's tent revival, and the Louisiana State Criminal Investigations Division offices, the last of which they built inside an abandoned light bulb warehouse near Elmwood. For the Dora Lange crime scene, the crew filmed exterior shots at a remote sugarcane field outside Erath which, because it was partially burned, inspired what DiGerlando called a [...] "moody and atmospheric" [...] backdrop for the corresponding interior scenes. The scene in which Cohle, taking Ginger hostage, escapes a housing complex amidst gunfire, was captured in Bridge City as a single six-minute tracking shot, a technique Fukunaga had employed in Sin Nombre (2009) and Jane Eyre (2011). Shot in seven takes, preparation for the scene was extensive and demanding: McConaughey trained with Mark Norby to master a fighting style for his character, {{and the nature of the}} shoot required a team of stunt coordinators, make-up artists, and special effects crew on hand during its entire course. Elsewhere, shooting took place at the old Kenner High School campus and nineteenth-century Fort Macomb, located outside New Orleans.|$|E

You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him." [...] Michael Young said of Rivera, [...] "I respect Mo more than anybody in the game.

[...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, and that made carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E
