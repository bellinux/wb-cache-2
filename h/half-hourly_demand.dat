40|$|Abstract — This paper {{employs a}} Monte Carlo based {{decision-support}} tool {{to assess the}} expected overall generation costs and risks of different thermal plant portfolios with high wind power penetrations. In particular, we present {{a case study of}} an electricity industry with Coal, CCGT, OCGT and Wind generation options that faces uncertain future fuel prices, carbon pricing, demand, and plant capital costs. The tool uses <b>half-hourly</b> <b>demand</b> and wind generation data from South Eastern Australia, and Australian estimates of new-build thermal plant costs. It incorporates a Monte-Carlo extension to standard optimal generation mix methods combined with risk weighting techniques from portfolio theory. The implications of different wind penetration levels on the expected costs and risks, and associated emissions of different thermal plant portfolios are explored. Results from the case study highlight the potentially complex interactions between high levels of intermittent generation and the costs, risks and emissions of future electricity industries with different portfolios of Coal and Gas-fired plants.

30|$|A key {{development}} in monitoring is Smart Metering. The UK expects {{to complete their}} smart meter roll out by 2020, which potentially provides half-hourly load readings for households. Each household represents a separately metered point on the network, and is allocated a unique meter point administration number (MPAN). Smart meter data helps DNOs assess the LV network headroom [10], the effect of energy storage [8], and the network renewable capacity [11]. However, a DNO is charged for smart meter data [1] so approximations to <b>half-hourly</b> household <b>demand</b> are required, which is a not-trivial task since load on this individual level is volatile.|$|R

For this purpose, a <b>half-hourly</b> load <b>demand</b> of Malaysia for one year, from September 01, 2005 to August 31, 2006 was used.

40|$|The {{realization}} that natural resources are limited has triggered a global sustainability movement, {{including in the}} electricity sector. Sustainable electricity supply is within the national agenda of many countries given that the demand for electricity has shown a consistent increase over many decades. An important aspect of sustainable electricity supply is the pricing of electricity. The objective {{of this study is}} to explore the effectiveness of a competitive electricity market structure in the Indonesian case. While restructuring, deregulation and privatization in the electricity industry is aimed at improving efficiency in electricity supply and ensuring competitive electricity price, experiences from other countries indicate that competitive market can lead to high price volatility and gaming behavior among market players, leading to more expensive electricity price. This study proposes to use an agent based model to simulate a competitive market. The focus of the study has been on the installed generation capacity in the region to ensure availability of supply and competitive pricing.

40|$|Day-ahead <b>half-hourly</b> <b>demand</b> {{forecasts}} {{are required}} for scheduling and for calculating the daily electricity pool price. One approach predicts turning points on the demand curve and then produces half-hourly forecasts by a heuristic procedure, called profiling, {{which is based on}} a past demand curve. This paper investigates possible profiling improvements. Using a cubic smoothing spline in the heuristic leads to a slight improvement. Often, several past curves could reasonably be used in the profiling method. Consequently, there are often several demand curve forecasts available. Switching and smooth transition forecast combination models are considered. These models enable the combining weights to vary across the 48 half-hours, which is appealing as different forecasts may be more suitable for different periods. Several criteria are used to control the changing weights, including weather, and the methodology is extended to the case of more than two forecasts.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} novel Monte-Carlo based {{generation}} portfolio assessment tool {{to explore the}} implications of increasing wind penetration and carbon prices within future electricity generation portfolios under considerable uncertainty. This tool combines optimal generation mix techniques with Monte Carlo simulation and portfolio analysis methods to determine expected overall generation costs, associated cost uncertainty and expected CO 2 emissions for different possible generation portfolios.

The case study uses <b>half-hourly</b> <b>demand</b> and wind generation data from South Eastern Australia, and regional estimates of new-build plant costs and characteristics. Results suggest that although wind generation generally increases overall industry costs, it reduces associated cost uncertainties and CO 2 emissions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes and implements {{the inclusion}} of model structure in combining forecasts. Empirical investigations are conducted {{with an emphasis on}} neural networks and seasonal exponential smoothing models using synthetic data and real time series, from the electricity sector. It starts with a literature review on combining forecasts and ensembles of neural networks, and highlights their use in forecasting within the energy sector. Research gaps are identified and the questions to be addressed in this research are set, thus leading to three empirical studies. The first study provides a detailed sensitivity analysis of the goodness-of-fit and forecasting performance of feed-forward neural networks on time series with different characteristics. It expands existing literature by increasing the number and variety of time series and by using graphical and statistical diagnostics to objectively judge the influence of model specification on forecasting performance. Having identified conditions for achieving stable model performance, this study facilitated the identification of suitable models for different time series characteristics, which are then useful in developing combinations (ensembles) of feed forward neural networks. The second study proposes structural combination methods based on clustering (CB) and genetic algorithms (GA) for forecasting time series. Clustering of neural networks using their parameter space is performed to identify a pool of forecasts to be combined. Three synthetic time series and two real time series (electricity demand and wind power production) were used to assess the performance of the two proposals against several benchmarks in univariate and multivariate forecasting problems. Structural combinations with GA were more competitive than those with CB for non-seasonal time series and the multivariate wind power forecasting application, whereas for the seasonal series, the CB tended to be more competitive. The third study focused on forecasting univariate time series with seasonality, by structurally combining, in separate applications, multiplicative Holt-Winters and multiplicative Holt-Winters-Taylor models. Noise addition and block swapping were applied to the original time series in order to generate structurally diverse individual models. Applications were conducted using a seasonal daily peak electricity demand time series, an hourly double-seasonal electricity demand series and a half-hourly double-seasonal electricity demand series. Structural combinations worked better for the peak electricity demand and <b>half-hourly</b> <b>demand</b> time series when model variation was induced via noise addition. For the double-seasonal hourly electricity demand, block swapping, as a means for diversity in models, resulted in better forecasts. Finally, in the last chapter of this dissertation, conclusions are drawn from this research. The contribution to the literature is assessed and a future research agenda is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Electricity {{load demand}} {{forecasting}} {{is an important}} element in the electric power industry for energy system planning and operation. The forecast accuracy is the main characteristic in the forecasting process. Hence, in an attempt to achieve a good forecast, combined methods of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and dynamic regression (DR), known as EMD-DR is proposed. Besides, the forecast performance of the combined model EMD and DR is compared with a single DR model. EMD is a powerful analysis technique for detecting non-stationary and nonlinear signal, while DR is a method that involves lagged external variables. The data used in this study are retrieved from <b>half-hourly</b> electricity <b>demand</b> (kW) and reactive power (var), whereby the reactive power data acts as exogenous variable for the DR method. The investigation is conducted using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) for DR method and Matlab software for EMD.

Forecast of this heat demand course is significant for short-term planning of heat production and it is most important for technical and economic consideration.

A hybrid time-series/probabilistic simulation environment using real-world data is described, which is applied {{in the analysis of}} electricity trading with vehicle-to-grid to vehicles, buildings and markets. Key parameters are found to be the electric vehicle electricity sale price, battery degradation cost and infrastructure costs. Three vehicle-to-grid scenarios are evaluated using pool vehicle trip data, market pricing index data and <b>half-hourly</b> electricity <b>demand</b> for a commercial building. Results show that provision of energy to the wholesale electricity market with additional income from the capacity market results in the greatest projected return on investment, producing an individual vehicle net present value of ∼£ 8400.

Energy consumption in a non-domestic building is a complex issue due {{to a wide variety}} of uses and energy services and therefore the energy demand of individual buildings need to be understood. A pilot study was undertaken to analyse the relationship between the electrical energy demand profiles and user activities for a university building. To gain insight into how the building is used, operated and managed on a daily basis, an online questionnaire was distributed to staff and students as well as interviews conducted with key management personnel. Analysis was performed on the <b>half-hourly</b> electrical <b>demand</b> data for the case-study building to identify key trends and patterns in energy use. The shape and magnitude of energy demand profiles show a significant trend which does not seem to be strongly connected to occupancy patterns. It was found that the building was mostly controlled by a building management system (BMS) where building users have minimal access to the controls. However, it was interesting to find that the detailed information on the occupancy patterns could help the management team to redesign control strategies for optimum energy performance of the building...|$|R
40|$|This paper uses <b>half-hourly</b> {{electricity}} <b>demand</b> data in South Australia as {{an empirical}} study of nonparametric modeling and forecasting methods for prediction from half-hour ahead {{to one year}} ahead. A notable feature of the univariate time series of electricity demand {{is the presence of}} both intraweek and intraday seasonalities. An intraday seasonal cycle is apparent from the similarity of the demand from one day to the next, and an intraweek seasonal cycle is evident from comparing the demand on the corresponding day of adjacent weeks. There is a strong appeal in using forecasting methods that are able to capture both seasonalities. In this paper, the forecasting methods slice a seasonal univariate time series into a time series of curves. The forecasting methods reduce the dimensionality by applying functional principal component analysis to the observed data, and then utilize an univariate time series forecasting method and functional principal component regression techniques. When data points in the most recent curve are sequentially observed, updating methods can improve the point and interval forecast accuracy. We also revisit a nonparametric approach to construct prediction intervals of updated forecasts, and evaluate the interval forecast accuracy.

This paper compares the accuracy of several models for short-term electricity load forecasting for nodes in New Zealand. The literature on short-term electricity load forecasting is reviewed, resulting in the selection of the seasonal ARIMA model and the double seasonal Holt-Winters exponential smoothing model for empirical testing. We also estimate a one season ARIMA model with some double seasonal aspects. A multivariate regression model is also developed for comparison, utilising aspects of several multivariate models used in other short-term electricity load forecasting papers. A time series of <b>half-hourly</b> electricity <b>demand</b> in the Hayward node in New Zealand is used for estimation and forecasting. The data clearly indicates a daily and a weekly seasonal pattern. The seasonal ARIMA model outperforms the Holt-Winters and multivariate regression models in forecasting electricity demand from half an hour to three hours ahead. The superiority of the seasonal ARIMA model increases as the forecasting length increases. Significant autocorrelation of residuals in the Holt-Winters and multivariate regression models leads to an error adjustment term being included, which improves the forecasting accuracy of the Holt-Winters models but not the multivariate regression model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of wind {{generation}} on system costs and prices in Ireland. The need to mitigate climate change, achieve renewables energy targets, and use {{renewable sources of energy}} means that many countries are considering greater levels of wind generation in their power generation mix. The overall impact of wind generation on system costs and performance has only been studied recently, and often with limited actual data from power systems with increased wind penetration. The paper uses a unique dataset of <b>half-hourly</b> system <b>demand,</b> generation, wind forecast generation, and actual wind generation, along with Irish system marginal price (SMP) data from 2008 to autumn 2012. An econometric time-series model of SMP as a function of forecast and realized demand and wind generation is formed. The costs of balancing and system constraints are included in the cost of ‘uplift’, and thus the total cost of a variety of factors is included in our estimates for Ireland. Our results suggest that each 1 % increase in wind generation reduces SMP in Ireland by about 0. 06 %, while each 1 % wind forecast error increases SMP about 0. 02 %. In absolute terms, though, at the mean {{the impact of}} wind forecast errors is small, or about 0. 4 €cent/MWh-wind generated. However, the impact per MWh forecast error is about € 1. ...|$|R
40|$|Short-term load {{forecasting}} is {{an essential}} instrument in power system planning, operation and control. Many operating decisions are based on load forecasts, such as dispatch scheduling of generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand will cause a conservative operation, {{which leads to the}} start-up of too many units or excessive energy purchase, thereby supplying an unnecessary level of reserve. On the contrary, underestimation may result in a risky operation, with insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system to operate in a vulnerable region to the disturbance. In this paper, semi-parametric additive models are proposed to estimate the relationships between demand and the driver variables. Specifically, the inputs for these models are calendar variables, lagged actual demand observations and historical and forecast temperature traces for one or more sites in the target power system. In addition to point forecasts, prediction intervals are also estimated using a modified bootstrap method suitable for the complex seasonality seen in electricity demand data. The proposed methodology has been used to forecast the <b>half-hourly</b> electricity <b>demand</b> for up to seven days ahead for power systems in the Australian National Electricity Market. The performance of the methodology is validated via out-of-sample experiments with real data from the power system, as well as through on-site implementation by the system operator.

40|$|Recent work {{introduced}} a novel time-permuting error measure for forecasts of <b>half-hourly,</b> household-level energy <b>demand,</b> designed to reward forecasts which predict extremes (spikes) in demand at approximately the right times, albeit perhaps slightly early or late. In many {{applications such as}} smart storage control, such forecasts are preferable to those that predict no spikes at all. Building on that idea, we make three contributions. First we introduce a probabilistic framework to estimate error distributions for actuals about forecasts, using the time-permuting error measure. The framework includes a variable discount for older, possibly less relevant data. Second we employ this framework to derive conditions to be satisfied by the optimal forecast under the time-permuting error measure. In turn this requires a mixture of discrete (non derivative) optimisation and calculus to condition forecasts on available historical observations. Finally we demonstrate the usefulness of our framework by using it to forecast the daily energy demand profiles for {{a large number of}} domestic energy customers. In particular we illustrate how such customers might be classified according to the relative forecastability of their behaviour and the corresponding need for different amounts of history to achieve such forecasts...|$|R
40|$|Decarbonising {{the built}} {{environment}} cost-effectively is a complex challenge public and private organisations are facing {{in their effort to}} tackle climate change. In this context, this work presents an integrated Technology Selection and Operation (TSO) optimisation model for distributed energy systems in commercial buildings. The purpose of the model is to simultaneously optimise the selection, capacity and operation of photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems; serving as a decision support framework for assessing technology investments. A steady-state mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach is employed to formulate the optimisation problem. The virtue of the TSO model comes from employing granular state-of-the-art datasets such as <b>half-hourly</b> electricity <b>demands</b> and prices, irradiance levels from weather stations, and technology databases; while also considering building specific attributes. Investment revenues are obtained from reducing grid electricity costs and providing fast-frequency response (FFR) ancillary services. A case study of a distribution centre in London, UK is showcased with the goal to identify which technologies can minimise total energy costs against a conventional system setup serving as a benchmark. Results indicate the best technology configuration is a combination of lithium-ion batteries and mono-crystalline silicon PVs worth a total investment of £ 1. 72 M. Due to the available space in the facility, the preferred PV capacity is 1. 76 MW, while the battery system has a 1. 06 MW power capacity and a 1. 56 MWh energy capacity. Although PV performance varies across seasons, the solution indicates almost 30 % of the energy used on-site can be supplied by PVs while achieving a carbon reduction of 26 %. Nonetheless, PV and battery systems seem to be a questionable investment as the proposed solution has an 8 -year payback, despite a 5 -year NPV savings of £ 300 k, implying there is still a performance gap for such systems to be massively deployed across the UK. Overall, the TSO model provides valuable insights into real-world project evaluation and can help to reduce the uncertainty associated with capital-intensive projects; hence proving to be a powerful modelling framework for distributed energy technology assessments...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the best model for {{forecasting}} Malaysia load demand. In this study, a <b>half-hourly</b> electricity load <b>demand</b> of Malaysia for one year, from September 01, 2005 until August 31, 2006 measured in Megawatt (MW) was used. The double-seasonal ARIMA model was considered due to the existence of two seasonal cycles in the load data. Analysis was done by using SAS package. The best model was selected based on the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots. The ARIMA(0, 1, 1) (0, 1, 1) 48 (0, 1, 1) 336 with in-sample MAPE of 0. 9906 % was selected as the best model. Comparing the one-step and k-step ahead out of sample forecasts performance, it was found that the MAPE for the one-step ahead out-sample forecasts from any horizon were all less than 1 %. It can be concluded that the one-step ahead out-sample forecasts were more accurate. There was a reduction in MAPE percentages for all lead time horizons considered, ranging 89 % to 96 %. Furthermore, a time-series plot of out-samples of actual load data, k-step ahead and one-step ahead out-sample forecasts showed that one-step ahead out-sample forecasts followed the actual load data more closely than k-step ahead out-sample forecasts. Therefore it is proposed that the ACF and PACF plots must be considered in proving the best model for load demand. It is also proposed that the one-step ahead out-sample forecasts must also be considered in forecasting load, especially in Malaysia load data...|$|R
40|$|The {{residential}} sector represents approximately 30 % of global electricity consumption, but the underlying drivers are still poorly understood. The drivers are many, varied, and complex, including local climate, household demographics, household behaviour, building stock {{and the type}} and number of appliances. There is considerable variation across households and, until recently, often a lack of good data. This thesis draws upon a detailed household dataset from the Australian Smart Grid Smart City project to build a residential demand modelling tool set. This data covers a part of greater Sydney. Two statistical models for household annual electricity <b>demand</b> and <b>half-hourly</b> peak electricity <b>demand</b> were established and tested for both individual households and regional aggregations of households. The model showed only reasonable performance in forecasting the consumption of individual households, highlighting the influence of factors beyond those surveyed. However, the model demonstrated good performance for aggregated household consumption: 3. 9 % MAPE for annual electricity consumption forecast and 4. 57 % MAPE for peak demand forecast. Models such as this would be highly useful {{for a range of}} stakeholders, including individual households, trying to understand the potential implications of different choices and utilities looking to better forecast the impact of different possible residential trends. The model would also be very helpful to grid operators seeking better reliability while avoiding augmentation and to policy makers seeking to improve householder’s energy efficiency through targeted policies and programs. Based on the developed tool set, models were built to simulate various strategies for annual and peak demand reduction, and socio-economic evaluations were calculated and compared between different reduction options. Results showed that behavioural and demand response interventions were found to provide the most cost effective peak reduction. The results were scaled up to the Sydney geographical region to provide realistic recommendations for policy makers, utility operators and other stakeholders. In addition, annual demand reduction intervention using feedback systems were investigated. Results showed that feedback interventions have different effectiveness on households with different characteristics. The statistically significant findings directly support the fact that demand reduction intervention should be tailored to match specific household types to achieve optimum and cost effective outcomes...|$|R
