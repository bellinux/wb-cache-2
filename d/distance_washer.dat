40|$|This master’s thesis {{has been}} {{elaborated}} {{as a part}} of master’s studies of engineering technology M 2 I-K, major in M-STM – Engineering technology and industrial management and deals with the problem of a transition to a self-production of previously purchased distance washers. Distance washers were purchased in six different types of similar shape, each type in four different thicknesses. One of these types was chosen as a representative for this master’s thesis. We shall explore the possibilities of self-production with the emphasis on economical validation of the transition. The <b>distance</b> <b>washer</b> is a flat part, the intermediate being sheet metal. Technologies considered for manufacturing the washers correspond to the technical facilities and equipment available at the production hall of the company this project is planned for. The company possesses technology for CO 2 laser cutting, cutting by CNC punching machine and cutting in the punching tool. To provide a complex overview we shall also enquire into cooperated technologies such as water jet and plasma cutting, oxy-acetyleny cutting and CNC working. All options are evaluated with regard to the production expenses and lead to a most economically plausible method of manufacturing or, if need be, give reasons for going back to purchasing the part from the current supplier...|$|E
40|$|The {{coupling}} coefficient (k(2)) between the superconducting coplanar resonator and the flip chip coupled washer radio frequency SQUID was calculated using computer simulation. The coplanar resonator is formed by two coplanar lines surrounding a flux: concentrator,vith each line having a slit. For a 3 mm x 3 mm washer SQUID with a 100 mu m x 100 pm loop coupled to a coplanar resonator with the slits on opposite sides, we estimated k(2) = 7. 1 x 10 (- 3). However, {{if the same}} SQUID is coupled to a coplanar resonator with parallel slits and with a short circuit at the 90 degrees position {{with respect to the}} opening slit, k(2) of only 0. 5 x 10 (- 3) is obtained, which indicates that the k(2) is strongly dependent on the resonator layout. The simulation also shows that k(2) is dependent on the SQUID washer size and the separation <b>distance</b> between the <b>washer</b> SQUID and the coplanar resonator...|$|R
40|$|Källsner and Girhammar have {{presented}} a new plastic design method of wood-framed shear walls at ultimate limit state. This method allows the designer {{to calculate the}} load-carrying capacity of shear walls partially anchored, where the leading stud is not anchored against the uplift. The anchorage system of shear walls is provided from anchor bolts and hold downs. Anchor bolts provide horizontal shear continuity between the bottom rail and the foundation. Hold downs are directly connected from the vertical end stud to the foundation. When hold downs are not provided, the bottom row of nails transmits the vertical forces in the sheathing to the bottom rail (instead of the vertical stud) where the anchor bolts will further transmit the forces into the foundation. Because of the eccentric load transfer, transverse bending is created in the bottom rail and splitting often occurs. Bottom rail experimentally studied with respect to two primary failure modes, splitting {{along the bottom of}} the bottom rail due to cross-wise bending and splitting along the edge side of the bottom rail due forces perpendicular to the grain for the sheathing-to-framing connections. The parameters varied are the location of the anchor bolt, the size of the washer and the orientation of the pith. The bottom rail was subjected to loading perpendicular to grain through one-sided sheathing. In this report the different test series are presented. Three series were conducted depending on the location on the anchor bolt. In each series different sets were studied {{depending on the size of}} the washer and in each set the pith was placed upwards or downwards. The tests showed three different failure modes. In addition to the failure modes that the testing program was aimed at, splitting along the bottom or side of the bottom rail, the final failure was due to plastic bending and withdrawal of the sheathing-to-framing nails. The results show that the size of the washer and the position of the bolt have a significant influence on the maximum load and the failure modes. It was found that decreasing the <b>distance</b> of the <b>washer</b> to the loaded edge of the bottom rail increases the maximum load. Godkänd; 2011; 20110620 (giucap...|$|R
40|$|The {{horizontal}} {{stabilization of}} timber frame buildings is oftenprovided by shear walls. Plastic design methods {{can be used}} todetermine the load-carrying capacity of fully and partially anchoredshear walls. In order to use these methods, a ductile behaviour of thesheathing-to-framing joint must be ensured. If hold-downs are notprovided, the vertical uplifting forces are transferred to the substrate bythe fasteners of the sheathing-to-framing joints. Since the forces in theanchor bolts and the sheathing-to-framing joints do not act in the samevertical plane, the bottom rail will be subjected to bending in thecrosswise direction, and splitting of the bottom rail may occur. If thebottom rail splits {{the applicability of the}} plastic design method forpartially anchored shear walls is questionable. This doctoral thesisaddresses the problem of brittle failure of the bottom rail in partiallyanchored timber frame shear walls. The first part of the study comprised of two basic experimentalprograms, for single-sided and double-sided sheathed shear walls. Theaim was to evaluate the different failure modes and the correspondingsplitting capacity of the bottom rail. Two brittle failure modes wereobserved: (1) a crack opening from the bottom surface of the bottomrail; and (2) a crack opening from the side surface of the bottom railalong the line of the fasteners of the sheathing-to-framing joints. It wasfound that the <b>distance</b> between the <b>washer</b> edge and the loaded edgeof the bottom rail has a decisive influence on the type of failure modeand the maximum failure load of the bottom rail. Two theoretical models for the load-carrying capacity for each typeof failure mode based on a fracture mechanics approach are studied andvalidated. The two analytical closed-form solutions are in goodagreement with the test results. The fracture mechanics models seem tocapture the essential behaviour and to include the decisive parametersof the bottom rail. These parameters can easily be determined and thefracture mechanics models can be used in design equations for bottomrails in partially anchored shear walls. Also, an extended fracturemechanics model for the load-carrying capacity for each type of failuremode is presented and evaluated. The present study discusses the splitting behaviour of the bottom railand provides methods to determine the splitting capacity for two brittlefailure modes, splitting of the bottom surface (mode 1) and of the sidesurface of the rail (mode 2). By these means brittle failure of thebottom rail can be avoided and the full plastic load-carrying capacity ofthe sheathing-to-framing joints can be utilized.
