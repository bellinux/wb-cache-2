25|$|In Battlefield 2, as with {{previous}} Battlefield titles, players {{are able to}} select {{from a variety of}} infantry classes. Each class of soldier is equipped with different weaponry appropriate to their role in the battle. Assault soldiers, for example, are general-purpose infantry with grenade-launcher equipped assault-rifles and extra armor, Medics carry <b>first-aid</b> <b>equipment</b> such as a field defibrillator, and Anti-Tank troopers are equipped with missiles which are effective against heavy armor.|$|E
50|$|Adequate, {{clean and}} well sign-posted lifesaving, <b>first-aid</b> <b>equipment</b> and {{fire-fighting}} equipment. Equipment {{must be approved}} by national authorities.|$|E
5000|$|... 3. Have Emergency Equipment And Supplies Handy: Always {{have a good}} flashlight, a radio, <b>first-aid</b> <b>equipment</b> and {{a supply}} of canned goods in the house.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the equipment already described, cavers frequently carry packs containing <b>first-aid</b> kits, emergency <b>equipment,</b> and food. Containers for securely transporting urine are also commonly carried. On longer trips, containers for securely transporting feces {{out of the cave}} are carried.|$|R
5000|$|The town {{is home to}} a Surf Life Saving Club and hosts annual Surf Life Saving Carnivals. In 2015 the Seaspray Surf Life Saving Club {{underwent}} a $2.6 million rebuild after the previous club rooms had been badly damaged by violent storms in 2007. This first stage of the rebuild included better operational control facilities, a <b>first-aid</b> centre, <b>equipment</b> storage, and a social function area with views across the town and beach. Future stages of the work will include a patrol tower, extensive outside decking to expand the function area, and greater storage facilities.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{it was decided}} that the fire company would add {{emergency}} medical services to its already expanded list of rescue operations. The company purchased the QRS (Quick Response Service) unit that houses enough basic life support and <b>first-aid</b> <b>equipment</b> to complement the Springfield Ambulance Association's arrival.|$|E

50|$|Pilots carry a {{parachute}} enclosed in the harness. In case of serious problems the parachute is manually deployed and carries both pilot and glider down to earth. Pilots also wear helmets and generally carry other safety {{items such as}} knives (for cutting their parachute bridle after impact or cutting their harness lines and straps {{in case of a}} tree or water landing), light ropes (for lowering from trees to haul up tools or climbing ropes), radios (for communication with other pilots or ground crew), and <b>first-aid</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} {{rejected that}} the aircraft {{did not have}} a sufficiently potent ice protection system, stating that the Heron's were equipped with a better system than comparable aircraft. It was of the opinion that no contemporary ice protections systems would have been capable of de-icing the aircraft in the conditions. They found no faults with the pilot's actions. It also recommended that airlines equip aircraft with additional <b>first-aid</b> and survival <b>equipment.</b>|$|R
40|$|Problems {{related to}} {{immediate}} medical care {{in case of}} in-flight emergencies are discussed with reference to such critical types of medical emergencies as obstructed airway, cardiac dysfunction, trauma, hemorrhage, hypoxia, and pain. It is shown that training flight attendants to deal with in-flight medical emergencies and to use <b>first-aid</b> support <b>equipment</b> and essential and useful drugs may later help with stabilization of a victim and allow continuing the flight to the scheduled destination {{without the need for}} a diverted landing. Among the steps suggested in order to upgrade inflight welfare and safety of passengers are the development of an advisory circular by the FAA covering standardized training for flight attendants, regulatory action requiring upgrading of the present rudimentary first-aid kit, and the enactment of Good Samaritan legislation by the U. S. Government...|$|R
50|$|The weekend {{program is}} the oldest Okpik program. From Friday evening through Sunday, {{participating}} groups receive instruction in the basic skills of winter camping and {{have the opportunity to}} practice them on an overnight campout. Training in cold weather dress, <b>first-aid,</b> menu and <b>equipment</b> are included in indoor sessions. Opportunities are also available for activities in winter ecology, igloo building, and other cold weather activities. Extra days can be added for school planning days and Martin Luther King holiday.|$|R
50|$|Since police {{officers}} {{may be the}} first to arrive at a medical incident, officers may wear a first aid pouch containing some basic life saving equipment, which is useful while waiting for an ambulance to arrive. This equipment may include: medical gloves, CPR mask and antiseptic wipes. It is not common practice for American {{police officers}} to carry <b>first-aid</b> <b>equipment</b> beyond examination gloves on their duty belt, but they usually keep such equipment in their nearby patrol car. More expensive equipment, such as Automatic External Defibrillators, may be assigned to a few patrol cars.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lifeboats}} power {{came from}} twin General motors GM6V92TA DDEC turbo-charged marine two-stroke diesel engines which could develop [...] These engines could push the lifeboat to {{a top speed}} of 18 kn. At full speed there was enough diesel fuel in the tanks for ten hours service. At lower speeds the endurance was significantly increased. The engines were computer-managed, with data being displayed on twin screens which was viewed at both the Mechanic’s and the Helm position in the wheelhouse. Within the wheelhouse there were six seats for the crew plus a jumper seat for a doctor. Ruby and Arthur Reed’s equipment included satellite navigation apparatus interfaced through a PC to a visual chart display. Daylight viewing radar was used both for navigation and to search for casualties. There was VHF radio direction-finding equipment for locating vessels in trouble. The lifeboat also carried the latest DSC digital radio equipment for the vital radio communication used in search and rescue missions. The lifeboat was equipped with three VHF radios one of which was portable, together with an MF `long range`set. On the deck were powerful searchlights, and the lifeboat was also later equipped with image-intensifying night sight equipment. Ruby and Arthur Reed carried a large amount of <b>first-aid</b> <b>equipment</b> including both oxygen and entonox.|$|E
5000|$|The buoys were {{of square}} or {{hexagonal}} construction {{and had a}} floor space of about 43 square feet with an 8-foot cabin rising above the float. On the upper deck of this cabin, there was an oval turret 6 feet high with a signal mast carrying a wireless antenna. Tube railings to which the distressed flyers could cling ran along the outer circumference below and above the water line. A ladder {{led up to the}} turret, in which there was a door opening into the cabin below.A 320-foot red and yellow striped rope anchored the buoy at a fixed location, but allowed a limited drift, thereby indicating the direction of the current to aircraft in distress. The buoy was painted light yellow above the water line, and red crosses against white oval backgrounds were painted {{on each side of the}} turret.The cabin accommodated four persons comfortably for several days, and in an emergency, the crews of several aircraft could be taken care of. It was electrically lit by storage batteries, but in case of a breakdown kerosene lamps or other lighting devices were provided. There were two double-deck beds and adequate cupboard space for <b>first-aid</b> <b>equipment,</b> dry clothing and shoes, emergency rations, and a water supply. Hot food could be prepared on an alcohol stove. Cognac to relieve chill and cigarettes to quiet the nerves were also provided. Games, stationery, playing cards, etc. afforded diversion until rescue was effected. Depleted supplies were always immediately replaced upon the arrival of the rescue ship. A tubular lifeboat was available for transferring the downed aviators from the buoy to the ship.Signalling was accomplished by hoisting a black anchor ball and a yellow and red striped flag on the mast during the day. At night, red and white lights in the turret indicated that rescued men were on board. A white anchor light on the mast was visible for 3,000 feet or more. SOS signals giving the location of the buoy were automatically sent out by an emergency wireless transmitter. Signal pistols with red and white lights, white-light parachute flares, or a smoke, distress-signalling apparatus completed the signalling equipment. Other equipment included plugs to stop up bullet holes in the walls of the cabin and a pump for the expulsion of seepage.|$|E
50|$|In 1986 NCH added direct mail, tele{{marketing}}, and catalog {{sales to}} its arsenal of marketing techniques. Cornerstone Direct was formed for this purpose, offering material handling <b>equipment,</b> <b>first-aid</b> kits, and other industrial supplies. Sales growth returned {{in the second}} half of the 1980s, breaking $400 million in 1987 and $500 million in 1988. European operations contributed more and more to the company's sales and income during this period. With sales up and expenses down, NCH's earned income from Europe quadrupled between 1987 and 1989, from $4.8 million to $18.8 million. Another area that expanded significantly in the last few years of the decade was the company's Resource Electronics Division, with the acquisition of three electronic parts distributors between 1988 and 1990.|$|R
5000|$|There is a café and toilets on {{platform}} 1, {{adjacent to}} each other. Both platforms are under-cover and {{are decorated with}} various hanging plants, which are watered when the time permits of the volunteers. If you arrive early before the first train of the day, volunteers can be seen cleaning the rolling stock and checking the Daily Report Form sheets associated with each carriage set. Each train set {{is equipped with a}} variety of safety-critical appliances and material, including brakes on nearly all carriages and in the guards' compartment a <b>first-aid</b> kit, sanding <b>equipment,</b> fire-beaters and a rander board. The driver must have a separate rander board in order to proceed out of the station, on to the main line. Rander boards will only be given to the driver by the Controller, once the single-line section from Ravenglass to Miteside loop is considered to be occupied by that particular train, so as to meet the legal requirements of fixed absolute block railway signalling systems.|$|R
50|$|Line 1 was allotted 64 coaches. Fourteen trains (of four cars) are {{in service}} during rush hour, and {{seven or eight}} in non-peak hours. All coaches are {{air-conditioned}} and have humidity control, and designed to reduce noise and vibration. Each coach is approximately 2.9 m wide and has 48 seats. A coach has a capacity of 375 passengers, and a single four car train has a total capacity of 1500 passengers. The coach body is made of lightweight stainless steel, with fire resistant metal doors. Coaches have metallic silver colour exteriors, and can be covered with vinyl sheets to display advertisements. The interior features anti-skid floors, and longitudinal seats with dedicated space to accommodate wheelchairs. Trains on Line 1 are fitted with the VTS Firetide 7010 video transmission system. Coaches are also fitted with LED displays showing dynamic route map, and LCD TVs for entertainment, information and advertising. Windows in coaches are made of double glazed laminated glass to shut out noise. Each coach has 8 externally hung, sliding bi-parting doors except the pilot cabin which has only 2. Doors are broad to enable wheelchair access. The maximum gap between the station platform and the doors is 85 mm. Trains are outfitted {{with a number of}} features for safety and convenience, including 3D route maps, <b>first-aid</b> kits, fire-fighting <b>equipment</b> and intercom systems permitting communication with the train driver. Each coach contains a black box to assist in accident investigations.|$|R
40|$|Background - Work in {{commercial}} fishing is physically demanding and hazardous, but unlike merchant seamen, fishermen {{are not required}} to hold a certificate of medical fitness. Aims - To investigate the case for regulatory medical standards for commercial fishermen and to identify priorities for the prevention and management of occupational injuries at sea. Methods - We surveyed a convenience sample of fishermen at three major fishing ports in South West England using a standardized interview-administered questionnaire. Results - Interviews were completed by 210 (68 %) of 307 fishermen approached. Over their careers, 56 subjects (27 %) had been returned to shore as an emergency for medical reasons, a rate of 14. 6 (95 % confidence interval 11. 5 – 18. 2) per 1000 man-years. Most emergency evacuations were for acute injuries, and only five were for illness. A few participants suffered from chronic disease that would call into question their fitness to go to sea. Fifty-five fishermen had suffered injuries in the past 12 months, including 12 that had caused loss of more than 3 days from work. Subjects had self-stitched 4 of 15 reported hand lacerations, while others had been bound with ‘gaffer’ tape. Conclusions - Prevention of hand lacerations should be a high priority, with <b>first-aid</b> training and <b>equipment</b> for fishing crews to improve their care when prevention fails. No firm conclusions can be drawn about the value of regular medical screening for commercial fishermen, but such screening should be considered a lower priority than accident prevention<br/...|$|R
