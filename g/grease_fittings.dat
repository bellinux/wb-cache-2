2500|$|... 84–87 front {{suspension}} is a wider direct {{derivative of}} the Chevrolet Chevette and Pontiac T1000. It employs a double A-arm (or double wishbone) design common {{prior to the}} advent of struts, and has naturally good geometry. A drawback of this design, however, means that the car's front suspension has four ball joints. Nevertheless, the tie-rods allow toe-in/out adjustability. Minimal camber adjustments exist on 1984 to 1987 models without an after-market upgrade that replaces the upper ball joints with slotted mounting points units. The joints have typical <b>grease</b> <b>fittings</b> for regular lubrication commonly found on pre-2000 autos.|$|E
2500|$|The 400 was {{replaced}} for 1970 with the [...] Buick V8, {{used in the}} GS 455. The base model V8 was rated 350hp (260kW) and [...] at 2800 rpm. In the optional Stage1 trim it was rated** 360hp (268kW) and 510lb·ft (691Nm) at a low 2800 rpm. As with all American engines produced prior to the 1972 model year, these were SAE gross ratings, which are generally significantly higher than SAE net ratings and are not indicative of what actual production engines produce in their [...] "as installed" [...] condition (with all engine accessories and full exhaust system in place). [...] The fastest magazine test results from this period were obtained by MOTOR TREND Magazine, which managed to extract a 13.38 ET @ 105.5 MPH from their 3,810 pound GS Stage 1 coupe test car. Using Hale's Trap Speed formula, this result indicated actual [...] "as installed" [...] peak HP of approximately 360 SAE Net (ironically the same as its advertised Gross Figure, meaning this engine was very conservatively rated for that time period). [...] The use of the larger sized 455 block created a maintenance problem by the exhaust manifolds being in too {{close proximity to the}} upper and lower A-arm bushings. [...] Heat would literally melt the A-arm bushings after {{a relatively short period of}} time; rapid tire wear and front end alignment difficulties were the first sign of this common problem, which was common to all makes and models of this GM body style with the 455 engine. [...] It was not uncommon for front ends to be rebuilt with <b>grease</b> <b>fittings</b> added, to [...] "lube" [...] the bushings at the A-arms, to help against the heat.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grease</b> <b>fittings</b> are {{commonly}} made from zinc-plated steel, stainless steel, or brass.|$|E
50|$|For greased bearings, the low {{pressures}} of lubrication before the <b>grease</b> <b>fitting</b> could often {{result in a}} failure of the grease to travel all the way down into all the voids of the bearing. The <b>grease</b> <b>fitting</b> improved this penetration, yielding more effective lubrication.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>grease</b> <b>fitting,</b> <b>grease</b> nipple, Zerk <b>fitting,</b> or Alemite fitting is a {{metal fitting}} used in {{mechanical}} systems to feed lubricants, usually lubricating grease, into a bearing under moderate to high pressure using a grease gun.|$|R
5000|$|The {{military}} {{also wanted}} a [...] "surface check" [...] <b>grease</b> <b>fitting</b> {{that would help}} to prevent dirt from entering through a fitting. Lincoln had developed many advances in fittings including the Bullneck fitting and a surface check feature - the design that remains {{the most widely used}} in industry today. The company's relationship with the armed forces was helped by an ex-employee who became a procurement officer serving in the Pentagon. (Redenbaugh) ...|$|R
5000|$|Swivel head: A rigid caster allows single {{back and}} forth direction. A swivel caster allows for 360 degree {{directional}} movement. The swivel action of a caster depends on bearings and lubrication. Bearing designs include ball bearings and raceway bearings. <b>Grease</b> <b>fittings</b> serve to inject grease into the axles, caster raceways and wheels. <b>Grease</b> <b>fittings</b> may also be known as [...] "zerks." ...|$|E
50|$|Since the 1920s, the ever-growing {{dissemination}} of sealed bearings throughout the manufacturing industries {{has made the}} use of <b>grease</b> <b>fittings</b> less common. Sealed bearings are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. <b>Grease</b> <b>fittings</b> are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new grease is pumped into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.|$|E
50|$|By 1950, {{innovations}} in automobile design {{reduced the number}} of <b>grease</b> <b>fittings</b> on cars from an average of 24 to just 12 fittings. This represented a significant impact on sales by Lincoln of lubrication fittings and on equipment used to lubricate cars. The company was open to the possibility of using its engineering capability to develop new products unrelated to lubrication.|$|E
5000|$|A {{grease gun}} {{is a common}} {{workshop}} and garage tool used for lubrication. The purpose of the grease gun is to apply lubricant through an aperture to a specific point, usually on a <b>grease</b> <b>fitting</b> or 'nipple'. The channels behind the grease nipple lead to where the lubrication is needed. The aperture may be of a type that fits closely with a receiving aperture on any number of mechanical devices. The close fitting of the apertures ensures that lubricant is applied only where needed. There are three types of grease gun: ...|$|R
5000|$|Nonsealed {{bearings}} {{often have}} a <b>grease</b> <b>fitting,</b> for periodic lubrication with a grease gun, or an oil cup for periodic filling with oil. Before the 1970s, sealed bearings were not encountered on most machinery, and oiling and greasing were a more common activity than they are today. For example, automotive chassis used to require [...] "lube jobs" [...] nearly as often as engine oil changes, but today's car chassis are mostly sealed for life. From the late 1700s through mid 1900s, industry relied on many workers called oilers to lubricate machinery frequently with oil cans.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded as Stewart & Clark Company in 1905 by John K. Stewart. Their speedometers {{were used in}} the Ford Model T. In 1912 John Stewart joined with Edgar Bassick to make vehicle {{instruments}} and horns. Bassick owned Alemite Co. and Stewart had bought the Warner Instrument Company; thus the name was changed to the Stewart-Warner Corporation. The company started in Chicago and built a manufacturing plant on Diversey Parkway. The building kept expanding and finally covered one million square feet (93,000 m²) and six floors. At its peak S-W employed 6000 people at the Diversey complex. They also made radios and refrigerators, among other products, and produced the ubiquitous [...] "zerk" [...] <b>grease</b> <b>fitting,</b> named after its inventor, associated with the company. In the last years of the company's Chicago factory, it owned a number of aging six-spindle Brown & Sharpe and New Britain screw machines.|$|R
50|$|The 400 was {{notable for}} fast trains of its day {{in that it}} {{originally}} ran with rebuilt or upgraded, rather than new equipment. This stood in stark comparison to the Milwaukee Road's Hiawatha and the Burlington Zephyrs, each of which first ran with brand new locomotives and cars. Each 400 train required two steam locomotives, which were swapped partway through the trip, primarily because some <b>grease</b> <b>fittings</b> on the train could not withstand the entire journey at high speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{idler arm}} {{supports}} {{the end of}} the center link on the passenger's side of the vehicle. The idler arm bolts to the vehicle's frame or subframe. Generally, an idler arm is attached between {{the opposite side of the}} center link from the Pitman arm and the vehicle's frame to hold the center link at the proper height. Idler arms are generally more vulnerable to wear than Pitman arms because of the pivot function built into them. If the idler arm is fitted with <b>grease</b> <b>fittings,</b> these should be lubricated with a grease gun at each oil change.|$|E
5000|$|The {{patent for}} the Zerk fitting was granted to Oscar U. Zerk in January 1929, and the {{assignee}} was the Alemite Manufacturing Corporation (thus the eponymous {{names for the}} fittings). Alemite was already marketing ball check valves to accept grease supplied under pressure from a grease gun, such as for car and truck chassis lubrication points, both for OEM installations and for aftermarket upgrade kits which would screw in as replacements for stock grease cups. But Zerk's fitting was an improved style, less vulnerable to dirt and more forgiving of angled approach. Today, many companies make these <b>grease</b> <b>fittings.</b>|$|E
50|$|Lincoln's {{expertise}} in lubrication was called into service when World War II broke out. The company began producing <b>grease</b> guns and <b>fittings</b> for the Quartermaster Corps and tooling {{for the production}} of small caliber ammunition.|$|R
50|$|The Court's {{decision}} in 1938 {{paved the way}} for Lincoln to market a line of <b>fittings,</b> <b>grease</b> guns and accessories under a product line the company named Kleenseal. Various hand-held grease guns, couplers and other accessories were developed to address a wide range of applications.|$|R
5000|$|Sealed {{ball joints}} {{do not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most ball joints had <b>grease</b> <b>fitting</b> (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed ball joints to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard ball joints will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible ball joint failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all ball joints on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed ball joints to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust boot seal's that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R

50|$|Founded in 1991 by President Peter Vinci, an {{electro-mechanical}} engineer, {{the company}} operates through a traditional three-step distribution process and serves the automotive, fleet, industrial, and agricultural industries. IPA manufactures {{an array of}} tools, including remote testers for truck and tractor-trailer braking and electrical systems, air guns designed to clean radiators, disc brake system analyzers, tire inflation systems, and tools to unclog <b>grease</b> <b>fittings.</b> IPA won the PTEN Innovation Award in 2011 and 2012, for their automotive wiring diagnostic tool and fuel pump relay bypass switch, and the Motor Magazine Top 20 Tools Award eight times, with the most recent being in 2011 for their electrical terminal cleaners.|$|E
5000|$|A {{captured}} Type 97 mortar, {{which has}} been studied in detail, was marked [...] "Type 97 High-Angle Infantry Gun". The weapon was manufactured in 1942 in the Osaka Army Arsenal. Although the Japanese weapon closely resembles the US 81-mm mortar, M1, there are several identifying features by which the two can be distinguished. The adjusting nut of the Japanese mortar {{is on the right}} bipod leg, while the sight is on the left. Other differences are the buttress-type threads on the traversing and elevating screws of the Japanese weapon, as well as the use of welding to fasten bipod legs to the clevis joint and <b>grease</b> <b>fittings</b> dissimilar to those used by the US model.|$|E

40|$|Until recently, septage {{removed from}} {{domestic}} septic tanks was spread on agricultural lands, deposited in trenches {{at the local}} sewage treatment works (STW) or placed in the local landfill. Similarly, grease trap wastes, a suspension of solids, greases, oils and fats in water, removed from restaurants, commercial kitchens, fast-food outlets and boarding houses were dumped in landfills. Changes to environmental and waste legislation in New South Wales prevent the disposal of septage or grease trap waste to land. Alternatives to landfill sites must be found. Armidale City Council sought {{to address the problem}} of grease trap waste disposal as a positive step in increasing compliance of its 1996 Liquid Trade Waste Policy. Regulation of pump-out contractors will ensure compliance with environmental laws and reduce illegal dumping of wastes on unlicensed lands. As Council owns the landfill to which septage is deposited, an economic benefit exists to incorporate septage from its own area (200 homes) with commercial grease trap wastes and open the facilities to neighbouring Councils that have more than 4000 septic tanks. The facility is an anaerobic/aerobic treatment process. Through special <b>fittings,</b> <b>grease</b> trap waste and septage are dumped by licensed contractors into one anaerobic pond, each pond designed to hold a year’...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Grease</b> <b>fittings</b> are {{permanently}} installed by either a (taper) thread or straight push-fit ('hammer in') arrangement, leaving a nipple connection that a grease gun attaches to. The pressure {{supplied by the}} grease gun forces a small captive bearing ball in the fitting to move back against the force of its retaining spring. The arrangement is thus essentially a valve that opens under pressure to allow lubricant to pass through a channel and be forced into the voids of the bearing. When the pressure ceases, the ball returns to its closed position. The ball excludes dirt and functions as a check valve to prevent grease escaping {{back out of the}} fitting. The ball is almost flush with the surface of the fitting {{so that it can be}} wiped clean to reduce the amount of debris carried with the grease into the bearing.|$|E
