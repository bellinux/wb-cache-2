5|$|Despite this performance, Illingworth was {{overlooked}} {{for further}} state selection {{for over two}} years. Returning to play for Fitzroy in district cricket, he took 63 wickets at 13.76 in the 196364 season, making him the leading wicket-taker for the season across the entire competition. He finally returned to the state team in late 1964, during the 196465 season. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> match {{at the start of}} the season against Sunraysia Cricket Association in the regional town of Mildura, Illingworth opened the bowling and took 1/15 from eight overs as Victoria took a 117-run win in the one-day match.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Charles 'Fred' Keenor (31 July 1894– 19 October 1972) was a Welsh {{professional}} footballer. He {{began his}} football career at his hometown club Cardiff City after impressing the club's coaching staff <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> match in 1912 that was organised by his former schoolteacher. A hard-tackling defender, he appeared sporadically {{for the team}} in the Southern Football League before his spell at the club was interrupted by {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, during which Keenor served in the 17th (Service) Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, led by Major Frank Buckley, which became known as the Football Battalion. During the conflict, he fought in the Battle of the Somme, suffering a severe shrapnel wound to his thigh in 1916. After lengthy rehabilitation, he returned to Britain and ended the war as a fitness instructor, reaching the rank of sergeant.|$|E

5|$|In Malaysia, {{large areas}} of {{rainforest}} were felled {{to make way for}} oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> saw almost one hundred percent occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest barn owl populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Cirencester in July 1920, Hammond {{planned to}} go to Winchester Agricultural College, {{following}} the path into farming mapped out by his mother. However, his plans changed when his headmaster wrote to the captain of Gloucestershire, Foster Robinson, reporting Hammond's school cricket record and suggesting that they {{take a look at}} him. Hammond, who scored a century in his first appearance in adult cricket days after leaving school, played <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> match for the Gloucestershire Club and Ground, scoring 60 runs, taking two wickets and impressing the local press. Subsequently, two members of Gloucestershire's committee visited Hammond's mother in an attempt to sign him for the club.

Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous snakes {{to be placed in}} the cargo hold in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). To ensure the snakes attack the passengers without the need for provocation, he has one of his henchmen disguised as an airport ground employee spray the passengers' leis with a special pheromone which makes the snakes highly aggressive. The crate opens midway through the flight and the snakes make their way through the cabin. A couple having sex in a bathroom, and a man using another bathroom are the first killed. The plane's captain, Sam McKeon, investigates and fixes an electrical short, but is killed by the viper that caused it. Co-pilot Rick, unaware of the snake, believes Sam has suffered a heart attack and continues toward LAX.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was free}} to play {{regularly}} for Middlesex in 1924. The team {{was involved in a}} close race for the County Championship with Yorkshire, and Allen had several successful matches. He ended the season with 568 runs at 21.84 and 50 wickets at 17.48. Playing less often in 1925, he scored 392 runs, took 39 wickets, and scored his maiden first-class century in the Gentlemen v Players match at the Oval. He was also chosen {{for the first time to}} represent the Gentlemen against the Players at Lord's, where he scored 52, and his reputation grew steadily. By the beginning of the 1926 season, he and fellow fast bowler Harold Larwood were tipped in the press to be chosen for the England team against Australia that summer. Allen began well for Middlesex but was less successful <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> match to help choose the England team. Larwood was chosen for the Test series; Allen was not. In county cricket, Allen scored his first century for Middlesex, and began to open the bowling occasionally, having been the third or fourth bowler in previous seasons. Overall, he scored 771 runs, the highest seasonal aggregate of his career, at an average of 29.65 and took 44 wickets at 28.27.|$|E
5|$|Although the Dirty War {{ended in}} the eighties, Kirchner {{considered}} it an unresolved issue. In his inaugural speech, he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process. He also ordered the top military leadership to retire. Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law of Due Obedience, which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War. The laws had been repealed in 1998, but that repeal had little legal significance, as only an annulment would reopen the cases. Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli, most legislators considered it a symbolic gesture since the laws' constitutionality would {{be decided by the}} Supreme Court. Both laws were annulled by the Congress in August 2003, and many cases were reopened as a result. The Supreme Court declared the laws, and Menem's presidential pardons, unconstitutional in 2005. Jorge Julio López, witness <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> of police officer Miguel Etchecolatz, disappeared in 2006.

5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for throwing in 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.|$|E
5|$|Despite Kỳ and Đức's media event, it {{appeared}} that Phát and Ton were remaining defiant after returning to the latter's 7th Division's headquarters in Mỹ Tho. Ton was apparently still maintaining a hostile political stance, and threatening {{to break away from}} the Saigon regime by overseeing the area around Mỹ Tho as a virtual independent state. Ton was reported to have threatened to cut the main highway from Saigon into Mỹ Tho and further south into the rest of the Mekong Delta, although it was thought he had no intention or means of assaulting Saigon militarily. Kỳ said a helicopter had been sent to arrest Ton but that a stand-off had developed. However, on September 16 Khánh had the plotters taken into custody. Đức, the rebel tank commander Nghia, Ton, and Lam were all arrested, followed by Phát, who returned to Saigon to turn himself <b>in.</b> <b>A</b> <b>trial</b> was then scheduled.

5|$|Having failed as a spin bowler <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trial</b> at Richmond in 1950, Meckiff {{switched}} to fast bowling in 1951–52 {{when he began}} his district career in Victorian Premier Cricket with South Melbourne.

The following summer, aged 17, Meckiff was in the senior team and played in South Melbourne's first championship-winning side in his debut season in the First XI, although his club career was sometimes interrupted by national service in the reserves. After receiving requests from cricket administrators, the military authorities scheduled the leave of young players for weekends, so that the impact on their careers would be minimised. At the time, Australia lacked bowlers of great pace, so a teammate advised Meckiff to bowl {{as fast as he}} could, without regard for accuracy—a plan he successfully adopted.|$|E
