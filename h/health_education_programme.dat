40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} descritive study {{aimed to}} develop a <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> {{that could serve as}} a teaching aid for high school Life Orientation educators. A sequential approach was used to collect data that would inform the <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme.</b> The study population comprised high school Life Orientation teachers, as well as subject advisors who were considered experts in the field of Life Orientation. A total of 31 educators participated in the initial quantitative survey and this was followed by semi-structured interviews with five (5) experts in the area of Life Orienation. The content of the <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> was based on the information obtained from semi-structured interviews. This study identified barriers to the teaching of Life Orientation, which included large classroom numbers, a lack of interest in the subject, and educators who were inadequately trained to teach the subject.

40|$|Background: The {{problem of}} obesity in {{children}} and adults has been widely recognised and described in the literature [1]. There are several challenges leading to an augmentation of the problem. Firstly, the aetiology of overweight and obesity is not clear. Secondly, the long term effectiveness of prevention programmes is low. Only in some groups and {{for a short period}} of time an effect may be visible [2]. Thirdly, little is known about what children should learn when [3]. A proper concept of educating children in regard to healthy eating or physical activity does not exist. As far as we know an essential pre-requisite for <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programmes</b> is that they are lifestyleoriented and easily transferable into daily family life [4]. For this, working together with the parents would be essential. The main goal of this article will be 1) to get a better understanding of what parents and nurses/ teachers want 2) to strengthen the point that this method is one way to involve the target groups and thus it is likely to increase the acceptance of <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programmes</b> 3) to describe that focus group discussions are a useful tool to identify the opinions of the target group. Methods: In the frame of three projects, focus groups with nurses/ teachers and parents have been carried out. Results and Conclusions: Results from different focus group discussions with pedagogues and parents will be discussed and conclusions for <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programmes</b> relevant to all key players involved will be identified...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} develop and {{validate}} a <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> to encourage breast cancer awareness and early detection behaviours among Arab women. Methods: This study took place between December 2015 and March 2016. The Enabling Systems Raising Awareness model was used to develop a breast cancer <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> which was subsequently implemented by trained health educators at three female-only fitness clubs in Muscat, Oman. Breast cancer knowledge among 53 women was assessed using the breast module of the Cancer Awareness Measure before and after each health education session. Overall pre- and post-session knowledge scores were then compared. Additionally, three focus group discussions were conducted with 10 participants from each location. Thematic {{analysis was used to}} analyse the transcribed discussions and collect feedback on the programme. Results: The health education sessions resulted in a statistically significant increase in overall mean knowledge scores (P < 0. 001). Participants also reported significantly improved intentions to undertake early detection practices (P < 0. 001). The focus group discussions yielded distinct themes and valuable feedback which can be utilised in the future to create an improved version of the programme. Conclusion: While the <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> significantly improved breast cancer and early detection knowledge among a cohort of Arab women, it still required critical improvements in terms of structure and administration.

It was estimated that between 500 and 1000 jackdaws (Corvus monedula) were present in the area where milk bottles were pecked and 63 isolates of campylobacter were made from the bill and cloaca.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of a 6 -year oral <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> in primary schoolchildren. METHODS: This programme was part of the Signal-Tandmobiel project, a longitudinal collaborative project combining the registration of oral health data and oral health promotion. The intervention group comprised 3291 children with a mean age of 7. 1 years (SD 0. 43) at the start of the programme. Every year these children were examined clinically and a questionnaire, to be filled in by the parents, was administered to assess oral health behaviour. These children received an oral <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> which consisted of a yearly 1 -h instruction. Data collected using the same questionnaire and clinical examination in 676 12 -year-old children were included as control group. The samples were obtained using stratified cluster sampling. The effect of the interventional programme was assessed by measuring differences in caries prevalence and incidence, levels of dental care and reported oral health behaviour. RESULTS: Mean DMFT/S values, although higher in the control group, were not significantly different. The reported frequency of brushing was the same in both groups. Significant differences in favour of the intervention group were found in the number of between-meal snacks (P < 0. 001) and the proper use of topical fluorides (P < 0. 05). Children in the control group showed a significantly lower proportion of filled teeth than those in the intervention group (P < 0. 01), with a care index of 73 % versus 80 %. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the implemented minimal school-based oral <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> did not result in a significant reduction of the caries prevalence measured. The programme has been effective in improving reported dietary habits and the proper use of topical fluorides and resulted in a higher care index. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we present {{qualitative}} findings of study of nurses' {{perceptions of a}} mental <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> for Australian nurses. Many nurses avoid disclosing their mental health problem/illness because of the stigmatization by health workers. Mental health education is a successful means to address workplace stigma; thus, it can be anticipated that such education can address workplace difficulties experienced by nurses with mental health problems. During 2008, a qualitative {{study was conducted to}} obtain nurses' perceptions of a short mental <b>health</b> <b>education</b> <b>programme</b> for nurses. The workshop purpose was to improve mental health literacy in order to improve support to colleagues with mental health problems. Semistructured, audio-taped interviews were conducted with 13 nurses and then transcribed. A framework analysis approach guided interpretation of the data. The education programme had limited effect on the participants' attitudes towards colleagues with mental health problems. This was likely due to their high level of mental health literacy and experiences prior to the workshop. Participants felt that a more focused nurse-specific programme might have been more efficacious. Implementing a nurse-specific education session is potentially an effective means to improve support to nurses who experience mental health problems...|$|E
