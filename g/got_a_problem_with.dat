5000|$|No, I {{never liked}} that song [...] "Athena". It's a great record.

I listened to it on the record the other day, and it's a great record; there's so much energy on that thing but I still don't think there's a center to that song. The fact that he changed the title in that and didn't stick to what {{it was supposed to be}} lost its center to me. Roger Daltrey, The News of the World, 2010 ...|$|R
2500|$|Young Buck {{released}} a song featuring Tony Yayo called [...] "Off Parole" [...] which insulted Lil Wayne. Young Buck said that Lil Wayne {{could not be}} angry, because Young Buck spoke the truth. Young Buck also said [...] "You think you <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Juve and B.G.; you'll have a true problem with me", referring to the Cash Money-Juvenile/B.G feud.

After he was dismissed, Young Buck appeared in the music video [...] "My Life" [...] by The Game, which featured Lil Wayne in the vocals. As of 2009 Buck and Wayne have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track [...] "Up's and Down's" [...] for Young Buck's Back On My Buck Shit mixtape.|$|E
2500|$|When casting for the film, Iliadis {{wanted to}} find actors who would not portray these {{characters}} in a stereotypical way. As Craven explains, they wanted someone who would take these characters {{in a direction that}} most actors would not—they wanted originality. Craven states, [...] "You need an actor who can bring a complete sense of commitment to that character without making it silly and not be afraid to go in there to the point where someone might say, 'Oh, you got bad in you?' You have to be brave enough and mature enough to know we've all got it, and you're not afraid of putting it out there and if you've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> seeing that, tough." [...] For instance, Iliadis wanted to avoid casting some superficially sexy actress in the role of Mari, because he did not want the rape sequence to appear enjoyable to the viewers in any possible way. Iliadis notes that when Sara Paxton came in her audition was [...] "good", but it was this sense of intelligence and intensity that Paxton brought with her. The actress also had the [...] "innocent face" [...] the director was looking for, someone who had this [...] "wholesomely American look" [...] that would not allow anyone to enjoy watching her go through these intense events.|$|E

5000|$|In an interview, Serbian {{actor and}} film {{director}} Dragan Bjelogrlić criticized the film: [...] "Shallow and plain wrong — sum up my feelings about this movie. I have <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>A</b> Serbian Film. Its director in particular. I've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> serious <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> the boy whose father got wealthy during the 1990s — nothing against making money, but I know how money {{was made in}} Serbia during the 1990s — and then pays for his son's education abroad and eventually the kid comes back to Serbia to film {{his view of the}} country using his dad's money and even calls the whole thing A Serbian Film. To me that's a metaphor for something unacceptable. The second generation comes back to the country and using the money that was robbed from the people of Serbia, smears the very same people by portraying them as the worst scum of the earth. You know, when the first generation of the Rockefellers finished robbing America, the second one built museums, galleries, charitable organizations, and financed America. But in Serbia we're seeing every segment of society continually being taken apart and for me this movie is a paradigm of that. I've never met this kid and I really don't want to since that meeting wouldn't be pleasant at all." ...|$|R
