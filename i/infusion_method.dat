In 14 ADPKD patients the {{total body clearance}} and the urinary clearance of inulin using the constant <b>infusion</b> <b>method</b> were compared with the “single-shot” technique.

A high correlation {{was found between the}} total body clearance and the urinary clearance for both the constant <b>infusion</b> <b>method</b> (r = 0. 96) and the single injection technique (r = 0. 96). The coefficient of variation for the total body clearance of inulin was significantly lower for the constant <b>infusion</b> <b>method</b> and the single injection technique (7. 8 % and 7. 1 %) than for the urinary clearance of inulin (11. 3 % vs. 9. 7 %, P < 0. 05). A constant overestimation of the urinary clearance by the total body clearance was observed with both methods (constant <b>infusion</b> <b>method</b> 8. 3 ml · min- 1 · 1. 73 m- 2 and single injection technique 13. 4 ml · min- 1 · 1. 73 m- 2). No concentration-dependent clearance was present. Determination of plasma inulin, especially at low levels, showed substantial interference by glucose. We conclude that, taking into account a constant overestimate of urinary clearance by the total body clearance of inulin, the single injection total body clearance possesses the best reproducibility and shows a good agreement with the conventional urinary clearance, which can be calculated by: GFR = TBCLss - 13. 1 ml · min- 1 · 1. 73 m- 2 (in the range of 28 to 124 ml · min- 1 · 1. 73 m- 2) ...|$|E

The BGE ammonium formate, acetate, and camphorsulfonate were found to have similar effects on analyte ionization. Addition of single-isomer sulfated beta-CD derivatives (available as sodium salt) to the BGE revealed that the anionic CD derivatives did not give rise to the same ionization suppression effect.

Further the effect of the functional changes mainly induced by Nembutal on the glucose metabolism in the brain was studied by means of brain perfusion. and this effect was compared with the effect of Nembutal anesthesia as studied by <b>infusion</b> <b>method.</b> The study was also focused on the metabolism of glutamic acid and aspartic acid which are the protein components of crude mitochondrial fractions in the brains of those placed under subacute compression and normal cat brain. After the infusion of [U-(14) C]-glucose, the incorporation of (14) C to free glutamic acid and aspartic acid of the brain was higher in the brain under subacute compression than in normal brain, i. e. the relative specific activity (RSA) was higher in the former than in normal brain. This tendency was more marked in aspartic acid. In observing the glucose metabolism by injecting Nembutal into carotid artery during the brain parfusion, the metabolic pattern at this stage showed a pattern intermediate between that during the high functional state and the low functional state of the brain under perfusion. This resembles the metabolic rates of glutamic acid and aspartic acid of the normal cat brain under a slight anesthesia by the <b>infusion</b> <b>method.</b> Only in the case of aspartic acid the relative specific acitivity (RSA) in the brain during the infusion was considerably lower than RSA during brain perfusion under the influence of Nembutal.
