5|$|The {{mother of}} Oswald Cobblepot and wife of Tucker Cobblepot. She {{and her husband}} {{abandoned}} their son by throwing him into Gotham City's park river after realizing that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> danger to society after he killed their cat.|$|E
5|$|Nolan has {{previously}} been called up to the England Under-18s and Under-21s and some commentators acknowledged that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> future candidate for the England squad. Reports have claimed that Nolan could be called up to the Republic of Ireland or Netherlands squads due to his ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{father of}} Oswald Cobblepot and husband of Esther Cobblepot. He {{and his wife}} {{abandoned}} their son by throwing him into Gotham City's park river after realizing that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> danger to society after he killed their cat. Burgess Meredith, the actor who played The Penguin in the 1960s Batman TV series was originally asked to play Tucker, but he declined due his health problems which culminated with his death in 1997.|$|E

50|$|The name Kamban {{indicates}} Celtic origins. Thus <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> {{man from}} Ireland, Western Isles or Isle of Man, where the Vikings already had settlements. Another theory says, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> early Christianized Norwegian {{under the influence}} of Irish monks there.|$|R
50|$|Some {{critics have}} viewed {{the film as}} semi-autobiographical, and it was {{described}} as such in a Masters of Cinema re-release. Pialat’s mother died in the same real place as the one depicted in the film, and the Philippe character is somewhat similar to Pialat himself such that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> author surrogate.|$|R
5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E
5|$|Morrison {{signed with}} the Anaheim Ducks to a one-year, US$2.75 million {{contract}} on July 7, 2008. He had received interest from as many as nine NHL teams, including the Canucks, who offered a one-year, US$1.9 million deal prior to Morrison's free agency. Morrison scored his first goal as a Duck on November 7 in a 5–2 loss to the Dallas Stars. While it was hoped <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> replacement for Andy McDonald as the team's second-line centre, Morrison struggled in his short tenure with the Ducks. He was relegated to the fourth line and made a healthy scratch at various points in the season. It was proposed by the media {{that he was not}} yet playing at full capacity on account of his off-season knee surgery. With 22 points in 62 games, he was waived by the Ducks leading up to the NHL trade deadline on March 3, 2009. He was claimed the following day by the Dallas Stars. He scored his first goal with the Stars on March 12, the game-winner in a 3–2 contest against the Carolina Hurricanes. Morrison's 2008–09 total of 31 points between the Ducks and Stars was the lowest output of his career (not including the previous season's injury-shortened campaign and his 11-game 1997–98 season).|$|E
25|$|Gooch also bowled {{occasional}} medium pace, {{and took}} over 200 first-class wickets. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> prodigious swinger of the ball if conditions suited. In dead matches he could sometimes be seen doing impressions of fellow professionals' bowling styles.|$|E
5000|$|Hugo Eugenio O'Neill, his son, was legitimated at Shane's {{death by}} Philip IV of Spain but died young. Shane's will {{provided}} that Hugo Eugenio be taught Irish, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> effective {{leader of the}} O'Neills; it also provided an elaborate system of succession if Hugo Eugenio died childless, as did happen.|$|R
50|$|Ó hÉinirí {{was born}} in 1915 in Cill Ghallagáin (Kilgalligan), County Mayo. He <b>was</b> from <b>an</b> early age {{determined}} to collect as many ancient legends and traditional stories as <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> currach-using fisherman, and a skilled rower.|$|R
2500|$|Carson {{viewed the}} Blackfoot {{nation as a}} hostile tribe, believing they posed the {{greatest}} threat to his livelihood, safety, and life. He hated the Blackfeet, and killed them at every opportunity. Historian David Roberts has written: [...] "It was taken for granted that the Blackfeet were bad Indians; to shoot them whenever <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mountain man's instinct and duty." ...|$|R
25|$|Less {{than a week}} later, Carpenter {{announced}} he would not travel to the club's Spring training site in Jupiter, Florida and instead remain in St. Louis, fearing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> distraction. At a press conference that same day, he said he still holds out hope of pitching in 2013, and refused to talk about retirement. On February 22, the team placed Carpenter on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the Braves revamped their {{starting}} rotation with the acquisitions of Mike Hampton, Russ Ortiz, Shane Reynolds, {{and the promotion}} of Horacio Ramírez from AA. Marquis was sent to the bullpen. He was upset about being sent to the bullpen, and requested to be sent to the minors where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> starting pitcher, and observed by scouts from other organizations. Ultimately, he split his season, making only 2 starts in 21 appearances for Atlanta, while starting 15games for Richmond in AAA.|$|E
25|$|Alexandra {{started a}} new life in Kiev. Initially, she settled at the Mariyinsky Palace, the Emperor's {{residence}} in Kiev, in the hope that she could recover. She completely relied on religion for solace and comfort. Bound to a wheelchair, the Grand Duchess decided to stay in Kiev for good. This was convenient for her husband, who wanted to divorce her so he could marry his mistress. Alexandra vehemently refused to grant a divorce and Nicholas hoped that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> widower so he could remarry, as it had been the case of his brother Alexander II, who after his wife's death married his mistress. Alexandra, in spite of her poor health, outlived both her husband and her husband's mistress.|$|E
50|$|Although McCrae {{remained}} {{a supporter of}} Lloyd George, {{he was unable to}} secure a seat for the 1918 General Election in which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> endorsed candidate of the Coalition Government. Later, he fought the 1922 general election as a Lloyd George National Liberal at Edinburgh Central. In a straight fight with Labour he trailed sitting MP, William Graham by 3,505 votes.|$|R

50|$|Bell {{received}} a requisition in September 1922 {{for the upcoming}} election and agreed {{to stand in the}} Bay of Islands electorate on the condition that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> Independent. <b>He</b> stood for opposition interests (at the time, William Massey's Reform government was in power) and was variously described as an Independent or Independent Liberal. He won against the incumbent of the Reform Party, Vernon Reed.|$|R
25|$|Mercurial, clever, {{and always}} {{a few steps}} ahead of his enemies, at times <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> calculating schemer who would not only {{manipulate}} people {{for the greater good}} but act like a bumbling fool to have others underestimate his true abilities. Sometimes this appears simply as a joke, such as in The Tomb of the Cybermen, where he finishes the archaeologists' calculations behind their backs, but at other times, it seems much darker. In The Evil of the Daleks he coldly manipulates Jamie into trying to rescue Victoria (thus setting in motion the Human Factor tests) and is unsympathetic when Edward Waterfield tries to apologise for his collaboration with the Daleks. Despite the bluster and tendency to panic when events got out of control, the Second Doctor always acted heroically and morally in his desire to help the oppressed.|$|E
25|$|Regarded as a five-star recruit by {{both the}} Rivals.com and Scout.com {{recruiting}} networks, Peterson was listed as the No. 1 running back and overall prospect in the Class of 2004 by Rivals.com. After considering schools such as Texas, Texas A, UCLA, Arkansas, and Miami (FL), {{he decided that he}} wanted to go to a school where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> difference-maker in a national championship run and narrowed his choices down to USC and Oklahoma. Concluding his high school football career at the annual U.S. Army All-American Bowl, he led the West squad with 95 yards on nine carries and scored two touchdowns, and announced at the game that he would attend college at the University of Oklahoma. Following his senior season, he was awarded the Hall Trophy as the U. S. Army National Player of the Year. In addition, he was named the top high school player by College Football News and Rivals.com.|$|E
25|$|South Africa's next {{international}} cricketing {{involvement was}} a triangular tournament held in England, involving the England, Australia and South Africa, the only three Test playing {{nations of the}} era. By this time, the googly duo of Schwarz and White were past their prime, while Vogler had already retired. Additionally, retirements of key players such as Sherwell ensured that South Africa were no where near their best in the series. South Africa finished bottom with just one draw, but the series was notable for the debut of Herbie Taylor, {{regarded as one of}} the finest batsmen of the era. The tournament marked the international swansong for Schwarz and White. The tournament also marked the peak of the short, but moderately successful test career of medium-pacer Sid Pegler, whose rise, coinciding as it did with the decline of Schwarz and Vogler, briefly caused him to hold the mantle of the lead bowler of the South African bowling attack before as well as to emerge as South Africa's leading bowler and a resounding success in the Triangular tournament, before commitments elsewhere in the form of the appointment as a colonial district commissioner in Nyasaland forced him to drift out of cricket - meaning that the enormous potential that he showed in that Triangular as well as the expectations that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mainstay in the South African bowling in the coming years were not quite fulfilled.|$|E

500|$|Rivera was {{considered}} an exceptional athlete, distinguished by his slender physique and durability. His propensity to shag balls during batting practice convinced scouts <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> top AL center fielder.

500|$|Wheeler {{was known}} as [...] "Rik" [...] among friends. He divided opinion among those who knew him, with some loving and others despising him, and during his lifetime, he was often criticised on both {{scholarly}} and moral grounds.

500|$|Scholars have puzzled {{over the}} Green Knight's {{symbolism}} since {{the discovery of}} the poem. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> version of the Green Man, a mythological being connected with nature in medieval art, a Christian symbol, or the Devil himself. British medieval scholar C. S. Lewis said the character was [...] "as vivid and concrete as any image in literature" [...] and J. R. R. Tolkien said he was the [...] "most difficult character" [...] to interpret in Sir Gawain. His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious. He appears in only two other poems: The Greene Knight and King Arthur and King Cornwall. Scholars have attempted to connect him to other mythical characters, such as Jack in the green of English tradition and to Al-Khidr, but no definitive connection has yet been established.|$|E
