International gas vendors have tested {{the use of the}} compression system to remove other flue gas impurities such as NOx; however, the reaction mechanism of mercury and its reaction products with NOx and nitric acid formed with condensed water vapour are unclear. This study used lab scale experiments to study the absorption of <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> into nitric acid and the gas phase reaction between mercury and nitrogen dioxide formed from oxidised NO at pressures up to 25 bar. It was observed that mercury has limited absorption into nitric acid and may partially desorb out of solution after depressurisation. On the other hand, mercury reacted readily with nitrogen dioxide (formed from nitric oxide oxidation at high pressure) in the gas phase. These gas phase reactions from the oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide to the subsequent oxidation of elemental mercury by nitrogen dioxide were predicted using existing global kinetic equations. The limited absorption of <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> in nitric acid and significant oxidation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> by nitrogen dioxide suggests that the primary removal step for elemental mercury is through the gas phase reaction.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern about the mercury (Hg) vented from {{submarine}} hydrothermal fluids to the marine surrounding and exchange of dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) between the sea surface and the atmosphere. A geochemical survey of thermal waters collected from submarine vents at Panarea Island (Aeolian Islands, southern Italy) was carried out in 2015 (15 – 17 th June and 17 – 18 th November), in order to investigate the concentration of Hg species in hydrothermal fluids and the vertical distribution in the overlying water column close to the submarine exhalative area. Specific sampling methods were employed by Scuba divers at five submarine vents located along the main regional tectonic lines. The analysis of the hydrothermal fluids indicates a site-to-site variation, with filtered total mercury (FTHg) concentrations ranging from 1072 to 4711 pM, {{as a consequence of the}} gas bubbles partial dissolution. These results are three orders of magnitude higher than the FTHg concentrations found in the overlying seawater column (ranging from 5. 3 to 6. 3 pM in the mid waters), where the efficient currents and vertical mixing result in more dilution, and potentially rapid transfer of the dissolved gaseous Hg to the atmosphere. Dissolved gaseous mercury (DGM) and gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) were simultaneously measured and combined in a gas-exchange model to calculate the sea-air Hg 0 evasional flux. Based on the data of DGM (range: 0. 05 – 0. 22 pM) and atmospheric GEM (range: 1. 7 ± 0. 35 – 6. 4 ± 2. 6 ng m− 3), we argue that the surface seawater off Panarea is mostly supersaturated in dissolved <b>elemental</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> compared to the atmosphere, with a sea-air Hg 0 net flux ranging from 0. 7 to 9. 1 ng m− 2 h− 1 (average: ~ 4. 5 ± 3. 5 ng m− 2 h− 1).

40|$|Polar {{ecosystems}} {{are considered to}} be the last pristine environments of the Earth relatively uninfluenced by human activities. Antarctica in particular, compared to the Arctic is considered to be even less affected by any kind of anthropogenic influences. Once contaminants reach the polar regions, their lifetime in the troposphere depends on local removal processes. Atmospheric mercury, in particular, has unique characteristics that include long-range transport to polar regions and the transformation to more toxic and water-soluble compounds that may potentially become bioavailable. These chemical-physical properties have given mercury on the priority list of an increasing number of international, European and national conventions and agreements aimed at the protection of the ecosystems including human health (i. e., GEO, UNEP, AMAP, UN-ECE, HELCOM, OSPAR) thus stimulating a significant amount of research including measurements of Hg 0 reaction rate constant with atmospheric oxidants, experimental and modelling studies {{in order to understand the}} cycling of Hg in polar regions and its impact to these ecosystems. Special attention in terms of contamination of polar regions, is paid to the consequences of the springtime phenomena, referred to as ''atmospheric mercury depletion event'' (AMDE), during which <b>elemental</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> (GEM or Hg 0 ) through a series of photochemically-initiated reactions involving halogens, may be converted to a reactive form that may accumulate in polar ecosystems. The discovery of the AMDE, first noted in the Arctic, has also been observed at both poles and was initially considered to result in an important net input of atmospheric Hg into the polar surfaces. However, recent studies point out that complex processes take place after deposition that may result in less significant net-inputs from the atmosphere since a fraction, sometimes significant of deposited Hg may be recycled. Therefore, the contribution of this unique reactivity occurring in polar atmospheres to the global budget of atmospheric Hg and the role played by snow and ice surfaces of these regions are important issues. This paper presents a review of atmospheric mercury studies conducted in the Antarctic troposphere, both at coastal locations and on the Antarctic Plateau since 1985.

40|$|Long-range {{atmospheric}} transport of mercury, its transformation to more toxic methylmercury compounds, and their bioaccumulation in the aquatic food chain have motivated international research on mercury as a pollutant of global concern. The background concentration of <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> (Hg" 0) {{in the lower}} troposphere of the northern hemisphere is generally around 1, 9 ng/m" 3 and 1, 3 ng/m" 3 in the southern hemisphere respectively. Highly time-resolved atmospheric mercury measurements in the Antarctic have shown that mercury depletion events do also occur in the Antarctic at Neumayer Station {{during the first three}} months after polar sunrise. This phenomenon leads to an increased input of atmospheric mercury into the polar ecosystem. A possible explanation for mercury depletion events may involve chemical or photochemical oxidation of Hg" 0 to Hg" 2 "+ [resulting either in particle-associated mercury (Total Particulate-Phase Mercury: TPM) and/or reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> (RGM) species] and significantly enhanced deposition fluxes of mercury leading to unequivocally increased input of atmospheric mercury into the polar ecosystem. The Antarctic mercury depletion phenomenon is strongly correlated with ground-level ozone depletion episodes. These trophospheric ozone loss events in the Antarctic are associated with enhanced bromine monoxide concentrations in the free troposphere. It is hypothesized that Br atoms and/or BrO radicals are involved in a chemical reaction which destroys ozone. The following depletion of atmospheric boundary layer mercury (at times up to an altitude of #approx# 1 km) is due to a reaction between <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> and BrO free radicals.

40|$|Mercury is {{a global}} {{pollutant}} {{that can be found}} in different forms and different ecosystems. Special attention has recently been devoted to mercury due to its high chemical reactivity, its global spreading, its biogeochemical cycling, its transformations in the environment, its ability for biomagnification and its high toxicity. Beside anthropogenic sources, mercury can also be of natural origin. Among natural Hg sources, volcanoes can be important. Volcanic gas emissions may be rich in <b>elemental</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> (Hg 0), reactive gaseous mercury (HgII) and other mercury forms. Mt.

Mercury concentrations have been measured on Mt. Etna during several campaigns carried out between 2004 and 2007 in fumaroles, mofettes and diffuse degassing areas, as well as in the air inside and across the volcanic plume. In addition, Hg fluxes have been measured by flux chamber technique. Mercury concentrations measured in air below the volcanic plume in November 2004 ranged between 4 and 30 ng m- 3 at low altitude, and between 65 and 132 ng m- 3 close to the summit craters. A profile of Hg in the air below the volcanic plume carried out on helicopter on November 2006 showed Hg concentrations up to 60 ng m- 3. Hg contents in fumarole gases reached 64, 200 ng m- 3, and soil gas Hg showed temporal variations that reached the highest values (up to 240 ng m- 3) in fall 2005. The highest Hg fluxes were measured in bubbling gas from mud volcanoes at the SW foot of Etna, reaching 1300 ng m- 2 h- 1. Mercury contents were found highly correlated both with water/mud temperature at mud volcanoes and with concurrent soil CO 2 effluxes. In the latter case, hydrothermal gases showed higher values and a higher correlation than “cold”gases.

40|$|Modelling of {{atmospheric}} transport of heavy metals emitted from Polish power sectorMany {{studies have been}} conducted to investigate the atmospheric heavy metals contamination and its deposition to ecosystems. The increasing attention to mercury pollution has been mainly driven by the growing evidence of its negative impacts on wildlife, ecosystems and particularly human health. Lead and cadium are also toxics which are being emitted into the atmosphere by anthropogenic as well as natural sources. The harmful influence of these three heavy metals was underlined in the Aarhus Protocol on Heavy Metals of 1998. The Parties of this protocol (including Poland) are obligated to reduce emissions, observe the transport and the amounts of lead, mercury and cadmium in the environment. Poland {{is one of the biggest}} emitter of mercury, lead and cadmium in Europe mainly due to emission from coal combustion processes. Therefore in Poland, research efforts to study the heavy metals emission, atmospheric transport, concentration and deposition are extremely important. The objectives of this work were twofold:•The practical objective was to develop and run a model to represent the atmospheric dispersion of mercury and to implement it in the air quality modelling platform Polyphemus. •The scientific objective was to perform heavy metals dispersion studies over Europe and detailed studies of the impact of the polish power sector on the air quality regarding mercury, cadmium and lead. To meet the declared aim, a new mercury chemical model was implemented into the Polyphemus air quality system. The scientific literature was reviewed regarding mercury chemistry and mercury chemical models. It can be concluded that the chemistry of mercury is still not well known. The models also differ in the way of calculating the dry and wet deposition of mercury. The <b>elemental</b> <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> ambient concentrations are evenly distributed, on the contrary, high variations in the spatial gradients of reactive gaseous and particulate forms of mercury air concentrations and deposition fluxes were noted. This study shows that many components of the developed model have crucial impacts on the results. In the model of mercury chemistry, the most effective pathway in the gaseous phase are the oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury by hydroxyl radical, ozone and most of all bromine oxide radicals, while in the aqueous phase the reduction reactions of elemental mercury dominate. These reactions have a crucial influence on the mass balance of reactive mercury, but a rather low influence on gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). In this model, dry deposition of gaseous elemental mercury is the prevailing process for removing mercury from the atmosphere. Dry deposition of GEM over land is equally distributed, due to almost uniform ambient concentrations. The relatively high dry deposition flux of gaseous elemental mercury has a huge influence on the presented results and differs significantly from other models where the dry deposition of GEM is often not taken into account. It was also shown that a change in the calculation of the scavenging coefficients or representative raindrop diameter for in-cloud scavenging has a significant impact on the amount of wet deposited mercury. The detailed results show that the Polish power sector can be responsible for up to 80 % of wet deposited mercury near large emission sources. The contribution from national sources over whole Poland reaches 21 % during the winter heating season when large quantities of coal are burned in the domestic sector and additionally the power sector activity is at its highest. The impact of emissions of cadmium and lead from the power sector is lower compared to the obtained results for mercury. The modelling results showed maximal impacts of 30 % and 10 % for cadmium and lead near large power sector sources on the ambient concentrations and deposition.

In addition, the model estimates the impact of oxidation of <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> from the three pathways. The inverse model identified direct emissions of reactive mercury, defined as the sum of reactive <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> and particle-bound mercury, that are associated with regional sources and with forest fires. The results suggest that oxidation by ozone is adequately characterized in existing chemical mechanisms, but that oxidation by the hydroxyl radical and by bromine may be underestimated. The results suggest that between 50 and 70 percent of the reactive mercury at the measurement site is due to direct emissions and hence suggest the importance of developing emission inventories for reactive mercury species. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

The following mercury species/fractions were measured: <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> (GEM), particulate bound <b>mercury</b> (PBM) and <b>gaseous</b> oxidised <b>mercury</b> (GOM) using the Tekran measurement system. The mercury concentrations measured at the Råö site were found to be low in comparison to other, comparable, European measurement sites. A back-trajectory analysis to study the origin of air masses reaching the Råö site was performed. Due to the remote location of the Råö measurement station it receives background air about 60...|$|R
40|$|This {{initiative}} establishes an Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMnet) {{to serve}} scientists, modelers, policy makers, federal, state, and tribal government agencies, and the public. The AMnet {{will be the}} part of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program. The purpose of the AMnet is to monitor, summarize, and report on atmospheric mercury species which contribute to dry and total mercury deposition. The network builds on NADP’s rich history of successful, collaborative environmental monitoring by offering a new database of high quality mercury measurements that complement the existing NADP-MDN program. The specific objectives of the AMnet are to determine the status and trends in measured concentrations of ambient air <b>mercury</b> species including: <b>Gaseous</b> Oxidized <b>Mercury</b> (GOM), Particulate bound mercury (PBM 2. 5), and <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> (GEM) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSnow {{surfaces}} play {{an important}} role in the biogeochemical cycle of mercury in high-latitude regions. Snowpacks act both as sources and sinks for gaseous compounds. Surprisingly, the roles of each environmental parameter that can govern the air–surface exchange over snow are not well understood owing to the lack of systematic studies. A laboratory system called the laboratory flux measurement system was used to study the emission of <b>gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> from a natural snowpack under controlled conditions. The first results from three snowpacks originating from alpine, urban and polar areas are presented. Consistent with observations in the field, we were able to reproduce <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> emissions and showed that they are mainly driven by solar radiation and especially UV-B radiation. From these laboratory experiments, we derived kinetic constants which show that divalent mercury can have a short natural lifetime of about 4 – 6 h in snow...|$|R
40|$|Since autumn 2012, total <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> (TGM) {{has been}} {{monitored}} at Harwell, Oxfordshire, UK. Harwell {{is one of}} the UKs two EMEP supersites (Level II) and is operated by Ricardo-AEA on behalf of the UK Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Heavy metals in air monitoring is undertaken at the site as part of the UK rural heavy metals monitoring network run by the UK’s Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. The monitoring site is a semi-rural site, and is located on part of the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, located at 51. 571 °N, 1. 325 °W. Total <b>gaseous</b> <b>mercury</b> (comprising <b>elemental</b> and <b>gaseous</b> oxidised <b>mercury)</b> was monitored using a Tekran 2537 A mercury vapour analyser, run at a resolution of 5 minutes, using dual channels allowing for continuous monitoring. The average concentration for December 2012 was 1. 34 ng m- 3, which is slightly lower than the northern hemispherical background observed in other studies. This poster presents an initial overview of TGM measurements at the Harwell supersite since November 2012. Using wind sector analysis, cluster analysis and air-mass back trajectories in the OpenAir package in the R statistical software, we show how TGM concentrations are influenced by local and regional sources (< 50 km) as well as air masses moving over the UK from continental Europe on easterly winds. ...|$|R
50|$|Mercury {{enters the}} ocean in {{different}} ways. Atmospheric deposition is the largest source of mercury to the oceans. Atmospheric deposition introduces three types of mercury to the ocean. <b>Gaseous</b> <b>elemental</b> <b>mercury</b> (Hg0) enters the ocean through air-water exchange. Inorganic mercury (Hg2+/HgII) and particle-bound mercury (Hg(P)) enters through wet and dry deposition. In addition, mercury enters the ocean via rivers, estuaries, sediments, and, hydrothermal vents etc. These sources also release organic mercury compounds such as Methyl mercury. Once {{they are in the}} ocean they can undergo many reactions primarily grouped as; redox reactions (gain or loss of electrons), adsorption processes (binding to solid particles), methylation and demethylation (addition or removal of a methyl group).|$|R

Using EMEP measurements of gaseous mer-cury and performing the inversions, it is shown that boundary conditions can be improved significantly as well as the fore-cast concentrations. Using inverse modelling to improve the emission inventory is however much more difficult. Indeed, there are currently not enough mercury monitoring stations, and they are located far away from the center of Europe. ...|$|R
