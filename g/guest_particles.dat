50|$|Matrix {{isolation}} is an experimental technique used in chemistry and physics which generally involves a material being trapped within an unreactive matrix. A host matrix is a continuous solid phase in which <b>guest</b> <b>particles</b> (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) are embedded. The guest {{is said to}} be isolated within the host matrix. Initially the term matrix-isolation was used to describe the placing of a chemical species in any unreactive material, often polymers or resins, but more recently has referred specifically to gases in low-temperature solids. A typical matrix isolation experiment involves a guest sample being diluted in the gas phase with the host material, usually a noble gas or nitrogen. This mixture is then deposited on a window that is cooled to below the melting point of the host gas. The sample may then be studied using various spectroscopic procedures.|$|E

The potential of mean force (PMF) {{as a function of}} the relative position of the Xe atom perpendicular to the ice surface is found to increase abruptly as the particle propagates from the disordered outermost region to the deeper hexagonally ordered region. A set of local minima observed in the PMF appears to correspond directly to the layer-by-layer crystal structure of hexagonal ice. Along with the unbound state, the first two minima (with similar free energies) that correspond to the accommodation of the <b>guest</b> <b>particle</b> on and inside the disordered outermost bilayer, respectively, are found to be populated during the MD runs. The multiple transitions of the system among these three states are also observed in accord with the PMF profile, which also suggests that the penetration of any ordered hexagonal bilayer by the Xe atom is unlikely. Furthermore, MD simulations of pristine ice (i. e., without Xe) over a 3 -ns simulation period show that the initially perfect-ordered hexagonal crystalline structure of the outermost bilayer undergoes transformation to a noncrystalline phase, in which fragmented domains with hexagonal ordering persist. Moreover, the accommodation of the Xe atom inside the outermost bilayer could facilitate further disordering of the hexagonal structure of this bilayer with the formation of a completely disordered Xe-ice surface phase. 1...|$|R

Large host silica gel (SG) particles (d 50 = 55 μm) were coated with fine invited particles of magnesium stearate (MS, d 50 = 4. 6 μm) for different contents of MS in the mixture. The real MS mass fraction wI obtained after mechanical treatment has been determined thanks to calibration from TGA measurements. The surface structure and morphology of MS coatings were observed using Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) [26, 27]. AFM has been also {{used to measure the}} adhesion forces between particles. Interaction forces between the material attached to the cantilever (Magnesium Stearate MS) and the surface of the composite material (Silica Gel SG or Magnesium Stearate MS) have been determined at different surface locations. For different compositions wI of the mixture MS-SG, the numeric distribution and the mean value f of the forces fH obtained for MS-SG interactions or fI for MS-MS interactions have been established and the experimental curve showing the evolution of f versus wI has been derived. Models of ordered structures have been developed, implying morphological hypotheses concerning large spherical or cylindrical host particles H and small invited spherical I. Different types of distribution of I materials onto the surface of H have been considered: for examples a discrete monolayer –or multilayers- of monosized particles I on the H surface. The coordinence of MS particles around SG particles has been estimated to calculate the free SG surface fraction through different modelling and to obtain the mean force f versus composition wI.

40|$|Conference on Particulate Systems Analysis, Stratford upon Avon, ENGLAND, SEP 21 - 23, 2005 International audienceDry {{powder coating}} is a {{powerful}} method for modifying the surface properties of particles whilst retaining their essential bulk properties. The coating of a host powder by <b>guest</b> <b>particles</b> can be achieved via different means ranging from simple stirring together of the two components, to high energy impact coating in devices such as a Nara Hybridizer or Turbula Mixer. The quality of the powder coating resulting from such methods is an important parameter, which depends both on {{the force of the}} mechanical action used, and also the physicochemical interactions between the host and <b>guest</b> <b>particles.</b> Here, a method for evaluating the strength of host-guest interactions based on particle size analysis using a standard Malvern Mastersizer with dry powder feed is presented.

Complementary examination is undertaken using an environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM).

This assemblage usually acts as the host to the <b>guest</b> mineral <b>particles,</b> a well known phenomenon in composite materials. The macromolecules can, surprisingly, also be the guests inside a host crystal, to form a sort of reverse composite material. Their presence both between and within crystals creates diverse interfaces and interphases, and these have marked effects on the mechanical properties of the material. Such “novelties” are {{the products of the}} evolutionary process, which by trial and error {{over long periods of time}} arrives at a solution that works. This may not be the most elegant solution or the most economical solution, and is therefore often unexpected. It is thus the possibility of discovering the unexpected that makes the investigation of biological materials so exciting. In some cases the biological solution to a problem may also be useful for improving synthetic materials, an added benefit.

40|$|We {{report a}} {{molecular}} dynamics {{study of a}} binary mixture consisting of a large (host) particle and a smaller (<b>guest)</b> <b>particle</b> whose radius is varied over a range. These simulations investigate the possible existence of a diffusion anomaly or levitation effect in dense fluids, previously seen for guest molecules diffusing within porous solids. The voids in the larger component have been characterized in terms of void and neck distributions by means of Voronoi polyhedral analysis. Four different mixtures with differing ratios of guest to host diffusivities (D) have been studied. The {{results suggest that the}} diffusion anomaly is seen in both close-packed solids with disorder and dense fluids. In the latter, the void network is constantly and dynamically changing and possesses a considerable degree of disorder. The two regimes, viz., the linear regime (LR) and the anomalous regime (AR), found for porous solids are shown to exist for a dense medium as well. The linear regime is characterized by D_g α 1 /σ_g_g^ 2, where σ_g_g is the diameter of the guest. The anomalous regime exhibits a maximum in D up to rather high temperatures (T* = 1. 663), even though in porous solids the maximum disappears at higher temperatures. In agreement with previous studies on porous solids, a particle in the AR is associated with lower activation energy, lower friction, and less backscattering in the velocity autocorrelation function when compared to a particle in the LR. Wavevector dependent self-diffusivity,Δ, and decay of the intermediate scattering function, F_s(k, t), exhibit contrasting behaviors for the LR and AR. For LR, Δ exhibits a minimum at values of k at which there are spatial correlations in S(k) while a smooth decrease with k is seen for AR. For LR, F_s(k, t) shows a biexponential decay corresponding to two different time scales of motion. Probably, the fast decay is associated with motion within the first shell of solvent neighbors and the slow decay with motion past these shells. For AR, a single-exponential decay is seen. The results indicate a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relationship. The relevant quantity that determines the validity of the SE relationship is the levitation parameter which is indirectly related to the solute/solvent radius ratio and not either the size of the solute or the solvent alone...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{atoms and}} small {{clusters}} introduced into superfluid helium (He II) concentrate there in quantized vortices to form (by further coagulation) the thin nanowires. The nanowires' thickness and structure are well predicted by a double-staged mechanism. On {{the first stage}} the coagulation of cold particles in the vortex cores leads to melting of their fusion product, which acquires a spherical shape due to surface tension. Then (second stage) when these particles reach a certain size they do not possess sufficient energy to melt and eventually coalesce into the nanowires. Nevertheless the assumption of melting for such refractory metal as tungsten, especially in He II, which possesses an extremely high thermal conductivity, induces natural skepticism. That is why we decided to register directly the visible thermal emission accompanying metals coagulation in He II. The brightness temperatures of this radiation for the tungsten, molybdenum, and platinum coagulation {{were found to be}} noticeably higher than even the metals' melting temperatures. The region of He II that contained suspended metal particles expanded with the velocity of 50 m/s, being close to the Landau velocity, but coagulation took place even more quickly, so that the whole process of nanowire growth is completed at distances about 1. 5 mm from the place of metal injection into He II.

For nanosized silica <b>guest</b> <b>particles,</b> FESEM images show that both the magnetic assisted impaction coater (MAIC) and the hybridizer (HB) produce particles that are significantly more uniformly coated than using either a V-shape blender or simple hand mixing. Image analysis confirms that MAIC and HB provide higher surface coverage {{for the amount of}} guest material (flow aid) used. The improvement in flowablity of coated cornstarch is determined from angle of repose measurements using a Hosokawa powder tester. These measurements show that nanosized silica provides the best flowability enhancement, whereas mono-dispersed 500 -nm silica does not improve the flow properties of cornstarch at all. This observation agrees with a simple theoretical derivation based on the original Rumpf model, which shows that the flowability improvement is inversely proportional to the guest particle size for a given host particle size or size of surface asperities. Experimental results also indicate that surface-treated hydrophobic silica is more effective in improving the flowability of cornstarch particles than untreated hydrophilic silica. An increase in processing time using MAIC and the V-blender also improves the flowability of the cornstarch since the <b>guest</b> <b>particles</b> are more deagglomerated and better dispersed, the longer the processing time...|$|E

40|$|Ag/ZnO nanocomposites were {{prepared}} on Si(100) substrates by an innovative approach {{consisting of the}} deposition of ZnO host matrices by Plasma Enhanced-Chemical Vapor Deposition (PE-CVD) and the subsequent dispersion of Ag <b>guest</b> <b>particles</b> by Radio Frequency (RF) -sputtering. In particular, ZnO nanostructures were synthesised from Ar-O 2 plasmas using a Zn(II) bis(ketoiminate) precursor at 300 °C and 1. 0 mbar, with an RF-power of 20 W. Subsequently, Ag was sputtered on the obtained systems under mild conditions (Ar, total pressure= 0. 3 mbar; substrate temperature= 60 °C; RF-power= 5 W). The structural, morphological and compositional features of the obtained nanosystems were analysed by Glancing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD), Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM) and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDXS). To attain a detailed insight into the chemical characteristics of the Ag/ZnO nanocomposites, this contribution {{is devoted to the}} investigation of a representative specimen by X-ray Photoelectron (XPS) and X-ray Excited Auger Electron (XEAES) Spectroscopies. In particular, the attention is focused on the analysis of the O 1 s, Zn 2 p 3 / 2, Zn 3 p and Ag 3 d core levels, as well as zinc and silver Auger signals. The results highlight an appreciable silver surface oxidation and an electronic interplay between Ag/Ag 2 O and ZnO phases...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{titanium}} dioxide target (99. 7 %) of 1 cm in dia was ablated in vacuum by laser pulses (6 ns) at 266 nm and at repetition rate of 10 Hz. During deposition the laser fluence between 1 and 3. 5 J/cm 2 and the O 2 {{pressure from the}} range of 10 - 2 – 1 Pa were applied. The thin TiO 2 films were deposited on glass substrate (1 × 1 cm 2) heated up to 500 °C. The chemical composition of the film and samples produced by annealing were investigated by spectroscopic techniques (µ-Raman, EDX) and the structure, porosity and surface morphology were analysed by means of SEM and x-ray diffraction (XRD). The SEM inspection of the TiO 2 thin film samples indicates that the obtained material is mostly crystalline. After annealing in O 2 at 500 °C the structure characterized {{by the presence of}} both anatase and rutile phases is observed in the Raman spectra and confirmed by the XRD data. The phase content ratio depends on the O 2 pressure applied. Results confirm that nanostructures produced in this way represent densely packed columns and promote deep penetration of <b>guest</b> <b>particles</b> such as CO 2. The resulting large active surface is advantageous {{from the point of view}} of photocatalytic applications...|$|E
