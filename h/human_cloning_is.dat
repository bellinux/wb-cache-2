40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the moral, ethical and legal aspects of reproductive <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> After examining {{the facts about}} cloning, this thesis tackles the difficult question of whether <b>humans</b> should <b>be</b> <b>cloned.</b> This <b>is</b> explored through an in-depth analysis of the moral and ethical acceptability of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> The author concludes that <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> should never <b>be</b> attempted and that consequently such a practice should be permanently prohibited by a legal norm. This thesis then surveys national legislation and international law {{to see if there}} presently exists a prohibition of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> This thesis then examines possible future legal action regarding <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> and suggests a legislative scheme. Finally, possible constitutional challenges to future Canadian legislation prohibiting <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. This analysis focuses on the right to liberty and the right to security of the person entrenched in section 7 and the right to equality embodied in section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The author concludes that such challenges would likely be unsuccessful...|$|R

[...] Scientists describing the same processes used terminology such as, [...] "insert an isolated nucleus from the donor to produce a dividing and viable embryo" [...] into an enulceated egg" [...] One reason why Christian fundamentalist pastors would be more apt to use terminology which includes [...] "DNA" [...] more prominently is that DNA is a [...] "value-laden" [...] term which carries religious significance.

5000|$|As {{the plot}} opens in 2276, {{a number of}} factors are {{combining}} to make a diplomatic visit to the 'mother world' of Earth a necessity. Firstly, the forthcoming 500th anniversary of US Independence, which is bringing in colonists from the entire Solar System, obviously needs a suitable representative from Titan. Secondly, the Makenzie family carry a fatal damaged gene that means any normal continuation of the family line is impossible — so both Duncan and his [...] "father" [...] Colin are clones of his [...] "grandfather" [...] Malcolm. <b>Human</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>is</b> a mature technology but is even at this time ethically controversial. And thirdly, technological advances in spacecraft drive systems — specifically the 'asymptotic drive' which improves the fuel efficiency by orders of magnitude — means that Titan's whole economy is under threat as the demand for hydrogen is about to collapse.|$|E
5000|$|Following the announcement, then-White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan {{spoke on}} behalf of {{president}} George W.

25|$|Two {{commonly}} discussed {{types of}} theoretical <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>are</b> therapeutic <b>cloning</b> and reproductive cloning. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells {{from a human}} for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, as of 2014. Two common methods of therapeutic <b>cloning</b> that <b>are</b> being researched are somatic-cell nuclear transfer and, more recently, pluripotent stem cell induction. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire <b>cloned</b> <b>human,</b> instead of just specific cells or tissues.|$|R
40|$|Many new {{reproductive}} {{methods such as}} artificial insemination, {{in vitro}} fertilisation, freezing of human embryos, and surrogate motherhood were at first widely condemned but are now seen in Western society as not just ethically and morally acceptable, but beneficial in that they allow otherwise infertile couples to have children. The idea of <b>human</b> <b>cloning</b> <b>was</b> also quickly condemned but debate is now emerging. This article examines cloning from a Jewish perspective and finds {{evidence to support the}} view that there is nothing inherently wrong with the idea of <b>human</b> <b>cloning.</b> A hypothesis <b>is</b> also advanced suggesting that even if a body <b>was</b> <b>cloned,</b> the brain, which is the essence of humanity, would remain unique. This author suggests that the debate should be changed from "Is cloning wrong?" to "When <b>is</b> <b>cloning</b> wrong?"...|$|R
