Through them almost the whole body of the nobility were in 'debt {{to the king}}; and when he thought proper to confiscate the effects of the Jews, the securities passed into his hands; and by this means he must have possessed one of the strongest and most terrible instruments of authority that could possibly be devised, and the best calculated to keep the people in an abject and slavish dependence.|$|E
60|$|By the Feudal Law, all landed {{property}} is, by a feigned conclusion, {{supposed to be}} derived, and therefore to be mediately or immediately held, from the crown.

But its consequent rights being once supposed, many real charges and burdens grew from a fiction made only for the preservation of subordination; and in consequence of this, a great power was exercised over the persons and estates of the tenants. The fines on the succession to an estate, called in the feudal language reliefs, were not fixed to any certainty, and were therefore frequently made so excessive that they might rather be considered as redemptions or new purchases than acknowledgments of superiority and tenure. With respect to that most important article of marriage, there was, in {{the very nature of the}} feudal holding, a great restraint laid upon it. It was of importance to the lord that the person who received the feud should be submissive to him; he had, therefore, a right to interfere in the marriage of the heiress who inherited the feud. This right was carried further than the necessity required: the male heir himself was obliged to marry according to the choice of his lord; and even widows, who had made one sacrifice to the feudal tyranny, were neither suffered to continue in the widowed state nor to choose for themselves the partners of their second bed. In fact, marriage was publicly set up to sale. The ancient records of the Exchequer afford many instances where some women purchased by heavy fines the privilege of a single life, some the free choice of an husband, others the liberty of rejecting some person particularly disagreeable. And what may appear extraordinary, there are not wanting examples where a woman has fined in a considerable sum, that she might not be compelled to marry a certain man; the suitor, on the other hand, has outbid her, and solely by offering more for the marriage than the heiress could to prevent it, he carried his point directly and avowedly against her inclinations.

6000|$|The common law, as it then {{prevailed in}} England, {{was in a}} great measure {{composed}} of some remnants of the old Saxon customs, joined to the feudal institutions brought in at the Norman conquest. And it is here to be observed, that the constitutions of Magna Charta {{are by no means}} a renewal of the laws of St. Edward, or the ancient Saxon laws, as our historians and law-writers generally, though very groundlessly, assert. They bear no resemblance, in any particular, to the laws of St. Edward, or to any other collection of these ancient institutions. Indeed, how should they? The object of Magna Charta is the correction of the feudal policy, which was first introduced, at least in any regular form, at the Conquest, and did not subsist before it. It may be further observed, that in the preamble to the Great Charter it is stipulated, that the barons shall HOLD the liberties, there granted TO THEM AND THEIR HEIRS, from THE KING AND HIS HEIRS; which shows, that the doctrine of an unalienable tenure was always uppermost in their minds. Their idea even of liberty was not (if I may use the expression) perfectly free; and they did not claim to possess their privileges upon any natural principle or independent bottom, but, just as they held their lands, from the king. This is worthy of observation. By the feudal law all landed property is, by a feigned conclusion, supposed to be derived, and therefore to be mediately or immediately held, from the Crown. If some estates were so derived, others were certainly procured by the same original title of conquest, by which the crown itself was acquired; and the derivation from the king could in reason only be considered as a fiction of law.

Since the diffusion approximation starts to loose its validity for E/Z >~ 10 ^(16 - 17) eV, we propagate individual cosmic rays (CRs) using Galactic magnetic field models and taking into account both their regular and turbulent components. The turbulent field is generated on a nested grid which allows spatial resolution down to fractions of a parsec. Assuming sufficiently frequent Galactic CR sources, the dipole amplitude computed for a mostly light or intermediate primary composition exceeds the dipole bounds measured by the Auger collaboration around E ~ 10 ^ 18 eV.

We simulate the propagation of different species of particles coming from the direction of Centaurus A in the Galactic magnetic fields, and find that only particles of nuclear charge Z 10 can avoid being deflected outside of the 18 ^∘ window of Centaurus A. On the other hand, considering the increasingly <b>heavy</b> <b>composition</b> of UHECRs at the highest energies measured by PAO, a plausible scenario for cosmic rays from the direction of Centaurus A can be found if they consist of intermediate-mass nuclei.

We find that cosmic ray acceleration in the lobes of Centaurus A is not favored, while acceleration in the stellar winds that are rich in intermediate-mass nuclei, could meet the requirement.
