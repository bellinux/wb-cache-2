Harmful substances in wastewater can be degraded by using <b>flocculants.</b> There are many kinds of <b>flocculants,</b> which mainly include two categories: inorganic <b>flocculants</b> and organic <b>flocculants</b> [7]. Inorganic <b>flocculants</b> mainly include inorganic coagulants and inorganic high molecular <b>flocculants</b> such as iron salt, aluminum salt, etc. [8].

Organic <b>flocculants</b> include synthetic organic polymer <b>flocculants,</b> natural organic high molecular <b>flocculants,</b> and microbial <b>flocculants</b> such as polyacrylamide [4].

25|$|Since {{its early}} days, Sellafield has {{discharged}} low-level radioactive waste into the sea, using a flocculation process to remove radioactivity from liquid effluent before discharge. Metals dissolved in acidic effluents produced a metal hydroxide <b>flocculant</b> precipitate following {{the addition of}} ammonium hydroxide. The suspension was then transferred to settling tanks where the precipitate would settle out, and the remaining clarified liquid, or supernate, would be discharged to the Irish Sea. In 1994 the Enhanced Actinide Removal Plant (EARP) was opened. In EARP {{the effectiveness of the}} process is enhanced by the addition of reagents to remove the remaining soluble radioactive species. EARP was enhanced in 2004 to further reduce the quantities of technetium-99 released to the environment.|$|E

40|$|Polymer <b>flocculants,</b> {{traditionally}} {{used with}} primary coagulant to enhance flocculation and sedimentation, {{are used in}} the coagulation-/microfiltration process as well assuming they can improve membrane performance similarly. However, there are several uncertainties concerning the use of polymer <b>flocculants</b> in the coagulation-microfiltration process. First, polymer <b>flocculants</b> may not have measurable effect on turbidity removal, because microfiltration membranes can remove significantly smaller particles than those removed by the conventional treatment process. Second, the effect of using polymer <b>flocculants</b> on NOM removal has been controversial. Although a number of studies reported improved NOM removal when polymers were used, others reported no or negative impact of polymers on NOM removal. Third, polymer <b>flocculants</b> are high molecular weight organic compounds. When carried over to membrane residual polymers can potentially foul the membranes. Finally, the use of polymer <b>flocculants</b> will change floc properties (i. e. size, fractal dimension, and stickiness) and subsequently bring uncertain effect on cake layer resistance. Therefore, the role of polymer <b>flocculants</b> in coagulation-microfiltration system needs to be carefully assessed for system optimization. In the reported research, three types of polymer <b>flocculants</b> with different charge and molecular weights were tested for comprehensively evaluating the impact of polymer <b>flocculants</b> on the performance of coagulation-microfiltration of surface water. Operation conditions such as inline filtration, direct filtration, and filtration with sedimentation were included. Two membrane reactors were designed to study the mechanism through which polymer <b>flocculants</b> affect the performance of coagulation-microfiltration systems. The result demonstrated that the use of polymer <b>flocculants</b> provides little to no benefit to turbidity and NOM removal in most cases, but pDADMACs can enhance NOM removal if applied properly; All polymer <b>flocculants</b> significantly increased membrane fouling except for pDADMACs when sedimentation proceeds MF; Polymer <b>flocculants</b> increase deposition/attachment of floc particles on the membrane surface through both adsorption of residual polymer on the membrane surface and polymer molecules on the floc particle surface; Even though polymers form larger and more fractal floc particles, they did not have notable impact on cake layer structure...|$|R

[...] Until the end of the 19th century, the breweries that produced Grodziskie used a single strain of yeast that was characterized by low attenuation and early flocculation.

The dried MFT can then be reclaimed in place or moved to another location for final reclamation. Suncor hoped this would reduce the time for water reclamation from tailings to weeks rather than years, with the recovered water being recycled into the oil sands plant. Suncor claimed the mature fines tailings process would {{reduce the number of}} tailing ponds and shorten the time to reclaim a tailing pond from 40 years at present to 7–10 years, with land rehabilitation continuously following 7 to 10 years behind the mining operations.

The polyacrylamide Synthofloc 5080 H and the polysaccharide Chitosan were employed for the flocculation of Neochloris oleoabundans. In seawater conditions, a maximum biomass recovery of 66 % was obtained with a dosage of 90 mg/L Chitosan. This recovery was approximately 25 % lower compared to Synthofloc 5080 H reaching recoveries greater than 90 % with dosages of 30 mg/L. Although different recoveries were obtained with both <b>flocculants,</b> the polymers exhibit a similar apparent polymer length, as was evaluated from viscosity measurements. While both <b>flocculants</b> exhibit similar polymer lengths in increasing salinity, the zeta potential differs. This indicates that polymeric charge dominates flocculation.

40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of this work was to synthesize water soluble cellulose-based <b>flocculants</b> using extracted cellulose from Eucalyptus Kraft bleached pulp. Both cationic and anionic <b>flocculants</b> have been synthesized based on information from the in literature. To increase cellulose reactivity, it was applied cellulose alkalization with NaOH aqueous solution and oxidation by sodium periodate. The cationization of cellulose was performed by using CHPTAC (3 -chloor- 2 -hydroxypropyl trimethylammonium chloride) as reagent. The anionization was performed by using sodium metabisulfite as reagent. Some reaction variables have been changed in order to synthesize <b>flocculants</b> with different characteristics. Once the water soluble <b>flocculants</b> were obtained, they have been characterized according to several techniques {{in order to determine}} the effective cellulose modification and other characteristic of the <b>flocculants</b> synthesized. To detect the modification spectroscopy techniques such as FTIR and 1 H NMR were used. To characterize the <b>flocculants</b> techniques like like DLS (Dynamic Light Scattering), SLS (Static Light Scattering) and ELS (Electrophoretic Light Scattering) were used, to determine, respectively, the average hydrodynamic diameter of the coils, the molecular weight and the zeta potential. Moreover, from the elemental analysis measurements the degree of substitution (DS) was calculate. The characterization has shown a certain variability of the <b>flocculants</b> obtained in terms of charge and DS as a confirmation that their characteristic can be modulated by tuning the reaction variables. The industrial application of the obtained cellulose-based <b>flocculants</b> was verified in wastewater treatment, in particular in the color removal from model effluents.

The performance has been evaluated calculating the percentage of color removed as a function of time, based on the decrease of absorbance of the supernatant water. The results show that both for CC (cationized cellulose) and ADAC (anionic dialdehyde cellulose) color removal percentages over 90 % can be obtained for most dyes.
