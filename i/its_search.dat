5|$|As {{a result}} of Cold War tensions, the search and rescue {{operations}} of the Soviet Union were not coordinated {{with those of the}} United States, South Korea, and Japan. Consequently no information was shared, and each side endeavored to harass or obtain evidence to implicate the other. The flight data recorders were the key pieces of evidence sought by both governments, with the United States insisting that an independent observer from the ICAO be present on one of <b>its</b> <b>search</b> vessels in the event that they were found. International boundaries are not well defined on the open sea, leading to numerous confrontations between the large number of opposing naval ships that were assembled in the area.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, screenwriter Chris Gerolmo {{discovered}} {{an article that}} excerpted a chapter from the book Inside Hoover's F.B.I., which chronicled the FBI's investigation into the murders of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner. While writing a draft script, Gerolmo brought it to Frederick Zollo, who had produced Gerolmo's first screenplay Miles from Home (1988). Zollo helped Gerolmo develop the original draft before they sold it to Orion Pictures. The studio then began <b>its</b> <b>search</b> for a director to helm the project. Filmmakers Miloš Forman and John Schlesinger were among those considered to helm the project.|$|E

5|$|Several of the animal's {{physical}} features are adaptions to climbing through trees. It uses its tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in <b>its</b> <b>search</b> for prey. It has semiplantigrade feet, switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when arboreal) and a digitigrade-like one (when terrestrial). The soles of its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads. The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree. Captive juveniles {{have been known to}} swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.|$|E

This allows the algorithm that has the properties of curve-linear searching method and the global convergence of trust region method.

5|$|A {{month after}} disappearing the Viet Cong 274th Regiment had emerged without warning and had caught 7 RAR by surprise, with the {{unexpected}} {{presence of a}} Viet Cong Main Force regiment in the Hat Dich forcing the Australians to change their tactics {{for the remainder of}} Operation Ballarat. The Australians became more cautious as a result and while 7 RAR continued <b>its</b> <b>search</b> and destroy mission, only two companies patrolled while the other two remained on standby in fire support bases nearby to provide support if required. Additional artillery support was also made available, with 161st Field Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery airlifted into Fire Support Base Giraffe. Meanwhile, Graham placed 2 RAR on standby to fly into the area if needed and US forces were also positioned to the north. In this manner Ballarat continued until 16 August, however there was only minor contact which resulted in two more Viet Cong killed, two wounded and one captured for no further loss to the Australians.|$|E

5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the observation that the parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a positive sign of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back <b>its</b> <b>search</b> operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Joseph M.

Wilson introduced the IB Diploma Program in 1998. The turnaround Wilson orchestrated led to a quick resurgence and restoration of the school's academic reputation. Enrollment, student performance, {{and the quality of the}} colleges and universities to which graduates matriculated improved, which attracted critical acclaim from education professionals and international media attention. In 2000, City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, the highest academic honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education.

5|$|The {{bog turtle}} is {{primarily}} diurnal, active {{during the day}} and sleeping at night. It wakes in the early morning, basks until fully warm, then begins <b>its</b> <b>search</b> for food. It is a seclusive species, making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat. During colder days, the bog turtle will spend much of its time in dense underbrush, underwater, or buried in mud. Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle's ability to survive without oxygen. On warmer days, the bog turtle's activities include scavenging, mating (during early spring), and basking in sunlight, the last of which it spends {{a great deal of the}} day doing. However, the bog turtle usually takes shelter from the sun during the hottest part of the day. Occasionally, during times of extreme heat, the turtle will either estivate, or become subterranean, sometimes occupying networks of tunnels filled with water. At night, the bog turtle buries itself in soft tunnels.|$|E

40|$|Four solanaceous plant species, namely {{hot pepper}} (Capsicum frutescens L.), potato (Solanum tu-berosum L.), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Miller) were anatomically {{screened}} for compatibility/incompatibility to field dodder (Cuscuta campestris Yunc-ker, Cuscutaceae).
