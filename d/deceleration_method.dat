40|$|In {{previous}} work {{it has been}} observed that the direct application of the law-of-the-wall in flows of high concentrations of cohesive sediments, results in overestimation of the bed shear stress. In this experimental work the effect of various turbidity levels on the drag coefficient and shear stress over a smooth bed is investigated. For this purpose, turbid flows were simulated in a laboratory annular flume (the Lab Carousel), using kaolinite suspensions of different concentrations, varying from 0 to 60 g/l. Flow velocity measurements were taken in the turbulent boundary layer of hydraulically smooth flows and the values of bed drag coefficient and shear stress were calculated using the method of Flow Deceleration. The results obtained after the processing of the velocity time-series and the application of the Flow <b>Deceleration</b> <b>method</b> indicate that {{there is no evidence of}} shear stress modification for suspended sediment concentrations below 3 g/l. However, at higher concentrations the flow in the Lab Carousel exhibited different boundary layer characteristics. Therefore, the bed drag coefficient showed a significant response to the increase of the suspended clay concentration by decreasing up to ~ 50 % from the clear water value over the range 3 - 60 g/l under a flow speed range of 0. 8 m/s. The equivalent decrease in bed shear stress was calculated as ~ 40 %. These results are in accordance with earlier findings of various researchers, thus confirming the validity of the Flow <b>Deceleration</b> <b>method,</b> used in accurate estimations of the bed drag coefficient and shear stress within the Lab Carousel...|$|E

40|$|We {{explore a}} {{technique}} for decelerating molecules using a static magnetic eld and optical pumping. Molecules travel through a spatially varying magnetic fi eld and are repeatedly pumped into a weak-field seeking state {{as they move}} towards each strong field region, and into a strong-fi eld seeking state as they move towards weak fi eld. The method is time-independent and so is suitable for decelerating both pulsed and continuous molecular beams. By using guiding magnets at each weak field region, the beam can be simultaneously guided and decelerated. By tapering the magnetic field strength in the strong field regions, and exploiting the Doppler shift, the velocity distribution can be compressed during deceleration.

This study attempts to examine how plantar force and spatio-temporal variables are affected by two rocker designs, one with softer and one with denser sole materials, by comparing them with the barefoot condition and with flat-soled shoes. Eleven subjects' gait parameters during walking and jogging were recorded. Our results showed that compared with barefoot walking, plantar forces were higher for flat shoes while lower for both types of rocker shoes, the softer-material rocker being the lowest. The plantar force of flat shoes is greater than the vertical ground reaction force, while that of both rocker shoes is much less, 13. 87 - 30. 55 % body weight. However, as locomotion speed increased to jogging, for all shoe types, except at the second peak plantar force of the denser sole material rocker shoes, plantar forces were greater than for bare feet. More interestingly, because the transmission of force was faster while jogging, greater plantar force was seen in the rocker-soled shoes with softer material than with denser material; results for higher-speed shock absorption in rocker-soled shoes with softer material were thus not as good. In general, the rolling phenomena along the bottom surface of the rocker shoes, as well as an increase in the duration of simultaneous curve rolling and ankle rotation, could contribute to the reduction of plantar force for both rocker designs. The possible mechanism is the conversion of vertical kinetic energy into rotational kinetic energy. To conclude, since plantar force is related to foot-ground interface and <b>deceleration</b> <b>methods,</b> rocker-design shoes could achieve desired plantar force reduction through certain rolling phenomena, shoe-sole stiffness levels, and locomotion speeds...|$|R

In {{the first part}} of the thesis we develop a general method applicable to atoms or molecules or even nanoparticles, to decelerate a hot fast gas beam to zero velocity by using an optical cavity. This <b>deceleration</b> <b>method</b> is based on a novel phase stability mechanism in the bad cavity regime, which is very different from the traditional cavity cooling studies where a good cavity is needed. We propose several schemes to decelerate the gas beam based on this new phase stability mechanism. Practical issues for realizing the proposals are also discussed in detail which show that the deceleration schemes are feasible using present experimental techniques. In the second part of this thesis, we show how the concept of quantum simulations is applied to multiple-layered Dirac cones and related phenomena by using multi-component ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices where the spin-dependent hopping and on-site spin flipping are both controlled by Raman lasers. By tuning the spin-dependent hopping according to the representations of su(2) algebra, we show that we can simulate the Dirac-Weyl fermions with any arbitrary spin beyond the spin ½ cases found in graphene and topological insulators. These high spin Dirac-Weyl fermions show rich anomalous quantum Hall effects and a remarkable Klein multi-refringent tunnelling. Moreover, when getting rid of the limitations of su(2) algebra and allowing for on-site spin flipping, we further investigate Modified Dispersion Relations (MDRs) and Neutrino Oscillations (NOs) as in Standard Model Extensions (SMEs) by virtue of an analogue between the three-family fermions in particle physics and a three-layered Dirac cones scheme.

Recently, the application of the same techniques to molecules has begun. The complexity of even a simple diatomic molecule makes laser cooling difficult, but promises new applications in many areas of research. In this thesis I describe the development of the first three-dimensional MOT of calcium fluoride (CaF) molecules. First, a cryogenic buffer gas source was set up, producing a pulsed beam of 9. 3 * 10 ^ 10 molecules per steradian per pulse with forward velocities around 170 m/s. A similar source for very large molecules was set up during a 5 month internship at the University of Vienna. Next, the molecular pulse was slowed down to the capture velocity of a MOT using chirped laser slowing, resulting in about 7 * 10 ^ 5 CaF molecules passing through the typical MOT volume of 1 cm^ 3 at velocities of 15 +- 5 m/s. A new <b>deceleration</b> <b>method,</b> called Zeeman-Sisyphus deceleration, was also investigated. In this method molecules move through a spatially varying magnetic field and are optically pumped between low- and high-field seeking states in such as a way that they are always losing kinetic energy. The method promises to deliver more slow molecules because the molecules are guided transversely as they are decelerated. A small prototype was built and the optical pumping step was tested successfully. Finally, 7. 6 * 10 ^ 3 CaF molecules were trapped in a MOT and cooled to a temperature of 8. 5 mK. The radial trap frequency is 2 pi* 130 Hz and the damping constant is beta= 9. 5 * 10 ^ 2 s^- 1. The lifetime is about 100 ms and depends strongly on the scattering rate.

40|$|The most {{commonly}} used methods of calculating mean, fluid-transmitted bed shear stresses within a benthic boundary layer have been investigated. The work {{was carried out in}} an annular flume 2 m in diameter and 0. 40 m deep—the Lab Carousel. This flume is a laboratory equivalent to the Sea Carousel (an in situ flume). A well developed boundary layer 0. 02 m thick was confirmed for a range of flows measured using a Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) within the Lab Carousel. There was a good relationship found between flow speed in the Lab Carousel and Sea Carousel, which corresponded well with a direct measurement method (particle tracking) using neutrally buoyant particles. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the accuracies and relative differences of eight ways of determining bed shear stress under smooth bed conditions: five using velocity as a proxy; and three considered direct. The proxy methods investigated were; (1) the Law of the Wall; (2) the Quadratic Stress Law; (3) the Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) method; (4) Prandtl’s seventh power law; (5) and the Reynolds stress calculation. Three ‘direct’ measurements of bed shear stress were: (6) hot film probes; (7) inverting Newton’s second law to define frictional drag through flow deceleration; and (8) numerical simulation. All the methods gave sensible results with the expected trends of increasing stress under increasing flow velocity. The best correlation of the proxy methods was found between Prandtl’s seventh power law and flow deceleration; the other methods over predicting the stress by up to a factor of 10. There was a good coherence between the estimates of stress using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) and the LDV at 0. 15 m above the bed. The use of Sternberg’s constant drag coefficient (CD 100 = 3 × 10 ? 3) in stress calculations yielded the greatest over prediction. The hot film probes showed radial differences in stress, which were in general greatest in the middle and lowest near the outer wall. All the methods appear to converge at low current velocities.

40|$|This article {{presents}} an examination and validation of {{a method to}} measure the field deceleration of a manual wheelchair (MWC) and to calculate the rolling resistances properties of {{the front and rear}} wheels. This method was based on the measurements of the MWC deceleration for various load settings from a 3 D accelerometer. A mechanical model of MWC deceleration was developed which allowed computing the rolling resistance factors of front and rear wheels on a tested surface. Four deceleration sets were conducted on two paths on the same ground to test the repeatability. Two other deceleration sets were conducted using different load settings to compute the rolling resistance parameters (RPs). The theoretical decelerations of three load settings were computed and compared with the measured decelerations. The results showed good repeatability (variations of measures represented 6 – 11 % of the nominal values) and no statistical difference between the path results. The rolling RPs were computed and their confidence intervals were assessed. For the last three sets, no significant difference was found between the theoretical and measured <b>decelerations.</b> This <b>method</b> can determine the specific rolling resistance properties of the wheels of a MWC, and be employed to establish a catalogue of the rolling resistance properties of wheels on various surfaces.

This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} frequency of restrictive left ventricular filling pattern in dilated cardiomyopathy, {{as well as its}} clinical and hemodynamic correlations and prognostic implications. Background. In dilated cardiomyopathy, as in other heart disease different left ventricular filling patterns were observed on Doppler echocardiography. Some patients showed a “restrictive filling pattern,” similar to that associated with restrictive cardiomyopathy, characterized by predominant E waves and a shortened E <b>deceleration</b> time. <b>Methods.</b> Pulsed Doppler transmitral curves were analyzed in 79 consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy assigned to two study groups according to E deceleration time group 1 (n = 36) had a restrictive left ventricular filling pattern (E deceleration time < 115 ms); group 2 (n = 43) had an E deceleration time ≥ 115 ms. Result. Patients in group 1 were significantly younger, in a higher New York Heart Association functional class, more frequently had a third heart sound and had a higher left ventricular pressure at catheterization. In addition, they showed more severe left and right ventricular dysfunction and dilation, a larger left atrium and more severe mitral regurgitation. A restrictive filling pattern was associated at Doppter study with a higher E wave velocity, lower A wave velocity and higher E/A ratio. During a follow-up interval of 22 ± 14 months, all 14 patients who subsequently died or required heart transplntation showed a restrictive left ventricular filling pattern. At multivariate analysis, E deceleration time was the most powerful independent prognostic indicator of poor outcome or transplantation. Conclusions.

The first quantity involves both the well-known effect of geophysical tides and the Kottler effect of Л-term (i. e. a kind of the “local ” Hubble expansion), while the second quantity is associ-ated only with the tidal influence. The difference between them, 2. 2 ± 0. 3 cm yr– 1, can be attributed just to the local Hubble expansion with rate H 0 (loc) = 56 ± 8 km s– 1 Mpc– 1. Assuming that Hubble expansion is formed locally only by the uniformly distributed dark en-ergy (Л-term), while globally also by a clumped substance (for the most part, the cold dark matter), the total (large-scale) Hubble constant should be H 0 = 65 ± 9 km s– 1 Mpc– 1. This is in reasonable agreement both with the commonly-accepted WMAP result, H 0 = 71 ± 3. 5 km s– 1 Mpc– 1, and with the data on supernovae Ia distribution.

40|$|Cranes {{are widely}} used in material-handling and {{transportation}} applications, e. g. in shipyards, construction sites, and warehouses. As they are critical to the economic vitality of modern-day industries, improving crane performance {{and ease of use}} are important contributors to industrial productivity, low production costs, and workplace safety. In a typical crane operation, a payload is lifted, moved to its destination, and then lowered into place. This dissertation aims to improve crane performance and reduce task difficulty for the human operator in the movements mentioned above, namely: 1) Moving payloads laterally in the horizontal plane, 2) Lifting payloads off the ground, and 3) Lowering or laying down payloads on the ground. The design of a novel and intuitive human-machine control interface is the focus for improving operations that involve moving payloads laterally. The interface allows operators to drive a crane by simply moving a hand-held device through the desired path. The position of the device, which is tracked by sensors, is used to generate command signals to drive the crane. This command is then input-shaped such that payload oscillations are greatly reduced, making it much easier for the operator to drive the crane. Several facets of this crane control method are examined, such as control structure and stability, usability contexts, modes of operation, and quantitative measures (by means of human operator studies) of performance improvements over standard crane control interfaces. Lifting up a payload can be difficult for the operator, if the hoist is not properly centered above the payload. In these potentially dangerous and costly ``off-centered" lifts, the payload may slide on the ground and/or oscillate in the air after it is hoisted. Newtonian and Coulomb friction models that focus on the stiction-sliding-separation contact dynamics are derived and experimentally verified to study off-centered lifts. Then, with the goal of aiding operators during lift operations, simple but practical, self-centering solutions are proposed and implemented. Laying down or lowering a payload to the ground can also be challenging for operators in certain situations. For example, laying down a long, slender payload from a vertical orientation in the air, to a horizontal position on a flat surface. If the operator does not properly coordinate the motions of the crane in the vertical and horizontal directions simultaneously, then the potential hazards that may occur during these operations include: 1) slipping of the pivot about which the payload rotates, leading to sudden and dangerous payload movements; and 2) excessive hoist cable angles that lead to ``side-pull" problems. Newtonian and Coulomb friction models are derived to describe this lay-down scenario. The forces and motions experienced by the payload are then used to determine the motion trajectories that the crane and payload should follow to execute a successful lay-down maneuver. Finally, a special chapter is included to address the oscillation control of systems that have on-off nonlinear actuators, such as cranes powered by relay-controlled circuits. Due to their simplicity, ruggedness, and long service life, this type of crane can be commonly found in older factories or in applications where precise motion control is not a strict requirement. However, controlling payload oscillations on this type of crane is challenging for two reasons: 1) Relays that can only be turned on or off allow for only limited control over the crane velocity; and 2) These cranes typically have nonlinear asymmetrical acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> properties. <b>Methods</b> are derived for determining the relay switch-times that move single-pendulum and double-pendulum payloads with low residual oscillations.
