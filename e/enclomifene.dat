50|$|<b>Enclomifene</b> acts by antagonizing the {{estrogen}} receptor in the pituitary gland, {{which reduces}} negative feedback by estrogen on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, thereby increasing gonadotropin secretion and hence gonadal production of testosterone. It {{is one of}} the two stereoisomers of clomifene, which itself is a non-racemic mixture of 38% zuclomifene and 62% <b>enclomifene.</b> <b>Enclomifene</b> is the (E)-enantiomer of clomifene, while zuclomifene is the (Z)-enantiomer. Whereas zuclomifene is more estrogenic, <b>enclomifene</b> is more antiestrogenic. In accordance, unlike <b>enclomifene,</b> zuclomifene is antigonadotropic due to activation of the estrogen receptor and is able to reduce testosterone levels in men to near-castrate levels. As such, enantiopure <b>enclomifene</b> is more favorable than clomifene as a progonadotropin for the treatment of male hypogonadism.|$|E
50|$|Zuclomifene (INN), or zuclomiphene (USAN), is a nonsteroidal {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) of the triphenylethylene {{group that}} was never marketed. It {{is one of the}} two stereoisomers of clomifene, which itself is a non-racemic mixture of 38% zuclomifene and 62% <b>enclomifene.</b> Zuclomifene is the (Z)-enantiomer of clomifene, while <b>enclomifene</b> is the (E)-enantiomer. Whereas zuclomifene is described as mildly estrogenic, <b>enclomifene</b> is described as antiestrogenic. In accordance, unlike <b>enclomifene,</b> zuclomifene is antigonadotropic due to activation of the estrogen receptor and is able to reduce testosterone levels in men to near-castrate levels. It is also about 5 times more potent than <b>enclomifene</b> in inducing ovulation.|$|E
