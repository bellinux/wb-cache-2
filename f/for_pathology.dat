25|$|John McCrae – Best {{known as}} the author of the World War I poem In Flanders Fields, McCrae started his active {{military}} service in the Boer War as an artillery officer. After completing several major campaigns, McCrae's artillery unit was sent home to Canada in 1901 with what would be referred to today as an 'honourable discharge'. McCrae ended up becoming a special professor in the University of Vermont <b>for</b> <b>pathology</b> and he would later serve in World War I as a Medical officer until his death from pneumonia while on active duty in 1918.|$|E
25|$|He {{had come}} to Canton with hope and a vision to greatly improve the hospital. The {{conditions}} of the hospital, medical supplies, and health environment weren't nearly as developed {{as those in the}} USA. In 1913, he and three other doctors donated money to the Canton Medical Missionary Society to further improve the hospital. Thus, in addition to being involved in the hospital's internal medicine department, he helped establish a lab <b>for</b> <b>pathology</b> research and run a rehabilitation center in the college. As he expanded his endeavors and philanthropic work, he continued serving as a physician and researcher at Canton Hospital.|$|E
25|$|In 1844, {{he married}} Lydia, {{youngest}} {{daughter of the}} Rev. Henry North. In 1847, he was appointed an assistant-surgeon to the hospital, and Arris and Gale professor at the Royal College of Surgeons. He held this professorship for six years and each year gave six lectures in surgical pathology. The first edition of these lectures, which were the chief scientific work of his life, was published in 1853 as Lectures on Surgical Pathology. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1851. In October 1851, he resigned the wardenship of the hospital. He had now become known as a great physiologist and pathologist; he had done <b>for</b> <b>pathology</b> in England what Rudolf Virchow had done in Germany, but he had hardly begun to get into practice, and he had kept himself poor so he might pay his share of his father's debts, a task that took him 14 years to fulfill.|$|E
50|$|The American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists (AAPB) was an American {{national}} {{professional association}} established in 1901, {{devoted to the}} medical sciences as distinct from clinical medicine.

25|$|In 1857 Leydig became full {{professor}} of Zoology and Comparative anatomy at the University of Tübingen, and he published his Lehrbuch der Histologie des Menschen und der Tiere: his main contribution to morphology. In the Lehrbuch, Leydig reviewed the crucial {{developments in the}} history of histology, including the discovery and definition of the cell by Jan Evangelista Purkyne (1797–1869), Gabriel Gustav Valentin (1810–1883), and by Theodor Ambrose Hubert Schwann (1810–1882), who described the cell as a vesicle containing a nucleus in 1839. Leydig paid further tribute to other contemporary anatomists, particularly Johannes Peter Müller (1801–1858) for his work on glands and emphasizing cellular doctrine <b>for</b> <b>pathology.</b> Leydig’s book was published at the time of similar subjects – most notably Kölliker’s Handbuch der Gewebelehre des Menschen (1852) and Joseph von Gerlach’s (1820–1896) Handbuch der allgemeinen und speciellen Gewebelehre des menschlichen Körpers... (1848). The Lehrbuch, however, gives the best account of the growth of comparative microscopical anatomy in the two decades following Schwann’s discoveries.|$|E
2500|$|Multispecialty groups, {{composed}} of physicians from clinical specialties {{as well as}} radiology and pathology, are another practice model. In some case, these may be large groups controlled by an HMO or other large health care organization. In others, they are in essence clinician group practices that employ pathologists to provide diagnostic services for the group. These groups may own their own laboratories, or, in some cases may make controversial arrangements with [...] "pod labs" [...] that allow clinician groups to lease space, with the clinician groups receiving direct insurance payments <b>for</b> <b>pathology</b> services. Proposed changes to Medicare regulations may essentially eliminate these arrangements in the United States.|$|E
60|$|The Great Hesper, by Mr. Frank Barrett, has {{at least}} the merit of {{introducing}} into fiction an entirely new character. The villain is Nyctalops, and, though we {{are not prepared to}} say that there is any necessary connection between Nyctalopy and crime, we are quite ready to accept Mr. Barrett's picture of Jan Van Hoeck as an interesting example of the modern method of dealing with life. <b>For,</b> <b>Pathology</b> is rapidly becoming the basis of sensational literature, and in art, as in politics, there is a great future for monsters. What a Nyctalops is we leave Mr. Barrett to explain. His novel belongs to a class of book that many people might read once for curiosity but nobody could read a second time for pleasure.|$|E

60|$|I {{have been}} seduced into a dry {{discussion}} where I had intended {{only a few}} amusing facts, in proof, that the mind makes the sense {{far more than the}} senses make the mind. If I have life, and health, and leisure, I purpose to compile from the works, memoirs, and transactions of the different philosophical societies in Europe, from magazines, and the rich store of medical and psychological publications, furnished by the English, French, and German press, all the essays and cases that relate to the human faculties under unusual circumstances, (<b>for</b> <b>pathology</b> is the crucible of physiology), excluding such only as are not intelligible without the symbols or terminology of science. These I would arrange under the different senses and powers: as the eye, the ear, the touch, &c.; the imitative power, voluntary and automatic; the imagination, or shaping and modifying power; the fancy or the aggregative and associative power; the understanding, or the regulative, substantiating, and realizing power; the speculative reason, 'vis theoretica et scientifica', or the power, by which we produce, or aim to produce, unity, necessity, and a universality in all our knowledge by means of principles, [2]'a priori'; the will or practical reason; the faculty of choice, ('Willkühr'), and (distinct both from the moral will, and the choice), the sensation of volition which I have found reason to include under the head of single and double touch.|$|E
