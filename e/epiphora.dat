500|$|Bedlington Terrier {{owners in}} the UK {{reported}} that the most common health issues among living dogs were reproductive, heart murmur, and eye problems such as <b>epiphora,</b> retinal dysplasia, and cataracts. Bedlingtons {{seem to be more}} prone to these eye diseases than other breeds. They also have a high incidence of kidney problems. Copper toxicosis occurred among about 5% of living dogs. Inbreeding is a concern, as some dogs [...] " [...] been bred in and in to a damaging extent." [...] Reputable breeders will conduct DNA testing of all litters and will not allow pups who carry the copper toxicosis gene to be bred, a practice which has significantly reduced the incidence of this disease in the breed. Excepting these problems, Bedlingtons are generally a very healthy breed.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{a sample}} of 48 still-living dogs, the most common health {{concerns}} noted by owners were eye problems (red eye, <b>epiphora,</b> conjunctivitis, and cataracts). [...] Dermatological and respiratory problems also ranked high.|$|E
2500|$|FHV-1 {{also has}} a predilection for corneal epithelium, {{resulting}} in corneal ulcers, often pinpoint or dendritic in shape. [...] Other ocular signs of FHV-1 infection include conjunctivitis, keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (decreased tear production), and corneal sequestra. [...] Infection of the nasolacrimal duct can result in chronic <b>epiphora</b> (excess tearing). [...] Ulcerative skin disease can also result from FHV-1 infection. [...] FHV-1 can also cause abortion in pregnant queens, usually at the sixth week of gestation, although {{this may be due}} to systemic effects of the infection rather than the virus directly.|$|E

50|$|In infants, {{the tear}} ducts (that drain the tears) {{occasionally}} fail to open, {{resulting in the}} overflow of tears onto the cheeks (<b>epiphora)</b> and rheum deposition on the surrounding skin.|$|E
50|$|Nasolacrimal duct {{obstruction}} (NLDO) is the {{obstruction of}} nasolacrimal duct {{and may be}} either congenital or acquired. Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct leads to the excess overflow of tears called <b>epiphora.</b>|$|E

50|$|Other mucosal sites may be {{involved}} (e.g., esophagus, urethral meatus, glans penis, lacrimal duct, conjunctiva, vagina, anus). Constriction and stenosis can occur at these sites, with subsequent development of dysphagia, dysuria, phimosis, and <b>epiphora.</b>|$|E
50|$|Obstruction of the punctum, {{nasolacrimal}} canal, or nasolacrimal duct {{can cause}} even normal levels of basal tear to overflow onto the face (<b>epiphora),</b> giving {{the appearance of}} constant psychic tearing. This can have significant social consequences.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epiphora</b> is an {{overflow}} {{of tears}} onto the face. A clinical sign or condition that constitutes insufficient tear film drainage {{from the eyes}} in that tears will drain down the face rather than through the nasolacrimal system.|$|E
50|$|The typical infant who has {{congenital}} glaucoma usually is initially referred to an ophthalmologist because of apparent corneal edema. The commonly described triad of <b>epiphora</b> (excessive tearing), blepharospasm and photophobia may be missed until the corneal edema becomes apparent.|$|E
5000|$|In {{animal and}} human hosts, {{infestation}} by Thelazia may be asymptomatic, though it frequently causes watery eyes (<b>epiphora),</b> conjunctivitis, corneal opacity, or corneal ulcers (ulcerative keratitis). [...] Infested humans have also reported [...] "foreign body sensation"the {{feeling that something}} is in the eye.|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of <b>epiphora</b> is {{clinical}} {{by history}} presentation and {{observation of the}} lids. Fluorescein dye {{can be used to}} examine for punctal reflux by pressing on the canaliculi in which the clinician should note resistance of reflux as it irrigates through the punctum into the nose.|$|E
50|$|A DCR is the {{treatment}} of choice for most patients with acquired NLD obstruction. Surgical indications include recurrent dacryocystitis, chronic mucoid reflux, painful distension of the lacrimal sac, and bothersome <b>epiphora.</b> For patients with dacryocystitis, active infection should be cleared, if possible, before DCR is performed.|$|E
50|$|Naso-orbital {{fractures}} {{may involve}} the NLD. Early treatment by fracture reduction with stenting {{of the entire}} lacrimal drainage system should be considered. However, such injuries are often not recognized or are initially neglected as more serious injuries are managed. In such cases, late treatment of persistent <b>epiphora</b> usually requires DCR.|$|E
50|$|Some clinicians {{believe that}} partial {{stenosis}} of the NLD with symptomatic <b>epiphora</b> sometimes responds to surgical intubation {{of the entire}} lacrimal drainage system. This procedure should be performed only if the tubes can be passed easily. In complete NLD obstruction, intubation alone is not effective, and a DCR should be considered.|$|E
50|$|In the {{recessive}} form corneal clouding {{is observed}} at birth or within the neonatal period, nystagmus is often present, but no photophobia or <b>epiphora</b> is seen. In the autosomal dominant type corneal opacification is usually {{seen in the}} first or second year of life and progresses slowly, and nystagmus is infrequently seen.|$|E
5000|$|In rhetoric, an {{anaphora}} (ἀναφορά, [...] "carrying back") is {{a rhetorical}} device {{that consists of}} repeating a sequence of words at the beginnings of neighboring clauses, thereby lending them emphasis. In contrast, an epistrophe (or <b>epiphora)</b> is repeating words at the clauses' ends. The combination of anaphora and epistrophe results in symploce.|$|E
50|$|Koelreuteria bipinnata are {{commonly}} used as focal points in landscape design in regions where they thrive; they are often used as street, highways, parking lots, shade, woodland garden or specimen trees. The seeds are used in beads in necklaces and the flowers can yield a yellow dye. They are also used in treatments of conjunctivitis and <b>epiphora.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Napoleon cat {{has very}} few health issues. Because of the {{incorporation}} of the Persian cat blood, PKD negative tested Minuet breeding cats should be used. Minuet cats are to be bred specifically away from common Persian cat issues such as <b>Epiphora</b> (excessive eye tearing), Stenosis (blockage) of Nasolacrimal Ducts, flat facial features, and matting prone coats.|$|E

50|$|Ibn 'Isa is {{considered}} one of the most famous physicians of the tenth century. His famous Notebook of the Oculists combined information obtained from both Greco-Roman and Arab sources. The book encompassed information on treatment and classification of over one hundred different eye diseases. In the book, eye diseases were sorted by their anatomical location. The Notebook of the Oculists was widely used by European physicians for hundreds of years. Ibn Isa’s book was one of the first, along with Hunayn ibn Ishaq’s Ten Treatises on the Eye, to illustrate anatomy of the eye. Specifically, Ibn Isa illustrated the optic chiasm and brain. Ibn Isa was the first to describe and suggest treatment for an array of diseases. For example, he was the first to discover the symptoms of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH) - ocular inflammation associated with a distinct whitening of the hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes. Ibn Isa was also the first to classify <b>epiphora</b> as being a result of overzealous cautery of pterygium. In addition to this pioneering description, Ibn Isa also suggested treatments for <b>epiphora</b> based on the stage of the disease - namely treatment in the early stages with astringent materials, for example ammonia salt, burned copper, or lid past and a hook dissection with a feathered quill for chronic stages of <b>epiphora.</b> Ibn Isa is also thought to be the first to describe temporal arteritis, although Sir Jonathan Hutchinson (1828-1913) is erroneously credited with this.|$|E
5000|$|Epistrophe (ἐπιστροφή, [...] "return") is the {{repetition}} of the same word or words {{at the end of}} successive phrases, clauses or sentences. It is also known as <b>epiphora</b> and occasionally as antistrophe. It is a figure of speech and the counterpart of anaphora. It is an extremely emphatic device because of the emphasis placed on the last word in a phrase or sentence.|$|E
50|$|Obstruction of the {{nasolacrimal}} duct may occur. This {{leads to}} the excess overflow of tears called <b>epiphora.</b> A congenital obstruction can cause cystic expansion of the duct and is called a dacryocystocele or Timo cyst. Persons with dry eye conditions can be fitted with punctal plugs that seal the ducts to {{limit the amount of}} fluid drainage and retain moisture.|$|E
50|$|Causes of <b>epiphora</b> are {{any that}} cause either {{overproduction}} of tears or decreased drainage of tears, resulting in tearing onto the cheek. This can {{be due to}} ocular irritation and inflammation (including trichiasis and entropion) or an obstructed tear outflow tract which is divided according to its anatomical location (i.e. ectropion, punctal, canalicular or nasolacrimal duct obstruction). The latter is often due to aging (a spontaneous process), conjunctivochalasis, infection (i.e. dacryocystitis), rhinitis, and in neonates or infants, failure of the nasolacrimal duct to open. Another cause could be poor reconstruction of the nasolacrimal duct system after trauma to the area. Cause of trauma could be facial fractures (including nasoethmoid fractures or maxillary Le Fort fractures), and soft tissue trauma involving the nose and/or the eyelid.This condition is often frustrating or irritating. A systematic review studying the usage of punctal plugs for treatment of dry eye reported a few cases of <b>epiphora</b> among participants.|$|E
