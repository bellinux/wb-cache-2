5|$|For example, Sudan’s {{famine in}} the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the famine of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. <b>Ergo,</b> the Sudanese Famine was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{learning}} of Crix Madine's (a former Imperial Commander Human, who had defected to the Alliance) capture and imminent execution, Kyle proceeds {{to a high}} security detention center on Orinackra to rescue him. Madine provides the Rebel Alliance with information about the smuggling of Dark Trooper materials, leading Katarn to investigate the Ramsees Hed docking port on Cal-Seti. He then destroys a robotics facility on the icy planet Anteevy, {{the second stage of}} the Dark Trooper production line. After being captured by Jabba the Hutt and having to escape his ship, Katarn infiltrates a computer vault on Coruscant which reveals the location of the <b>Ergo</b> fuel station, the final stage in the smuggling route. He masquerades as a smuggler, gaining access to the Super Star Destroyer Executor, which brings him finally to the Arc Hammer starship, the headquarters of General Mohc's Dark Trooper project, where he successfully destroys the operation and kills Mohc.|$|E
25|$|Eucharistic {{celebrations}} of any nature are sometimes initiated {{with the first}} four {{or at least the}} first stanza of the Pange lingua hymn, and often concluded with the Tantum <b>ergo</b> (being the other two stanzas of the same hymn), or at the least the versicle and oration attached to the Tantum <b>ergo</b> (see the article).

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) is an {{important}} public health problem. <b>Ergone</b> has been proved to prevent the progression of CKD. UPLC-QTOF/HDMS was employed for metabolic profiling of adenine-induced CKD and to investigate the nephroprotective effects of <b>ergone.</b> Pharmacology parameters including blood biochemistry, histopathological evaluation and Western blot analysis were performed concurrently. The UPLC-MS data were analyzed by partial least squares-discriminate analysis, correlation analysis, heatmap analysis and mapped to KEGG pathways. Blood and serum biochemistry were observed to be significantly different in the CKD group than in the control group. In conjunction with biochemistry, histopathology and protein expression results, identified metabolites indicated perturbations in fatty acid metabolism, purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism as changes associated with adenine-induced CKD and the interventions of <b>ergone.</b> Upregulated expression of TGF-β 1, ED- 1, CTGF, bFGF and collagen I was observed in the CKD group. However, downregulated expression of these proteins was observed after oral administration of <b>ergone.</b> These results suggest that expression changes in these proteins had implications for fatty acid metabolism, purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism {{in the development of}} CKD and that <b>ergone</b> treatment could delay the development of CKD by normalizing or blocking abnormal changes in biomarker metabolites and protein expression in the CKD group...|$|R

40|$|Musculoskeletal {{disorders}} often {{result in}} employee disability leaves and sickness-related absenteeism in the workplace. Professional evaluations of an employee's capacity to work require additional support {{by means of}} Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) methods. However, most FCE methods assess general physical capacity and, because of fixed test procedures, testing times range between 4 and 6 h for up to several days. For return to work (vocational rehabilitation), the tests need to reflect the employees' specific work demands more precisely. This study aims to develop a job-specific FCE protocol on the Ergos(TM) Work Simulator for hospital nurses. In developing the contents of this specific protocol, hierarchical task analyses were performed with 20 nurses in four departments of a university medical center. A job-specific test protocol was developed that consisted of five steps. In this process, the original test protocol was analyzed first. Secondly, categorization of physical risk factors for work-related musculoskeletal disorders revealed 16 possible combinations of activity, posture, and load. Finally, duration and frequencies during one working day of these combinations were coupled to the <b>Ergos</b> test panels. The nurse-specific test protocol lasts 90 min. It was possible to develop a job-specific protocol, using on-site observations as the input. Compared to the original <b>Ergos</b> protocol, the external validity of the new job-specific protocol has improved: it simulates the functional capacity that nurses need to perform their job in a realistic way. The testing time of the original <b>Ergos</b> protocol is four times longer compared to the new job-specific protoco...|$|R

25|$|The Chinese {{have claimed}} {{that most of the}} {{population}} of Tibet at that time were serfs, bound to land owned by lamas. This claim has been challenged by other researchers (see serfdom in Tibet controversy). Any attempt at land reform or the redistribution of wealth would have proved unpopular with the established landowners. The Seventeen Point Agreement was put into effect only in Tibet proper; <b>ergo,</b> eastern Kham and Amdo, being outside the administration of the government of Tibet, were treated like territory belonging to any other Chinese province, with land reform implemented in full.

40|$|Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a {{key role}} in the {{development}} and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent studies have demonstrated activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway by RAS in CKD. However, the underlying mechanisms of RAS and Wnt/β-catenin signaling interaction and their contribution to the pathogenesis of CKD have not been fully elucidated. Present study is designed to investigate the role of RAS/Wnt/β-catenin axis activation in tubulo-interstitial fibrosis and glomerulosclerosis by the cultured HK- 2 and podocytes. HK- 2  cells and podocytes are treated by angiotensin II (Ang II). Ang II up-regulates expression of various Wnt mRNA and active β-catenin protein in HK- 2  cells and podocytes in the time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, Ang II induces injury, oxidative stress and inflammation and impaired Nrf 2 activation in HK- 2  cells and podocytes. This was accompanied by up-regulations of RAS components as well as Wnt 1, activated β-catenin and its target proteins. RAS/Wnt/β-catenin axis activation results in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in HK- 2  cells and injuries podocytes. The effect of Ang II is inhibited by losartan and ICG- 001, a Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor. We further found that treatment with natural products, <b>ergone,</b> alisol B 23 -acetate and pachymic acid B inhibit extracellular matrix accumulation in HK- 2  cells and attenuated podocyte injury, in part, by inhibiting Ang II induced RAS/Wnt/β-catenin axis activation. In summary, activation of RAS/Wnt/β-catenin axis results in podocytes and tubular epithelial cell, injury and up-regulations of oxidative, inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. These adverse effects are ameliorated by <b>ergone,</b> alisol B 23 -acetate and pachymic acid B. Therefore, these natural products could be considered as novel Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitors and anti-fibrotic agents...|$|R
