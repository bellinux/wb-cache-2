5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} breeds either {{alone or in}} small colonies {{averaging}} two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site. It is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate. It is believed to breed cooperatively in <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Guinea,</b> as four different birds were observed feeding one nest. The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown. The timing of the egg laying in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony. It {{has been suggested that}} this is to promote cooperative breeding. The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with {{a few weeks before the}} onset of the wet season; in areas where the wet season is bimodal, two different breeding seasons occur. However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent mists of the wet season. Birds in Nigeria lay their eggs between August and November, birds in Gabon lay between November and April, birds in western Cameroon lay between March and November with peaks of June, July, and October, and birds in southern Cameroon have two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May. In <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Guinea,</b> nesting occurs in mid-February.|$|E

By the early 1970s, OPEC's membership {{accounted for more than}} half of worldwide oil production. Indicating that OPEC is not averse to further expansion, Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC's Acting Secretary General in 2006, urged his African neighbors Angola and Sudan to join, and Angola did in 2007, followed by <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Guinea</b> in 2017. Since the 1980s, representatives from Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers, as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.|$|E

The delegation included one middle-distance runner, one short-distance sprinter and two swimmers: José Luis Ebatela Nvo, Mari Paz Mosanga Motanga, Eric Moussambani and Paula Barila Bolopa respectively. All four athletes qualified for the games through wildcard places. Moussambani {{was selected as the}} flag bearer for the opening ceremony. The four athletes were unable to advance beyond the first rounds of their respective events, with Moussambani and Bolopa attracting attention for their poor performances, but were applauded by the crowds.|$|E
5|$|Reïna-Flor Okori, at age 36, was {{the only}} Equatoguinean female competitor. She had {{previously}} competed at the previous three Summer Games but with the French Olympic team. She was notable for being the flag bearer for the opening and closing ceremonies. Okori qualified for the Games via a wildcard because she had not recorded a qualifying standard time for her event, the women's 100 metres hurdles. She spent time training in <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Guinea</b> and France preparing for the Games. In an interview before the Games Okori said she aimed to reach {{the final stage of}} her event and earn Equatorial Guinea's first Olympic gold medal. She was due to compete in the contest's sixth heat on 16 August alongside seven other participants but was unable to start the event because of a ruptured popliteal cyst.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin Enzema was {{the sole}} male athlete {{representing}} <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Guinea</b> at the Rio Games at age 27. He had previously competed at the 2012 Summer Games. Enzema qualified for the Games via a wildcard as his fastest time of one minute and 53.35 seconds, set at the 2015 African Games, was 7.55 seconds slower than the qualifying standard for his event, the men's 800 metres. He was drawn in the third heat on 12 August, finishing eighth out of nine athletes, {{with a time of}} one minute and 52.14 seconds. Enzema ranked ahead of final-placed finisher Alex Beddoes of the Cook Islands (one minute and 52.76 seconds) but behind Brazil's Lutimar Paes (one minute and 48.38 seconds) in a heat led by eventual gold medallist David Rudisha from Kenya (one minute and 45.09 seconds). Overall, he finished 50th out of 54 runners, and was unable to advance to the later rounds because he finished 7.15 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in his heat who progressed to the second round.|$|E
5|$|The African {{species is}} a partial migrant, but its {{movements}} are complex, seasonal and poorly studied. It is mainly a wet-season breeder, and many birds {{move away from}} the equator as soon as the rains provide sufficient grass cover to allow them to breed elsewhere. Southward movement is mainly from November to April, the return north beginning when burning or drought reduces the grass cover again. This species is present throughout the year in some West African countries, and in equatorial regions, but even in those areas numbers vary seasonally due to local movements; internal north–south migration has been noted within countries including Nigeria, Senegal, The Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire and Cameroon. This crake has also wandered further afield. It is rare on Bioko Island (<b>Equatorial</b> <b>Guinea),</b> and there have been two records each for São Tomé and Tenerife, the Canary Islands birds being the first records for the Western Palaeartic.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} (Picathartes oreas) is a {{medium-sized}} {{bird in the}} family Picathartidae with a long neck and tail. Also known as the grey-necked picathartes, this passerine is mainly found in rocky areas of close-canopied rainforest from south-west Nigeria through Cameroon, <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Guinea,</b> and south-west Gabon. It additionally lives {{on the island of}} Bioko. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often isolated from each other. The rockfowl typically chooses to live near streams and inselbergs in its forested habitat. It has no recognized subspecies, though some believe that it forms a superspecies with the white-necked rockfowl. The grey-necked rockfowl has grey upperparts, a light grey breast, and lemon-coloured underparts. Its unusually long tail is used for balance, and its thighs are muscular. The head is nearly featherless, with the exposed skin being powder blue on the forehead and upper mandible and carmine on the hindcrown. The bird’s cheeks and eyes are covered in a large, circular black patch that, though narrow, connects and divides the carmine and powder blue skin {{at the peak of the}} crown. Though the bird is usually silent, some calls are known.|$|E
