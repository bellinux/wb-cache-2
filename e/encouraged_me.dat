25|$|Back on Broadway, Arthur {{continued}} {{to appear in}} small plays that received little attention. Critics, however, {{continued to}} praise her in their reviews. It {{has been argued that}} in this period, Arthur developed confidence in her acting craft for the first time. On the contrast between films in Hollywood and plays in New York, Arthur commented:I don't think Hollywood {{is the place to be}} yourself. The individual ought to find herself before coming to Hollywood. On the stage I found myself to be in a different world. The individual counted. The director <b>encouraged</b> <b>me</b> and I learned how to be myself.... I learned to face audiences and to forget them. To see the footlights and not to see them; to gauge the reactions of hundreds of people, and yet to throw myself so completely into a role that I was oblivious to their reaction.|$|E

He recalled that his father [...] "insisted that I learnt the Koran and <b>encouraged</b> <b>me</b> to understand the basic traditions and beliefs of Islam but without imposing any particular views. He was an overwhelming personality but open-minded and liberal." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1971, Butterfield had {{purchased}} his first house, in rural Woodstock, New York, and began enjoying family life {{with his second}} wife, Kathy Peterson, and their infant son, Lee. According to Maria Muldaur, {{she and her husband}} were frequent dinner guests, which usually involved sitting around a piano and singing songs. She doubted her abilities, but [...] "it was Butter that first <b>encouraged</b> <b>me</b> to let loose and just sing the blues [...] not to worry about singing pretty or hitting all the right notes... He loosened all the levels of self-consciousness and doubt out of me... And he'll forever live in my heart for that and for respecting me as a fellow musician." ...|$|E
500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just go in there, just do it.' He totally <b>encouraged</b> <b>me.</b> I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E

500|$|Goldstone was {{approached}} by Cassese and {{expressed an interest in}} the position. President Mandela supported his wish to take up the position at The Hague, as Goldstone later recalled: [...] "He certainly <b>encouraged</b> <b>me.</b> He thought it was important to take what was the first offer of a major international position after South Africa ceased to be a pariah." [...] However, the offer put Mandela in a difficult spot. He wanted Goldstone, {{who was one of the}} few South African jurists to have earned the respect of both blacks and whites, for South Africa's newly established Constitutional Court. Mandela struck a deal with the UN Secretary-General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, that Goldstone would serve only half of his four-year term as prosecutor and would then return to take up his post in South Africa. The president rushed through a constitutional amendment that would allow Goldstone to be named, take an immediate period of leave to serve at the tribunal and then return to his spot on the Constitutional Court. He proved to be an ideal candidate, as he had been suggested by the French, was not too hot-headed for the British, was strong enough to satisfy the Americans and his credentials as a white South African who had opposed apartheid satisfied the Russians and Chinese. The UN Security Council unanimously approved his appointment to the rôle of prosecutor.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hill collaboratively {{wrote an}} autobiography, , with mountaineer and writer Greg Child, {{published}} by W.W. Norton & Company. As {{she describes the}} process, [...] "He would take my writings and organize them, and he <b>encouraged</b> <b>me</b> to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was." [...] Hill explained {{in an interview that}} writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to [...] "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: [...] "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point , because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there." [...] Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer Rachel de Silva explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.|$|E
500|$|The {{acquisition}} of Nova Publications by Maclaren in 1954 gave New Worlds the stability to establish {{itself as a}} leading magazine. [...] Ashley describes the period from 1954 to 1960 as a [...] "Golden Age" [...] for New Worlds. [...] Carnell bought J. G. Ballard's first sale, [...] "Escapement", {{which appeared in the}} December 1956 New Worlds; Ballard {{went on to become a}} significant figure in the genre in the 1960s. Ballard was grateful to Carnell for the support he provided Ballard in the late 1950s. [...] Much of Ballard's work appeared in New Worlds and Science Fantasy, and Ballard later recalled that Carnell [...] "recognized what I was on about from a very early stage and he <b>encouraged</b> <b>me</b> to go on writing in my own way." [...] Carnell also published much of Brian Aldiss's early work in Science Fantasy and New Worlds. [...] John Brunner, later to become one of the most successful British science fiction writers, appeared regularly in the Nova magazines, starting with [...] "Visitors' Book" [...] in the April 1955 New Worlds. [...] James White began publishing with [...] "Assisted Passage" [...] in the January 1953 New Worlds, and in 1957 began his popular Sector General series, about a hospital for aliens, with [...] "Sector General" [...] in the November 1957 issue. John Wyndham, who was already well known outside the genre for works such as The Day of the Triffids, began a series about the Troons, a space-going family, with [...] "For All the Night" [...] in the April 1958 issue. [...] Arthur C. Clarke, another very successful British sf writer of the period, wrote relatively few short stories for the British market, but did publish [...] "Who's There" [...] in the November 1958 New Worlds. [...] Colin Kapp began his popular [...] "Unorthodox Engineers" [...] series with [...] "The Railways up on Cannis", in October 1959. [...] Other less well-known writers who were prolific during the late 1950s included J. T. McIntosh, Kenneth Bulmer, and E. C. Tubb.|$|E
