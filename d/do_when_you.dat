He just acts on them with more intensity than we do. He is a character who relies on the animal. And I always believe that the animal instincts are often the worst part of them.

500|$|Hans Zimmer {{initially}} denied popular {{rumors that}} he would be composing the film's score. However, in June 2012, it was confirmed that Zimmer would, in fact, be writing the film's musical score. To completely distinguish Man of Steel from the previous films, the iconic [...] "Superman March" [...] by John Williams was not used. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for Man of Steel was released publicly on June 11, 2013. An unofficial rip of the musical score from the third trailer, entitled [...] "An Ideal of Hope", confirmed to be a cut-down version of the track [...] "What Are You Going to <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Not Saving the World?", was released on April 19, 2013. In late April 2013, the official track listing of the two-disc deluxe edition was revealed.|$|E
500|$|... "Walk Away" [...] is a piano-driven waltz ballad. Written {{in the key}} of G major, it is a downtempo song, with a {{moderate}} slow and bluesy tempo of 52 beats per minute. It {{is followed by a}} chord progression of EmC7 in the verses. Aguilera's vocal range on the song span nearly two octaves, from the low-note of C3 to the high-note of G5. In the track, Aguilera uses a [...] "sultry lower range". Lyrically, [...] "Walk Away" [...] is about an abusive relationship, where she uses a [...] "clever" [...] metaphor. At the song's beginning, the lyrics [...] "What do you <b>do,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> know something's bad for you, and you still can't let go?" [...] are spoken by Aguilera. In the first verse, she sings, [...] "Your love was like candy/ Artificially sweet, I was deceived by your wrapping". The track was described as a non-sense song by Amanda Murray for Sputnikmusic.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the final volume of The Balkan Trilogy in 1965, Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories, A Romantic Hero and Other Stories, both of which were published in 1967. Another novel, The Play Room (published as The Camperlea Girls in the US), appeared in 1969. The book of short stories and The Play Room both contained homosexual themes, a topic which interested Manning. The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents, though the reviews were generally encouraging. A film version was proposed, and Ken Annakin asked her to write the script. The movie, with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book, was all but made before the money ran out; a second version, with a very different script, was also developed but came to nothing. [...] "Everything fizzled out", she said. [...] "I wasted {{a lot of time and}} that is something which you cannot afford to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are sixty"; in keeping with her obfuscations about her age, she was actually sixty-two.|$|E
2500|$|What to <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Armor for Sleep. Following the {{completion}} of two songs written {{from the perspective of}} being dead, vocalist/guitarist Ben Jorgensen created a whole story from this perspective. What to <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead is a concept album, with each song telling the story of the protagonist's suicide as well as his journey through the afterlife. Recording took place between August and October 2004 with producer Machine. A rough mix of [...] "Car Underwater" [...] was made available in November, followed by two US tours in February 2005. What to <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead was released on February 22 through independent label Equal Vision Records.|$|E

2500|$|To {{celebrate}} the 10th anniversary of What to <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead, the band performed {{a series of}} shows in September, October and December 2015, during which they performed the album in its entirety. In 2015, Maria Sherman of Fuse.tv wrote that the album [...] "laid the foundation for future pop-punk bands to explore concept records in very real ways". Calling it [...] "impressive at the time, this band from the suburbs [...] a power pop-punk record with a linear, intricate narrative". AXS contributor Tarynn Law wrote that [...] "the instantly relateable tracks that filled What To <b>Do</b> <b>When</b> <b>You</b> Are Dead soundtracked the teenage angst of kids {{all around the country}} for years to come". Brian Aberback of NorthJersey.com noted that the album [...] "put Armor for Sleep on the indie-rock map and continues to resonate heavily with fans 10 years later". Jorgensen later called the album a [...] "diary entry. Without that, I {{think a lot of people}} when [...] lives go on they forget what they went through at a certain point in time so for me that’s the biggest markers for me to remember where I was at the point in my life." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of Zimmer's most durable {{works from}} {{his time in}} the United Kingdom was the theme song for the {{television}} game show Going for Gold, which he composed with Sandy McClelland in 1987.

2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction.
