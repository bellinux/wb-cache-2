40|$|Ovine Johne's disease, or paratuberculosis, {{occurs in}} many countries. In Australia, {{surveillance}} using serology {{is used as}} part of a control program, but the testing regime is costly relative to its sensitivity. For this reason, culturing of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in fecal samples pooled from a number of sheep was evaluated. Initially, the effect of pooling on the sensitivity of fecal culture was evaluated using samples from 20 sheep with multibacillary paratuberculosis and 20 sheep with paucibacillary paratuberculosis, each confirmed histologically. All multibacillary cases and 50 % of paucibacillary cases were detected by culturing of feces at a pooling rate of 1 infected plus 49 uninfected sheep. In a pilot-scale study in 1997, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was detected by pooled fecal culture on 93 % of 27 infected farms which were identified originally based on history, clinical signs, and one or more rounds of testing using serologic and histopathologic examinations. Pooled fecal culture was compared with serologic examination for submissions from 335 farms where both tests had been conducted on the same sheep and was significantly more sensitive (P < 0. 001). Computer simulation of random sampling indicated that the testing of 6 pools of 50 sheep would provide 95 % confidence in detecting ≥ 2 % prevalence of infection. The estimated laboratory cost of pooled fecal culture when applied as a <b>flock</b> <b>test</b> is approximately 30 % that of serologic examination, and sample collection costs are lower. It is recommended that pooled fecal culture replace serologic examination for detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection at the flock level...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the {{evaluation}} of five influenza antigen detection tests by avian influenza H 5 N 1 virus-positive swab samples to estimate their diagnostic sensitivity. The tests included two chromatographic immunoassays, an H 5 avian influenza-specific antigen detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an influenza A antigen detection ELISA, and an H 5 rapid immunoblot assay. The results showed that the overall sensitivities of these tests ranged from 36. 3 % to 51. 4 % (95 % confidence interval ranging from 31. 0 % to 57. 0 %), which were comparable to Directigen (TM) Flu A antigen detection tests but substantially lower than genome detection methods. Diagnostic sensitivity performance {{is a function of the}} concentration of antigens in samples and the analytical sensitivity of the individual test. The test sensitivities were significantly higher for sick and dead birds by cloacal, tracheal, or tissue swabs than for fecal swabs from apparently healthy birds, and these tests would not be suitable for surveillance testing of clinically healthy birds. Furthermore, the sensitivity for testing tracheal and cloacal swabs from waterfowl and wild birds was not as good as for chickens. This was most likely to be associated with variation in virus titers between specimens from different bird species. However, the tests showed good sensitivities for testing brain swabs from clinically affected waterfowl species. The results indicate that these antigen detection tests could be used for preliminary investigations of H 5 N 1 outbreaks as a low-cost, simple <b>flock</b> <b>test</b> in sick and dead birds for the rapid detection of H 5 N 1 infection. However, the relatively low sensitivity of the tests as individual bird tests means that they should be used on optimal clinical specimens from diseased birds, testing birds on a flock basis, or testing samples as close to the onset of disease as possible before viral titers diminish. They should be followed up by confirmatory tests, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or viral culture, wherever possible but could assist in facilitating rapid investigations and control interventions...|$|E

40|$|Pregnancy {{diagnosis}} plays {{important role}} in modern goat management, especially when technologies such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer are employed in goat. Accurate pregnancy diagnosis may provide essential information for effective herd management in farm animals (Doize et al., 1997). This study was carried out with the following objectives: a) to determine accuracy of pregnancy prediction by using ultrasound scanner, b) to determine the criteria for single and twin pregnancies using ultrasound scanner, c) to predict the gestation age based on ultrasound scanning using constructed regression equation, d) to compare the efficacy of two different probes on pregnancy diagnosis and e) {{to determine the effect}} of breeds and unknown date of mating on pregnancy diagnosis, using ultrasound scanning. Pregnancy diagnosis was conducted using real-time B-mode ultrasound scanner with transrectal (7. 5 MHz) and transabdominal (5. 0 MHz) probes. Experiments 1 and 2 were conducted as preliminary studies on detection of pregnancy-related structures and their echogenicity. Experiments 3 and 4 were designed for echogenicity and size measurement of pregnancy-related structures, using both probes as well as to derive equations for gestational age estimation. <b>Flock</b> <b>test</b> was conducted in Experiment 5 to test the accuracy of gestational age estimation equations derived from Experiments 3 and 4. Embryonic vesicles with foetus and foetal heart were detected on week 4 and week 5 of gestation, respectively. Single and twin foetuses were differentiated between weeks 4 to 7 and weeks 5 to 10 of gestation, respectively. Both probes firstly detected placentome on week 7 of gestation and measurable up to the delivery day (week 21 of gestation). Foetal heart measurement was possible starting from week 8 of gestation, owing to the changes in echogenicity of the foetal heart. Transrectal probe visualised foetal heart up to week 10 of gestation, while transabdominal probe until week 21 of gestation. Skeletal structures, such as foetal head, were first viewed on week 6 and week 7 of gestation using transrectal and transabdominal probes, respectively.

40|$|In this study, milk-coagulation {{properties}} (MCP) {{were characterized}} in the Sarda sheep breed. Milk composition and MCP [rennet-coagulation time (RCT), curd-firming time [time {{to reach a}} curd firmness of 20 mm (k 20) ], and curd firmness (a 30), (a 45), and (a 60) ] were obtained extending the lactodynamographic analysis from 30 to 60 min from a population of 1, 121 ewes from 23 different farms. Managerial characteristics of farms and parity, individual daily milk yields and stage of lactation of ewes were recorded. Data were analyzed using a mixed-model procedure with fixed effects of days in milk, parity, daily milk yield, and flock size and the random effect of the flock/test day nested within flock size. Sampled farms were classified as small ( 600 ewes), often operated through hired workers. Daily milk yield was, on average, 1. 58 ± 0. 79 L/d and variability for this trait was very high. The average content of fat, protein, and casein was respectively 6. 41, 5. 39, and 4. 20 %. The class of flock size {{had a significant effect}} only on curd firmness, whereas days in milk affected RCT and k 20. The <b>flock</b> <b>test</b> day, parity, and daily milk yield were important sources of variation for all MCP. The mean value of RCT (8. 6 min) and the low occurrence of noncoagulating samples (0. 44 %) confirmed the excellent coagulation ability of sheep milk compared with cattle milk. A more rapid coagulation was observed in mid-lactating, primiparous, and high-yielding ewes. The k 20 was usually reached in less than 2 min after gelation, with the most favorable values at mid lactation. The mean value of curd firmness 30 min after rennet addition (a 30) was, on average, 50 mm and decreased to 46 and 42 mm respectively after 45 (a 45) and 60 min (a 60). The decreasing value of curd-firmness traits was likely to be caused by curd syneresis and whey expulsion. The correlation between RCT and a 30 was much lower than in dairy cows and about null for a 45 and a 60. This means that curd firmness in dairy ewes is almost independent of gelation time and this can provide specific information for this species. In conclusion, this study showed that milk from Sarda sheep is characterized by an earlier gelation, a faster increase in curd firmness with time, and greater curd firmness after 30 min compared with dairy cows. Furthermore, correlations between MCP in sheep are much lower than in bovines and some of the assumptions and interpretations related to cows cannot be applied to sheep...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} the observed relationship of campylobacter in poultry operations to human cases {{in a closed}} environment. During 1999 in Iceland, domestic cases of campylobacteriosis reached peak levels at 116 / 100, 000 and in 2000 dropped to 33 / 100, 000. Approximately 62 % of broiler carcass rinses were contaminated with Campylobacter spp. in 1999. During 2000, only 15 % of the broiler <b>flocks</b> <b>tested</b> Campylobacter spp. positive. In 2000, carcasses from <b>flocks</b> which <b>tested</b> positive on the farms at 4 weeks of age were subsequently frozen prior to distribution. We suggest that public education, enhanced on-farm biological security measures, carcass freezing and other unidentified factors, such as variations in weather, contributed to the large reduction in poultry-borne campylobacteriosis. There is no immediate basis for assigning credit to any specific intervention.

Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from environmental samples including air, water puddles, adjacent broiler flocks and soil. A representative subset of isolates from each farm was selected for further characterization using flaA-SVR sub-typing and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to determine if same-species isolates from different sources were indistinguishable or not. Results obtained suggest that no evidence of vertical transmission existed and that adequate cleaning/disinfection of broiler houses contributed to the prevention of carryover and cross-contamination.

Moreover, amplified fragment length polymorphism, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and automated ribotyping were employed to estimate the levels of genetic variability of H. pullorum broiler isolates within and between flocks. Overall, Gram-negative, slender, curved rods, identified as H. pullorum by PCR, were isolated at 93. 3 % of the farms tested. The percentage of positive free-range farms (54. 2 %) was significantly lower than that of conventional (100 %) or organic (100 %) farms (P < 0. 001). The level of within-flock genetic variability, calculated as the number of flocks colonized by isolates genetically different by all of the typing methods, was 34. 9 %.

The seroprevalence of sheep increased from 37. 7 % in one year old stock to 73. 8 % in ewes that were older than six years, showing that acquired infections during the life of the animals is frequent and that environmental contamination by T. gondii oocysts must be significant.

30|$|Molecular {{studies of}} IBV {{have shown that}} genetic and {{antigenic}} variants of this virus can emerge, mainly {{as a result of}} a few alterations or mutations in nucleotide sequences of the S 1 gene, while the majority of the IBV genome remains unaltered. The genetic variability in the S 1 subunit of the envelope spike glycoprotein gene represents an adaptive mechanism of the virus to immune selective pressures associated with intensive IBV vaccination and other management practices (Gelb et al. 1991; 1997). As a consequence, several serotypes of the virus are recognized and additional variant serotypes continue to evolve and cause disease episodes. Moreover, the vaccination of many broiler and layer flocks has been routinely made with a live attenuated vaccine against IB containing the strain H 120. This strain belongs to the Massachusetts serotype and represents an additional problem for the discrimination of virulent field strains from this serotype, using RT-PCR or even RFLP techniques. Cavanagh et al.

The objective {{of this study was}} to determine serologically the prevalence of antibodies against Salmonella gallinarum among apparently healthy chickens around Jos. A total of 700 serum samples made up of 450 exotic and 250 local breed of chickens were used for this study with 37. 9 % seropositvity. In the free range system (19. 3 %) of the flocks sampled were seropositive for Salmonella gallinarium antibodies while in the semi intensive, 18. 6 % of the <b>flock</b> <b>tested</b> positive. The serum agglutination test (SAT) was adapted to the microtitre format used to determine somatic and flagella titres. The antigen used for this study was specific for S. gallinarum, hence differentiation between species infection was assessed in this study. Perhaps the most feasible way to eradicate the disease is to encourage farmers (both small and large scale) to break the disease cycle at their levels by embarking on prompt and regular vaccination programmes. It is thus concluded that Salmonella gallinarum (fowl typhoid) is present in the area investigated.

40|$|We use a {{well known}} model (T. Vicsek et al. Phys Rev Lett 15, 1226 (1995)) for <b>flocking</b> to <b>test</b> mutual {{information}} {{as a tool}} for detecting order-disorder transitions, in particular when observations of the system are limited. We show that mutual information is a sensitive indicator of the phase transition location, in terms of the natural dimensionless parameters of the system which we have identified. When only a few particles are tracked, and when only a subset of the positional and velocity components are available, mutual information provides a better measure of the phase transition location than the susceptibility of the data.

Resistance to erythromycin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol was < 1 %, whereas for ampicillin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline, resistance was 33 %, 10 % and 13 %, respectively. Ciprofloxacin resistance was 3 %, {{one of the}} lowest in recent reports from studies on human or poultry isolates. Sequence data of the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyrA gene showed a mutation leading to Thr- 86 to Ile substitution among highly resistant ciprofloxacin isolates.

Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) {{was used to}} screen oropharyngeal/ cloacal swab and brain samples from wild Canada geese (Branta canadensis) for ABV. Approximately 2. 9 % of swab samples were positive for bornavirus sequences. Fifty-two percent of brain samples from 2 urban <b>flocks</b> also <b>tested</b> positive, and brain isolates were cultured in duck embryo fibroblasts.

40|$|Objective: Estimate the {{seroprevalence}} {{of influenza}} A virus in various commercial poultry farms and evaluate specific risk factors {{as well as}} analyze their genetic nature using molecular assays. Materials and Methods: This report summarizes {{the findings of a}} national survey realized from October 2010 to May 2011 on 800 flocks in 20 governorates. Serum samples were screened for the presence of specific influenza virus antibodies using cELISA test. Additionally, swab samples were tested by real time and conventional RT-PCR and compared with results obtained by others assays. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses of the glycoproteins were established for some strains. Results: Out of the 800 chicken and turkey <b>flocks</b> <b>tested</b> by cELISA, 223 showed positive anti-NP antibodies (28. 7 %, 95 % CI: 25. 6 – 32. 1). Significantly higher seroprevalence was found among the coastal areas compared to inland and during the autumn and winter. Broiler flocks showed significantly lower seroprevalence than layers and broiler breeders. The influenza virus infection prevalence increased after the laying phase among layer flocks. In addition, AIV seropositivity was significantly associated with low biosecurity measures. The Ag EIA and rRT-PCR tests revealed significantly higher numbers of AI positive samples as compared to cell cultures or egg inoculation. All new strains were subtyped as H 9 N 2 by real time and conventional RT-PCR. Drift mutations, addition or deletion of glycosylation sites were likely to have occurred in the HA and NA glycoproteins of Tunisian strains resulting in multiple new amino acid substitutions. This fact may reflect differen...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAvian {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli (APEC) strains {{originating from}} ten free-range layer flocks {{were characterized by}} Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) and plasmid profile analysis to investigate their phylogenetic relationship and diversity, respectively. In addition to colibacillosis, all <b>flocks</b> <b>tested</b> positive for antibodies against avian Metapneumovirus (aMPV) during production, and six of the flocks were concurrently affected by histomonosis. Accumulated average mortality for flocks concurrently affected by colibacillosis and histomonosis made up 17. 4 %, while the average mortality for E. coli infected flocks was 16. 5 %. A total of eight different sequence types (STs) and 47 different plasmid profiles were demonstrated among the E. coli isolates. Within each flock between one to four different STs and three to 13 different plasmid profiles were demonstrated. A statistical significant difference in STs and plasmid profile diversity {{of the population of}} E. coli was not demonstrated between flocks affected by histomonosis compared to histomonosis-free flocks. Only minor clonal diversity was demonstrated for each flock, and in all, but one flock, colibacillosis started before antibodies against aMPV were detected. All isolates, except two, carried plasmids greater than 100 kilobases, but only a single plasmid replicon type, IncFIB, was demonstrated, suggesting plasmids representing this type might represent a common pathogenicity factor for the different STs of E. coli. Within each flock a clonal tendendy was observed, indicating that only certain clones of E. coli possess a significant pathogenic potential. These clones act as primary than rather than secondary pathogens, resulting in colibacillosis without predisposing factors, including histomonosis and aMPV...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo genetically {{different}} isolates {{of chicken}} astrovirus (CAstV), named CAstV 612 and CAstV 11672, which share {{low levels of}} antigenic relatedness in cross-indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) tests, have been identified recently. In this study, separate IIF tests for detecting antibodies to the CAstV 612 and CAstV 11672 isolates {{have been used to}} determine the seroprevalences of CAstV infections in 4 generations of flocks involved in broiler chicken production. CAstV antibodies were detected in 78 % (73 % CAstV 612; 46 % CAstV 11672) of serum samples from UK broiler flocks and in all 10 <b>flocks</b> <b>tested,</b> indicating that infections were very common. Twenty three (96 %) of 24 and 26 (93 %) of 28 broiler parent flocks, aged 23 - 26 weeks from 3 UK organisations, were positive for antibody to CAstV 612 and CAstV 11672 respectively. Of 718 samples tested from these parent flocks, 415 (53 %) were positive for either CAstV 612 or CAstV 11672 antibody. CAstV infections were also widespread in parent flocks, with screening of pooled serum samples showing that antibodies to both CAstVs were detected in flocks from 7 other UK poultry organisations and in flocks from 8 other European countries. The seropositivities for CAstVs were substantially less in grandparent (28 %) and great grandparent (21 %) flocks. Overall, higher seropositivies were observed for CAstV 612 than for CAstV 11672 in broiler, parent, GP and GGP flocks. A limited study of 99 sera from 10 turkey breeder flocks showed low level seropositivities for CAstV 612 (9 %) and CAstV 11672 (2 %), indicating that turkeys were infected with CAstVs or antigenically related viruses...|$|R

H. pullorum isolates were examined by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprinting for interstrain genetic diversity and relatedness. Sixteen isolates from cecal samples from 2 different flocks were obtained. AFLP {{analysis showed that}} these isolates and 4 additional isolates from a different flock clustered according to their origin, which indicates that H. pullorum colonization may occur with a single strain that disseminates throughout the flock. Strains isolated from different hosts or geographic sources displayed a distinctive pattern.
