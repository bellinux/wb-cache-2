50|$|CV {{measures}} {{are often used}} as quality controls for quantitative laboratory assays. While <b>intra-assay</b> and inter-assay CVs might be assumed to be calculated by simply averaging CV values across CV values for multiple samples within one assay or by averaging multiple inter-assay CV estimates, {{it has been suggested}} that these practices are incorrect and that a more complex computational process is required. It has also been noted that CV values are not an ideal index of the certainty of a measurement when the number of replicates varies across samples − in this case standard error in percent is suggested to be superior. If measurements do not have a natural zero point then the CV is not a valid measurement and alternative measures such as the intraclass correlation coefficient are recommended.|$|E

We have developed a method for distinguishing and discriminating common genotypes of E. granulosus s. l. (G 1, G 3, and G 6) in Iran. This method is based on polymerase chain reaction coupled with high resolution melting curve (HRM), ramping from 70 to 86 C with fluorescence data acquisition set at 0. 1 C increments and continuous fluorescence monitoring. Consistency of this technique was assessed by inter- and <b>intra-assays.</b> Assessment of intra- and inter-assay variability showed low and acceptable coefficient of variations ranging from 0. 09 to 0. 17 %.

The serum level in the AHSG∗ 1 homozygote is significantly {{higher than that of}} the AHSG∗ 2 homozygote. This study examined the molecular mechanism for the cis-regulatory expression. To quantitate allele-specific mRNA in <b>intra-assays</b> of the heterozygote, RT-PCR method employing primers that were incorporated to the two closely located SNPs was developed. The respective magnitudes of AHSG∗ 1 to AHSG∗ 2 in the liver tissues and hepatic culture cells of PLC/PRF/ 5 were determined quantitatively as 2. 5 -fold and 6. 2 -fold. The mRNA expressional difference of two major alleles was observed, which is consistent with that in the serum level. The culture cells carried heterozygous genotypes in rs 4917 and rs 4918, but homozygous one in rs 2248690. It was unlikely that the imbalance was derived from the SNP located in the promotor site. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of mRNA degradation, RNA synthesis in the cell culture was inhibited potently by the addition of actinomycin-D. No marked change was apparent between the two alleles.

40|$|Background: Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) are a {{group of}} animal and human {{illnesses}} that are mostly caused by several distinct families of viruses including bunyaviruses, flaviviruses, filoviruses and arenaviruses. Although specific signs and symptoms vary {{by the type of}} VHF, initial signs and symptoms are very similar. Therefore rapid immunologic and molecular tools for differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever viruses (HFVs) are important for effective case management and control of the spread of VHFs. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay is one of the reliable and desirable methods for specific detection and quantification of virus load. Multiplex PCR assay has the potential to produce considerable savings in time and resources in the laboratory detection. Results: Primers/probe sets were designed based on appropriate specific genes for each of 28 HFVs which nearly covered all the HFVs, and identified with good specificity and sensitivity using monoplex assays. Seven groups of multiplex one-step real-time qRT-PCR assays in a universal experimental system were then developed by combining all primers/probe sets into 4 -plex reactions and evaluated with serial dilutions of synthesized viral RNAs. For all the multiplex assays, no cross-reactivity with other HFVs was observed, and the limits of detection were mainly between 45 and 150 copies/PCR. The reproducibility was satisfactory, since the coefficient of variation of Ct values were all less than 5 % in each dilution of synthesized viral RNAs for both <b>intra-assays</b> and inter-assays.

40|$|Biological and {{biochemical}} {{characteristics of}} monoclonal antibodies (MABs) raised against human interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) {{are described as}} well as their use in the design of a specific ELISA for the measurement of the cytokine. 21 murine anti-human interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) MABs were obtained by fusion of splenocytes from mice immunized against human recombinant IL- 10 with SP 2 / 0 myelomatous cells. These antibodies define three major antigenic areas on the IL- 10 molecule, one of which comprises epitopes involved in receptor binding and induction of biological activity. They recognize recombinant human IL- 10 with affinities ranging from 1. 3 x 10 (- 7) to 3 x 10 (- 11), as well as natural IL- 10. Most of them also recognize viral IL- 10 (vIL- 10) encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A specific human-IL- 10 ELISA has been developed using two MABs (18 and 19) as capture antibody and one MAB (17) as detector. The sensitivity (3 pg/ml), precision (<b>intra-assays</b> < 4 %), reproducibility (interassay < 3 %), and accuracy (recoveries, ranging between 84 and 107 %, in several fluids) of the assay, plus its excellent performance in dilution tests, and the lack of interference when in the presence of possible cross-reactive substances, permits accurate cytokine measurement in biological fluids such as serum, plasma, bronchoalveolar lavage, urine and culture supernatants. Using the assay, IL- 10 was measurable in the plasma of patients with septic shock (range 11 - 2740 pg/ml) whereas IL- 10 plasma levels were < 7. 8 pg/ml in healthy volunteers.

40|$|Rapid {{diagnosis}} of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARa) {{contributes to a}} highly effective therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a valuable tool to diagnose APL with PML-RARa. However, a single RT-qPCR analysis, which is laborious and costly, has to be performed in three reactions to determine whether {{one of the three}} PML-RARa transcripts is present and to quantify the involved transcript. This paper describes a novel TaqMan MGB probe-based 3 -plex RT-qPCR assay in a single reaction to detect simultaneously the three PML-RARa transcripts. Specific primers and probe were designed, and the results were further normalized to the Abelson gene. The detection results for the serially diluted plasmid indicate that the analytical sensitivity was 10 copies per reaction for PML-RARa bcr 1, bcr 2, and bcr 3. A relatively high sensitivity of 10 - 4 was achieved with this assay when analyzing the bcr 1 transcripts obtained from the NB 4 cell line. The reproducibility was satisfactory because the coefficients of variation of cycle threshold values were less than 3 % for both inter- and <b>intra-assays.</b> After testing 319 newly diagnosed patients with leukemia (including 61 APL cases), the results of the 3 -plex RT-qPCR assay completely agreed with the traditional methods used for the detection of PML-RARa. The quantitative results of the 3 -plex RT-qPCR were highly correlated with the single RT-qPCR and showed similar assay sensitivity for 60 PML-RARa positive APL samples at diagnosis and 199 samples from 57 patients during follow-up. Interestingly, one PML-RARa bcr 2 case at diagnosis with breakpoint at 1579, which was not detected by the single RT-q-PCR, was detected by the 3 -plex RT-qPCR assay. The 3 -plex RT-qPCR assay is a specific, sensitive, stable, and cost-effective method {{that can be used for}} the rapid diagnosis and treatment monitoring of APL with PML-RARa...|$|R

40|$|Background. Serum bile acids (SBA) {{are used}} as a routine {{screening}} tool of liver function in dogs. Serum samples are usually shipped to a referral laboratory for quantitative analysis with an enzymatic chemistry analyzer. The canine SNAP Bile Acids Test (SNAP-BAT) provides an immediate, semi-quantitative measurement of bile acid concentrations in-house. With the SNAP-BAT, bile acids concentrations of 5 – 30 µmol/L are quantified, and results outside of that range are classified as 30 µmol/L. Agreement of the SNAP-BAT with the enzymatic method has not been extensively investigated. Objectives. The purposes of this prospective clinical study were to assess the precision of the SNAP-BAT and determine agreement of SNAP-BAT with results from an in-house chemistry analyzer. Methods. After verifying <b>intra-assay</b> precision of the SNAP-BAT, a prospective analysis was performed using blood samples collected from 56 dogs suspected to have liver disease.

40|$|Synovial fluid (SF) is a {{difficult}} biological matrix to analyse due to its complex non-Newtonian nature. This can result in poor assay repeatability and potentially inefficient use of precious samples. This study assessed the impact of SF treatment by hyaluronidase and/or dilution on <b>intra-assay</b> precision using the Luminex and Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) multiplex platforms. SF was obtained from patients with knee osteoarthritis {{at the time of}} joint replacement surgery. Aliquots derived from the same sample were left untreated (neat), 2 -fold diluted, 4 -fold diluted or treated with 2 mg/ml testicular hyaluronidase (with 2 -fold dilution). Preparation methods were compared in a polysterene-bead Luminex 10 -plex (N= 16), magnetic-bead Luminex singleplex (N= 7) and MSD 4 -plex (N= 7). Each method was assessed for coefficient of variation (CV) of replicate measurements, number of bead events (for Luminex assays) and dilution-adjusted analyte concentration. Percentage recovery was calculated for dilutions and HAse treatment. Hyaluronidase treatment significantly increased the number of wells with satisfactory bead events/region (95 %) compared to neat (48 %, p< 0. 001) in the polystyrene-bead Luminex assay, but the magnetic-bead Luminex assay achieved ≥ 50 bead events irrespective of treatment method. Hyaluronidase treatment resulted in lower <b>intra-assay</b> CVs for detectable ligands (group average CV< 10 %) than neat, 2 -fold and 4 -fold dilution (CV~ 25 % for all, p< 0. 05) in both polystyrene- and magnetic-bead Luminex assays. In addition, measured sample concentrations were higher and recovery was poor (elevated) after hyaluronidase treatment. In the MSD 4 -plex, within-group comparison of the <b>intra-assay</b> CV or concentration was not conclusively influenced by SF preparation.
