2500|$|On {{the right}} of the 163rd Brigade, the Imperial Camel Brigade—reinforced by one {{battalion}} of the 161st Brigade (54th Division)—advanced from <b>Dumb-bell</b> Hill. The 1st Battalion Imperial Camel Brigade advanced to occupy Tank redoubt on the left of the line, while the 3rd Battalion Imperial Camel Brigade crossed the Gaza to Beersheba road and temporarily occupied both [...] "Jack" [...] and [...] "Jill" [...] positions to the east of Kh. Sihan. They withdrew when the 4th Light Horse Brigade on their right was forced to withdraw during an Ottoman counterattack.|$|E
2500|$|The 53rd (Welsh) Division held Samson Ridge, and the 52nd (Lowland) Division {{held the}} line at the foot of Outpost Hill where {{construction}} of new defences at Heart Hill and Blazed Hill were begun. Although ordered not to abandon any ground, the position of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, out in the open and swept by fire, could not be maintained. The division was forced to withdraw to a position near Sheikh Abbas where they made contact with the 74th Division. The Imperial Camel Brigade, whose right was close to Kh. Sihan, covered this withdrawal, before withdrawing in turn at 19:45 to Charing Cross, southwest of Sheikh Abbas. Desert Column was withdrawn to an outpost line extending from the right of the 54th (East Anglian) Division near <b>Dumb-bell</b> Hill {{on the edge of the}} Sheikh Abbas Ridge, through Munkheile south of the Wadi el Baha, to a point on the Wadi Ghuzzee about [...] north of Shellal at Hiseia.|$|E
2500|$|Two tanks {{attached}} to the 163rd (Norfolk & Suffolk) Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division, started their advance from <b>Dumb-bell</b> Hill at 04:30, but the leading tank was put out of action after being hit by three shells. The attack on Sheikh Abbas succeeded by 07:00 when the area was occupied and work began to fortify and entrench the position. The advance by the 52nd (Lowland) Division was more strongly opposed but after their 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade captured the Ottoman outpost at El Burjabye, {{they were able to}} occupy Mansura Ridge. Here their advance was brought to a halt when they were targeted by Ottoman artillery firing from Ali Muntar. Despite this, the captured position was consolidated. During the day a fortified line was constructed from Sheikh Ailin to Sheikh Abbas about [...] from Gaza. With the capture of the Mansura Ridges, a line from there to the sea, about [...] from the Wadi Ghuzzeh was established.|$|E

The other aim of this theses was to compare the heart rate during rest on land and rest in water during shallow water aerobic in an upright position with water level to shoulder depth. Methods: We monitored heart rate changes during 14 minutes head-out aquatic exercise by Sport Tester S 610 i. The results of the tests were analyzed and evaluated with Polar Precision Performance software. Chi-squared {{test was used to}} examine the average difference to heart rate during tests. Results: We found non-significant increases on load intensity during test with using buoyancy <b>dumb-bells.</b> Average heart rate during rest in water showed decreases by 13 beats per minute.

40|$|URL] The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare the acute physiological adaptations to several variants of the same basic head-out aquatic exercise (only with legs actions, with simultaneous legs and arms actions, with simultaneous legs and arms actions using buoyancy <b>dumb-bells).</b> 16 young females, clinically healthy and with a regular level of physical activity were studied. Each subjected performed a basic head-out aquatic exercise named “rocking horse”. Before and after each 6 minutes exercise, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) and blood lactate (La-]) were evaluated. Before, during and after each exercise, the maximal heart rate achieved (FCmax) was measured and the percentage of maximal theoretical heart rate estimated (%FCmax). The subjects perceived an increasing exertion from the exercise only with legs actions to the exercise with simultaneous legs and arms actions, to the exercise with simultaneous legs and arms actions including <b>dumb-bells.</b> The cardiac workout (FCmax and %FCmax) was significantly lower performing the exercise only with the legs than in the other two exercise conditions. The increasing number of limb’s actions and the adoption of <b>dumb-bells</b> promoted an increase of the blood lactate. In conclusion, the increasing number of simultaneous limb’s actions and the inclusion of materials, just like buoyancy <b>dumb-bells,</b> increased the acute physiological response in head-out aquatic exercises...|$|R

Suddenly, {{in the middle}} of her work, on a stuffy-still July day, she called a wind out of the Northwest, a wind blown under an arch of steel-bellied clouds, a wicked bitter wind with a lacing of hail to it, a wind that came and was gone in less than ten minutes, but blocked the roads with fallen trees, toppled over a barn, and--blew potatoes out of the ground! When that was done, a white cloud shaped like a <b>dumb-bell</b> whirled down the valley across the evening blue, roaring and twisting and twisting and roaring all alone by itself.

6000|$|When I {{first began}} my visits, {{he had lived}} in the town itself, and close to a disreputable {{neighbourhood}} called the Burrough, till one evening, while he sat over his dinner, he heard a man and woman quarrelling under his window. [...] "I mind the time," [...] shouted the man, [...] "when I slept with you and your daughter in the one bed." [...] My uncle was horrified, and moved to a little house {{about a quarter of a}} mile into the country, where he lived with an old second-sighted servant, and a man-servant to look after the racehorse that was browsing in the neighbouring field, with a donkey to keep it company. His furniture had not been changed since he set up house for himself as a very young man, and in a room opposite his dining-room were the saddles of his youth, and though he would soon give up riding, they would be oiled and the stirrups kept clean and bright till the day of his death. Some love-affair had gone wrong when he was a very young man; he had now no interest in women; certainly never sought favour of a woman, and yet he took great care of his appearance. He did not let his beard grow, though he had, or believed that he had, for he was hypochondriacal, a sensitiveness of the skin that forced him to spend an hour in shaving, and he would take to club and <b>dumb-bell</b> if his waist thickened by a hair's breadth, and twenty years after, when a very old man, he had the erect shapely figure of his youth. I often wondered why he went through so much labour, for it was not pride, which had seemed histrionic in his eyes--and certainly he had no vanity; and now, looking back, I am convinced that it was from habit, mere habit, a habit formed when he was a young man, and the best rider of his district.|$|E
6000|$|I did not {{at first}} find it at all an easy matter to make test weights so alike as to differ in no other appreciable respect than in their {{specific}} gravity, and if they differ and become known apart, the knowledge so acquired will vitiate future judgments in various indirect ways. Similarity in outward shape and touch was ensured {{by the use of}} mechanically-made cartridge cases; dissimilarity through any external stain was rendered of no hindrance to the experiment by making the operatee handle them in a bag or with his eyes shut. Two bodies may, however, be alike in weight and outward appearance and yet behave differently when otherwise mechanically tested, and, consequently, when they are handled. For example, take two eggs, one raw and the other hard boiled, and spin them on the table; press the finger for a moment upon either of them whilst it is still spinning: if it be the hard-boiled egg it will stop as dead as a stone: if it be the raw egg, after a little apparent hesitation, it will begin again to rotate. The motion of its shell had alone been stopped; the internal part was still rotating and this compelled the shell to follow it. Owing to this cause, when we handle the two eggs, the one feels [...] "quick" [...] and the other does not. Similarly with the cartridges, when one is rather more loosely packed than the others the difference is perceived on handling them. Or it may have one end heavier than the other, or else its weight may not be equally distributed round its axis, causing it to rest on the table with the same part always lowermost; differences due to these causes are also easily perceived when handling the cartridges. Again, one of two similar cartridges may balance perfectly in all directions, but the weight of one of them may be disposed too much towards the ends, as in a <b>dumb-bell,</b> or gathered too much towards the centre. The period of oscillation will differ widely in the two cases, as may be shown by suspending the cartridges by strings round their middle so that they shall hang horizontally, and then by a slight tap making them spin to and fro round the string as an axis.|$|E
