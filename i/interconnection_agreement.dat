40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the structure}} of the Internet marketplace and the business relationships of key players involved in network services provision. A brief overview of existing pricing policies and research work in this area is presented and some new issues are introduced. We believe that the role of information asymmetry is critical when considering agreements for Internet access and interconnection. In negotiation and contract preparation, information asymmetry gives rise to adverse selection. The current structure of connectivity agreements does not address information asymmetries thus allowing the possibility of opportunistic behaviour in the form of moral hazard. Inasmuch as <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> involve sharing and/or exchanging network resources, either party will tend to exploit the agreement to its own advantage (i. e. conserving its own resources) and, possibly, {{to the detriment of the}} other (i. e. over-utilising the other’s resources).

40|$|Summary The {{increasing}} demand for real-time applications (video conferencing, Internet telephony [...] VoIP [...] etc.) delivered over Internet networks requires stringent Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Internet traffic routing {{based on a}} Best-effort basis can hardly support these QoS requirements. This article argues that Internet services providers should form strategic alliances to coordinate their investments in a new-generation infrastructure that could provide innovative services with QoS guarantees. This {{is supported by a}} topological analysis of the <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> among top-level Internet providers and by the lessons derived from alliances forged in the airline and card-based payment sectors. We conclude that on the Internet, the optimal organizational form should be a centralized alliance with a hub-and-spoke network structure.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the structure of}} the Internet connectivity market by focusing on the business relations of stakeholders involved in network services provision. We believe that the role of information asymmetry is critical when considering <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements,</b> and should be taken into account in {{the structure of the}} contract. Information asymmetry due to incomplete information concerning important operating parameters such as network load, capacity, cost, gives rise to adverse selection during negotiation and contract preparation. The current at structure of <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> does not address such information asymmetries. In many cases, the dfficulty of observing the actual effort allocated by the contracted network for providing quality of service, and in particular, the absence of appropriate incentives in the contract, allows for the possibility of opportunistic behaviour in the form of moral hazard. We formulate two simple analytical models which demonstrate the effects of moral hazard in the market for network transport services. The first deals with the case where the network is contracted for short duration transport where the customer can not use the statistical information obtained during the life time of the service to determine with certainty the actual effort allocated by the network. The second model deals with transit contracts of longer duration, where the actual cost for provisioning the service at various quality levels is only statistically known at the time the contract is set up. Although these models are too simple for capturing the complexity of <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> between ISPs, they demonstrate the bad effects of information asymmetry and motivate the importance of incentive contracts for improving efficiency. interconnection moral hazard incentives...|$|R

50|$|For cost reasons, many of {{the circuit}} (overcurrent) {{protection}} and power quality control (voltage regulation) devices used by electric utility companies are designed {{with the assumption that}} power always flows in one direction.

This type of interconnection can involve nontrivial engineering, and possibly equipment upgrade costs to keep the distribution circuit properly protected. Such costs may be minimized by limiting distributed generation capacity to less than is locally consumed, and guaranteeing this condition by installing a reverse-power cutoff relay that opens if backfeeding occurs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and analyzes the main {{aspects of the}} historical development and the current issues {{at stake in the}} South American Internet access market. We have studied the interconnection schemes for the exchange of local and regional traffic in the South American region, trying to identify the main incentives large ISPs have for improving the financial conditions under which <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> occur, usually at the expense of smaller ISPs. In fact, the model of cooperative agreement for the exchange of domestic (national) traffic has been adopted all through the region; the Internet access market has benefited from the cost reduction and the improvement in the quality of service that the operation of a NAP has brought in each country. We have also contacted representatives of the cooperative exchange points (also called Network Access Points or NAPs) at Latin American NAPs Second Meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The most important achievement of this work is the understanding of the basics upon which the stability of the exchange points is founded. This is especially critical for the growth of Internet in South America. We have identified come crucial aspects such as the characteristics of the <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> and the payments ISPs make to the NAP administration. We have developed a sufficiently detailed understanding of important issues such as the impact of new forms of interconnection such as secondary peering agreements and multi-homing on the stability of Internet growth {{in the context of the}} fast developing and ever more complex South American Internet access markets. We have collected information on the structure of exchange points in different countries in the region to study the ISPs patterns of behavior arising from the new <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements,</b> in particular, and the changes in the traditional hierarchy induced by new contract forms, in general. Such agreements are essentially bilateral agreements at the exchanges, a relatively new feature in South and Central America. For that purpose we have developed theoretical models using bargaining theory and have also dealt with cost allocation problems at cooperative exchange points. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{studies the}} effects of {{geographical}} distance on the interconnection agreements between providers participating at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) in Europe. We assess separately two main issues: the extent of existing clustering, {{as well as the}} role of proximity in bilateral interconnection decisions. Our results show the dominance of spatial random patterns in the <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreement</b> distributions. On the other hand, we find that proximity positively affects the probability of establishing interconnection for all the IXPs studied but one. Interesting, the latter is the only one showing an initially clustered morphology. This indicates a prevalence of centripetal forces—local spillovers and mutual knowledge—over geographical differentiation for any pre-existing interconnection pattern morphology except the clustered ones.

40|$|<b>Interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> in the {{telecommunications}} industry have always been constrained by regulation. Internet interconnection has not received {{the same level of}} scrutiny. Recent debates regarding proposed mergers, network neutrality, Internet peering, and last mile competition have generated much discussion about whether Internet interconnection regulation is warranted. In order to determine whether such regulation is necessary, policymakers need appropriate metrics to help gauge a network provider's market power. Since Internet <b>interconnection</b> <b>agreements</b> are typically not published publicly, policymakers must instead rely on proxy metrics and inferred interconnection relationships. Alessio D'Ignazio and Emanuele Giovannetti have attempted to address this challenge by proposing a standard set of metrics that are based on and assessed using network topology data. They suggest two metrics, referred to as customer cone and betweenness, as proxies for market size and market power. This thesis focuses on the efficacy of the proposed customer cone and betweenness metrics as proxies for network market size and market power. by Elisabeth M. Maida. Thesis (S.
