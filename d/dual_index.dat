40|$|We {{examine a}} {{possibly}} capacitated, periodically reviewed, single stage inventory system where replenishment {{can be obtained}} either through a regular fixed leadtime channel, or, for a premium, via a channel with smaller fixed lead time. We consider the case when the unsatisfied demands are back-ordered over an infinite horizon, introducing the easily implementable, yet informationally rich <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> policy. We show very general separability results for the optimal parameter values, providing a simulation-based optimization procedure that exploits these separability properties to calculate the optimal inventory parameters within seconds. We explore {{the performance of the}} <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> policy under stationary demands as well as capacitated production environments, demonstrating when the dual sourcing option is most valuable. We find that the optimal <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> policy mimics the behavior of the complex, globally optimal state dependent policy found via dynamic programming: The <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> policy is nearly optimal (within one or two percent) for the majority of cases, and significantly outperforms Single Sourcing (up to 50 % better). Our results on optimal <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> parameters are generic, extending to a variety of complex and realistic scenarios like non-stationary demand, random yields, demand spikes and supply disruptions...|$|E
40|$|We study an {{inventory}} system under periodic {{review in the}} presence of two suppliers (or delivery modes). The emergency supplier has a shorter lead-time than the regular supplier, but the unit price he offers is higher. Excess demand is backlogged. We show that the classical “Lost Sales inventory problem ” is a special case of this problem. Then, we generalize the recently studied class of <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> policies (Veeraraghavan and Scheller-Wolf (2007)) by proposing two classes of policies. The first class consists of policies that have an order-up-to structure for the emergency supplier. We provide analytical results that are useful for determining optimal or near-optimal policies within this class. This analysis and the policies that we propose leverage the connections we make between our problem and the lost sales problem. The second class consists of policies that have an order-up-to structure for the combined orders of the two suppliers. Here, we derive bounds on the optimal order quantity from the emergency supplier, in any period, and use these bounds for finding effective policies within this class. Finally, we undertake an elaborate computational investigation to compare the performance of the policies we propose with that of <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> policies. One of our policies provides an average cost-saving of 1. 1 % over the Best <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> policy and has the same computational requirements.

40|$|XML {{has become}} the most common means for publication, storage and {{exchange}} of data over the Internet. As a result, a huge amount of information is stored and represented in XML, and research on keyword search in XML documents is on the increase as it allows users to find information they are interested in without having to know the underlying database schema or complex query language. In XML keyword search, the accurate identification of user search intention and ranking of the result in the presence of keyword ambiguities have been challenging problems. In this thesis, we propose a XML keyword search using <b>Dual</b> <b>indexing</b> and Mutual summation based Algorithm (XDMA) to address the problems in XReal and other XML keyword search approaches. Our proposed approach builds <b>dual</b> <b>indices,</b> namely, tag information table and data node information table for structural node and data node in XML database respectively. Moreover, we propose a keyword search technique to select all possible T-typed nodes for a given query using the two-level matching between the two indices. Using this search technique, keywords in a given query can be identified and distinguished as tags or data while searching for an input query. Furthermore, another new keyword ambiguity, Ambiguity 4, i. e., A keyword can exist as the name of a tag for node types having different data (text) values and vice versa, is identified and addressed in this thesis. Subsequently, a new concept called mutual summation is proposed for a pair of random variables. By incorporating the concept of dependence of two indices and the concept of mutual summation, we define the Mutual Score (MScore) between selected tags and query keywords to find the desired node of type T...|$|R

A dual indexed system safeguards the interests of both groups while providing for continued lending activities. The effects of inflation upon lenders are addressed through indexation of payments to prices, while the payments of borrowers are tied to a wage index with any shortfalls in real payments capitalized for later repayment.

40|$|Abstract—A {{resource}} allocation {{problem for a}} cognitive radio base station (CR-BS) communicating with multiple CR mobile stations (MSs) is considered in the downlink, which relies on orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). To protect the incumbent primary user (PU) system operating over the same frequency band, the interference inflicted to the PU receiver must be regulated. Since the channel gain estimates from the CR-BS to the PU receiver are typically uncertain in practice, a robust interference power constraint is advocated. Although the latter translates to a second-order cone constraint, the overall optimization problem for joint transmit-power and subcarrier allocation is non-convex, and coupled over all subcarriers in general. To circumvent the resulting computational hurdle, a tight polyhedral approximation of the second-order cone is employed. Practical finite-alphabet constellations are adopted and total weighted achievable rate is maximized. It is shown that a near-optimal solution can be obtained based on the Lagrangian <b>dual.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Cognitive radios, {{resource allocation}}, OFDMA, channel uncertainty, optimization...|$|E

Metagenomic deep sequencing (MDS) inventories nucleic acids present in laboratory stocks, providing an unbiased assessment of pathogen identity, {{the extent of}} genomic variation, {{and the presence of}} contaminants. Double-stranded cDNA MDS libraries were constructed from RNA extracted from in vitro-passaged stocks of six viruses (La Crosse virus, Ebola virus, canine distemper virus, measles virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus). Each library was <b>dual</b> <b>indexed</b> and pooled for sequencing. A custom bioinformatics pipeline determined the organisms present in each sample in a blinded fashion. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis identified viral isolates.

40|$|We {{consider}} a single stage periodic-review inventory system with backorders and dual sourcing: Replenishment can occur through a regular channel and/or {{a more expensive}} expedited channel with a smaller lead time. Globally optimal policies for these problems are in general highly complex; we therefore introduce a simple class of heuristic base stock policies.

The long-term implementation of a system of ring roads plus radiating roads in Beijing has strongly impacted urban infrastructure construction and space-time accessibility.

Few studies have examined the spatial distribution of bacterial communities on the leaves of a single tree. In this study, leaf samples from different areas of the canopy were obtained from a single Magnolia grandiflora tree. Samples were taken from the high (3. 5 - 4. 0 m above the ground), middle (1. 5 m), inner middle (1. 5 m but close to the trunk), and low (0. 5 m) portions of the tree canopy, following cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

40|$|Geographic {{information}} {{is one of}} the most important and the most common types of information in human society. It is estimated that more than 70 % of all information in the world has some kind of geographic features. In the era of information explosion, information retrieval (IR) tools, such as search engines, are the main tools people used to quickly find the information they need nowadays. Because of the importance of geographic information, recent efforts have been made either by expanding the traditional IR to support a spatial query, or building a GIR in a brand new architecture from the ground such as the SPIRIT project. To some degree, these existing GIR systems could solve users’ information search need with a spatial filter, especially when the users are looking for information on something within a relatively large extent. Despite its advantage on processing geographical information and queries over conventional IR systems, modern GIR systems are also facing challenges including a proper representation and extraction of geographical information within documents, a better information retrieval model for both thematic and geographical information, a fast indexing mechanism for rapid search within documents by thematic and geographical hints, and even a new architecture of system. The objective of this licentiate research is to provide solutions to some of these problems in order to build a better modern GIR system in the future. The following aspects have been investigated in the thesis: a generic conceptual framework and related key technologies for a modern GIR system, a new information retrieval model and algorithm for measuring the relevance scores between documents and queries in GIR, and finally a new better indexing technique to geographically and thematically index the documents for a faster query processing within modern GIR. Concerning the proposed conceptual framework for modern GIR, it includes three modules: (1) the user interface module, (2) the information extractor, storage and indexer module and (3) the query processing and information retrieval module. Two knowledge bases, Gazetteer and Thesaurus, play an important role in the proposed framework. A digital map based user interface is proposed for the input of user information search needs and representation of retrieval results. Key techniques required for the implementation of a modern GIR using the proposed framework are a proper representation of document and query information, a better geographical information extractor, an innovative information retrieval model and relevance ranking algorithm, and a combined indexing mechanism for both geographical and thematic information. The new information retrieval model is established based on a Spatial Bayesian Network consisting of place names appeared in a single document and the spatial relationships between them. The new model assesses the geographical relevance between GIR document and query by the geographical importance and adjacency of the document geo-footprint versus the geographical scope of the user’s query. Regarding the indexing mechanism for modern GIR systems, a Keyword-Spatial Hybrid Index (KSHI) is proposed for the single and overall geo-footprint model, in which there is only one single geo-footprint for each document to retrieve from. A Keyword-Spatial <b>Dual</b> <b>Index</b> (KSDI) is proved to be more appropriate for a GIR system which allows for multiple geo-footprints within a single document. In addition to theoretical analysis, necessary experiments have also been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of proposed new information retrieval model and indices. Both the theoretical analysis and results of experiments show the potentials of proposed solution and techniques. QC 2011063...|$|E
