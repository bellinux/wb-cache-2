Ono refused as {{she thought it was}} too high a price. McCartney spoke about the offer at a press conference in April 1990, explaining that Ono [...] "actually said 'I think we can <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> 5.'

Côte-Saint-Luc, Quebec mayor Anthony Housefather expressed concern in a recent council meeting {{about the lack of}} data: “I’m not the federal government, I didn’t determine if the railways have an obligation to provide [...] to the municipalities or anyone else,” the mayor added. “The federal government should be doing that. I had one opportunity to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> our city to work on our emergency measures plan and make sure that we’re prepared, and I prefer to have the information than not have it.... Until such time as the federal government adopts more stringent requirements on the railways, anything we receive as information as a city comes from the sufferance of the railway, meaning {{we need to have a}} good relationship with the railway to get anything because they have no legal obligation under federal law to provide it to us,” ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{estimated}} 12 million persons obtained {{their insurance}} from insurance companies in 2016 via online marketplaces (federal or state) developed {{as part of}} the Affordable Care Act, also known as [...] "Obamacare." [...] This insurance is federally subsidized through a premium tax credit, which varies based on the level of income of the individual. The credit is typically applied by the insurance company to lower the monthly premium payment. The post-subsidy premium cost is capped as a percentage of income, meaning as premiums rise the subsidies rise. Approximately 10 million persons on the exchanges are eligible for subsidies. An estimated 80% of persons obtaining coverage under the ACA can <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> less than $75 per month after subsidies, if they choose the lowest-cost [...] "bronze" [...] plan. The average cost for the [...] "second-lowest cost silver plan" [...] (the benchmark plan {{and one of the most}} popular) was $208/month after subsidy for a 40-year old male non-smoker in 2017.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{of his own}} background, Laurents felt it was {{important}} for his heroine to be Jewish and share his outrage at injustice. He also thought it was time a mainstream Hollywood film had a Jewish heroine, and because Barbra Streisand was the industry's most notable Jewish star, he wrote the role of Katie Morosky for her. Laurents had already known Streisand for some time, having cast her in his 1962 Broadway musical I Can <b>Get</b> <b>it</b> <b>For</b> You Wholesale. Hubbell Gardiner, initially a secondary character, was drawn from several people Laurents knew. The first name was borrowed from urbane television producer Hubbell Robinson, who had hired Laurents to write an episode of ABC Stage 67. The looks and personality came from two primary sources: writer Peter Viertel and a man Laurents referred to only as [...] "Tony Blue Eyes," [...] an acquaintance who inspired the scene where the creative writing instructor reads Hubbell's short story to his class.|$|E

She got the part of secretary to the lead actor businessman, played by then unknown Elliott Gould. They fell in love during rehearsals and eventually moved into a small apartment together. The show opened on March 22, 1962, at the Shubert Theater, and received rave reviews. Her performance [...] "stopped the show cold," [...] wrote Nickens, and she became Broadway's most exciting and youngest new star. Groucho Marx, while hosting the Tonight Show, told her that twenty was an [...] "extremely young age {{to be a success}} on Broadway." [...] Streisand received a Tony nomination and New York Drama Critic's prize for Best Supporting Actress. The show was recorded {{and it was the first}} time the public could purchase an album of her singing.|$|E

However, {{it was not clear}} why the money was given to him, though it was alleged that he was talking to Mr Saklawi about the redevelopment of an [...] council-owned carpark. Tsang had previously released a statement that [...] "Councils need to take leadership roles in this area, we simply cannot continue to support unsustainable development, {{for the sake of our}} children, grandchildren and the future environment, we need to make changes now." [...] According to The Australian Tsang was heard to have said that [...] "Basically, we <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> nothing,..... I am making Strathfield a better place ... I am doing it for the area." [...] Strathfield council soon afterwards released a press statement that it [...] "will not and does not" [...] tolerate misconduct. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is currently investigating whether claims developers were given inside information about land rezoning proposals put to Strathfield Council have any substance and the pictures taken by The Australian were handed to them for further investigation.|$|E
