Different <b>energy-efficient</b> or safetyrelevant <b>driving</b> systems are analysed and improvement possibilities are presented. The new driving system will use serialbus systems of the car and sensors that monitor the driver’s condition for gathering information about the driving behaviour and the driver. On the basis of this information, the driving system will give recommendations that try to get the driver adapt his driving behaviour to a chosen target driving behaviour, such as energy-efficient, safe or a combination of them. Additionally, a driving profile will be generated that recognizes and warns the driver on significantly deviations from driver’s normal driving behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Commissioned by the Dutch Railways Operation (NS Reizigers) {{research}} has been conducted on the possibilities to better incorporate energy-efficient train operation into the timetable. The motivation for this research is {{based on the fact that}} energy-efficient operation is not yet optimally included in the timetable design. This is because of the fact that the running time supplement is not optimally divided. Running time supplement or slack time is the running time above the minimal running time between two timetable points. The objective of the research is to develop a model which determines the optimal coasting point and the optimal cruising speed for trains and the associated running time supplement distribution; taking into account the desired robustness, the possibilities for energy-efficient operation and the desired punctuality during the execution of the timetable. The behavior of a train is described by four driving regimes: acceleration, cruising, coasting and braking. With these driving regimes this study considers two driving strategies: time optimal and energy-efficient. The time optimal driving strategy requires a train to drive as fast as possible from A to B using the driving regimes acceleration, braking and possibly cruising. The <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> strategy requires a train to drive also from A to B using as less as possible traction energy given the available time from the timetable. The coasting regime is an important part in this strategy. The <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> strategy is determined by the optimal control theory. The algorithm which is applied in MATLAB determines the <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> strategy by calculating the optimal coasting point and the optimal cruising speed given the time from the timetable. The model has been applied on the section Utrecht Central – Rhenen for sprinter train series 7400. The results of this research show that there are yearly energy savings possible of almost 8 ̆ 0 26. 400 if the <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> strategy is used instead of the UZI (‘Universeel Zuinig rijden Idee’) method of NS Reizigers. Moreover the results show that using a uniform distribution of the running time supplements leads to extra energy savings and an improvement for the punctuality compared to the method of tightening the timetable. Tightening the timetable means that the running time supplements are placed as much as possible short before stations where the punctuality is measured. These yearly extra savings which are possible by the uniform distribution instead of the current slack time are almost 8 ̆ 0 44. 000 for the <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> strategy and are almost 8 ̆ 0 27. 500 for the UZI method on the total section.

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} behaviours {{are gradually}} becoming better-understood. However, {{there is still}} a deficit in terms of knowledge of individuals’ energy-use behaviours in organisations, despite a variety of available theories. This paper addresses this need in three main stages, based on a survey among mid-level managers at a major infrastructure operator in Great Britain. Firstly, a principal components analysis is performed to identify key determinant constructs <b>driving</b> <b>energy-efficient</b> behaviours in organisations, revealing the importance of perceived benefit to the organisation and flexibility of existing performance goals and targets. Secondly, cluster analysis is undertaken, in an effort to identify differences in behavioural influences between demographic groups. These clusters highlight the heterogeneity of employee populations’ energy behaviours, demonstrating that assumptions cannot be made about these based on single responses to cross-industry surveys. Finally, a structural equation model of individuals’ energy use intentions and behaviours using the newly-identified constructs is developed, revealing some similarities with existing behavioural frameworks such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour (Ajzen, 1991). Implications for policymakers are then discussed, in terms of encouraging individual employees’ curtailment of energy consumption in organisations through tailored engagement programmes...|$|R
40|$|Saving {{energy and}} {{protecting}} the environment became fundamental for society and politics, why several laws were enacted to increase the energy-efficiency. Furthermore, {{the growing number of}} vehicles and drivers leaded to more accidents and fatalities on the roads, why road safety became an important factor as well. Due to the increasing importance of energy-efficiency and safety, car manufacturers started to optimise the vehicle in terms of energy-effciency and safety. However, energy-efficiency and road safety can be also increased by adapting the driving behaviour to the given driving situation. This thesis presents a concept of an adaptive and rule based driving system that tries to educate the driver in <b>energy-efficient</b> and safe <b>driving</b> by showing recommendations on time. Unlike existing driving-systems, the presented driving system considers energy-efficiency and safety relevant driving rules, the individual driving behaviour and the driver condition. This allows to avoid the distraction of the driver and to increase the acceptance of the driving system, while improving the driving behaviour in terms of energy-efficiency and safety. A prototype of the driving system was developed and evaluated. The evaluation was done on a driving simulator using 42 test drivers, who tested the effect of the driving system on the driving behaviour and the effect of the adaptiveness of the driving system on the user acceptance. It has been proven during the evaluation that the energy-efficiency and safety can be increased, when the driving system was used. Furthermore, it has been proven that the user acceptance of the driving system increases when the adaptive feature was turned on. A high user acceptance of the driving system allows a steady usage of the driving system and, thus, a steady improvement of the driving behaviour in terms of energy-efficiency and safety...|$|R
40|$|Eco-driving {{consists}} of using <b>energy-efficient</b> approaches to <b>driving</b> {{aimed at reducing}} fuel consumption and, ultimately, CO 2 emissions. A previous study found that an EcoDrive informational campaign was effective at increasing the use of eco-driving behaviors, but only when employees perceived that their supervisor supported the program {{and when they were}} personally motivated to perform the eco-driving behaviors. In order to build upon the findings of our previous study, the present study focused on increasing the use of eco-driving behaviors through an informational eco-driving campaign combined with supervisor training to support the use of eco-driving practices. In this study we collected baseline measures of driving knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors from employees at three organizations, as well as follow-up data collected at two months (Time 2) and six months post-intervention (Time 3). Implementing a quasi-experimental design with a control group (informational campaign only) and an experimental group (informational campaign combined with supervisor training), we tested the incremental effectiveness of supervisor training compared to the effect of an informational campaign alone. In total, 19 supervisors received supervisor training (supervisor training group) and 10 supervisors were provided with the informational campaign materials only (control group). We collected data from 144 unique participants across the three time points, and of these responses we were able to match responses for 50 participants from Time 1 to Time 2 and 48 from Time 1 to Time 3. We were also able to match responses from 38 participants across all three time points; however, because our interest was in change from baseline, and in order to increase our statistical power, analyses were conducted comparing Time 1 to Time 2 and Time 1 to Time 3 data. We assessed changes in self-reported knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors using mixed method ANOVAs to assess the within-person change across time points and compare the effectiveness of the intervention between the control and supervisor training groups. We found that, in general, participants reported using eco-driving behaviors more often in the follow-up surveys compared to baseline measures. However, we did not find direct support for the supervisor training intervention providing an incremental increase in eco-driving behaviors and attitudes compared to the informational campaign alone. On the other hand, we did find that supervisor support, frequency of communication about eco-driving, and the percentage of employees who viewed the EcoDrive materials were greater in the supervisor training group compared to the control group. Additionally, employees in the supervisor training group rated the EcoDrive materials as more useful compared to the control group. Based on these findings, the supervisor training seemed to be effective in improving indicators of supervisor support; however, it may be that our limited sample size did not allow us to find statistically {{significant differences between the two}} groups in eco-driving behaviors. In this report we discuss in more detail the basis for this study, the implementation of the intervention, the results, and potential explanations for our findings in order to inform future studies. We also provide a detailed account of the methodology used in this study...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{consumption}} of trains is highly efficient {{due to the}} low friction between steel wheels and rails, although the efficiency is also influenced largely by the driving strategy applied and the scheduled running times in the timetable. Optimal <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> strategies can reduce operating costs significantly and contribute to a further increase of the sustainability of railway transportation. The railway sector hence shows an increasing interest in efficient algorithms for energy-efficient train control, {{which could be used}} in real-time Driver Advisory Systems (DAS) or Automatic Train Operation (ATO) systems. This paper gives an extensive literature review on energy-efficient train control (EETC) and the related topic of energy-efficient train timetabling (EETT), from the first simple models from the 1960 s of a train running on a level track to the advanced models and algorithms of the last decade dealing with varying gradients and speed limits, and including regenerative braking.

Both issues lead to increased computational effort. The length of the prediction horizon is usually large and the problem of unknown future movement of other traffic participants usually requires frequent replanning. This work proposes a novel motion planning approach for vehicles operating in dynamic environments. The above-mentioned problems are addressed by splitting the planning into a strategic planning part and situation-dependent replanning part. Strategic planning is done without considering other dynamic participants and is reused later in order to lower the computational effort during replanning phase...|$|E

30|$|However, {{according}} to the literature, the above-mentioned techniques can be applied separately by addressing individually the design of <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> profiles [263, 264] and the optimisation of operational times within the timetable [265, 266] or, more frequently, in an integrated framework. In this context, [267] proposed a train control approach, based on an optimisation model, which combines energy-efficient timetables and speed profiles. In particular, the procedure is characterised by a dynamic layout, since it provides a dynamic adjustment of the cycle time {{on the basis of}} travel demand changes, in order to minimise energy consumption. Moreover, a linear approximation method is implemented with the aim of dealing with a convex optimisation problem, whose resolution is performed by means of Kuhn–Tucker conditions. Moreover, [268] developed a nested optimisation framework in which, starting from the planned total running time, energy-efficient speed profiles are derived: the optimal cruising speed is defined by means of the outer loop of the Fibonacci algorithm [269, 270], while, in the inner loop, the bisection method computes, for the given cruising speed, the optimal switching points of the coasting phase. In addition, different distributions of running time supplements are tested and compared in terms of service punctuality and energy consumption. Furthermore, [271] devised a simulation-based optimisation procedure in which the simulation model provides the most <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> profile, computing energy consumption Pareto curves for each stretch, and the optimisation tool allocates the total running reserve time available in the most efficient way among the different stretches. The proposed simulation technique deals with a manual driving mode and specifically allows a large variety of manual driving strategies to be performed by combining different sections of holding speed with different coasting windows. Finally, [272] enriched the common optimisation framework, which combined energy control strategies with a suitable design of operational times, by performing the estimation of dwell times at stations {{as a function of the}} number of passengers involved in the boarding/alighting process. By considering dwell time as a flow-dependent factor, rather than a fixed value, a more realistic computation of dwell time itself can clearly be carried out. Yet most importantly, dwell time margin, which plays a key role within the implementation of energy-saving strategies, can be derived with a high degree of accuracy. It is worth noting that both manual [273, 274, 275] and automatic [276, 277, 278] driving systems have been investigated in the literature.|$|E

However, while these technologies exist, they may remain unimplemented for many reasons, including a lack of capital preventing their purchase/lack of subsidies to enable retrofitting, {{and a lack of}} awareness/full understanding of the technology. Most urban rail systems use direct current (DC) traction, via a catenary or third rail, with examples of AC traction being a relatively new phenomenon (i.e. S-Bahn Systems in Germany, Delhi Metro). DC systems are commonly used for small, dense rail networks with many trains as transformers and rectifiers are lineside rather than on-board, enabling lightweight rolling stock compared to AC systems, where such equipment is located onboard. However, AC systems exhibit lower losses in the power supply system (due to higher voltages) and are able to recover regenerative braking energy much simpler than in DC systems. As such, different strategies need to be applied. Further technologies to aid energy efficiency improvements in urban rail systems include <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving,</b> reducing power supply losses, lightweighting rolling stock, improving the energy efficiency of HVAC/lighting and those that lower the energy consumed whilst stabled.

Researchers have been studying the planning of velocity trajectories, a simpler form of motion planning, for over a decade now and many different methods are available. Dynamic programming has shown to be the most common choice due to its numerical background and ability to include nonlinear constraints and models. Although planning of optimal trajectory is done in a systematic way, dynamic programming doesn't use any knowledge about the considered problem to guide the exploration and therefore explores all possible trajectories. A* is an algorithm which enables using knowledge about the problem to guide the exploration to the most promising solutions first. Knowledge has to be represented in a form of a heuristic function, which gives an optimistic estimate of cost for transitioning between two states, which is not a straightforward task. This paper presents a novel heuristics incorporating air drag and auxiliary power as well as operational costs of the vehicle, besides kinetic and potential energy and rolling resistance known in the literature. Furthermore, optimal cruising velocity, which depends on vehicle aerodynamic properties and auxiliary power, is derived.

40|$|AbstractEco-driving {{is a way}} {{to drive}} that allow to use less fuel. To be eco-driver you need to follow a set of simple rules such as: {{upshifting}} to avoid engine speeds over 2500 rpm, keep steady vehicle speed, anticipating traffic, accelerating and decelerating smoothly, and avoiding long idles. The promotion of an <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> style is a measure that can have an important impact on fuel consumption. The eco-driving behaviour varies the attitude in setting speed and distance to the preceding vehicles. Speed and distance are parameters that influence, at the macroscopic level, the speed and density of traffic. To assess measure's impact at road network level we need to simulate, first the microscopic level movement of vehicles and then scale up in a suitable way the result to the macroscopic level. A suitable software platform has been developed using and enhancing the models adopted in the existing commercial tools in order to simulate traffic with drivers having different behaviour such as eco driver. The results shows that different behaviour, which imply different law for interaction between vehicle, can have different impact on emission when not a single vehicle is considered but the traffic on a real road network. Results show that Eco drive has more impact in free and normal traffic condition, but could be not useful when traffic condition is congested...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{or energy}} savings of 10 % or {{more can be}} {{achieved}} by providing train drivers with information on <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving</b> strategies. The Energymiser system uses optimal control theory to calculate a control strategy which minimises the mechanical work done by the traction system to move a train from its current location and speed to the next scheduled stop. The calculation takes into account the required arrival time at the next stop as well as train performance parameters and track gradients, curves and speed limits. The optimal speed and control profile is displayed to the driver in the cab. When a train is delayed, it is more efficient, where possible, to recover the delay gradually over the entire remainder of the journey than to recover quickly. However, the delayed train will often interact with other trains, causing further delays to propagate through the system and thereby impacting on the energy-efficiency of many trains. When the delays are sufficiently small, the interaction locations and sequence of interactions do not change. We demonstrate a numerical optimisation algorithm to find a set of interaction times that allows each affected train to finish on time wherever possible and that minimises total energy consumption for the whole set of trains. The new interaction times can be transmitted to Energymiser units on each of the trains, which will then calculate new optimal driving strategies to meet these times. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis investigates {{a method}} to save energy and thus also extend the range of a series-production battery {{electric}} vehicle by influencing the driving style automatically {{with the help of}} a of a cruise controller. An exploration of existing methods shows that the contextual consideration of the current and upcoming driving situation is necessary to realise safe and <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>driving.</b> This limits the appropriate approaches to online methods using updated predictions of the vehicle behaviour. It turns out that the most suitable method for the intended purpose is model-predictive control (MPC). The MPC generates controls for the accelerator pedal of the vehicle based on optimised predictions of the vehicle motion and energy consumption subject to the current and future road slope, curvature, speed limits and distance to an eventually preceding vehicle. The non-linear nature of the vehicle dynamics generally necessitates the use of a non-linear prediction model and solving a non-linear optimisation which goes along with difficulties in the online real-time implementation. However in this work - by exploiting and extending the tool sets of classical MPC - a controller based on a quadratic optimal control problem with linear constraints can be formulated that approximates the nonlinearities of the plant dynamics with equivalent accuracy as a non-linear formulation. A linear prediction model of the vehicle motion is derived by a change of the model domain from time to position and a change of variables to predict the kinetic energy of the moving vehicle instead of the driving speed. Further, a convex piece-wise linear energy consumption model is included in the inequality constraints of the problem according to the methodology of separable programming to capture the consumption characteristics of the vehicle in different operating points. In this form, real-time capability and the energy-saving potential of the presented control approach can be demonstrated by simulations of the closed loop and by implementing the controller for driving experiments. A Smart ED series-production battery electric vehicle is chosen for the practical tests and all models and parameters are identified and adapted to the characteristics of the car. In this application case, a significant energy-saving potential could be demonstrated compared to human drivers. To further reduce the computational burden and speed up the computation, the so-called move blocking method for input parameterisation of the MPC control trajectory is investigated and extended within this work to a flexible move blocking approach which enables a fast computation and at the same time high tracking performance...|$|E
