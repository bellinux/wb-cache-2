Simpson also said {{that she did not}} want to meet with Jessica's record label (Columbia) because she wanted to be signed because of her music, rather than her sister. She eventually signed with Geffen in 2003. As for her role as co-writer of the songs, Simpson has said that she had a lot of input lyrically: [...] "...I come up with the whole concept of the song. To me, writing is a very important thing. It's what I've always <b>done</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I've always loved to do, and it was a big part of my wanting to do a record. So my label was amazing because they really let me have my hands in there. I got to write a lot." [...] Simpson said of making the album: [...] "It's a lot of work. From finding the right label to the actual recording, it took about nine months, then it was followed by the publicity work." [...] In an extensive list of thank-yous in the album's liner notes, Simpson includes Benji and Joel Madden of the band Good Charlotte, with whom she worked on the song [...] "Harder Everyday," [...] which was released as an international bonus track.|$|E

Adam stole Sharon's newborn baby, Faith, and gave her to Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson)whom he caused to have a miscarriage and a phantom pregnancy. Despite knowing this and seeing Sharon grieve, Adam bonded with her out of guilt; however, they fell in love and married. Muhney told SoapNet that Adam [...] "unequivocally loves her 100%", and [...] said, [...] "You can argue as much logic as you want about what Adam has <b>done</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> he is doing." [...] Sharon remained in love with Adam after his kidnapping of Faith was revealed. The soap's other characters, who viewed him as a criminal, were displeased with the romance. Case described Sharon's ability to forgive Adam as a [...] "tough pill to swallow", and also compared it to Nick's love for Phylliswho had [...] "blown people up and ran people over". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it described Adam and Sharon's relationship as [...] "inappropriate" [...] yet [...] "red-hot". Several of Sharon's friends, including her ex-husband Jack, disowned her because of the relationship. After Sharon's conviction for the murder of Adam's ex-wife Skye, she escaped after being sentenced to life imprisonment. During this storyline, Case still supported the coupledubbed [...] "Shadam" [...] by viewerssaying that the pairing [...] "took us all by surprise".
