5|$|A {{tropical}} {{wave that}} {{had reached the}} Eastern Pacific from Africa was first spotted on July 23. The wave continued westward with little development occurring until August 3, when convection increased. After additional slow organization, the wave was classified as Tropical Depression Seven-E on August 6 near the tip of Baja California. The system did not strengthen much, and development was halted when wind shear destroyed the system on August 8. The depression never came near land and hence no one was killed or injured. Like Tropical Depression Three-E, this cyclone was forecast to reach tropical storm intensity, but <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
5|$|Admiral Nimitz {{recommended}} to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development {{and control of}} the base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward to include the Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could not be changed without the consent of the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility {{for the development of the}} base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18May 1944. It was proposed control would ultimately pass to SOPAC but <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
25|$|What {{remained}} of the fort was dismantled in 1915. It {{was seen as a}} crumbling eyesore next to the Alberta Legislature Building, which had been completed three years earlier. The Government of Alberta indicated at the time that it would use the old fort's timbers to create a heritage site elsewhere in the city, but <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

25|$|Early {{transportation}} to Newport had relied mainly on rail, with trains from Albany arriving at Yaquina City, where passengers could board a ferryboat to Yaquina Bay. Optimism for Newport's early growth {{was based on}} the expectation that the railway would eventually reach Newport. <b>It</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> In 1928, the Southern Pacific Railroad stopped service to Yaquina City. This may have put a temporary damper on the tourist business, but by 1930 highway projects were underway that would make the area more accessible than ever.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of these {{initiatives}} northeastern Florida prospered economically in a way <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> under Spanish administration. Furthermore, the British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This would be the first introduction of much of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today including trial by jury, habeas corpus and county-based government. Neither East Florida nor West Florida would send any representatives to Philadelphia to draft the Declaration of Independence. Florida would remain a Loyalist stronghold {{for the duration of the}} American Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconnaissance}} {{version of}} the Vigilante, the RA-5C, had slightly greater wing area and added a long canoe-shaped fairing under the fuselage for a multi-sensor reconnaissance pack. This added an APD-7 side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), AAS-21 infrared line scanner, and camera packs, as well as improved ECM. An AN/ALQ-61 electronic intelligence system could also be carried. The RA-5C retained the AN/ASB-12 bombing system, and could, in theory, carry weapons, although <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> in service. Later-build RA-5Cs had more powerful J79-10 engines with afterburning thrust of 17,900lbf (80kN). The reconnaissance Vigilante weighed almost five tons more than the strike version with almost the same thrust and an only modestly enlarged wing. These changes cost it acceleration and climb rate, though it remained fast in level flight.|$|E

500|$|Although Coppola {{enjoyed his}} working {{relationship}} with Lucas, he commented in a July 1988 The New York Times interview with Robert Lindsey that [...] "I think it's a good movie - it's eccentric, a little wacky, like the Tucker car - but it's not the movie I would have made {{at the height of}} my power."

500|$|It was a {{journalist}} on a motorbike {{who managed to}} get up to me. He was shouting 'Not that way! Not that way!' And I turned round in the road and I rode back beneath the outside wall of the grandstand and I saw a gateway that went into the track, a gateway for journalists. And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about <b>it.</b> <b>Never</b> <b>did.</b> Why should I? ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite royal {{patronage}} and encouragement, {{there was}} never any overt mandate to use the new translation. It was not until 1661 that the Authorized Version replaced the Bishops Bible in the Epistle and Gospel lessons of the Book of Common Prayer, and <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>did</b> replace the older translation in the Psalter. In 1763 The Critical Review complained that [...] "many false interpretations, ambiguous phrases, obsolete words and indelicate expressions...excite the derision of the scorner". Blayney's 1769 version, with its revised spelling and punctuation, helped change the public perception of the Authorized Version to a masterpiece of the English language. By the 19th century, F. W. Faber could say of the translation, [...] "It lives on the ear, like music that can never be forgotten, like the sound of church bells, which the convert hardly knows how he can forego." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marc Hogan of Spin {{felt the}} mixed {{influences}} didn’t work in Swift’s favor: “A glossy soft rocker with a stomping four-on-the-floor beat, back-porch twang, adult-contemporary orchestration, and Top 40-ready electronic vocal effects, it covers a bizarre number of bases. And the key lyric compares her lost love, mourned here {{as an object}} of desire but not kissed off as one of the usual jerks, to ‘driving a new Maserati down a dead end street,’ like Swift is about to brawl with Rick Ross.” [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly, joked, saying: [...] "Those are the only colors the song — which Swift says is all about 'intense emotion' — brings up, which kind of let me down. (...) I’m being serious — I kept waiting for some other hue to pop up, and <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>did.(...</b> And then, said: [...] "Lyrically, (...) [...] lines (...) lack the crisp, powerful punch that Swift usually delivers. And in a song all about the vividness of feelings, they paint a rather blurry portrait. (...) Where is the drama, the sexiness, the freefall of passion? The poppy production white-washes over all that. That doesn’t mean this is a bad song, just maybe an underwhelming one." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1763, Spain traded Florida to the Kingdom of Great Britain {{for control}} of Havana, Cuba, which had been {{captured}} by the British during the Seven Years' War. It {{was part of a}} large expansion of British territory following the country's victory in the Seven Years' War. Almost the entire Spanish population left, taking along most of the remaining indigenous population to Cuba. The British divided the territory into East Florida and West Florida. The British soon constructed the King's Road connecting St. Augustine to Georgia. The road crossed the St. Johns River at a narrow point, which the Seminole called Wacca Pilatka and the British named [...] "Cow Ford", both names ostensibly reflecting the fact that cattle were brought across the river there. [...] The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the French and Indian War in order to encourage settlement. In order to induce settlers to move to the two new colonies reports of the natural wealth of Florida were published in England.
