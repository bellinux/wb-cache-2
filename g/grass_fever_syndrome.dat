40|$|Fever {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{symptoms}} leading to medical evaluation. Not only infections cause fever but also inflammatory disorders. To distinguish one from another, a thorough medical history and clinical evaluation are needed. Sometimes, only the clinical course will reveal the diagnosis. PFAPA-Syndrome (periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis) is the most frequent periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> in Switzerland. No diagnostic test is available to support the diagnosis. Some important diseases have to be ruled out, such as Immunodeficiency, cyclic neutropenia, chronic viral infections and rheumatologic disorders. To know the diagnosis of the PFAPA-Syndrome can help avoiding antibiotic courses for febrile episodes in infants. There is a clinical overlap to hereditary periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes</b> as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), Hyper-IgD and <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HIDS), Tumor-necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and others, in which a genetic basis for the disease has already been found...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Amyloid A (AA) {{amyloidosis}} is {{a severe}} complication of many chronic inflammatory disorders, including the hereditary periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes.</b> However, {{in one of}} these periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes,</b> the hyper IgD and periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome,</b> amyloidosis is rare despite vigorous, recurring inflammation. This he-reditary syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene coding for mevalonate kinase, an enzyme of the isopre-noid pathway. In this study, we used a cell culture sys-tem with human monocytes to show that inhibition of the isoprenoid pathway inhibits amyloidogenesis. Inhi-bition of the isoprenoid pathway by lovastatin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of amyloid formed [53 % at 10 M (P 0. 01) ] compared with mononuclear cells that are exposed only to serum AA. The inhibitory effects of lovastatin are reversible by addition of farne-sol but not geranylgeraniol. Farnesyl transferase inhibi-tion also inhibited amyloidogenesis. These results impli-cate that the isoprenoidmetabolism could be a potential target for prevention and treatment of AA amyloidosis...|$|R
40|$|Hereditary {{periodic}} <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{are characterized}} by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation with no known pathogenic or autoimmune cause. In humans, several genes have been implicated in this group of diseases, {{but the majority of}} cases remain unexplained. A similar periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> is relatively frequent in the Chinese Shar-Pei breed of dogs. In the western world, Shar-Pei have been strongly selected for a distinctive thick and heavily folded skin. In this study, a mutation affecting both these traits was identified. Using genome-wide SNP analysis of Shar-Pei and other breeds, the strongest signal of a breed-specific selective sweep was located on chromosome 13. The same region also harbored the strongest genome-wide association (GWA) signal for susceptibility to the periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (p(raw)  = 2. 3 × 10 ⁻⁶, p(genome)  = 0. 01). Dense targeted resequencing revealed two partially overlapping duplications, 14. 3 Kb and 16. 1 Kb in size, unique to Shar-Pei and upstream of the Hyaluronic Acid Synthase 2 (HAS 2) gene. HAS 2 encodes the rate-limiting enzyme synthesizing hyaluronan (HA), a major component of the skin. HA is up-regulated and accumulates in the thickened skin of Shar-Pei. A high copy number of the 16. 1 Kb duplication was associated with an increased expression of HAS 2 as well as the periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (p < 0. 0001). When fragmented, HA can act as a trigger of the innate immune system and stimulate sterile fever and inflammation. The strong selection for the skin phenotype therefore appears to enrich for a pleiotropic mutation predisposing these dogs to a periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The identification of HA as a major risk factor for this canine disease raises the potential of this glycosaminoglycan as a risk factor for human periodic fevers and as an important driver of chronic inflammation...|$|R

40|$|Hereditary {{periodic}} <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{comprise a}} group of distinct disease entities linked by the defining feature of recurrent febrile episodes. Hyper IgD with periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HIDS) is caused by mutations in the mevalonate kinase (MVK) gene.

Mutations of the TNFRSF 1 A gene may also cause periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TRAPS). Treatment with the TNFR-Fc fusion protein, etanercept, is effective in some patients with TRAPS, but its clinical usefulness in HIDS has not been reported. We describe a 3 -year-old boy in whom genetic screening revealed a rare combination of two MVK mutations producing clinical HIDS as well as a TNFRSF 1 A P 46 L valiant present in about 1 % of the population.

40|$|Abstract Objective To {{analyze the}} {{prevalence}} of diagnosed and suspected autoinflammatory diseases in Eastern and Central European (ECE) countries, with a particular interest on the diagnostic facilities in these countries. Methods Two different strategies were used {{to collect data on}} patients with periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes</b> from ECE countries- the Eurofever survey and collection of data with the structured questionnaire. Results Data from 35 centers in 14 ECE countries were collected. All together there were 11 patients reported with genetically confirmed familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), 14 with mevalonate-kinase deficiency (MKD), 11 with tumor necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) and 4 with chronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA). Significantly higher numbers were reported for suspected cases which were not genetically tested. All together there were 49 suspected FMF patients reported, 24 MKD, 16 TRAPS, 7 CINCA and 2 suspected Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) patients. Conclusions The number of genetically confirmed patients with periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes</b> in ECE countries is very low. In order to identify more patients in the future, it is important to organize educational programs for increasing the knowledge on these diseases and to establish a network for genetic testing of periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes</b> in ECE countries. </p...|$|R

40|$|Muckle - Wells {{syndrome}} (MWS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal dominant}} disease that belongs {{to a group of}} hereditary periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes.</b> It is part of the wider spectrum of the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) which has only rarely been described in non-Caucasian individuals. It is characterized by recurrent self-limiting episodes of fever, urticaria, arthralgia, myalgia and conjunctivitis from childhood. Progressive sensorineural hearing loss and amyloidosis are two late complications. MWS is caused by gain of function mutations in the NLRP 3 gene, which encodes cryopyrin, a protein involved in regulating the production of proinflammatory cytokines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and {{periodic}} <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> is a hereditary periodic fever, {{caused by}} deficiency of the enzyme mevalonate kinase. It {{is unclear how}} this defect leads to recurrent fever episodes. AIM: To assess the involvement of cysteinyl leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of fever attacks as reflected by urinary leukotriene E(4) (LTE(4)) excretion. METHODS: Urinary LTE(4) was measured in seven patients while febrile and afebrile. RESULTS: LTE(4) was raised during fever in all subjects (46 - 199 nmol/mol creatinine, mean 92; normal < 40). Urinary LTE(4) was normal between attacks, {{as well as in}} normal children with fever as a result of miscellaneous causes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that cysteinyl leukotrienes {{play a role in the}} pathophysiology of this disorder. As no effective treatment is yet available, leukotriene receptor antagonists might offer a new therapeutic approach for patients with the hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R

40|$|Autoinflammatory {{diseases}} (AID) {{are characterized}} by seemingly unprovoked self-limited attacks of fever and systemic inflammation potentially leading to amyloidosis. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) {{is the most common}} AID and therefore the most studied. Besides FMF, the other main hereditary AID are tumor necrosis factor-associated periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (TRAPS), mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), and cryopyrin-associated periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (CAPS). These hereditary diseases result from a mutant gene that is involved in the regulation of inflammation, resulting in a characteristic clinical phenotype. The differential diagnosis of AID can be challenging due to a wide overlap in clinical manifestations. Moreover, a considerable proportion of patients present with autoinflammatory symptoms but without a pathogenetic variant on genetic analysis. Furthermore, non-hereditary AID, such as the periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome, which is the most common AID in children worldwide, must be excluded in certain circumstances.

40|$|Hereditary {{periodic}} <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{are characterized}} by incapacitating attacks of fever and generalized inflammation. While the mutated genes for the major syndromes in this group are known, the pathogenesis remains unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate apoptosis in patients with periodic fever as a possible pathogenic factor. We measured anisomycin-induced apoptosis with annexin-V flow cytometry and caspase- 3 / 7 activity in peripheral-blood lymphocytes from symptom-free patients with hyper-IgD and periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HIDS; n = 10), TNF-receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS; n = 7), and familial Mediterranean fever (FMF; n = 2). HIDS lymphocytes showed a decreased percentage of apoptosis during remission by both methods compared with controls (17. 8 % vs 55. 4 %), whereas no difference was observed in TRAPS or FMF lymphocytes. This defective apoptosis of lymphocytes may be a central pathogenic mechanism in HIDS, since dysfunction of one of the inhibitory mechanisms to curtail the immunologic response could cause an unbridled generalized inflammation after a trivial stimulus...|$|R
40|$|Hereditary {{periodic}} <b>fever</b> <b>syndromes</b> {{are defined}} by recurrent attacks of generalised inflammation for which no infectious or auto-immune cause can be identified. For most of these disorders, the molecular basis has recently been elucidated. This has opened the prospect of novel therapeutic approaches. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene. Pathogenesis is poorly understood. The clinical severity is in part related to the mutations involved. Tumour necrosis factor receptor- 1 -associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS) is caused by mutations in the TNFRSF 1 A gene. This results in decreased serum levels soluble TNF-receptor leading to inflammation due to unopposed TNF-alpha action. Results of treatment with recombinant TNF-receptor analogues are promising. The hyper IgD periodic <b>fever</b> <b>syndrome</b> (HIDS) is caused by mutations in the MVK gene. leading to mevalonate kinase deficiency. The pathogenesis remains unclear. Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) and familial cold urticaria (FCU) are probably allelic disorders. The gene has been located, but not identified. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
