5|$|According {{to local}} legend, the Holman Clavel Inn {{is the home}} of a <b>hearth</b> spirit called Chimbley Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{used in the}} ISP have a {{more intense}} operation than standard lead blast furnaces, with higher air blast rates per m2 of <b>hearth</b> area and a higher coke consumption.|$|E
5|$|Hearths and oblong shaped ovens {{were found}} in a semicircular hut. The white colour of the soil around the <b>hearth</b> and the ovens found at the site pointed to animal meat roasted in the ovens, likely for {{community}} feeding. Rice was a staple food. Mud boundary walls of houses were traced. Burnt chunks of clay with reed or bamboo impressions suggest that houses were destroyed by fire. Houses were larger in size in the Chalcolithic period compared to the Neolithic period, made of reeds and bamboo with mud plaster and flooring of fired earth. A circular <b>hearth</b> and a few post-holes were also found.|$|E
50|$|Most of the <b>hearths</b> found, {{along with}} the tripod, were {{associated}} with the habitation structure, which was the largest feature of the site. The tripod that was discovered was not related to any of the <b>hearths</b> so the archeologists speculate that instead of being used for cooking this was used as a type of backrest like those used by historic aboriginal populations. The two pits discovered were not thought to be used for fire. One appeared to be a storage pit and the other an ash pit. 18 <b>hearths</b> were found on many different levels showing different occupations of humans. The <b>hearths</b> consisted of surface <b>hearths</b> and basin <b>hearths,</b> basin <b>hearths</b> being the most common and also the most sophisticated.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the chronological setting of <b>hearths</b> registered in FMIS (digital register containing records of all known ancient monuments in Sweden) in the provinces of Västerbotten and Norrbotten, Northern Sweden. A total of c. 1500 <b>hearths</b> are known in the area, mainly situated north of the river Skellefteälven. Within a study area of 107 x 94 km, 32 <b>hearths</b> were randomly selected for excavation, each site embracing 1 - 14 <b>hearths.</b> The sites were scanned using a metal detector and nearly all artifacts found were from the period AD 1600 - 1900. 14 C-datings of charcoal and burned bones corroborated that most <b>hearths</b> were used during this period, with a large number dating to the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Many <b>hearths</b> contained bones from mature reindeer, indicating that the <b>hearths</b> were related to reindeer herding. We suggest that most <b>hearths</b> are related to nomadic Sami reindeer herders using coastal areas for winter pasture, possibly resulting from the breakdown of the “lappskatteland” (taxation lands) system and an increase in reindeer numbers...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "A <b>Hearth's</b> Warming Tail", as Ponyville {{gets ready}} to {{celebrate}} <b>Hearth's</b> Warming (the series' lore equivalent to Christmas) in Twilight Sparkle (Tara Strong)'s castle, Starlight Glimmer (Kelly Sheridan) prefers {{not to be a}} part of the festivities. To convince her of the importance of <b>Hearth's</b> Warming, Twilight tells her and Spike (Cathy Weseluck) the tale of Snowfall Frost, a cold-hearted unicorn who despises <b>Hearth's</b> Warming and swears to erase it with her magic.|$|R
5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred <b>hearth</b> fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell in the domestic <b>hearth</b> was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E
5|$|A {{rich source}} of Late Paleolithic sites and {{artifacts}} (the Magdalenian culture of 14,500 BCE) is the Prądnik River Valley. The Maszycka Cave there contained {{the remains of a}} typical (at that time) social unit of several families, 20-30 people, as well as numerous tools and other artifacts of their culture, including ornamented bone utensils. Remnants of a 15,000 to 17,000 years old Magdalenian culture dwelling (a dugout cabin site with traces of supporting posts, a <b>hearth</b> and imported materials) were discovered recently in Ćmielów, Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski County.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} {{have been used for}} this, including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open <b>hearth</b> furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} of five <b>hearths</b> and reddened earth in the Escale Cave. These <b>hearths</b> have been dated to 200,000 BP.|$|R

5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a <b>hearth</b> of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{returned}} to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised {{on the success of}} the book by publishing other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the <b>Hearth</b> (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.|$|E
5|$|Finery forge: In {{addition}} to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in Chinese cupola furnaces, the ancient Chinese also created wrought iron {{by using the}} finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo. Pigott speculates that the finery forge existed in the previous Warring States period (403–221 BC), {{due to the fact}} that there are wrought iron items from China dating to that period and there is no documented evidence of the bloomery ever being used in China. The fining process involved liquifying cast iron in a fining <b>hearth</b> and removing carbon from the molten cast iron through oxidation. Wagner writes that in {{addition to}} the Han Dynasty hearths believed to be fining hearths, there is also pictoral evidence of the fining <b>hearth</b> from a Shandong tomb mural dated 1st to 2nd century AD, as well as a hint of written evidence in the 4th century AD Daoist text Taiping Jing.|$|E
25|$|Paleolithic campsites were {{dotted with}} {{external}} fire pits and internal <b>hearths.</b> The internal <b>hearths</b> were not open-burning fires, but were hollow areas that held heated stones and charcoal.|$|R
50|$|In that year, 7 <b>hearths</b> were counted. For 1562, the County of Diez service {{register}} names 7 names (families) for Wörsdorf. A year later there were 8 <b>hearths.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tax fell {{most heavily}} {{on those who}} {{occupied}} the houses with {{the greatest number of}} <b>hearths.</b> For instance, in 1673-4 the Earl of Exeter had to pay for 70 <b>hearths</b> at Burghley House. In contrast, most householders who were liable to pay tax had only one or two <b>hearths</b> and a significant proportion of householders were not liable to pay at all.|$|R
5|$|Potbelly sculptures {{have been}} {{interpreted}} {{in a variety}} of manners. Investigators have theorised that potbelly sculptures represent dead ancestors. Alternatively, they have been associated with babies or with the poorly understood Fat God of Mesoamerican mythology. Potbelly monuments have also been associated with a group of supernatural entities associated with the domestic <b>hearth.</b> A further interpretation, based on the sculpture found at Teopán in western El Salvador, interprets potbelly figures as pregnant women at full term, possibly in the very act of giving birth.|$|E
5|$|The Barnhouse Settlement is {{a cluster}} of at least fifteen buildings, {{including}} one {{that may have been}} used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central <b>hearth,</b> recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and stone tools have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran.|$|E
5|$|The English Parliament granted him {{an annual}} income {{to run the}} {{government}} of £1.2million, generated largely from customs and excise duties. The grant, however, proved to be insufficient for most of Charles's reign. For the most part, the actual revenue was much lower, which led to attempts to economise at court by reducing the size and expenses of the royal household and raise money through unpopular innovations such as the <b>hearth</b> tax.|$|E
50|$|In 1384 Roquemaure was the chef-lieu {{of one of}} the 13 vigueries in the sénéchaussée of Beaucaire and Nîmes. It was {{the site}} of a royal castle and a large collegiate church with 10 priests. In spite of this, the village itself was very small with only 5 <b>hearths.</b> Within the Roquemaure viguerie Lirac had 3 <b>hearths,</b> Tavel 5, Saint-Geniès-de-Comolas 13 and Saint-Laurent-des-Arbres 30. Bagnols-sur-Cèze was the chef-lieu of a {{neighbouring}} viguerie and had 115 <b>hearths.</b> Four centuries later in 1789, {{on the eve of the}} French Revolution, Roquemaure had 929 <b>hearths</b> and was similar in size to Bagnol which had 1085.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{designs for the}} Russian oven. For example, there is a variant with two <b>hearths</b> (one of the <b>hearths</b> is used mainly for fast cooking, the other mainly for heating in winter).|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Elk Ridge {{was the site}} of {{numerous}} charcoal <b>hearths,</b> which produced charcoal for nearby iron furnaces from wood harvested on the mountain. More than 50 <b>hearths</b> were constructed between 1810 and 1840.|$|R
5|$|The {{location}} {{selected for}} the barrow had witnessed inhabitation during the preceding Mesolithic period, as evidenced by a nearby <b>hearth</b> and scatters of knapped flint tools. Built out of earth and local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus. Within {{the eastern end of}} the tumulus was a stone chamber, into which human remains were deposited, alongside sherds of pottery vessels.|$|E
5|$|Wrought iron: During the Han dynasty, new iron {{smelting}} processes led to {{the manufacture}} of new wrought iron implements for use in agriculture, such as the multi-tube seed drill and iron plough. In addition to accidental lumps of low-carbon wrought iron produced by excessive injected air in ancient Chinese cupola furnaces. The ancient Chinese created wrought iron by using the finery forge at least by the 2nd century BC, the earliest specimens of cast and pig iron fined into wrought iron and steel found at the early Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) site at Tieshengguo.

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the Concealed Shoe Index maintained by Northampton Museum, conducted by June Swann and published in 1996, reveals that the most common place of concealment is the chimney, fireplace or <b>hearth</b> (26.2 per cent), followed by under the floor or above the ceiling (22.9 per cent), and almost as many concealed in the roof. Shoes have also been found around doors and windows, under the stairs, and among the foundations. Concealed shoes have been discovered in many types of building: country cottages, town houses, manor houses, hospitals, workhouses, factories, public houses, and two Oxford colleges, St John's and Queen's. They have even been found in ecclesiastical buildings, including a Benedictine monastery in Germany and a Baptist church in Cheshire, England.|$|E
5000|$|Large rectangular-shaped pit-houses {{were used}} in Early Mumun. These pit-houses had one or more <b>hearths,</b> and pit-houses with up to 6 <b>hearths</b> {{indicate}} that such features were the living spaces for multiple generations of the same household.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hearths</b> are the {{smallest}} structure within SpiralScouts. They are generally {{one or two}} family groups that may meet separately {{as a result of}} lack of local interest or distance from larger circles. <b>Hearths</b> can also function as subdivisions within a circle to organize by age, small scale geography, or similar interests. Independent <b>hearths</b> can obtain the same recognition as a circle through the national organization to provide charter benefits to low-access areas.|$|R
50|$|The Lehner Mammoth {{kill and}} camp site {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} firsts: It was the first site associated with the Clovis culture to have definable fire <b>hearths.</b> These <b>hearths</b> provided the first radiocarbon dates for the culture (9,000 BCE).|$|R
5|$|Derby Place was {{situated}} in the parish of St Benedict and St Peter, south of St Paul's Cathedral, more or less on the College's present location. There are records of the heralds carrying out modifications {{to the structure of}} Derby Place over many years. However, little record of its appearance has survived, except the description that the buildings formed three sides of a quadrangle, entered through a gate with a portcullis on the west side. On the south range, roughly where Queen Victoria Street now stands, was a large hall on the western end. Derby Place's <b>hearth</b> tax bill from 1663, discovered in 2009 at the National Archives at Kew, showed that the building had about thirty-two rooms, which were the workplace as well as the home to eleven officers of arms.|$|E
5|$|In 1172, the new pope, Alexander III, further {{encouraged}} Henry {{to advance}} {{the integration of the}} Irish Church with Rome. Henry was authorised to impose a tithe of one penny per <b>hearth</b> as an annual contribution. This church levy, called Peter's Pence, is extant in Ireland as a voluntary donation. In turn, Henry accepted the title of Lord of Ireland which Henry conferred on his younger son, John Lackland, in 1185. This defined the Irish state as the Lordship of Ireland. When Henry's successor died unexpectedly in 1199, John inherited the crown of England and retained the Lordship of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the {{province}} of Trento, Italy provided sculpted wooden figures and animals as well as utensils to create depictions of daily life. The scene featured seventeen figures with nine depicting the Holy Family, the Magi, and the shepherds. The nine figures were originally donated by Saint Vincent Pallotti for the nativity at Rome's Church of Sant'Andrea della Valle in 1842 and eventually {{found their way to}} the Vatican. They are dressed anew each year for the scene. The 2008 scene was set in Bethlehem with a fountain and a <b>hearth</b> representing regeneration and light. The same year, the Paul VI Audience Hall exhibited a nativity designed by Mexican artists.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{pictures}} we have of medieval smoke canopies show them being used in kitchens. They usually appeared over <b>hearths</b> that were placed against stone walls. Some were over free standing <b>hearths,</b> but this required special venting of the smoke.|$|R

5000|$|The {{artifact}} {{concentration of}} the Carson-Conn-Short site and the Johnson site (40DV400) indicate that these sites may have been Paleoindian base camps, where the knapping of projectile points and other daily activities of hunter-gatherers took place. [...] Over 40 <b>hearths</b> were unearthed at the Carson-Conn-Short site, and many were found at the Johnson site as well. These <b>hearths</b> evidence the possibility of base camps proposed by Broster and Norton. At the Johnson site, these <b>hearths</b> date to around 11,700-11,980 B.P.|$|R
