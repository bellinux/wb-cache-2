Twenty-one players were asked to complete (a) an incremental test to determine maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max), the speed at the ventilatory threshold (vthr) and the energy cost of "linear" running (Cr) and (b) an <b>intermittent</b> <b>test</b> composed of 10 shuttle runs of 10 -second duration and 30 -seconds of recovery (total duration: about 6 minutes). The exercise intensity (the running speed, vi) was set at 130 % of vthr. During the intermittent tests, oxygen uptake (VO 2) and blood lactate concentration (Lab) were measured. The average pretraining VO 2 calculated for a single bout (131 Â± 9 ml Â· min(- 1) kg(- 1)) was about 2. 4 times greater than the subjects' measured VO 2 max (54. 7 Â± 4. 6 ml Â· min(- 1) Â· kg(- 1)). The net energy cost of running (9. 2 Â± 0. 9 J Â· m(- 1) Â· kg(- 1)) was about 2. 4 times higher than that measured at constant "linear" speed (3. 9 Â± 0. 3 J Â· m(- 1) Â· kg(- 1)).

This study investigated the influence of two intermittent exercise protocols, with equal mean muscle loading, on the mechanical and myoelectrical signs of fatigue in the elbow flexor muscles. DESIGN: Ten subjects performed two 20 -min long intermittent isometric elbow flexion tasks. The exercise period load for the low force <b>intermittent</b> <b>test</b> was 25 % of the maximum voluntary contraction, with a work-cycle time of 20 s and a duty cycle of 0. 5. The high force intermittent exercise protocol had an exercise period load of 50 % maximum voluntary contraction, a cycle time of 20 s and a duty cycle of 0. 25. METHODS: Muscle fatigue was quantified both by measuring the maximal voluntary contraction torque {{before and after the}} intermittent exercises, and also by the temporal changes observed in the electromyography signal. RESULTS: Both muscle-loading patterns induced a 15 % decrease in maximum voluntary contraction. However, the electromyographic spectral changes during the intermittent static contractions varied between the two protocols.

30|$|The {{inability}} to detect indicators of soccer performance has been hypothesized {{to result from}} fundamental differences between activity patterns in soccer and VO 2 max tests and, accordingly, the underlying physiology [17]. Of course, the nature of VO 2 max testing (straight treadmill running) does not replicate the activity pattern described in soccer match play, as linear running is not a soccer-specific activity [15]. A test is more reliable and effective when it is specific to the exercise patterns of that sport [59] {{and validity of the}} test depends on its ability to elicit similar physiological responses to the actual performance [19]. Indeed, the intermittent activity profile inherent in soccer elicits increased physiological strain [60] and often requires performance at intensities above those observed in VO 2 max testing [6, 7]. Studies adopting time-motion analyses underscored how the ability to perform repeated high intensity exercise (intermittently) is fundamental in elite soccer [39]. In support, Aziz [61] observed how measured VO 2 max may not be suitable to characterize soccer players’ intermittent endurance capacity, as performance (distance covered/speed) in a soccer-specific <b>intermittent</b> <b>test</b> had no relationship with either VO 2 max measured in the same test, as well as a standardized treadmill test nor with VO 2 max measured during a multi-stage shuttle run test.

40|$|Rock {{climbing}} is a multi-dimensional sport encompassing physiological, psychological, bio-mechanical {{and skill}} components. Interpretation of data in current investigations {{is limited by}} the lack of knowledge regarding the extent of the potential interaction of pre-climb anxieties with the physiological responses during an ascent. This thesis attempts to delineate the psychological and physiological contributions of on-sight top rope and lead climbing in multiple ability groups of rock climbers. Furthermore, the thesis goes on to gain an understanding of the de-oxygenation and re-oxygenation profiles in two forearm flexors during sustained and intermittent contractions-to-failure, as well as during the subsequent recovery period. In study one, intermediate, advanced and elite rock climbers were asked to on-sight a route {{at the top of their}} respective best self-reported on-sight grade. There were no ability group or ascent style differences for any pre-climb measures of anxiety. However, elite rock climbers had significantly higher oxygen consumption, heart rate (HR) and cortisol (physiological component) responses compared to lower ability groups. Furthermore, the elite climbers spent a significantly greater percentage of their static time resting during the ascent compared to all lower ability groups. As there appears to be no differences in the anxiety based interaction with the physiological response, study one suggests that ability group and ascent style differences may be attributed mainly to the changes in the physical demands of the route. Furthermore, it would appear the higher level rock climbers may have a greater reliance on the aerobic metabolism during an on-sight ascent. Study two investigated the haemodynamic responses to sustained and intermittent handgrip contractions which are seen during rock climbing ascents. Intermediate, advanced and elite climbers as well as a control group were asked to perform sustained and intermittent contractions (10 s) at 40 % of maximal volitional capacity until exhaustion. Oxygen saturation, blood flow (BF) and HR were measured pre, during and post contractions. Elite and advanced climbers were able to de-oxygenate both the flexor digitorum profundus and the flexor carpi radialis significantly more than the intermediate climbers, and the control group. During the <b>intermittent</b> <b>test</b> to failure, relative re-oxygenation during the rest period (3 s) (re-oxygenation which takes into account the amount of de-oxygenation during the previous contraction), may be an important determinant of the force time integral. During the <b>intermittent</b> <b>test,</b> the increase in Δ BF, release HR and Δ HR during the rest periods suggest that vessel occlusion in elite and advanced rock climbers may not be as prominant as previously speculated upon. Furthermore, elite rock climbers appear to have a significantly faster time to half recovery after both sustained and intermittent contractions-to-failure. In conclusion, it would appear that the psychological responses assessed pre on-sight rock climbing may not be different between ability groups or ascent styles. Instead, ability group differences may be due to physiological adaptations caused in part by the significantly greater amount of training. Furthermore, elite rock climbers appear to be able to de-oxygenate and re-oxygenate faster and to a greater extent than lower ability level climbers due to an increased Δ BF and Δ HR during intermittent rest periods, as well as post-exercise. Further investigation focusing on aerobic/anaerobic contribution, determination of capillary density and muscle fiber type would aid in gaining a greater understanding of rock climbing performance...|$|E
40|$|Backgrounds: The {{immune system}} {{changing}} affects the fitness. Exercise induces the immune responses, oxidative stress and tissue damage that alters leukocyte counts. Maltodextrin supplies higher energy reserves, that {{can improve the}} immune system profiles. Vitamin C as an antioxidant against tissue damage. Objective: This study aims to assess {{the effectiveness of a}} maltodextrin and vitamin C combination drink on leukocyte differential count after exercise. Method: This study was quasi-experimental with the within-subject design. Subjects were 14 collegiate football players of the State University of Yogyakarta and fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects were selected with a purposive sampling. Subjects received a combination of 15 % maltodextrin and 250 mg of vitamin C beverage, 300 mL. Subjects did wash out for 6 days, then received placebo beverage (300 mL plain water). Subjects drank 30 minutes before and 5 minutes after physical exercise. Exercise loads were yoyo <b>intermittent</b> <b>test</b> and run gradually until 80 HRmaks. Blood samples were taken immediately and 30 minutes after exercise. Results: In the administration of intervention beverage, immediately to 30 minutes after exercise neutrophils increased (p= 0, 006); lymphocytes decreased (p= 0. 015); monocytes decreased (p= 0. 000); and eosinophils decreased (p= 0. 613). In the administration of placebo beverage, immediately to 30 minutes after exercise, neutrophils increased (p= 0. 359); lymphocytes decreased (p= 0. 257); monocytes decreased (p= 0. 146); and eosinophils increased (p= 0. 549). Neutrophils (p= 0. 003) and monocyte (p= 0. 003) had significant difference between both administration drink at 30 minutes after exercise. Lymphocyte and monocyte significantly decrease (p< 0. 05) at intervention than placebo. Conclusion: Maltodextrin and vitamin C combination drink effect on the decreasing of lymphocyte and monocyte 30 minutes after exercise...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{combined}} corrosion-wear {{degradation of}} nano-structured Ni-SiC coatings in sliding contacts immersed in electrically conductive solutions is investigated in situ by electrochemical techniques (open-circuit potential measurements, E(OC), the potentiodynamic polarization measurements, PD, and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), The coating thickness was 50 mu m, {{with an average}} volume of dispersed phases inside nickel of 20 %. The samples were tested in a cell, containing the electrolyte and electrodes, and mounted on a pin-on-disk tribometer, with the working surface of the specimen facing upwards. Both continuous and <b>intermittent</b> friction <b>tests</b> were carried out. In the <b>intermittent</b> <b>tests,</b> friction was applied periodically: during each cycle, friction was first applied for 2 s at constant sliding speed under constant normal load and then stopped during a latency time of 20 s or 0. 5 s. Without friction, the free potential reaches a passive value after immersion in the test solution. When friction force is applied the free potential is shutting down to active values. Under friction the measured current, I {{can be considered as}} the sum of two partial currents: one generated by the wear track areas, where the passive film is destroyed and the surface is active; the other one linked to the surface not subjected to friction and that remains in the passive state. A localised corrosion process when subjected to friction in 0. 5 M K(2) SO(4) was not observed on nano-structured Ni-SiC composite coatings. The mechanical destruction of the passive film occurs in the wear track by friction and subsequent restoration of the film (repassivation) when friction stops. The wear volume loss increases with sliding forces...|$|R
