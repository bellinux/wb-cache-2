30|$|Femoral trochanteric <b>fracture</b> is a {{very common}} injury (Nikkel et al. 2012; Kannus et al. 1996). However, in the {{so-called}} femoral trochanteric <b>fracture,</b> a <b>fracture</b> whose <b>fracture</b> line extends to the basal neck or the subtrochanteric part is not rare. A <b>fracture</b> extending from the basal neck to the subtrochanteric part is included among so-called femoral trochanteric <b>fractures.</b> Such <b>fractures</b> have high instability, and the treatment method {{is different from that}} for femoral trochanteric <b>fractures</b> within only the trochanteric zone. Nevertheless, we cannot classify such <b>fractures</b> conventionally because the <b>fractures</b> cross the target range of the conventional classification: femoral neck <b>fracture,</b> basicervical <b>fracture,</b> pertrochanteric <b>fracture,</b> or subtrochanteric <b>fracture.</b> Therefore, the choice of internal fixator for such <b>fractures</b> around the femoral trochanter is very difficult. Thus, area classification has been proposed as a comprehensive classification that can identify such <b>fractures</b> (Kijima et al. 2014).|$|R
30|$|Six of 30 femur <b>fractures</b> and six of 21 tibia <b>fractures</b> were corner <b>fractures.</b> The {{average age}} of {{patients}} with corner <b>fractures</b> was 2.2  months, ranging from 1  month to 4  months. All corner <b>fractures</b> {{in this study were}} reported as abuse, comprising 35  % of femur <b>fractures,</b> and 46  % of tibia <b>fractures.</b> No corner <b>fractures</b> of the humerus occurred.

30|$|<b>Fracture</b> {{morphology}} differed {{when the}} <b>fracture</b> initiated from sandstone or coal. The <b>fracture</b> geometry was simple when the <b>fracture</b> initiated from the sandstone layer; in most cases, the <b>fracture</b> propagated {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the minimum horizontal stress. When the <b>fracture</b> initiated from the coal layer, the <b>fracture</b> morphology was more complex with three main patterns: (1) The hydraulic <b>fracture</b> initiated and propagated alongside the natural <b>fracture,</b> partially diverging due to in situ stress and forming secondary <b>fractures.</b> (2) The hydraulic <b>fracture</b> initiated and propagated in {{the direction of the}} maximum horizontal stress. (3) Multiple <b>fractures</b> initiated and propagated simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|By {{complexity}} of technology: In situ technologies are usually classified either as true in situ processes or modified in situ processes. True in situ processes {{do not involve}} mining or crushing the oil shale. Modified in situ processes involve drilling and <b>fracturing</b> the target oil shale deposit to create voids in the deposit. The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the deposit, thereby increasing the volume {{and quality of the}} shale oil produced.|$|E
5|$|Offshore oil and {{gas from}} North Sea and Irish Sea, and more {{recently}} offshore wind, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic <b>fracturing</b> ("fracking") {{have proven to be}} controversial.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hydraulic <b>fracture</b> propagation model to describe propagation more realistically. In propagating the hydraulic <b>fractures,</b> {{we have used}} two criteria: maximum tangential stress to determine the <b>fracture</b> initiation angle and whether a hydraulic <b>fracture</b> intersects a natural <b>fracture.</b> The model was validated for the parameters relevant to <b>fracture</b> propagation, such as initiation angle and crossing ability through natural <b>fracture.</b> In order to check whether a hydraulic <b>fracture</b> crosses a natural <b>fracture,</b> the model results on crossing state excellently matched with the experimental data. In the sensitivity analysis for direction of maximum horizontal stress, frictional coefficient of <b>fracture</b> interface, and natural <b>fracture</b> orientation, {{the results show that}} hydraulic <b>fracture</b> intersects natural <b>fracture,</b> and then, propagated suitably with theoretical results according to <b>fracture</b> interaction criterion. In comparison of this model against vertical <b>fracture</b> approach, it was ascertained that there are discrepancies in <b>fracture</b> connectivity and stimulated reservoir volume. ? ??? 2015 ?? ??????? ??? ??? ?????(?????? ??? ?? ? ??? ?? ???? ??) ...|$|R

5|$|The Apollo 14 {{crew members}} sampled {{boulders}} in the ejecta of Cone crater.

These boulders show what is believed to be general characteristics of the Fra Mauro formation: clastic texture, stratification, and jointing or <b>fracturing.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} and prognosis of neck <b>fractures</b> (extra-articular) and body <b>fractures</b> (intra-articular) of the talus are different.

We examined 215 <b>fractures</b> of the talus. By examin-ing the inferior surface <b>fracture</b> line, we found that the 61 <b>fractures</b> crossing the anteromedial aspect of the troch-lea could be differentiated into 28 neck <b>fractures</b> and 33 body <b>fractures.</b> We suggest classifying <b>fractures</b> of the talus based on the inferior, not superior, surface <b>fracture</b> line...|$|R
50|$|Other {{proximal}} fifth metatarsal <b>fractures</b> exist, {{although they}} are not as severe as a Jones <b>fracture.</b> If the <b>fracture</b> enters the intermetatarsal joint, it is a Jones <b>fracture.</b> If, however, it enters the tarsometatarsal joint, then it is an avulsion <b>fracture</b> caused by pull from the peroneus brevis.

5000|$|<b>Fractures</b> of the humerus are {{classified}} {{based on the}} location of the <b>fracture</b> and then by the type of <b>fracture.</b> There are three locations that humerus <b>fractures</b> occur: at the proximal location, which is the top of the humerus near the shoulder, in the middle, which is at the shaft of the humerus, and the distal location, which is the bottom of the humerus near the elbow. Proximal <b>fractures</b> {{are classified}} into one of four types of <b>fractures</b> based on the displacement of the greater tubercle, the lesser tubercle, the surgical neck, and the anatomical neck, which are the four parts of the proximal humerus, with <b>fracture</b> displacement being defined as at least one centimeter of separation or an angulation greater than 45 degrees. One-part <b>fractures</b> involve no displacement of any parts of the humerus, two-part <b>fractures</b> have one part displaced relative to the other three; three-part <b>fractures</b> have two displaced fragments, and four-part <b>fractures</b> have all fragments displaced from each other. <b>Fractures</b> of the humerus shaft are subdivided into transverse <b>fractures,</b> spiral <b>fractures,</b> [...] "butterfly" [...] <b>fractures,</b> which are a combination of transverse and spiral <b>fractures,</b> and pathological <b>fractures,</b> which are <b>fractures</b> caused by medical conditions. Distal <b>fractures</b> are split between supracondylar <b>fractures,</b> which are transverse <b>fractures</b> above the two condyles {{at the bottom of the}} humerus, and intercondylar <b>fractures,</b> which involve a T- or Y-shaped <b>fracture</b> that splits the condyles.|$|R
5|$|The local bedrock {{is a hard}} red sandstone, {{which the}} {{inhabitants}} used {{in the construction of}} monuments and architecture. This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to shearing or <b>fracturing,</b> allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the Americas.

5|$|Unknown {{before the}} Apollo 15 mission, there are {{parallel}} linear {{patterns on the}} faces of the mountains in the area. Although they appeared to be occurrences of <b>fracturing</b> or layering appearing through the regolith, determining this is made difficult by the lighting circumstances during the mission.

5|$|Although the <b>fracturing</b> {{process is}} not yet known, the altitudinal {{statistical}} analysis indicates that the caldera had formed just before the eruption. The area of the island was smaller, and the southern and eastern coastlines appeared regressed. During the eruption, the landscape was covered by the pumice sediments. In some places, the coastline vanished under thick tuff depositions. In others, recent coastlines were extended towards the sea. After the eruption, the geomorphology of the island was characterized by an intense erosional phase during which the pumice was progressively removed from the higher altitudes to the lower ones.|$|E
40|$|Summary: In this {{meta-analysis}} {{of the control}} arms of four phase 3 trials, mild vertebral <b>fractures</b> were a significant risk factor for future vertebral <b>fractures</b> but not for non-vertebral <b>fracture.</b> Introduction: A prior vertebral <b>fracture</b> is {{a risk factor for}} future <b>fracture</b> that is commonly used as an eligibility criterion for treatment and in the assessment of <b>fracture</b> probability. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prognostic significance of a morphometric <b>fracture</b> according to the severity of <b>fracture.</b> Methods: We examined the control (placebo) treated arms of four phase 3 trials. Vertebral <b>fracture</b> status was graded at baseline in 7, 623 women, and <b>fracture</b> outcomes were documented over the subsequent 20, 000 patient-years. <b>Fracture</b> outcomes were characterised as a further vertebral <b>fracture,</b> a non-vertebral <b>fracture</b> or a clinical <b>fracture</b> (non-vertebral plus clinical vertebral <b>fracture).</b> The relative risk of <b>fracture</b> was computed from the merged β coefficients of each trial weighted according to the variance. Results: Mild vertebral <b>fractures</b> were a significant risk factor for vertebral <b>fractures</b> [risk ratio (RR) [*]=[*] 2. 17; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 70 – 2. 76] but were not associated with an increased risk of non-vertebral <b>fractures</b> (RR[*]=[*] 1. 08; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 86 – 1. 36). Moderate/severe vertebral <b>fractures</b> were associated with a high risk of vertebral <b>fractures</b> (RR[*]=[*] 4. 23; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 3. 58 – 5. 00) and a moderate though significant increase in non-vertebral <b>fracture</b> risk (RR[*]=[*] 1. 64; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 1. 38 – 1. 94). Conclusions: Prior moderate/severe morphometric vertebral <b>fractures</b> are a strong and significant risk factor for future <b>fracture.</b> The presence of a mild vertebral <b>fracture</b> is of no significant prognostic value for non-vertebral <b>fractures.</b> These findings should temper the use of morphometric <b>fractures</b> in the assessment of risk and the design of phase 3 studies...|$|R
40|$|Recognition of {{patterns}} of traumatic elbow instability helps anticipate specific <b>fracture</b> characteristics and associated injuries. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the association of <b>fracture</b> line distribution and location of displaced partial articular radial head <b>fractures</b> with specific patterns of traumatic elbow instability using <b>fracture</b> mapping techniques. <b>Fracture</b> line distribution and location of 66 acute displaced partial articular radial head <b>fractures</b> were identified using quantitative 3 -dimensional computed tomography reconstructions that allowed reduction of <b>fracture</b> fragments and a standardized method to divide the radial head into quadrants with forearm in neutral position. Based on qualitative and quantitative assessment of <b>fracture</b> maps, the association between <b>fracture</b> characteristics of displaced partial articular radial head <b>fractures</b> and specific elbow <b>fracture</b> patterns was determined. In partial articular radial head <b>fractures,</b> the highest <b>fracture</b> line intensity was located in the anterolateral quadrant near the center of the radial head. <b>Fracture</b> location corresponded with <b>fracture</b> line distribution; most <b>fractures</b> involved the anterolateral quadrant (n[*]=[*] 65; 98 %), whereas parts of the posteromedial quadrant were involved in a minority of the <b>fractures</b> (n[*]=[*] 10; 15 %). The association of <b>fracture</b> line distribution and location with overall <b>fracture</b> patterns of the elbow, as depicted on <b>fracture</b> maps, was not statistically significant. <b>Fracture</b> maps demonstrated no association between <b>fracture</b> line distribution and location of displaced partial articular <b>fractures</b> of the radial head and overall specific patterns of traumatic elbow instability, suggesting a common <b>fracture</b> mechanism that involves the anterolateral part of the radial head in most patient...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} of <b>fracture</b> {{toughness}} K 1 C prediction of non power law hardening material by using cleavage <b>fracture</b> local approach is proposed in this paper.

To most of pressure vessel carbon-manganese steels, cleavage <b>fracture</b> is likely to occur at the load corresponding to 62 % cleavage <b>fracture</b> probability. Hence, the <b>fracture</b> toughness corresponding to the load is the most possible <b>fracture</b> toughness of the steels.

5|$|Cassini {{observations}} {{provided a}} much {{closer look at}} the crater distribution and size, showing that many of Enceladus' craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and <b>fracturing.</b> Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have domed floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim. Dunyazad crater {{is a prime example of}} a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origins}} to {{approximately}} {{the area of}} Sanford, the St. Johns flows north. It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles—which {{is referred to as}} the St. Johns River offset, but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some <b>fracturing</b> and faulting may also be responsible for the offset. Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by Pangaean rifting.|$|E
50|$|Humerus <b>fractures</b> {{are among}} the most common of <b>fractures.</b> Proximal <b>fractures</b> make up 5% of all <b>fractures</b> and 25% of humerus <b>fractures,</b> middle <b>fractures</b> about 60% of humerus <b>fractures</b> (12% of all <b>fractures),</b> and distal <b>fractures</b> the remainder. Among {{proximal}} <b>fractures,</b> 80% are one-part, 10% are two-part, and the remaining 10% are three- and four-part. The most common location of proximal <b>fractures</b> is at the surgical neck of the humerus. Incidence of proximal <b>fractures</b> increases with age, with about 75% of cases occurring among people over the age of 60. In this age group, about three times as many women than men experience a proximal <b>fracture.</b> Middle <b>fractures</b> are also common among the elderly, but they frequently occur among physically active young adult men who experience physical trauma to the humerus. Distal <b>fractures</b> are rare among adults, occurring primarily in children who experience physical trauma to the elbow region.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the pat-tern of <b>fracture</b> risk {{following}} a prior <b>fracture</b> at the spine, shoulder or hip. We studied 1918 patients with <b>fractures</b> at these sites identified from the Department of Radiology in Malmo who were followed for 5 years. Poisson regression was used to compute <b>fracture</b> rates immediately after the initial <b>fracture</b> and at 5 years thereafter in men and women aged 60 or 80 years. Immediate <b>fracture</b> risk was higher than that of the general population, more markedly so at the age of 60 than at 80 years. At the age of 60 years, the risk of hip, forearm and spine <b>fractures</b> were significantly increased following a prior spine, hip or shoulder <b>fracture</b> in men. A similar pattern was seen in women, except that the increase in risk of forearm <b>fracture</b> following a spine or hip <b>fracture</b> was not statistically significant. The inci-dence of further <b>fractures</b> at the shoulder, spine or hip fell with time after the first <b>fracture,</b> a fall that was sig-nificant for all <b>fractures</b> after a shoulder <b>fracture,</b> hip <b>fracture</b> after a spine <b>fracture,</b> and hip and spine frac-tures after a hip <b>fracture.</b> We conclude that the risk of a subsequent <b>fracture</b> immediately after an osteoporotic <b>fracture</b> is highest immediately after the event.
