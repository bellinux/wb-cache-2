The approach taken {{is to look}} at the present from the perspective of Tinbergen, Haavelmo, and Keynes. It is argued that probability modeling has been in retreat at central banks and elsewhere. New computational methods, though, are making Bayesian analysis of previously intractable problems possible, and at the same time appreciation of the clarity with which Bayesian <b>data</b> <b>analyis</b> integrates with decison-making is spreading...|$|R
40|$|We {{tackle the}} problem of {{integration}} {{in the context of}} <b>data</b> <b>analyis.</b> Integration <b>in</b> <b>data</b> analysis often means correlating observations from different parts of the data. That is, we often have two (or more) parts of the data, and the goal is to relate observations in one part to observations in the others. For instance, we would like to relate gene expression to pathway/network or clinical <b>data.</b> <b>In</b> this abstract, we propose predictive clustering trees as a data analysis tool for the joint analysis of different types of data. The approach seems to be particularly well-suited for relating gene expression to other types of data. Predictive clustering is a hybrid clustering/classification scheme [Blockeel et al., 1998]. Clustering aims at finding groups of observations that maximize intra-group similarity, but also inter-group dissimilarity. Classification, in contrast, aims at finding a mapping from instances to class labels. Many machine learning learning algorithms do not only find such mappings, but also provide a description of the classes. Predictive clustering is now defined as a hybrid approach that finds groups of observations as well as their mapping plus a description simultaneously. So, the task is to find groups in an unsupervised fashion, such that future data points can automatically be assigned to the clusters based on generated cluster descriptions. One can easily solve {{the problem of}} predictive clustering by first clustering and then classifying, for instance, by unpruned decision trees. However, in predictive clustering, the construction of clusters and their descriptio...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -Sociology, Humboldt State University, 2007 Cohousing {{originated}} in Denmark in the 1960 s and, after much success, spread to North America in the 1980 s. In the United States, the 1980 s marked {{a period of}} ever-increasing suburbanization. With this shift in neighborhood organization came a related perceived loss of community. Some people who felt alienated from their neighbors and unsatisfied with typical housing opportunities turned to cohousing. These people hoped to find solutions to ???community lost??? by living in cohousing developments whose aims included creating safe ???fifties style??? neighborhoods that promoted the well-being of residents through shared common spaces and community decision making. This research is an ethnographic study of a cohousing community, referred to in this paper as Emerald Hills, established in 1998 {{in a small town}} in Northern California. I entered the setting in Spring 2005 and exited the community at the end of the year. In addition to participant observation at community meals and meetings, I completed fifteen one-on-one semi-structured interviews. In those interviews, I encouraged participants to speak about their cohousing expectations and experiences and questioned them about relationships with others in the community and the emotional aspects of their experiences. I used NVivo qualitative <b>data</b> <b>analyis</b> software to analyze field notes and interview transcriptions and reviewed the data looking for common themes and coded accordingly. To analyze the data, I relied on the existing literature on cohousing, well-being, social interaction, social support, individualism and expectations. Participants developed a sense of well-being at Emerald Hills through regular community meals, community projects, shared political outlooks, friendships with neighbors, a good environment for raising children and other resources from those relationships. Conversely, conflicts over money, the absence of mediation and consensus training, the lack of a unifying vision statement, individualism and disagreement about expectations for relationships among community members negatively affected the well-being of residents of Emerald Hills. However, those community members with lower expectations prior to moving into cohousing expressed a greater sense of well-being from living in Emerald Hills...|$|R

40|$|The {{prospect}} of realizing materials with highest strengths and other unique properties has driven {{a large number}} of research activities on nanostructured materials in recent years. The present dissertation deals with the atomic-scale modeling of nanocrystalline and nanotwinned metals and alloys, employing state of-the-art atomistic simulation and analysis methods. The aims of the present work are two-fold: to develop novel computational techniques in the field of atomistic materials modeling, and to use these methods to shed light on the structure and atomic-scale plasticity of nanostructured materials. In {{the first part of this}} thesis the newly developed <b>data</b> <b>analyis</b> and visualization software Ovito is described, which provides the basis for all following work. It serves as an integral part in the search for the origins of microstrain broadening in x-ray diffraction (XRD) data of nanocrystalline materials. To this end, virtual nanocrystalline structures are characterized by means of simulated diffraction experiments as well as a real-space strain field analysis. By correlating the results from the strain field analysis with the XRD measurements, conclusions on the features of nanometer-sized grains contributing to peak broadening can be drawn. In the second part two sophisticated analysis algorithms are developed, which allow to extract the complete dislocation network from an atomistic simulation. The identification of single dislocation lines and the determination of their Burgers vector has been a laborious task usually done by hand in the past. The new method makes this information available within seconds, enabling a quantitative assessment of dislocation processes in large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It is employed in a study of dislocation plasticity of nanotwinned metals, which can exhibt highest strength and ductility compared with their twin-free counterparts. The deformation mechanisms of Cu and Pd with ultrahigh twin densities are investigated by means of MD simulations. While nanotwins have a strengthening effect in Cu, they lead to a softening in Pd. This difference is discussed in terms of the characteristic dislocations occurring during deformation. The third part is dedicated to nanocrystalline alloys. First, an atomistic simulation method is described that allows to model such materials by taking into account both structural and chemical equilibration in large-scale MD simulations. It is complemented by an efficient implementation of a concentration-dependent interatomic potential scheme, which enables a precise description of the energetics of mixing in multi-component systems over the whole concentration range. These tools are then employed in a study of nanocrystalline Pd–Au. The stress-strain behavior of this miscible alloy is discussed in terms of the interplay of grain boundary solute segregation, fault energies, and grain size...|$|R
