The possibility to reduce depletion {{of natural resources and}} decrease the produced waste lies in an efficient and possibly repeated use of resources. An important subgroup of waste is formed by materials from petroleum derivatives- polymers (PP, PE, HDPE etc.). Polymers and their composite materials {{can be used as a}} base material for most products including products used in civil engineering. One of these products is an <b>insulation</b> <b>block</b> for elimination of thermal bridges in wall footing. During design of this product the MAP method (modelling-analysis-prediction) has been used together with experimental testing. This paper deals with the description of long term behaviour of an <b>insulation</b> <b>block</b> made of recycled polymers using full scale testing. Experimental data is compared to different rheological models...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} recent {{thermal model}} {{results of the}} Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG). The three-dimensional (3 D) ASRG thermal power model was built using the Thermal Desktop(trademark) thermal analyzer. The model was correlated with ASRG engineering unit test data and ASRG flight unit predictions from Lockheed Martin's (LM's) I-deas(trademark) TMG thermal model. The auxiliary cooling system (ACS) of the ASRG is {{also included in the}} ASRG thermal model. The ACS is designed to remove waste heat from the ASRG {{so that it can be}} used to heat spacecraft components. The performance of the ACS is reported under nominal conditions and during a Venus flyby scenario. The results for the nominal case are validated with data from Lockheed Martin. Transient thermal analysis results of ASRG for a Venus flyby with a representative trajectory are also presented. In addition, model results of an ASRG mounted on a Cassini-like spacecraft with a sunshade are presented to show a way to mitigate the high temperatures of a Venus flyby. It was predicted that the sunshade can lower the temperature of the ASRG alternator by 20 C for the representative Venus flyby trajectory. The 3 D model also was modified to predict generator performance after a single Advanced Stirling Convertor failure. The geometry of the Microtherm HT <b>insulation</b> <b>block</b> on the outboard side was modified to match deformation and shrinkage observed during testing of a prototypic ASRG test fixture by LM. Test conditions and test data were used to correlate the model by adjusting the thermal conductivity of the deformed insulation to match the post-heat-dump steady state temperatures.

During {{the manufacture}} of footwear, are generated various types of waste, including the Ethylene Vinyl Acetat (EVA), as inevitable patchwork of expanded boards of the material to obtain the shoe formats. An alternative to an appropriate destination of EVA waste is its use in {{the manufacture of}} blocks produced with lightweight concrete. The issue addressed in this study is related to the thermal gains made by vertical sealing and thermal comfort of built environments. The environments that do not have the appropriate type of masonry to its climate generate thermal comfort problems due to loss, or excessive heat gain, what happens in regions with predominantly hot dry weather wet hot, as is the case of Northeast Brazil. Considering the thermal discomfort of environments due to misuse elements appropriate in the walls of buildings, as well as the problem of disposal of waste EVA, this work is to extend the characterization of the thermal performance of the blocks composed of EVA. Therefore, we sought to analyze compared samples developed from EVA blocks with other components. The study was done from the development of miniature single skin and double samples (made of EVA blocks, ceramic bricks and concrete blocks), which were tested in a thermal chamber composed of two rooms, a heated and another cooled, separated by an insulating partition in which the sample was inserted. The instrumentation was performed with the use of thermocouples installed in the walls and surfaces of the mini black globe thermometers in the chamber environment. From the experimental characterization of thermophysical properties such as thermal conductivity and density of the EVA blocks of various parameters calculations were performed as set out in NBR 15220 - 2 (ABNT, 2005 b) and calculations to obtain the heat transfer rate of samples. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the <b>insulation</b> <b>block</b> with the highest percentage of waste and the various samples using proposed block can meet EVA hot and wet/dry climate requirements...|$|E

Vermiculite ore mined near Libby, Montana, which {{accounted for more than}} half the worldwide production of vermiculite from 1925 to 1990, was contaminated with asbestos and asbestos-like fibers. Workplace exposure to these fibers caused a serious health problem in local miners and millers, as well as some downstream workers. Mining stopped at the mine near Libby in 1990. However, concerns remain about health effects from environmental and other occupational exposures to asbestos-contaminated vermiculite, especially vermiculite that has been installed as loose-fill insulation in homes and other buildings.

40|$|SpaceClaim/TD Direct {{has been}} used {{extensively}} {{in the development of}} the Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generator (ASRG) thermal model. This paper outlines the workflow for that aspect of the task and includes proposed best practices and lessons learned. The ASRG thermal model was developed to predict component temperatures and power output and to provide insight into the prime contractors thermal modeling efforts. The <b>insulation</b> <b>blocks,</b> heat collectors, and cold side adapter flanges (CSAFs) were modeled with this approach. The model was constructed using mostly TD finite difference (FD) surfaces solids. However, some complex geometry could not be reproduced with TD primitives while maintaining the desired degree of geometric fidelity. Using SpaceClaim permitted the import of original CAD files and enabled the defeaturing repair of those geometries. TD Direct (a SpaceClaim add-on from CRTech) adds features that allowed the mark-up of that geometry. These so-called mark-ups control how finite element (FE) meshes were generated and allowed the tagging of features (e. g. edges, solids, surfaces). These tags represent parameters that include: submodels, material properties, material orienters, optical properties, and radiation analysis groups. TD aliases were used for most tags to allow analysis to be performed with a variety of parameter values. Domain-tags were also attached to individual and groups of surfaces and solids to allow them to be used later within TD to populate objects like, for example, heaters and contactors. These tools allow the user to make changes to the geometry in SpaceClaim and then easily synchronize the mesh in TD without having to redefine these objects each time as one would if using TD Mesher. The use of SpaceClaim/TD Direct has helped simplify the process for importing existing geometries and in the creation of high fidelity FE meshes to represent complex parts. It has also saved time and effort in the subsequent analysis...|$|R
40|$|Production of {{one family}} houses has over time {{developed}} successfully in Sweden and producers {{have managed to}} reduce the production costs and industrialize the production process. The development has however not been that successful {{when it comes to}} high-rise buildings. There are many attempts made, but no one has really managed to create a product that can persuade the market. The systems used are not flexible and cannot cope very well with variations in the design. The aim of this work has been to develop and evaluate the idea of prefabricated high-rise buildings within the outlines of a scientific research. By understanding the problems that the building sector experiences today {{it will be possible to}} identify the solutions that are needed tomorrow. The main objective has been to develop new technologies and system concepts for buildings. Concepts that are highly flexible and respect the ambitions of the architect and technologies that will facilitate a more effective building process and address relevant key issues in building physics and building construction for cost reduction and a sustainable performance. Aside from the actual production cost it is also important to consider the lifecycle cost of the building. The production cost represents only a fraction of the total lifecycle cost of a building. A background research has been made to understand the building process and its problems, this information served for the formulation of a building concept. The work has been interdisciplinary and has not been limited to only one single point of view. Because of the nature of the method the work has resulted in new construction techniques. The initial idea of the prefabricated high-rise building has during the course of this work developed to a complete building concept. The Symphony Concept as it is called is about industrial prefabricated buildings that are assembled on site and is based on the idea of large and flat building elements with a very high degree of prefabrication. To evaluate the concept technology detailed researches have been made in different fields. The detailed researches made in this thesis regards the strength of sheet metal studs embedded in stiff <b>insulation</b> <b>blocks,</b> hazards connected with plastering on light weight constructions and fire protection of light weight constructions. The experiences from these researches are then applied in the building concept. Theory was put to practice with the construction of an experimental building called the Research Tower. The purpose of this pilot-project was primary to evaluate the construction technology and secondary to evaluate the properties of the building concept. To be able to find methods for production of sustainable, cost-effective and attractive high-rise buildings it is necessary to have a holistic view. A holistic concept that takes into consideration the whole building process will yield time- and cost-efficient production while it will also make it possible to achieve better quality. The detail researches shows that embedding of the sheet metal profiles in the rigid <b>insulation</b> <b>blocks</b> will increase the buckling load of the stud and that the thickness of the plastering layer and the material properties of its substrate will affect the strains in the plastering layer and the moisture stored in it. Regarding the fire protection it could be stated that the Symphony outer wall construction protected with a double layer of gypsum board can maintain segregation of the fire up to 60 min as long as the gypsum boards do not crumble. In the production of the pilot projected it could be stated that the fact that the whole building was designed by one homogenous team with information about all details, made it possible to foresee many problems. The production of elements even in the temporary experimental production facility proved to be fast and economic, even with untrained labour force and the elements could be prefabricated to a very high level with facades that are plastered before assembly.

Thus by this new innovative recycling process the waste is not only eliminated but benefits can be gained from the new material that comes out of it as a structural composite panel.

In this research different kind of polymeric foams used for manufacturing of reconstituted recycled samples. Sodium silicate solution has been chosen as the binder to binds shredded foams together. Due to fastening of sodium silicate curing different kind of acidic powders have been tested. For increasing of post properties after curing variety of fillers as an additive have been tried through out this research.

40|$|Reduction of {{the cost}} of {{construction}} is a constant goal for the building industry. One way of reducing the construction cost of buildings is to develop building technologies that will give increased productivity. Reduced construction time at the building-site and waste of materials and resources contribute to furtherreduction {{of the cost}}s. This is why the sector is developing towards more industrialized construction methods with prefabricated components. The objective of this thesis is development of industrial construction methods forcost-effective and energy-efficient construction of multi-storey buildings. It is important to highlight the difference between cheap or low-cost and cost-effective production. It is possible to produce buildings to a low-cost at the expense of decreased quality and design. Conversely, cost-effective buildings are buildings that are produced to a low cost while maintaining a high standard of design and comfort. While cost reduction efforts are often made based on a, relatively, fixed building process, this research is focused on reducing the costs by changing the building process with the help of innovative building technologies. The construction of a building is a very complex practice {{with a wide range of}} interacting processes. The hypothesis is that a holistic approach is advantageous in order to find effective construction methods. To achieve a holistic view, an interdisciplinary approach to the research is required. By approaching the development of construction methods from the point of view of the entire building process, it is possible to achieve optimizations with synergy effects and by that find solutions that are time-efficient, energy-efficient and cost-effective at the same time. The work started by analysing the building process and the construction methods currently used in order to; discover the most common problems, gain understanding of the strengths and weaknesses in the conventional construction methods and identify the fields where the largest potential for improvements existed. Based on this analysis, a new building concept for industrial construction of multi-storey buildings is formulated called The Symphony concept. The concept involves a holistic view of the whole building process and is based on a prefabricated heavy structure that is covered with a prefabricated building envelope consisting of large, light-weight elements with a high degree of prefabrication and finished exterior surfaces. The concept required development of new types of building-elements and assembly methods. The technology was first evaluated while still on the drawing table. Some of these evaluations have been of a more detailed character and are reported in scientific papers. Thereafter an experimental building in full scale was erected in order to test the developed technology during production and assembly, while measurements and tests were performed in order to evaluate the performance of the building in operation. Based on the obtained results suggestions for improvements could be given in order to upgrade the concept further. The economic analysis of the building process showed that the largest cost posts in the construction of dwellings are the climatic shell (24 %), the interior finishing, and the management costs. The construction of the climatic shell is optimized through the use of the Symphony elements while the management costs are reduced through the use of prefabricated elements with a high degree of prefabrication which, substantially, increase the construction speed. Results show that it is possible to reduce the construction costs with about 25 % when constructing according to the Symphony concept compared to conventional construction methods. The construction of the large light-weight Symphony-elements was possible thanks to the CasaBona system. CasaBona is a building system which integrates the thermal insulation with the structural elements in the outer walls by embedding sheet metal profiles into stiff <b>insulation</b> <b>blocks.</b> The results show that the strength of the profile, when embedded in rigid <b>insulation</b> <b>blocks,</b> is increased between 22 % and 33 % when submitted to bending forces, and between 161 % and 210 % when submitted to compressive forces. Simulations of the annual energy use of buildings show that the energy performance of buildings is improved with increased effective thermal mass. Increased mass is also beneficial from the acoustic point of view. However, it is important that the interior space is separated from the exterior climate with constructions that have low U-values. It could be concluded that the most beneficial design strategy is the combination of a heavy core-construction (which has a large mass and thermal inertia) and a light-weight building envelope (which yields low U-value without adding to the thickness of the outer-wall). The construction of the experimental building made it possible to test the technology in an inexpensive yet realistic way. However, it is important to bear in mind that the information which can be gathered from an experimental building can be limited depending on the size of the building and its finishing standard. It could also be noticed that industrial construction benefits from an interdisciplinary design process since this render the increased use of prefabricated components possible. QC 2010090...|$|R
40|$|This {{objective}} of this thesis has been to development and analysis a measurement apparatus designed to determine thermal conductivity of porous materials. A literature survey concerning available experimental techniques for thermal conductivity measurements was conducted. A steady state radial heat transfer method with cylindrical geometry and a centered heating element {{was found to be}} most suited technique for achieving accurate and reliable results. A side wall cooling arrangement was used to achieve desired cooling temperatures. To restrict the extent of the work, it was decided to only investigate heat transfer behavior at cryogenic temperatures. Test specimen with a thermal conductivity of 0. 05 W/(m*K), (assumed to be the thermal conductivity of the materials to be tested in the apparatus) and a thermal conductivity of 0. 01 W/(m*K) for the insulation components, were the ones chosen for investigations. The design process of the new apparatus, using the software COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 2, was initiated by evaluating heat transfer behavior in a simple cylinder, containing a hollow heating element and the test specimen. Radial heat transfer was verified, hence, the design process proceeded. Extensive, step-wise analyses were conducted to evaluate heat transfer behavior as the complexity of the apparatus increased. Implemented elements such as <b>insulation</b> <b>blocks,</b> a heater support and three thermocouples proved to cause heat losses in the test section, which resulted in errors in the calculated thermal conductivities. Furthermore, an electric wire, supplying the heating element with current, was included in the model. In addition, the hollow heater was replaced by an aluminum oxide heater since such an element is to be used when building the apparatus. Unexpected results revealed critical heat transfer into the test section from the wire. This led to an investigation of the wire length to reduce such effects. Lastly, {{as a result of the}} analyses carried out, the overall error of the thermal conductivity measurements due to heat losses was determined. Dimensional drawings of the characteristic dimensions, as well as practical solutions for the final compilation of the apparatus, were suggested as the last step of the design process. It was of interest to estimate the overall uncertainty of the apparatus when all parameters effecting the measurements, were included. For this, a comprehensive uncertainty analysis was conducted and compared to previous work. Results showed that temperature recordings from the thermocouples placed in the mid-section of the test cylinder would provide the most reliable results for the determination of thermal conductivity in the test apparatus. </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{verify that}} the inner design and its {{performance}} are satisfactory {{and that there are}} no failures in the winding insulation system and core displacement during long-trip transport, we need to do several tests such as SFRA test or single-phase excitation test. Defect in magnetic core structure, shifting of windings, failures in turns to turns or <b>block</b> to <b>block</b> <b>insulation</b> or problems in tap changers are conditions that change the eﬀective reluctance of the magnetic circuit, thus aﬀecting the current required to establish ﬂux in the core. In order to deal with these problems, we would use low voltage single-phase excitation for power transformers. This is also a kind of auxiliary judgment method to guide us about the condition of transformer...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the scope}} of the {{transnational}} access activities of the European research project SERIES, the Laboratório Nacional de Engenharia Civil (LNEC) has provided access to its 3 D shaking table to the international construction company Wienerberger AG and to a group of European experts, in order to perform full-scale seismic tests on an industrial solution for buildings using a modern unreinforced thermal <b>insulation</b> clay <b>block</b> masonry structure. Such solution represents a very common construction method in Central Europe but, although some cyclic shear test results are available, its effective dynamic response under seismic events still requires experimental validation. For this purpose, two full-scale mock-ups with different geometries were tested on the 3 -D shaking table using a series of seismic records with increasing intensity. The first mock-up is plan-regular, while the second one is designed so as to trigger some torsional effects. This paper summarizes the most relevant experimental results regarding the structural response of the specimens, e. g., the dynamic response evolution, the collapse mechanism identified and the maximum drift values measured. It also focuses on two different easy modelling strategies, i. e. simple model according to a combined Eurocode 6 /Eurocode 8 approach and equivalent frame approach. It finally compares the predictions obtained from these two methods with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Induction core alloys are {{evaluated}} {{that are appropriate}} for heavy-ion induction accelerators to drive heavy-ion inertial fusion (HIF) power plants. Parameters evaluated include the usable flux swing and the energy loss over a range of magnetization rates of ∼ 10 ^{ 5 }– 10 ^{ 7 } T/s, corresponding to pulse durations of ∼ 20 to 0. 2 μs, respectively. The usable flux swing, for minimum core losses, extends from near the reversed remanent field to about 80 % of the saturation field. The usable flux swing is enhanced, with little increase in losses, by annealing the core after winding. Maintaining low energy loss at high magnetization rates requires <b>insulation</b> to <b>block</b> interlaminar eddy currents. To obtain annealed cores with a high ratio of remanent to saturation magnetic field, the insulation must withstand annealing temperatures and apply minimum mechanical stress to the core during cooldown. We find that commercially available insulating coatings for amorphous metals either break down near 10 ^{ 6 } T/s (a factor of 10 below the requirement), or do not achieve the maximum remanent field and hence the usable flux swing after annealing. More satisfactory coatings are available for silicon steel and nanocrystalline alloys, which could have applications in HIF. Amorphous alloys are capable of meeting most HIF needs, especially with improved coatings...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports initial work on {{creating}} frequency selective surfaces (FSS) on modern day glass windows {{to improve the}} transmission of wireless commu-nication signals through the glass. The manufacturers of these glass windows apply very thin layers of metallic oxides {{on one side of}} glass to provide extra thermal <b>insulation.</b> These coatings <b>block</b> the infrared and ultraviolet waves to provide thermal insulation, but they also attenuate communication sign-las such as GSM 900, GSM 1800 / 1900, UMTS and 3 G mobile signals. This creates a major communication problem when buildings are constructed using mostly such type of glass. A bandpass FSS can provide a solution to increase the transmission of useful bands through the coated glass. In order to design an appropriate FSS, the relative permittivity and conductivity of glass should be measured accurately. Moreover, electrical properties of the coated layer must also be known in order to obtain a resonance in the desired band. In this work, we used two different methods of measuring the permittivity an...|$|R

The concrete mixtures have been mixed with 10 %, 15 % 20 % and 25 % of wood ash as a partial replacement for cement with sand and tested for compressive strength, water absorption and heat release. Higher compressive strength was observed in the samples of 15 % containing wood ash replacement material. All the samples other than 25 % of wood ash replacement were shown lower water absorption and highest was found in 15 % wood ash content. Slower heat release was observed in the samples of 15 % and 20 % of wood ash replacement after 21 days of curing time. Addition of 15 % wood ash for the manufacturing of concrete blocks was developed and these blocks meet standard limits...|$|R

40|$|Millions of single-family masonry (block) {{houses with}} slab {{foundations}} {{exist in the}} southern United States. In fact, approximately 50 % of Florida`s six million residences are of concrete block construction. The block walls in these homes are usually uninsulated, and the technology for retrofitting wall insulation is not well developed. Two field tests were performed [...] one near Phoenix, Arizona and one in Cocoa, Florida [...] to measure the air-conditioning energy savings and demand reduction impact of applying an exterior insulation and finish system (EEFS) to {{the exterior of the}} block wall, and gain practical experience with retrofit application techniques and costs. One field test used a {open_quotes}site-fabricated{close_quotes} insulation system, while the other field test used a commercially available system. The field tests measured a savings of 9 % in Arizona and less savings in Florida, and emphasized the impact indoor temperature settings have on cooling energy savings: exterior wall <b>insulation</b> on <b>block</b> homes will produce energy savings in Florida houses only if a low cooling thermostat setting is desirable. The field tests also highlighted an improved comfort benefit from the retrofit - namely, elimination of overheating in rooms with south and west exposures. The DOE- 2. ID program was used to analyze the energy savings (air-conditioning and heating) and electric demand impact of applying an EIFS. Air-conditioning energy savings were estimated to be in the range of 8 % to 10 % in many southern U. S. regions. A 12 % savings was predicted for Phoenix, Arizona and a savings of 1 % to 4 % was predicted for seacoast regions, particularly in Florida. These predictions were in good agreement with the measured values. Peak hour cooling energy savings were predicted to be more uniform throughout the country, generally in the range of % 8 to % 12...|$|R
