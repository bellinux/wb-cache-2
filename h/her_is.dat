5|$|Fuller painted {{other works}} for the Hacketts. In a 1937 piece {{reflecting}} on early twentieth-century art in Western Australia, a reviewer recalled:Dr. (later Sir Winthrop) Hackett was a great patron of Miss Fuller, {{and he was a}} constant visitor to her dignified studio, above his office in the old West Australian Chambers. The first portrait I saw Miss Fuller working on was of Mrs. E. Chase... The portrait was a commission from Dr. Hackett, and was destined to hang in his gallery. Miss Fuller painted Lady Hackett both before and after her marriage, and one particularly happy picture of <b>her</b> <b>is</b> as a young girl gathering wildflowers in the Darlington hills. Her portraits of the first Hackett babies were charming studies of childhood.|$|E

The film also stars Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, and Olivia Wilde.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, The Strand {{became a}} newly fashionable address and many avant-garde writers and thinkers {{gathered}} here, among them Thomas Carlyle, Charles Dickens, John Stuart Mill, Ralph Waldo Emerson and the scientist Thomas Henry Huxley. No.142 {{was the home}} of radical publisher and physician John Chapman, who published contemporary authors from this house during the 1850s and edited the journal Westminster Review from 1851. George Eliot lived at No.142 between 1851 and 1855. Virginia Woolf regularly travelled along the Strand, and a King's College building named after <b>her</b> <b>is</b> in nearby Kingsway.|$|E

He tells a woman named Helen on the phone about it, but it is revealed that she charges by the hour to talk with Locke, {{and that they have}} been conversing for eight months. Locke reveals to Helen that he is going on a walkabout and would like for Helen to go with him; she tells him that she can't meet customers in person and that his paid hour on the phone with <b>her</b> <b>is</b> up.|$|E

John and Tom flee the scene while a crying Lana lies with Brandon's body. The next morning, Lana awakens next to Brandon's corpse. Her mother arrives and takes {{her away from the}} scene. As Lana leaves Falls City, a letter Brandon wrote to <b>her</b> <b>is</b> heard in a voiceover.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about Catherine's premarital life. The {{earliest}} source that mentions <b>her</b> <b>is</b> the will of her maternal great-grandmother Jelena Lazarević, dated 25 November 1442, in which she left her her gold earrings and a snake-shaped bracelet. Stjepan was a member and significant supporter of the Bosnian Church, while her mother was an Eastern Orthodox Christian; Catherine was raised in her father's confession.|$|E
5|$|Pericles, {{following}} Athenian custom, {{was first}} married {{to one of}} his closest relatives, with whom he had two sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, but around 445BC, Pericles divorced his wife. He offered her to another husband, with the agreement of her male relatives. The name of his first wife is not known; the only information about <b>her</b> <b>is</b> that she was the wife of Hipponicus, before being married to Pericles, and the mother of Callias from this first marriage.|$|E

5|$|Since {{little of}} Honora Sneyd's own words have survived, our image of <b>her</b> <b>is</b> largely {{through the eyes}} of others, in {{particular}} Anna Seward and Richard Edgeworth. Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on educational psychology would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E
5|$|The Hachisuka scroll {{contains}} paintings {{which are}} not associated with any text sections of the scroll. The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara scroll, where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (latticed shutters). Next to <b>her</b> <b>is</b> an old-fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil-filled dish and wick {{on top of it}} (tōdai).|$|E
5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving <b>her</b> <b>is</b> more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time sitting on top of a rubbish bin, his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E

Tokarev.|$|R
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that her building had been sped up by using guns and/or turrets originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded <b>her</b> <b>is</b> not borne out as the guns and turrets were not ordered until July 1905. It seems more likely that Dreadnoughts turrets and guns merely received higher priority {{than those of the}} earlier ships.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Kazuaki Kiriya. It opens with the camera traveling through a tunnel full of lights, and includes the song's title and Utada's name. For {{the first part of}} the song, it has Utada singing into a microphone, whilst walking inside the head of a spacecraft. The spacecraft exits the station, and flies all over a futuristic cityscape. The first verse has Utada as a hostess on the spacecraft, helping and serving the passengers in a dancing manner; the passengers are wearing theatrical clothing and headpieces that cover their faces. During the pre-chorus, Utada sings in front of a forest-like backdrop, whilst a stop-motion animation of <b>her</b> <b>is</b> walking through the woods, observing disfigured creatures. The chorus has Utada and the passengers marching across a bridge, while continuous intercut scenes of Utada outside a party is seen.|$|E
5|$|Balu plays continual pranks on Geetha, {{during the}} course of which he also falls in love with her. She falls in love with him but circumstances, and their egos, prevent them both from expressing their feelings. One day, Balu pretends to suffer from chest pain, which scares Geetha, causing her to finally admit that she loves him. Later, when Geetha and Ramaiah go to Balu to enquire about his health, Balu, exiting from the bathroom, fails to see that Geetha is there. He tells Ramaiah about the prank he played on her, and that he was only pretending to have chest pain. Angry that she has been deceived by Balu, she begins to {{question}} whether or not his professed love for <b>her</b> <b>is</b> real. Hurt, she brings her friends, who are on a holiday trip to Shimla, to the residence and tries to drive Balu out of the house. When her plan backfires and her friends start supporting Balu, she becomes spiteful and tells her parents to move forward with a planned marriage to Sekar (S. A. Ashokan), a relative and an air force pilot.|$|E
50|$|In 1558, Margaret's remains <b>were</b> {{transferred}} because <b>her</b> coffin <b>was</b> rotten. <b>Her</b> clothes <b>were</b> also rotten, but <b>her</b> body <b>was</b> preserved. <b>Her</b> cultus <b>was</b> {{recognized by}} Pope Paul V in an equivalent beatification on October 19, 1609.|$|R

5|$|Further {{depictions of}} Mary {{are found in}} the church background. They include a statue of the Virgin and Child {{positioned}} between two lit candles in the choir screen behind the main figures, and to the right two angels stand in the choir singing her praises (perhaps singing the hymn inscribed on the frame). Above <b>her</b> <b>is</b> an annunciation relief, and in the recessed bay a relief depicting her coronation; the crucifixion is shown on the rood. Thus, the stages of Mary's life as mother of Jesus are depicted in the painting. A two-column prayer tablet – similar to the one depicted in Rogier van der Weyden's large Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (1445–50) – hangs on a pier to the left. It contains words alluding to and echoing the lines on the original frame. The windows of the clerestory overlook flying buttresses, and cobwebs are visible between the arches of the vault. Several different building phases {{can be seen in the}} arched gallery, while the choral balcony and transept are depicted in a more contemporary style than the nave.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) demands {{compensation}} for her voice work in Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) pornographic video game, Gorgasm: The Legend of Dong Slayer. The argument escalates and Liz orders {{them to stop}} their bickering. After Liz leaves for Chicago, Jenna and Tracy decide to conduct a social experiment to see whether Tracy can survive better as a white woman than Jenna can as a black man, after arguing respectively that black men and white women have it harder in society. Later, while on her flight, Liz takes Jack's sedative. Liz realizes that the woman sitting next to <b>her</b> <b>is</b> Oprah Winfrey. When Liz arrives back at the 30 Rock studios, Tracy is dressed in female drag with his body covered in white makeup and soon after, Jenna enters in blackface and male drag. Jack worries that the situation {{has gone out of}} control, but Liz assures him that Oprah, who is coming to the studios, {{will be able to make}} them come to terms. As it turns out, her inflight conversation with Oprah was a hallucination. The person who Liz thought was Oprah is actually a 12-year-old girl named Pam (Raven Goodwin). Even so, Pam engages Tracy and Jenna in a heart-to-heart, and manages to settle their differences.|$|E

Maureen notifies to him that she is out of cigarettes, {{and goes to the}} storeroom to resupply. Bruno Bianchi, who previously tried to dance with <b>her,</b> <b>is</b> at the premises and attempts to seduce her. A terrified Maureen begins to resist his attempts; the two later get into a scuffle. Dalton—checking on his order—witnesses the attack and gets into an altercation with Bianchi. Maureen stabs Bruno Bianchi in the neck with the heel of her shoes, killing him. Nick Dalton later informs her that Bianchi is the head of a local chapter of the Chicago Outfit. They dispose of his body in the Chicago River, and Dalton provides refuge for Maureen at his condominium.|$|E
