50|$|The M1917 RSC (for: Ribeyrolles, Sutter and Chauchat) was {{formally}} adopted in May 1916 and {{a fairly large}} number (86,000) had been manufactured by November 1918. It was less expensive to manufacture than the Meunier rifle since it used standard Lebel rifle components, notably: the barrel, stock, handguard, barrel bands and trigger guard. Above all else, it was chambered for the standard 8mm Lebel ammunition, which was loaded on special five-round en-bloc clips. The Mle 1917 RSC was gas operated with a rotating bolt, the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> being located underneath the barrel and near the muzzle as in the later M1 Garand rifle. The Mle 1917 was widely distributed among French infantry during 1918. However the troops did not like it as they found it too heavy, too long and too difficult to service and to maintain in the trenches. The weak point of this rifle {{was the size of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> located under {{the front end of the}} barrel. Because of its very small internal diameter the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> tended to foul up with repeated firings thus leading to weaker and weaker bolt returns in prolonged use. Hence the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> required frequent cleaning out (every 100 rounds or so) which could be performed after removing the large brass screw under the front end of the barrel. Furthermore, the special clip for the Mle 1917 was not particularly strong.|$|R

50|$|The Bushmaster Dissipator {{combines}} a longer sight radius with a shorter barrel {{to allow more}} effective use of the iron sights. Similar modifications sometimes suffer from reliability problems due to the close proximity of the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> to the muzzle, which throws {{the timing of the}} weapon's gas system off and makes it more sensitive to <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> diameter and port pressure variables introduced by the ammunition. Bushmaster's solution was to use a low-profile gas block in the normal position for carbine-length barrels and fit the front sight tower/gas block, which is not connected to the gas system, further forward to create the longer sight radius.|$|R

5000|$|Upper {{and lower}} {{receiver}}s: The lower receiver {{is a standard}} M4A1 lower receiver sometimes modified {{with the addition of}} a CQD RSM sling adapter plate. However, many CQBR rifles also use surplus M16A1 lower receivers. Internally, the CQBR also takes advantage of a larger <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> and modified bolt carrier and buffer assembly. The <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> has been opened to 0.070 in (1.8 mm). A number of Lewis Machine & Tool 10.5" [...] (266.7 mm) upper receivers have also been reported to have been purchased for the CQBR program. These upper receivers feature a gas system optimized for short barrel use. The Mod 1 makes use of a forward sight delete and full-length handguard to provide more rail space for the user.|$|R

50|$|After the {{introduction}} of the M4 Carbine, {{it was found that the}} shorter barrel length of 14.5 inches also has a negative effect on reliability, as the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> is located closer to the chamber than the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> of the standard length M16 rifle: 7.5 inches instead of 13 inches. This affects the M4’s timing and increases the amount of stress and heat on the critical components, thereby reducing reliability. In a 2002 assessment the USMC found that the M4 malfunctioned three times more often than the M16A4 (the M4 failed 186 times for 69,000 rounds fired, while the M16A4 failed 61 times). Thereafter, the Army and Colt worked to make modifications to the M4s and M16A4s in order to address the problems found. In tests conducted in 2005 and 2006 the Army found that on average, the new M4s and M16s fired approximately 5,000 rounds between stoppages.|$|R

50|$|The RM-38 was a Soviet 50 mm light {{infantry}} mortar, {{developed as}} {{a variant of the}} M1938 120 mm mortar. The barrel was clamped at two elevation angles only - 45 and 75 degrees. Range variations were made by altering a sleeve round the base of the barrel. This sleeve opened a series of <b>gas</b> <b>ports</b> which bled off exhaust gases and so determined the range.|$|R
50|$|The SPAS-12 was {{designed}} to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by depressing the button under the foregrip and also sliding the foregrip forwards or backwards until it clicks into position allowing the rotating sleeve to open or close the two <b>gas</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Ag m/42 is {{operated}} {{by means of}} a direct impingement gas system, {{similar to that of the}} French MAS-49 rifle. The Ag m/42 also uses a tilting breech block like the Tokarev SVT-38/SVT-40, the MAS-49 and FN FAL rifles. The Ag m/42 is ammunition specific since it does not have an adjustable <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> or valve to adjust the rifle to various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior.|$|R
50|$|The Dragunov is a semi-automatic, gas-operated rifle with a short-stroke gas-piston system. The barrel breech {{is locked}} through a {{rotating}} bolt (left rotation) and uses three locking lugs to engage corresponding locking recesses in the barrel extension. The rifle has a manual, two-position gas regulator. A gas regulator meters {{the portion of}} the combustion gases fed into the action in order to cycle the weapon and sets the recoil velocity of the gas-piston system. The gas regulator can be set {{with the help of the}} rim of a cartridge. The normal position #1 leaves a <b>gas</b> escape <b>port</b> opened in the form of a hole that lets some combustion gas escape during cycling. Position #2 closes the <b>gas</b> escape <b>port</b> and directs extra combustion gas to the piston increasing the recoil velocity of the gas-piston system and felt recoil. It is used for when the rifle does not reliably cycle due to carbon fouling build-up in the <b>gas</b> <b>port,</b> when shooting in extreme cold or high altitude or using low powered ammunition.|$|R
50|$|SA80 {{development}} was complicated from the start. One complication {{was at least}} three project staffing changes at the Royal Small Arms Factory, which resulted in repetition of testing several times. One problem with {{the design of the}} gun itself was that the cases would be ejected at constantly varying angles as it heated up and the rate of fire changed, resulting in a large ejection port. The conversion from 4.85 mm to 5.56 mm also caused a complication, as the rate of fire dropped dramatically as the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> was left in the same position, but the pressure and time curve of the rounds were different. The 4.85 mm round was based on the 5.56 mm case in anticipation of the need to convert calibres. The barrel was changed easily, but the <b>gas</b> <b>ports</b> had to be enlarged considerably. This was made worse by the production of ammunition with power that gave a lower port pressure and rate-of-fire. Pressure problems had less of an effect on the LSW due to its longer barrel.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Fusil Ametrellador Systema Mendoza" [...] Model 1934 is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated {{light machine}} gun {{weighing}} approximately 18.5 lb. The design features a quick-detachable barrel with 39 radial cooling fins, a flash hider and a bipod. The top-mounted, 20-or 30-round box magazine is offset to the right, allowing the sights to be centered. The rotating bolt has eight locking lugs in three rows that lock directly to the steel receiver. The gas system is fed from an adjustable <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> 11 inches {{from the rear of}} the barrel. Gas flows through a tube in the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> where it impinges on the recessed face of the piston, which forms part of the operating rod assembly. Cyclic firing rate is 380 to 550 rounds per minute (RPM) depending on the gas system setting. Designers consider that while the Mendoza borrows much from both the Lewis and the Hotchkiss machine guns, the Model 1934 is a first-class design in its own right. In many ways, the Mendoza Model 1934 is what the American BAR should have been.|$|R
