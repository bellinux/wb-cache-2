5000|$|The 905 {{area code}} was once {{used as a}} block of {{alternate}} numbers for calls from the United States to Mexico (+52-5-...) {{in the days when}} overseas calls otherwise would have needed to be placed through a telephone operator. This use became obsolete with the widespread introduction of <b>direct</b> <b>dial</b> <b>overseas</b> calls and was completely abolished no later than February 1, 1991. Partly because of this prior usage of the number 905, area code 905 was the last of the [...] "original-1947-format" [...] area codes (that is, area codes with [...] "0" [...] zero or [...] "1" [...] one for the middle digit, and 2-9 for the first digit) to be assigned.|$|R
