He left {{his wife and}} child behind him in Khotan, Liu Darin making himself answerable for their maintenance. But I also paid Fong Shi three months' salary in advance, and that money he gave to his wife. Whenever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> leisure he was to give me lessons in Chinese, and we began at once, even before we left Khotan...........|$|E

500|$|John Ottman {{served as}} both film editor and music {{composer}} for Apt Pupil. When he edited the film, {{he found it}} a challenge to create the proper musical score. Ottman recalled, [...] "Normally, an editor will score scenes with temporary music from CDs, and so forth, and nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> worked for this film." [...] The composer sought a mix between the scores of the science fiction film [...] (1968) and the military-based comedy 1941 (1979) to create an [...] "otherworldly pastiche".

500|$|The {{appearance}} of Molyneux's globes {{had a significant}} influence on the culture of his time. In Shakespeare's The Comedy of Errors, written between 1592 and 1594, one of the protagonists, Dromio of Syracuse, compares a kitchen maid to a terrestrial globe: [...] "No longer {{from head to foot}} than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> out countries in her." [...] The jest gained its point from the publication of the globes; Shakespeare may even have seen them himself.

[...] After Fleming met the ornithologist and his wife, he described them as [...] "a charming couple who are amused by the whole joke".

Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E

[...] Corgan said in 2005, [...] "I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan." [...] On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a [...] "mean-spirited drug addict" [...] and blaming Iha for the breakup of the Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that [...] "the depth of my hurt [...] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, [...] "No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy." ...|$|E
500|$|Phillips, meanwhile, {{was always}} on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader {{audience}} the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused. As Keisker reported, [...] "Over and over I remember Sam saying, 'If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> a white man who had the Negro sound and the Negro feel, I could make a billion dollars.'" [...] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, [...] "Without You", that he thought might suit the teenage singer. Presley came by the studio, but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing as many numbers as he knew. He was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield [...] "Scotty" [...] Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work something up with Presley for a recording session.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} 1974. The budget was $1.5 million. Pre-production lasted one week, including casting. Grittier sequences were {{shot on the}} streets of New York City, while less serious locations were shot on Warner Bros.' sound stages in Los Angeles. According to Bakshi, [...] "What I would do is dress guys up, live-action guys. Very strange dudes! The weirdest guys <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find.</b> Having them talk to animated characters in front of candy stores, discussing girlfriends and such. It was very surrealistic." [...] Yaphet Kotto and the glam punk band New York Dolls were cast in the live action sequences, with the New York Dolls playing homosexuals. Mean Streets actors Richard Romanus and David Proval were cast as the voices of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro. Much of the shooting of live action sequences and recording of animated dialogue involved improvisation, with Bakshi setting up the premise of the scene and allowing his actors to create their own dialogue. During the [...] "rumble" [...] sequence, the actors playing the Chaplains were filmed popping and performing styles of dance which later evolved into breakdancing, dance styles which were unheard of in the 1970s studio system.|$|E
500|$|Patton's {{training}} was effective, and on March 17, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division took Gafsa, winning the Battle of El Guettar, and pushing a German and Italian armored force back twice. In the meantime, on April 5, he removed Major General Orlando Ward, commanding the 1st Armored Division, after its lackluster performance at Maknassy against numerically inferior German forces. Advancing on Gabès, Patton's corps pressured the Mareth Line. During this time, he reported to British General Sir Harold Alexander, {{commander of the}} 18th Army Group, and came into conflict with Air Vice Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham {{about the lack of}} close air support being provided for his troops. When Coningham dispatched three officers to Patton's headquarters to persuade him that the British were providing ample air support, they came under German air attack mid-meeting, and part of the ceiling of Patton's office collapsed around them. Speaking later of the German pilots who had struck, Patton remarked, [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> the sons of bitches who flew those planes, I'd mail each of them a medal." [...] By the time his force reached Gabès, the Germans had abandoned it. He then relinquished command of II Corps to Bradley, and returned to the I Armored Corps in Casablanca to help plan Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. Fearing U.S. troops would be sidelined, he convinced British commanders to allow them to continue fighting through {{to the end of the}} Tunisia Campaign before leaving on this new assignment.|$|E
500|$|The year 1983 saw Streep play {{her first}} non-fictional character, the nuclear {{whistleblower}} and labor union activist Karen Silkwood {{who died in}} a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols's biographical film Silkwood. Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, [...] "I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>find</b> about her... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside." [...] Jack Kroll of Newsweek considered Streep's characterization to have been [...] "brilliant", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. Streep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance Falling in Love (1984), which was poorly received, and portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama Plenty (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed [...] "great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms." [...] In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep's performance in Plenty, believing it to be [...] "one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous" [...] films and [...] "most feminist" [...] role.|$|E
