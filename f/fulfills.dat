5|$|The Chintpurni ("She who <b>fulfills</b> one's wishes"), Himachal Pradesh {{temple of}} Chhinnamastika, {{is one of}} the Shakti Peethas (considered the holiest goddess temples) and is where the goddess Sati's {{forehead}} (mastaka) fell. Here, Chhinnamasta is interpreted as the severed-headed one as well as the foreheaded-one. The central icon is a pindi, an abstract form of Devi. While householders worship the goddess as a form of the goddess Durga, ascetic sadhus view her as the Tantric severed-headed goddess.|$|E
5|$|The IFC <b>fulfills</b> a {{treasury}} role {{by borrowing}} international capital to fund lending activities. It is usually {{one of the}} first institutions to issue bonds or to do swaps in emerging markets denominated in those markets' local currencies. The IFC's new international borrowings amounted to $8.8 billion in 2010 and $9.8 billion in 2011. The IFC Treasury actively engages in liquidity management in an effort to maximize returns and assure that funding for its investments is readily available while managing risks to the IFC.|$|E

Now this text {{is not one of}} His prophecies, but it is a prophecy about Him; one which He <b>fulfilled,</b> and which He has been <b>fulfilling</b> again and again. He is <b>fulfilling</b> it, as I believe, more than ever, now in these very days.|$|R
5|$|The {{responsibilities}} of Kraków's president include drafting and implementing resolutions, enacting city bylaws, managing the city budget, employing city administrators, and preparing against floods and natural disasters. The president <b>fulfills</b> his duties {{with the help}} of the City Council, city managers and city inspectors. In the 1990s, the city government was reorganised to better differentiate between its political agenda and administrative functions. As a result, the Office of Public Information was created to handle inquiries and foster communication between city departments and citizens at large.|$|E
5|$|Any {{class that}} <b>fulfills</b> the {{allocator}} requirements {{can be used}} as an allocator. In particular, a class A capable of allocating memory for an object of type T must provide the types A::pointer, A::const_pointer, A::reference, A::const_reference, and A::value_type for generically declaring objects and references (or pointers) to objects of type T. It should also provide type A::size_type, an unsigned type which can represent the largest size for an object in the allocation model defined by A, and similarly, a signed integral A::difference_type that can represent the difference between any two pointers in the allocation model.|$|E
5|$|Further in Skáldskaparmál, Snorri relates a story where Loki {{cuts off}} Sif's hair as a prank. When Thor discovers this, he {{grabs hold of}} Loki, {{resulting}} in Loki swearing to have a headpiece made of gold to replace Sif's locks. Loki <b>fulfills</b> this promise by having a headpiece made by dwarfs, the Sons of Ivaldi. Along with the headpiece, the dwarfs produced Odin's spear, Gungnir. As the story progresses, the incident leads {{to the creation of}} the ship Skíðblaðnir and the boar Gullinbursti for Freyr, the multiplying ring Draupnir for Odin, and the mighty hammer Mjöllnir for Thor.|$|E
60|$|No prophecy of Scripture is {{of private}} interpretation.

The perceived sustainability of <b>fulfilling</b> non-shareholding stakeholders’ claims was assessed with the question, “To what degree do you think that <b>fulfilling</b> this claim sustainably enhances the airport operator’s corporate success?” on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much).|$|R
50|$|Individual self-realization {{rests on}} each individual's desire to <b>fulfill</b> their egoism. The {{difference}} between an unwilling and a willing egoist, is that the former will be 'possessed' by an empty idea and {{believe that they are}} <b>fulfilling</b> a higher cause, but usually being unaware that they are only <b>fulfilling</b> their own desires to be happy or secure, and the latter, in contrast, will be a person that is able to freely choose its actions, fully aware that they are only <b>fulfilling</b> individual desires.|$|R
5|$|In euryarchaea {{the cell}} {{division}} protein FtsZ, which forms a contracting {{ring around the}} cell, and {{the components of the}} septum that is constructed across the center of the cell, are similar to their bacterial equivalents. In cren- and thaumarchaea, however, the cell division machinery Cdv <b>fulfills</b> a similar role. This machinery is related to the eukaryotic ESCRT-III machinery which, while best known for its role in cell sorting, also has been seen to fulfill a role in separation between divided cell, suggesting an ancestral role in cell division.|$|E
5|$|Motherhood, a theme {{throughout}} Angelou's autobiographies, {{becomes more}} complex in The Heart of a Woman. Although Guy {{struggles with the}} developmentally appropriate process of adolescent separation from his mother, they remain close. Many years of experience as a mother, and her success as a writer, actress, and activist, enable Angelou to behave more competently and with more maturity, professionally and as a mother. Her self-assurance becomes {{a major part of}} her personality. Her past conflict between her professional and personal lives are resolved, and she <b>fulfills</b> her promise to Guy she made to him {{at the end of her}} previous autobiography that they would never be separated again. Lupton writes that Angelou resolves this conflict by subordinating her needs to her child's.|$|E
5|$|Osteogenesis imperfecta, {{known as}} brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone {{disorder}} {{which can be}} lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in Type-I collagen, which <b>fulfills</b> a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in mammals. The mutation causes a deformation in collagen's triple helix structure, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new quantum mechanical method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.|$|E

5|$|Choosing {{to support}} a Reason {{will result in a}} {{different}} ending depending on who is chosen, but in each the world is reborn {{in the image of the}} chosen Reason after the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi to prove his resolve. Chiaki and Isamu die before the Demi-fiend begins and give him their blessing in spirit form, while Hikawa accompanies the Demi-fiend into their new world. If Takao's wishes are followed, the Demi-fiend fights Kagutsuchi and the world is returned to its pre-Conception state, resurrecting and restoring all the main characters. If the Demi-fiend rejects Takao's wishes, Kagutsuchi curses him for allowing the world to die and departs, leaving the Demi-fiend as the only survivor in a barren world of demons, trapped as it is until another Conception can happen. If the Demi-fiend <b>fulfills</b> Lucifer's request of collecting the Candelabra from the Fiends, Kagutsuchi attacks him and is destroyed, breaking the Great Will's control over the worlds. After this, Lucifer fights the Demi-fiend to test his strength, then declares him to be the ultimate weapon in the upcoming war against the Great Will.|$|E
5|$|In Lightning Returns, Hope {{resides in}} a special base {{constructed}} within the new Cocoon called the Ark, communicating with Lightning via a wireless com-link. Hope is returned to his 14-year-old image and stripped of his emotions by Bhunivelze, but retains his memories from the past two games. He is instrumental in keeping the world going, for as Lightning completes quests and <b>fulfills</b> missions, he uses energy generated from those acts to prolong the world's life. On the final day, Hope reveals that he acted as Bhunivelze's eyes and ears, and will now be disposed of. Bhunivelze then uses Hope as an avatar, speaking with Lightning and capturing her allies. During the final battle Lightning frees him from Bhunivelze's control, then Hope aids her in defeating Bhunivelze for good.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of comparative philology in the 19th century, together with ethnological discoveries in the 20th century, established {{the science of}} myth. Since the Romantics, all study of myth has been comparative. Wilhelm Mannhardt, James Frazer, and Stith Thompson employed the comparative approach to collect and classify the themes of folklore and mythology. In 1871 Edward Burnett Tylor published his Primitive Culture, in which he applied the comparative method {{and tried to explain}} the origin and evolution of religion.* Robert A. Segal, Theorizing about Myth, 16 Tylor's procedure of drawing together material culture, ritual and myth of widely separated cultures influenced both Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell. Max Müller applied the new science of comparative mythology to the study of myth, in which he detected the distorted remains of Aryan nature worship. Bronisław Malinowski emphasized the ways myth <b>fulfills</b> common social functions. Claude Lévi-Strauss and other structuralists have compared the formal relations and patterns in myths throughout the world.|$|E

5|$|Unless {{the player}} imports a Mass Effect 2 saved game where Tali cannot appear in Mass Effect 3, Tali shows when the Commander moves to recruit the quarian fleet {{in the fight}} against the Reapers, {{powerful}} sapient cyborgs with intentions to destroy all life. Tali joins the squad, and her conversation options tell of the quarians' new attack on the now Reaper-allied geth, in a bid by the quarians to try and reclaim their homeworld. Depending on the player's choices in the second game, Tali may either be an Admiral or merely an advisor on how to defeat the geth. Eventually, the player must choose between saving the geth or the quarians, or, if certain conditions are fulfilled, negotiating a stand-down and saving both parties. If the player sides with the geth and lets the quarians die, Tali kills herself; otherwise, she fully joins the squad and can be found interacting with other Normandy crew members. Admiral Shala'Raan vas Tonbay <b>fulfills</b> Tali's role in saved games where Tali cannot appear in-game. Shala'Raan does not join Shepard's squad.|$|E
5|$|When {{the pilgrims}} reach the {{appropriate}} Miqat (depending on where they're coming from), they {{enter into a}} state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male, with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side; wearing ordinary dress for the female that <b>fulfills</b> the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered; taking ablution; declaring the intention (niyah) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails, shaving any part of the body, having sexual relations; using perfumes, damaging plants, killing animals, covering head (for men) or the face and hands (for women); getting married; or carrying weapons. The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God: there is no difference between the rich and the poor.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the Waking Sands, {{the heroes}} {{discover}} a few Scions who escaped the attack, {{as well as}} the location of their abducted comrades. They mount a rescue mission to the Garlean Castrum Centri, stealing uniforms and a magitek reaper for disguise. Minfilia and the others are retrieved but they also learn that Lahabrea had possessed Thancred during the course of his investigation into the Ascian threat. Minfilia and Alphinaud barge into a meeting between the three Grand Company leaders who had been considering surrender in the face of Ultima Weapon's power and convince them to fight against Garlean oppression. Using the combined forces of all three nations as well as other allied groups, the Eorzean Alliance executes Operation Archon—a massive counteroffensive that aims to assault every Garlean Castrum simultaneously. The player leads a strike team into the Praetorium where the Ultima Weapon is housed. Using Hydaelyn's blessing of light, the adventurer strips Ultima Weapon of its primal aether. The weapon destroys the Praetorium using Ultima magic but the player's team is protected by Hydaelyn's light and dismantles it. Lahabrea attacks personally but the player <b>fulfills</b> the vision {{at the beginning of his}} or her adventure by striking Thancred free from Lahabrea's possession using a blade of light. With the threat of Garlean invasion lifted, the Grand Company leaders declare the beginning of the Seventh Astral Era. The player's character is hailed as a hero of the same caliber as the Warriors of Light.|$|E
