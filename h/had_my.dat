5|$|Because I {{always try}} {{so hard to}} win and <b>had</b> <b>my</b> {{troubles}} in Boston, I was suspended. At playoff time it hurts {{not be in the}} game with the boys. However, I want to do what is good for the people of Montreal and the team. So that no further harm will be done, I would like to ask everyone to get behind the team and to help the boys win from the New York Rangers and Detroit. I will take my punishment and come back next year to help the club and the younger players to win the Cup.|$|E

The following day, Reid accepted a coaching role assisting Williams {{until the end of}} the 2015–16 season. Although he was yet to feature for the club that season due to injury, Reid still harboured hopes of playing again and told Forest Player HD “I’m going to be coupling this with my rehab – I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> operation four weeks ago – and I’m still trying to get back".|$|E

Later, especially after rock 'n' roll came along, I made the 'rumba' bass part heavier and heavier. I'd have the string bass, an electric guitar and a baritone all in unison.|$|E

25|$|Since I am anxious {{that you}} should all know {{something}} about my trip and {{the condition of the}} country as we find it in British East Africa, I am sending this general letter. I have <b>had</b> <b>my</b> first visit to a native village where goats, sheep and human beings occupy the same hut. The houses are built of bamboo and thatched with grass; the center or highest point is about ten feet, sloping to the outer edge until the door or hole to crawl through is about three feet high.... The chief occupation for the men is herding goats; the women do the gardening, wood chopping, carrying of heavy loads, etc. The women carried all our trunks and baggage from the depot up to the mission station, a distance of about three miles. It is considered a disgrace for a man to carry a load of wood, pail of water, etc.|$|E
25|$|I <b>had</b> <b>my</b> editor count shots. There are 139 dance {{shots in}} the film. 111 are Natalie Portman untouched. 28 are her dance double Sarah Lane. If you do the math, that's 80% Natalie Portman. What about duration? The shots that feature the double are wide shots and rarely play for longer than one second. There are two {{complicated}} longer dance sequences that we used face replacement. Even so, if we were judging by time, over 90% would be Natalie Portman. And to be clear, Natalie did dance on pointe in pointe shoes. If {{you look at the}} final shot of the opening prologue, which lasts 85 seconds, and was danced completely by Natalie, she exits the scene on pointe. That is completely her without any digital magic. I am responding to this to put this to rest and to defend my actor. Natalie sweated long and hard to deliver a great physical and emotional performance. And I don't want anyone to think that's not her they are watching. It is.|$|E
