40|$|We have {{compared}} historical changes in concentrations {{of the heavy}} metals Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb accumulated in samples from the Polish woodlands of Beskidy and Karkonosze (S, SE Poland) and the north-east regions of the country, versus the relatively little polluted areas of Spitsbergen of the Svalbard Archipelago. We have combined the results from literature with new results from 2014. The regions of Beskidy and Karkonosze were the most exposed to <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> <b>deposition.</b> However, from 1975 to 2014 there was a considerable decrease of concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb at all Polish sites, clearly signifying improvement of environmental quality. For example, the average Cd concentration in mosses samples collected in Karkonosze decreased from 0. 002 mg/g in 1975 to 0. 0006 mg/g in 2014. It is interesting to observe relatively large concentrations of nickel in moss samples collected in 2014 in the Svalbard archipelago, {{in the vicinity of}} Longyearbyen (average 0. 018 mg/g) which most likely originate from local mine waste piles. air pollutions, biomonitoring, heavy metals, mosses, Poland, Svalbar...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metals are {{chemical}} elements {{with a specific}} gravity that is {{at least five times}} the specific gravity of water. The specific gravity is a measure of density of a given amount of a solid substance when it is being compared to an equal amount of water. Heavy metals are closely connected with environmental deterioration and the quality of human life, and thus have aroused concern all over the world. Heavy metals may enter the human body through food, water, air, or absorption through the skin when they come in contact with humans in agriculture and in manufacturing, pharmaceutical, industrial, or residential settings. Metal toxicity unlike some organic substances, are not metabolically degradable and their accumulation in living tissues can cause death or serious health threats. However, <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> <b>deposition</b> in water and sediment in Balok and Tunggak River is not well documented, and scientific evidence is very limited. The research proposed to assessment of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> <b>deposition</b> in water and sediment in Balok and Tunggak River, Kuantan, Malaysia. Samples were collected every month from November 2010 to November 2012 and analyses for the regional variability for the concentrations of Al, As, Cr, Cd, Ch, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were done using ICP-MS. Rotary milling in agate mortar and microwave digestion (MDG) procedure was performed for the dissolution of the sediment samples before the determination of heavy metals. The presence of heavy metal has proven to influence human activity, mainly from chemical industry, chipboard industry, domestic waste disposal, etc.; they deteriorate since water quality of Balok and Tunggak River. Pearson's correlation between elements in water and sediment showed weak correlation due to the changing of the river flow rate every ±six hours. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Enrichment Factor (EF) had proven that sources of a pollutant were dominated by anthropogenic activity (industry and domestic waste) more than natural activity. The Contamination factor (Cf) proved that water column in Balok River and Tunggak River have been contaminated by Al, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, and Pb, which are probably influenced by anthropogenic activity, contamination by sedimentation, and natural source. Therefore, heavy metal pollution monitoring in Balok River and Tunggak River are needed in order to provide baseline data, which can be used by local authorities for environmental management, especially to improve river water quality...|$|E

The methodological study concerns {{the effects of}} different types of pre-treatment on data variability. Epiphytic samples of Hypnum cupressiforme were collected from an unpolluted area, treated in different ways, and the resulting bags were exposed in two sites in the province of Trieste (NE ltaly) with widely different pollution: a natural woodland far from urban and industrial centers, and a site near an iron smelting industry in the industrial area of Trieste. The content of eight heavy metals (Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb) was measured in 80 moss samples by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The results, which represent a contribution to the standardization of the moss bags technique, concern: a) variability of metal conteni in mosses from natural areas: this is influenced by soil contamination; it is advisable to collect epiphytic samples, avoiding those growing near the base of the trunks; b) effects of different washing treatments on metal contents: compared to distilled water, washing with an acid solution is particularly efficient in removing metal ions associateci with the cell wall, but produces more variable data; c) uptake capacity of exposed moss bags: this is not influenced by the type of washing, and even short periods of exposure were sufficient to reveal differences in metal depositions between the two sites...|$|E

Vegetable cropping along major highways with heavy vehicular movement has been a serious concern to food safety experts in large cities. A study was, therefore, carried out in two major highways in Lagos, Nigeria {{to determine the extent of}} lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) contamination in vegetable tissues. Samples of soil and plant (Amaranthus viridis) were collected from three sites; two of which were located on major highways, and another in a rural area which served as the reference site. These samples were collected at distances of 5, 10, 15 and 20 m from the roadside and analysed for Pb and Cd. Levels of Pb and Cd in soil were found to be 47 to 151 mg kg- 1 and 0. 30 to 1. 33 mg kg- 1 (dry weight) respectively. Concentrations in leaves ranged from 68 to 152 mg kg- 1 and 0. 5 to 4. 9 mg kg- 1 (dry weight) for Pb and Cd, respectively. The pattern of these <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> <b>deposition,</b> as reflected by the plant concentration factor (PCF) values, showed decrease in concentration with increase in distance from the road. Heavy metal concentrations in Amaranthus cultivated on soils characterized by heavy traffic were significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 05) than those cultivated on the reference soil.

40|$|Industrialization and {{urbanization}} {{have led}} to increasingly serious levels of atmospheric <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> pollution, {{which is one of}} the main sources of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> to terrestrial ecosystems. Therefore, it is essential to quantify atmospheric fluxes and explore their potential effects on natural ecosystems and human welfare. We monitored water-soluble <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr)) in rainfalls on a monthly basis in 2013 and 2014, at 31 field stations located in typical natural Chinese ecosystems. The average soluble Pb, Cd, and Cr deposition was 1. 90 1. 54, 0. 28 0. 25, and 0. 96 +/- 0. 48 mg m(- 2) yr(- 1), respectively, with a large variation among the different sites. Generally, the atmospheric deposition of soluble Pb, Cd, and Cr was higher in the southwest, central, south, and north China than in the northwest and northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Qinghai-Tibet. As expected, the atmospheric <b>heavy</b> soluble <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> fluxes were significantly correlated with the number of vehicles (Ps < 0. 1). The wet deposition of soluble Pb and Cr was positively correlated with oil and coal consumption, unlike Cd deposition. Moreover, soluble Pb and Cd in atmospheric wet deposition were positively correlated with the contents of Pb and Cd in soil at different regions. In this study, atmospheric <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> through rainfall in typical natural ecosystems in China is assessed at the national scale, alerting potential ecological hazards resulting from an increasing atmospheric <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> and providing a basis for future studies.

Observational {{studies have demonstrated}} a correlation between fluvial <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> and hyporheic microbial community structure. To establish a causal relationship between sediment metal content {{and the structure of}} colonizing bacterial communities, we performed a controlled field experiment. River sediments of 1. 75 − 2. 36 mm in diameter with five different contaminant concentrations were collected from an environmental metal contamination gradient. Sediments were sterilized and then recolonized by incubation in the hyporheic zone of an uncontaminated river (i. e., a common garden experiment was performed). A significant correlation between hyporheic microbial community structure and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> contamination (R 2 = 0. 81) was observed.

40|$|Abstract The thesis {{consists}} of regional forest condition studies, using different biomonitors. <b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> {{was investigated in}} 1985 – 2000 {{on the basis of}} the <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Ni, Pb, V, Zn) in mosses in Finland. A comparison on the suitability of mosses, epiphytic lichens and pine bark as biomonitors of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> was also carried. Bark was also used to study the dispersal of emissions from the Kola Peninsula into northern Finland. The occurrence of green algae on conifers in Finland was investigated in 1985 and 1995. Regional and temporal differences were found in the <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations of mosses in Finland. The concentrations of most metals were the highest in southern Finland, and they decreased towards the north. Some of the major emission source had a noticeable effect on the Cu, Ni and Cr concentrations of mosses in the surroundings of the emission sources. The Pb, Cd and V concentrations decreased the most during the study period. Mosses, lichens and bark gave a relatively similar result for <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> in Finland. However, the comparisons indicated that mosses are better suited as biomonitors for regional surveys than epiphytic lichens, because the regional differences in <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> were more readily reflected by concentrations in mosses than in lichens. Bark is relatively unsuitable for regional surveys due to the small range of variation in the concentrations. Emissions from the Kola Peninsula had a clear effect on the sulphur and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations of pine bark. The concentrations in bark were at very high levels close to the smelters, but they rapidly decreased on moving towards the west. The effects of emissions were still clearly visible in north-eastern Lapland. There was strong increase in the abundance of green algae on conifers in southern and central Finland during the period 1985 – 1995. The increase is probably due to following factors: climate warming, and an increase in nitrogen and a decrease in sulphur in their habitats. Half of each biomonitor sample collected in the surveys has been stored in the specimen bank at Paljakka. The storage of samples offers advantages for monitoring purposes. The availability of long-term sample series makes it possible to construct retrospective time series of the pollutants.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Heavy</b> <b>metals</b> may {{influence}} chemical composition of plants, and thus shape elemental stoichiometry of plant communities. That is because some physiological processes aiming at neutralization of contaminant toxicity require increased acquisition of some nutrients (e. g. N, S, P or Ca). The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> in Poland using moss Pleurozium schreberi as a bioindicator, and check whether C/N, C/S, C/P and Ca/Mg ratios in mosses correspond with the accumulation of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> <b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in mosses were highly variable across the study area – southern parts of the country, industrialized and densely populated, were the most contaminated. There were significant correlations between nutrient ratios and metal accumulation in mosses. Mosses seem to take 1) more N, P and S under Cu contamination, and 2) more Ca under Zn contamination. This increased acquisition of nutrients, mainly N and Ca, may be a response to higher toxicity of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals.</b> Further studies are required to exclude other causes for observed relationships...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} correlations between <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in mosses and modelled deposition values {{as well as}} other site-specific and regional characteristics to determine which factors primarily affect cadmium, lead and mercury concentrations in mosses. The resulting relationships could potentially be used to enhance the spatial resolution of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> maps across Europe. Materials and methods Modelled <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> data and data on the concentration of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in naturally growing mosses were integrated into a geographic information system and analysed by means of bivariate rank correlation analysis and multivariate decision trees. Modelled deposition data were validated annually with deposition measurements at up to 63 EMEP measurement stations within the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), and mosses were collected at up to 7, 000 sites at 5 - year intervals between 1990 and 2005. Results and discussion Moderate to high correlations were found between cadmium and lead concentrations in mosses and modelled atmospheric deposition of these metals: Spearman rank correlation coefficients were between 0. 62 and 0. 67, and 0. 67 and 0. 73 for cadmium and lead, respectively (p< 0. 001). Multivariate decision tree analyses showed that cadmium and lead concentrations in mosses were primarily determined by the atmospheric <b>deposition</b> of these <b>metals,</b> followed by emissions of the metals. Low to very low correlations were observed between mercury concentrations in mosses and modelled atmospheric deposition of mercury. According to the multivariate analyses, spatial variations of the mercury concentration in mosses was primarily associated with the sampled moss species and not with the modelled deposition, but regional differences in the atmospheric chemistry of mercury and corresponding interactions with the moss may also be involved. Conclusions At least for cadmium and lead, concentrations in mosses are a valuable tool in determining and mapping the spatial variation in atmospheric deposition across Europe at a high spatial resolution. For mercury, more studies are needed to elucidate interactions of different chemical species with the moss...|$|R

Twenty-eight European countries, almost 7000 sites and about 100 individuals {{have been involved in the}} most recent survey in 2000 / 2001. The survey provides data on concentrations of 10 <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, nickel, vanadium, zinc) in naturally growing mosses throughout Europe.

The aims of the survey are to determine patterns of variation in the <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentration of mosses across Europe, identify the main polluted areas, produce regional maps and further develop the understanding of long-range transboundary pollution. As in previous surveys, there was an east/west decrease in <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in mosses, related in particular to industrial emissions. Former industrial sites and historic mines accounted for the location of some high concentrations in areas without contemporary industries. Long-range transboundary transport appears to account for elevated concentrations of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in areas without emission sources, such as lead in southern Scandinavia (presumably from emission sources elsewhere in Europe) ...|$|R

The principal period of monitoring was designed to coincide with contemporaneous changes in the operation of the complex involving, the incorporation of new smelting and refining centres. The initial phase of the sampling programme began with a preliminary multi-element survey to establish the degree of communality between different metals in smelter emissions and their interrelationships with background factors. <b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> was monitored at bimonthly intervals over a two year period at 40 bulk precipitation sites located within an area of 250 km[sup]- 2. In a complementary survey suspended moss-bags were collected at bimonthly intervals from 60 sites over a period of one year. Bimonthly levels of Pb deposition at these sites ranged from 7. 0 to 1148 g ha[sup]- 1 in bulk precipitation and 31 to 1792 mg kg[sup]- 1 in moss-bags. The longer term pollution effects resulting from smelter emissions were assessed by determining retrospective <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> accumulations in saxicolous lichens and coniferous woodland soil profiles. The results of these surveys have been subjected to a range of interactive computer application packages including statistical analysis, computer mapping and plotting techniques.

At the distant site poplar grows well and faunal activity is intense, so there are skeletonized leaves and many organo mineral earthworm and millipede faecal pellets. The humus form is a mull, with a well-developed hemorganic A horizon. The passage from mor to mull along the transect was abrupt, mor turning to mull at 250 m from the smelter, though there was a progressive decrease in <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition.</b> This indicates that there was a threshold (estimated to be 20 000 mg Zn kg- 1) in the resilience of the soil foodweb...|$|R
40|$|Ombrotrophic peatlands {{are highly}} {{sensitive}} to atmospheric <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition.</b> Previous attempts to quantify peatland lead pollution have been undertaken using the inventory approach. However, {{there can be}} significant within-site spatial heterogeneity in lead concentrations, highlighting the need for multiple samples to properly quantify lead storage. Field portable x-ray fluorescence (FPXRF) continues to gain acceptance {{in the study of}} contaminated soil, but has not thus far been used to assess peatland lead contamination. This study compares lead concentrations in surface peat samples from the South Pennines (UK) derived using (a) FPXRF in the field, (b) FPXRF in the lab on dried samples and (c) ICP-OES analysis. FPXRF field and lab data are directly comparable when field measurements are corrected for water content, both can be easily used to estimate acid extractable lead using regression equations. This study is a successful demonstration of FPXRF as a tool for a time- and cost-effective means of determining the lead content of contaminated peatlands, which will allow rapid landscape scale reconnaissance, core logging, surface surveys and sediment tracing...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} 35 years the {{temporal}} and spatial trends of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> have been followed at regular intervals all over Norway. From the extensive evidence available {{it is clear that}} airborne Pb, Zn, Cd, As, Sb, Sn, Hg, and V have all been added in excessive amounts to the environment in the southernmost part of the country. Analyses of aerosol samples, precipitation, moss samples, and surface soils all demonstrate substantial contamination of southernmost Norway from long-range atmospheric transport. Moss biomonitoring at regular intervals since 1977 show substantially decreasing deposition over time for these metals, but levels in natural surface soils are still far above normal levels in the south. Concentrations of Pb in vascular plants have decreased at similar rates as shown in the moss, whereas Zn and Cd contents maintain a more constant level due to root uptake from the contaminated soil. Hg levels in moss and natural surface soil show little {{temporal and spatial}} variation, and may be mainly affected by net deposition of hemispheric Hg 0...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous soil {{acidification}} and <b>deposition</b> of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> {{is a major}} concern for forest and agricultural soils of the Black Triangle region of East Central Europe including southern former East Germany, northern Bohemia of the Czech Republic, and southern Poland. The objective of this project was to develop historical and future projections of acid and <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> to soils (As, Cd, Pb, Zn) and to produce a preliminary map of soil sensitivity to cadmium pollution and uptake by crops. Ultimately, we wish to assess the relative hazard and recovery times of soils to <b>metals</b> <b>deposition</b> in the region. Emission and deposition data bases obtained from several models developed at IIASA were linked using the Geographical Information System ARC/INFO to produce soil maps of sensitivity to cadmium mobility based on <b>metals</b> <b>deposition,</b> soil type, soil texture, organic matter content, and acid deposition. RAINS 6. 1 (Alcamo et al., 1990) was utilized to produce maps of acid deposition for EMEP grids (150 km x 150 km). The largest amount of acid load is deposited in southern East Germany. Sulfur deposition in that area was 10 - 12 gS/m 2 /yr in 1990, and S+N deposition exceeded 8000 eq/ha/yr. But the "hot spot" for <b>metals</b> <b>deposition</b> is further to the east, in the Silesia area of southern Poland. The TRACE 2 trajectory model of Alcamo, Bartnicki, and Olendrzynski (1992) was used to estimate cumulative <b>metals</b> <b>deposition</b> since 1955 with scenarios to 2010. Pb has improved over Europe since 1970 when depositions in the Ruhr River Valley of West Germany exceeded 60 mg/m 2 /yr. But cadmium deposition in southern Poland (Katowice and Krakow) has now accumulated to 60 - 70 mg/m 2 by atmospheric deposition alone. During base case simulations from 1955 - 87, approximately 1. 8 mg/kg Pb and 0. 12 mg/kg Cd {{have been added to the}} mixed plow-layer of ∼ 30 cm. If these emissions continue indefinitely, the accumulation of metals will become problematic for agriculture and the food chain...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{examines the}} deposition of airborne particles which contain <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> and investigates the methods {{that can be}} used to identify their sources. The research focuses on lead and cadmium because these two metals are of growing public and scientific concern on environmental health grounds. The research consists of three distinct parts. The first is the development and evaluation of a new deposition measurement instrument - the deposit cannister - designed specifically for large-scale surveys in urban areas. The deposit cannister is specifically designed to be cheap, robust, and versatile and therefore to permit comprehensive high-density urban surveys. The siting policy reduces contamination from locally resuspended surface-dust. The second part of the research has involved detailed surveys of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> in Walsall, West Midlands, using the new high-density measurement method. The main survey, conducted over a six-week period in November - December 1982, provided 30 -day samples of deposition at 250 different sites. The results have been used to examine the magnitude and spatial variability of deposition rates in the case-study area, and to evaluate the performance of the measurement method. The third part of the research has been to conduct a 'source-identification' exercise. The methods used have been Receptor Models - Factor Analysis and Cluster Analysis - and a predictive source-based deposition model. The results indicate that there are six main source processes contributing to <b>deposition</b> of <b>metals</b> in the Walsall area: coal combustion, vehicle emissions, ironfounding, copper refining and two general industrial/urban processes. |A source-based deposition model has been calibrated using facctorscores for one source factor as the dependent variable, rather than <b>metal</b> <b>deposition</b> rates, thus avoiding problems traditionally encountered in calibrating models in complex multi-source areas. Empirical evidence supports the hypothesised associatlon of this factor with emissions of metals from the ironfoundry industry...|$|R
40|$|Ombrotrophic bogs {{are used}} to {{reliably}} assess past and present levels of <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> <b>depositions</b> through chemical analyses of peat layers. Instead, surface waters collected in ombrotrophic bogs were never tested as an alternative way to assess atmospheric precipitation quality, although the solely source of water in bogs is by atmospheric precipitation. In the present paper the reliability of bog water to mirror atmospheric precipitation quality has been tested. To this aim, <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in bog water were compared to both rainwater chemistry, and tissue chemistry of Hylocomium splendens, a moss frequently used as biomonitor. Bog water was periodically sampled in three different microhabitats, i. e., a hummock, a carpet, and a hollow at two bogs, located in the south-eastern Alps of Italy. Microhabitats were selected in order to encompass a gradient of water table depth from relatively dry to relatively wet conditions, respectively. Basing on surface peat and bog water chemistry {{as well as on}} hydrological measurements, selected microhabitats were shown to be ombrotrophic, i. e., their mineral input was solely by atmospheric precipitation. <b>Heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in bog water did not differ significantly among microhabitats, with the only exception of Fe which showed significantly higher concentrations in hummock water. Because of the lack of rainwater chemical information for the study area, mean <b>heavy</b> <b>metal</b> concentrations in rainwater were obtained from a set of European stations monitoring atmospheric precipitation. A significant relationship was found between <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in rainwater and bog water, further supported by the positive relationship between emission amounts of Cd, Cr, Cu, Zn, and Pb in Italy and the corresponding values in bog water during the study period. Concentrations of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals</b> in bog water were then compared with corresponding concentrations in H. splendens collected in the nearby of the study bogs. Moss chemistry has been here used as a proxy of atmospheric precipitation chemistry, basing on the reliability of mosses to mirror local precipitation chemistry as widely demonstrated by biomonitoring surveys. Bog water and moss tissues showed the same pattern of variation of concentrations, although moss tissues were characterised by higher absolute concentrations of <b>heavy</b> <b>metals...</b>|$|R
