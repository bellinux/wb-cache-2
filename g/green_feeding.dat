40|$|Summary This work {{is aimed}} at parrot {{breeding}} of genus Rossella in Europe, in different climatic conditions than the conditions in the Southeast and South Australia where the birds come from. Here, you can find overview of their occurrence in nature, evaluation of biotope, feeding and information on breeding in human custody. Eastern Rosellas (Platycersus eximius) live in pairs and each pair is very protective of their own nesting teritory. Outside of the nesting season, Rosellas are moving around the land in small groups. In nature, these parrots eat grain from grass or weeds, seeds from bushes, trees and of course fruit. The nesting season starts around february and lasts until august. In nature Rosellas nest in hollow trees, branches, tree stumps, columns, on top of fence post and even in rabbit holes. The best option {{when it comes to}} breeding Rosellas, is an outside aviary, which best represents their natural habitat. European winter causes them little to no trouble, the same goes for severe frost, which allows for year-round stay in the outside aviary. Rosellas have the similar eating habits as their parrot brethren, meaning sunflower seeds, millet, panic grass, canary and oat. An important supplement in their daily diet is <b>green</b> <b>feed(ing),</b> fresh fruit and vegetable, branches to nibble on, mineral substances, and fresh drinking water. During the nesting season and while with young, it is necessary to feed the birds an egg mixture, it is an important source of protein. Breeding of Rosellas is fairly effortless, they can easily nest even in small spaces. Ideal size of their bird house would be 25 x 25 x 60 - 70 cm with a fly-in entrance of 7 - 8 cm. It is necessary to hang the bird houses as high as possible in the protected part of aviary. Female lays 5 - 7 white colored eggs, on which she sits 21 - 22 days. Young birds leave the nest in age between 28 - 35 days and then, are are partly fed additional 10 - 14 days by the male. Among the most frequent diseases of this species of pet birds belong those non contagious, e. g. hypovitaminosis, uricosis and, furthermore parasitical ones and pathogens as well as other contagious diseases or feather abnormalities, such as the so called French defeathering. Breeding of Rosellas does not require an experienced breeder. With proper care, Rosellas can live up to 25 - 30 years and remain fertile their whole lives...|$|E

30|$|The {{current study}} {{has shown that}} <b>Green</b> <b>feed,</b> concentrates, hay, non-conventional feeds and natural pasture grazing, in that order, were the most {{important}} feed resources in Jimma town. Wheat bran and commercial concentrate mix were the dominant concentrates for supplementation. Feed scarcity was identified as the most important constraint especially during the dry season. Lack of access to land was reported as the most important cause of feed scarcity. Farmers’ adopted coping strategies against feed shortage were increased utilization of agro-industrial by-products and commercial concentrate mix, conserved hay, non-conventional <b>feeds,</b> purchased <b>green</b> <b>feeds</b> and reducing herd size. It is concluded that to ensure sustainable availability of dairy cattle feed in the surveyed area, technological, technical and institutional innovations would be vital. Government intervention in allocating land to the smallholder dairy farmers for feed production should be the first important intervention. The adoption of tree legume forages as live fences, use of Urea-Molasses-Blocks and increased conservation and proper storage of hay, and utilization of the locally available crop residues could be of importance in alleviating feed shortage and reducing the high feed costs.|$|R

40|$|Despite a {{great deal}} of anecdotal {{evidence}} linking summer–autumn rainfall events to the position of break (POB) of wool from sheep grazed in a Mediterranean environment, there are no published experiments directly investigating this relationship. This trial examined the effects on staple strength (SS) and POB of simulated rainfall onto sheep grazing dry pasture residues during February and April. The simulated rainfall events had few significant effects on the wool quality parameters of the sheep in this trial. The natural rainfall associated with the ‘break’ of the season had a much greater influence on SS and POB. A significant effect on POB was noted in the wool from sheep that had been exposed to simulated rainfall and then grazed germinating green pasture for approximately 15 – 20 days.
