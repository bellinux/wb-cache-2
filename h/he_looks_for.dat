500|$|Ideologically, Varg Vikernes's one-man project Burzum helped {{inspire the}} Viking metal scene through his {{strongly}} held racist, nationalistic, and anti-Judeo-Christian beliefs, and his {{longing for a}} return to paganism. In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, [...] "His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'." [...] They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes [...] "cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with [...] "an eye on Mein Kampf". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, [...] "proving both that {{it is not just the}} early medieval past to which <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> inspiration, and that he will use any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator".|$|E
500|$|While Kosinski, the Traveler and the {{engineering}} crew work on reversing the process, {{the rest of}} the crew begin experiencing lifelike visions of their past (an effect of the strange space around them). After having a vision of his mother (Herta Ware), Picard surmises that they have arrived at the theoretical Outer Rim of the universe, and issues a red alert to awaken the crew from their visions. Finding Picard at the spot where he saw his mother, Riker suggests that Kosinski may have had nothing to do with the warp jumps, which were more likely to be a result of the Traveler's illness. Trying to determine this theory, Picard has the alien moved to sick bay. Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) however cannot evaluate the Traveler's alien biology, and is unable to treat him. When Picard visits him in sick bay, the Traveler explains his ability to channel pure thought into reality. He brought the crew of the Enterprise to the Outer Rim, triggering similar effects in anyone within it to ascertain if they were ready to experience thought as reality. The Traveler confides to Picard that <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> scientific prodigies such as the young Crusher, and Picard should nurture him. When he returns to {{the engineering}} section, the Traveler asks Crusher to assist him in returning the Enterprise to known space. As they concentrate, beginning to return the ship home, the Traveler again phases out and finally disappears. The Enterprise suddenly stops, and the crew is relieved to find themselves back in Federation space. After the incident, Picard finally promotes Crusher to acting ensign (following his own unspoken suggestion in [...] "The Naked Now") on the Enterprise for his performance.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzpatrick's {{reputation}} as one of the greatest trainers and conditioners continued to grow as his four-mile-relay team won the event at the Penn relays for seven consecutive years. [...] And in January 1910 a Minnesota newspaper wrote a lengthy profile on Fitzpatrick describing him as the [...] "great little man" [...] responsible for molding Michigan's teams:"A great asset to Michigan is Keene Fitzpatrick. He knows athletics from A to Z. As a trainer of track men he is beyond a peer; for keeping football players in condition he is unbeatable and in the capacity of a football coach he ranks high.

2500|$|In September 2004, a Christmas storyline {{created by}} Berridge {{that was to}} show Zoe fall {{pregnant}} with Dennis Rickman's (Nigel Harman) baby was axed by Berridge's successor, Kathleen Hutchison. Instead, Zoe was to be seduced by Dennis's father, Den (Leslie Grantham). An EastEnders insider revealed: [...] "Dirty Den lives up to his name by seducing Zoe.

But they {{are caught in the}} act by Dennis who is shocked and disgusted to see his dad snogging his girlfriend." [...] Hutchison decided that Den would be killed off in a storyline involving three people plotting to kill him.

They plot and scheme to give themselves alibis and exact their revenge for what Den has done to them." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Alfie {{returns from}} Germany, Jean {{tells him to}} buy scented candles as Kat used one while he was away. He asks Kat where she got it from and she lies that {{it was from the}} local shop but he discovers they do not sell them. He then finds out Kat closed the pub early one night because it was [...] "quiet" [...] but worries it may have been for another reason. He then finds the ring that Kat pawned and asks Jean if she or Charlie lent Kat money, but they did not, and the {{pawnbroker}} refuses to tell him who bought it. The next day, he is suspicious when Kat leaves the pub and tells Michael that she is untrustworthy. Michael says Kat would not cheat again, revealing he knew about the affair, but he does not know who Kat was seeing. Alfie is in turmoil when Michael advises him not to pursue his suspicions. Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) finds a key on the bar and leaves it in a glass, but Alfie later notices it has gone. As he hides a Christmas present in Kat's jewellery box, he finds the key hidden there with the ring. He then leaves, claiming he will be away overnight, and asks Jean and Roxy to look after the bar so Kat can have the night off. Roxy tells the three Branning brothers that Alfie is away, and shortly after, Kat receives a phone call. She heads out, unaware that Alfie is watching. Alfie watches Kat enter the bedsit and kicks the door open, where he sees lit candles and rose petals. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>for</b> Kat's lover but she is alone. He demands to know who she is seeing, reminding her that she claimed her lover lived miles away. Kat insists this was her only lie and says the affair is over but her lover kept pestering her and threatening to tell Alfie. Alfie brings out Kat's mother's ring and asks how her lover knew about it if she had not seen him. Kat reveals she had not seen him alone, so Alfie realises it is someone he knows. Alfie decides to stay until he arrives, but then sees a rental agreement. Kat quickly sets fire to it, but Alfie sees the name Mr Branning. She tells Alfie she refused to let the man in while he was in Germany, and refuses to reveal which brother it is. Alfie says she makes him sick and goes to The Queen Victoria to find out the truth. While Kat searches for her phone in the bedsit, all three Branning brothers deny everything to Alfie. Kat then phones one of them and Alfie answers. Kat panics and runs to the pub. Alfie then returns the phone to its owner, Max, and attacks him. Kat stops Alfie, saying he has the wrong person. Alfie asks who it is, and Kat points at a smug Derek.|$|E
