50|$|The bay {{is home to}} {{many species}} of wading birds. Most notably, Roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), Reddish egrets (Egretta rufescens), and <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> <b>Herons</b> (Ardea herodias occidentalis) have unique subpopulations that are largely {{restricted}} to Florida Bay. Other bird species include Bald eagles, seagulls, pelicans, sandpipers, cormorants, ospreys, and flamingos.|$|R
50|$|The refuge protects {{habitat for}} a wide variety of birds, {{including}} nesting or wintering populations of terns, magnificent frigatebirds, white-crowned pigeons, ospreys, and <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>herons.</b> Several federally listed species are monitored, such as piping plovers and bald eagles.

5|$|Another segment, Debussy's Clair de lune, was {{developed}} {{as part of}} the film's original program. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The animation depicted two <b>Great</b> <b>white</b> <b>herons</b> flying through the Florida Everglades on a moonlit night. The sequence was later edited and re-scored for the Blue Bayou segment in Make Mine Music (1946). In 1992, a workprint of the original was discovered and Clair de Lune was restored, complete with the original soundtrack of Stokowski with the Philadelphia Orchestra. It was included as a bonus feature in The Fantasia Anthology DVD in 2000.|$|R
50|$|Hanley’s {{property}} {{included the}} lower Silver Creek drainage and several lakes that provided water to irrigate his ranch lands. The ranch’s riparian areas, lake shore wetlands, and grassy meadows provided habitat for migratory birds traveling along the Pacific Flyway. A number of natural warm springs made the lakes a winter haven for non-migratory bird as well. Numerous birds including <b>great</b> <b>white</b> egrets, <b>herons,</b> pelicans, wild swans, Canada geese, and many duck species nested on the Double O Ranch.|$|R

50|$|The {{great egret}} (Ardea alba), {{also known as}} the common egret, large egret or (in the Old World) great white egret or <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>heron</b> is a large, widely {{distributed}} egret, with four subspecies found in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and southern Europe. Distributed across most of the tropical and warmer temperate regions of the world. It builds tree nests in colonies close to water.|$|E
500|$|Production began {{under the}} working title of Fantasia Continued with a release in 1997. The title changed to Fantasia 1999 {{followed}} by Fantasia 2000 {{to coincide with}} its theatrical release in 2000. Disney formed its initial running order {{with half of the}} Fantasia program and only [...] "three or four new numbers" [...] with the aim of releasing a [...] "semi-new movie". Realizing the idea would not work, he kept three Fantasia segments—The Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Nutcracker Suite, and Dance of the Hours—in the program for [...] "quite a while". In the end, Dance of the Hours was dropped and The Nutcracker Suite was replaced by Rhapsody in Blue during the last few months of production following the response from numerous test screenings. Disney kept The Sorcerer's Apprentice in the final program as a homage to Fantasia. The segment underwent digital restoration by Cinesite in Los Angeles. Disney considered using Clair de Lune, a piece originally made for Fantasia that followed two <b>Great</b> <b>white</b> <b>herons</b> flying through the Everglades at night, but thought it was [...] "pretty boring". An idea to have [...] "a nightmare and a dream struggling for a sleeping child's soul" [...] to Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini by Sergei Rachmaninoff was fully storyboarded, but fell through.|$|R

50|$|Many wetland birds {{found in}} Lahugala Kitulana include <b>great</b> <b>white</b> pelican, purple <b>heron,</b> painted stork, lesser adjutant, Anas spp., white-bellied sea eagle, grey-headed fish eagle, common kingfisher, stork-billed kingfisher, white-throated kingfisher. Spot-billed pelican, Asian openbill and woolly-necked stork are also {{recorded}} visiting the wetland. The last recorded sighting of knob-billed duck, now thought be extinct in Sri Lanka, occurred in here. Red-faced malkoha and Sri Lanka spurfowl are two endemic birds that {{reside in the}} park.|$|R
50|$|The refuge, {{along with}} the <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> <b>Heron</b> National Wildlife Refuge, {{represents}} {{the last of the}} offshore (and raccoon-free) islands in the lower Florida Keys available as critical nesting, roosting, wading and loafing habitat to over 250 avian species — particularly wading birds. The area managed is overwhelmingly (99 percent) marine environment including large sand flats surrounding the islands that are used extensively by wading birds when they forage.|$|E
50|$|The {{branches}} of mangroves serve as roosts and rookeries for coastal and wading birds, {{such as the}} brown pelican (Oelicanus occidentalis), roseate spoonbill (Ajajia ajaia), frigatebird (Fregata magnificans), double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon), brown noddy (Anous stolidus), <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>heron</b> and Wurdemann's heron, color phases of the great blue heron (Adrea herodias), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), snowy egret (Egretta thula), green heron (Butorides striatus), reddish egret (Dichromanassa rufescens) and greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca).|$|E
5000|$|The {{subspecies}} differ {{only slightly}} {{in size and}} plumage tone, {{with the exception of}} subspecies A. h. occidentalis, which also has a distinct white morph, known as the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>heron</b> (not {{to be confused with the}} great egret, for which [...] "great white heron" [...] was once a common name). It is found only in south Florida and some parts of the Caribbean. The <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>heron</b> differs from other great blues in bill morphology, head plume length, and in having a total lack of pigment in its plumage. It averages somewhat larger than the sympatric race A. h. wardi and may be the largest race in the species. In a survey of A. h. occidentalis in Florida, males were found to average 3.02 kg and females average 2.57 kg, with a range for both sexes of 2 to 3.39 kg. This is mainly found near salt water, and was long thought to be a separate species. Birds intermediate between the normal morph and the white morph are known as Würdemann's heron; these birds resemble a [...] "normal" [...] great blue with a white head.|$|E
50|$|Highline Lake State Park is a Colorado state park. It {{is home to}} two lakes, the Highline Lake and the Mack Mesa Lake. It is {{well known}} for its birdwatching {{opportunities}} and has two wildlife migratory waterfowl overlook kiosks where it is possible to watch <b>Great</b> blue <b>heron,</b> <b>white</b> pelicans and whooping crane among many others. There is fishing allowed all year round. It is also open in winter to Snowshoers and Cross Country Skiers.|$|R
50|$|Natural Attractions. Given {{its small}} {{population}} and remote location, {{much of the}} town’s charm rests with its salt and fresh water marshes and a maritime forest, all of which support {{a wide range of}} plant and animal life. Alligators, turtles, foxes, deer, raccoons, beavers, eagles, brown pelicans, <b>great</b> <b>white</b> and blue <b>herons,</b> and ibis abound, while an occasional bear has been known to swim across the Intracoastal Waterway to visit the town. As for plant diversity, Live Oak, Longleaf Pine and Yaupon Holly predominate in the forest, while Azaleas, American Beautyberry and Sweet Bay Magnolia thrive both in natural and landscaped areas.|$|R

50|$|The {{great blue}} heron (Ardea herodias) is a large wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae, common near the shores of open water and in {{wetlands}} over most of North America and Central America, {{as well as the}} Caribbean and the Galápagos Islands. It is a rare vagrant to coastal Spain, the Azores, and areas of far southern Europe. An all-white population found only in the Caribbean and Florida was once treated as a separate species and known as the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>heron.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> <b>Heron</b> National Wildlife Refuge {{is part of}} the United States National Wildlife Refuge System, {{located in}} a region known as the 'Backcountry', which reaches from north of Marathon to north of Key West. It is along {{the north side of the}} Keys in that area that border the Gulf of Mexico. The 130,187 acre (527 km2) refuge (6,207 acres (25 km2) of it land, 123,980 (502 km2) water) was {{established}} on October 27, 1938, as a haven for great white herons, migratory birds, and other wildlife Approximately 1,900 acres (8 km2) are designated as a National Wilderness Area. The refuge is administered as part of the National Key Deer Refuge.|$|E
50|$|An adult {{whooping}} crane is white {{with a red}} crown and a long, dark, pointed bill. Immature {{whooping crane}}s are cinnamon brown. While in flight, their long necks are kept straight and their long dark legs trail behind. Adult whooping cranes' black wing tips are visible during flight.The species {{can stand up to}} 1.5 m and have a wingspan of 2.3 m. Males weigh on average 7.3 kg, while females weigh 6.2 kg on average (Erickson, 1976). The body length averages about 132 cm. The standard linear measurements of the whooping cranes are a wing chord length of 53 - 63 cm, an exposed culmen length of 11.7 - 16 cm and a tarsus of 26 - 31 cm. The only other very large, long-legged white birds in North America are: the great egret, which is over a foot shorter and one-seventh the weight of this crane; the <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>heron,</b> which is a morph of the great blue heron in Florida; and the wood stork. All three other birds are at least 30% smaller than the whooping crane. Herons and storks are also quite different in structure from the crane.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are around}} 200 bird species {{found in the}} park, but {{the symbol of the}} park is the <b>white</b> <b>heron.</b> [...] The reserve is home to the largest number of <b>white</b> <b>herons</b> in the Iberian peninsula, and they are found there from February/March until the summer.|$|R

40|$|Compelling {{arguments}} for preserving large habitat 'is-lands ' {{have been made}} {{for a number of}} animal groups, but most commonly for terrestrial birds. We argue that, for many species of waterbirds nesting in coastal estuar-ies, maintaining numerous mall islands may be a more effective management s rategy than maintaining larger islands or reserves. In this study, the number of <b>great</b> <b>white</b> <b>heron</b> Ardea herodias nests over a 5 -year period (1986 - 91) was negatively correlated with island area in the Florida Keys, USA. Nest densities were highest in the 2 - 10 ha island size range and lowest for islands larger than 100 ha. These small islands also attract nesting black skimmers Rynchops niger, brown pelicans Pele-canus occidentalis, and several species of terns and gulls. Small estuarine islands are vulnerable to sea level rise, erosion from watercraft, and, for dredge material islands, lack of sufficient maintenance because of competing need~ for beach nourishment. Managers need to enforce more buffering and protection of these islands and argue for more dredged material allocations in some areas...|$|E
40|$|This bird report {{covers the}} years 1986 - 1987 {{and is a}} sequel to the bi-annual reports begun in the 1930 's of the maj or ornithological events {{recorded}} in the Camargue and neighbouring Crau and Alpilles. Several researchers present the results of long-term monitoring programmes and there are observations of rare species (but only those accepted by the Rareties Committee) or the more regular ones recorded in unusual numbers, or outside the normal dates of presence in the region. There were spells of severely cold weather in February 1986 and again, for the 3 rd consecutive winter, in January 1987, this latter being the more severe of the two. Flamingos and egrets suffered less than in January 1985 but passerines were hard hit, particularly Cetti's and Fan-tailed warblers and Bearded Tits. Rainfall over the two years was quite high {{and as a result}} the salinity of the Vaccarès lagoon dropped from 33 g/l to only 20 g/l by the end of 1987. All european grebes have been recorded in the delta and their numbers have increased on the Vaccarès where 1 000 or more Great-crested and around 3 000 Black-necked were censused both years. The Grey Heron breeding population continues to increase and there were a record 891 pairs censused in the Camargue area in 1986. In winter the <b>Great</b> <b>White</b> <b>Heron</b> is now a regular visitor with up to 35 individuals. Storks are still regular on migration with 8 Black and 43 White in autumn 1987. Record numbers of flamingos were again breeding in 1986 and 1987 with 20 000 and 17 500 pairs respectively and a record 8 590 chicks raised in 1986. In 1987, only 2 200 chicks were raised because of disturbance caused by a child's balloon blown onto the breeding island during hatching. The banding programme continues and 600 chicks were marked each year. During the cold spell of January 1987 about 100 flamingos died, one of the victims being marked with an Iranian ring from Lake Rezaiyeh. Waterfowl counts revealed record numbers of Shelducks in February, with 2 745 in 1986 and 3 590 in 1987. The Mute Swan breeding population continues to increase in the area and the Bewick's peaked at 105 in January 1986. A small flock of Grey-lag Geese now winters in the Camargue and one bird has been seen wearing a Swedish ring. Midwinter counts of ducks and coots have now been made over 24 consecutive seasons. Although Gadwall and Shoveler numbers have increased in recent years the overall numbers of ducks have decreased for the thirteenth consecutive winter. This decline is attributed mainly to excessive hunting and an increase in the salinity of Camargue lagoons. Other notorious winter visitors to the delta have been Sea and Booted Eagles in 1986 and 1987, and 7 cranes in 1986. Amongst the rarer waders is the 4 th record of a Pectoral Sandpiper, a spring report of Buff-breasted Sandpiper and several observations of Wilson's Phalarope, Terek Sandpjper and Black-winged Pratincole. Finally, a record 193 pairs of Slender-billed Gulls bred in 1987 and 35 pairs of Mediterranean gulls in 1986...|$|E
