40|$|PURPOSE: The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the suitability of using introduced hydrilla leaf-mining flies (Hydrellia pakistanae Deonier and H. balciunasi Bock) for the management of monoecious hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata (L. f.) Royle). This was accomplished using a variety of procedures and experimental designs, <b>including</b> <b>small</b> <b>container</b> bioassays, development of a greenhouse-based fly colony reared exclusively on monoecious hydrilla, a larger tank study designed to evaluate short-term impact on both monoecious and dioecious hydrilla, use of small ponds to evaluate establishment in a more natural situation, evaluation of overwintering biology of the agents, and field releases to determine establishment success. BACKGROUND: Introduction of biological control agents is a critical component of aquatic plant management. Using host-specific agents complements the goal of targeting nuisance vegetation while minimally affecting native vegetation. Two species of introduced ephydrid leaf-mining flies, Hydrellia pakistanae Deonier and H. balciunasi Bock, have been shown to suppress dioecious hydrilla by reducing photosynthesis, thereby impacting biomass production, tuber formation...|$|R

40|$|A multi-phased {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Cambodia from 2005 - 2011 to measure the impact of larviciding with the bacterial larvicide, Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti), a water dispersible granule (WG) formulation on the vector, Aedes aegypti (L.) and the epidemiology. In our studies, all in-use containers were treated at 8 g/ 1000 L, <b>including</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>containers</b> and animal feeders which were found to contribute 23 % of Ae aegypti pupae. The treated waters were subjected to routine water exchange activities. Pupal production was suppressed by an average 91 % for 8 weeks. Pupal numbers continued to remain significantly lower than the untreated commune (UTC) for 13 weeks post treatment in the peak dengue vector season (p 50 % of the household in the UTC harbored ≥ 11 mosquitoes per home. The adult population continued to remain at significantly much lower numbers in the Bti treated commune than in the UTC for 10 - 12 weeks post treatment (p< 0. 05). In 2011, a pilot operational program was evaluated in Kandal Province, a temephos resistant site. It was concluded that 2 cycles of Bti treatment in the 6 months monsoon season with complete coverage of the target districts achieved an overall dengue case reduction of 48 % in the 6 treated districts compared to the previous year, 2010. Five untreated districts in the same province had an overwhelming increase of 352 % of dengue cases during the same period of time. The larvicide efficacy, treatment of all in-use containers {{at the start of the}} monsoon season, together with treatment coverage of entire districts interrupted disease transmission in the temephos resistant province...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Research on the {{automatic}} verification of heap-manipulating programs (HMPs) — programs that manipulate unbounded linked data structures via pointers — has blossomed recently, with many different approaches all showing leaps in performance and expressiveness. A year ago, {{we proposed a}} small logic for specifying predicates about HMPs and demonstrated that an inference-rule-based decision procedure could be performance-competitive, {{and in many cases}} superior to other methods known at the time. That work, however, was a proof-ofconcept, with a logic fragment too small to verify most real programs. In this work, we generalize our previous results to be practically useful: we allow the data in heap nodes to be mutable, we allow more than a single pointer field, and we add new primitives needed to verify cyclic structures. Each of these extensions necessitates new or changed inference rules, with the concomitant changes to the proofs and decision procedure. Yet, our new decision procedure, with the more general logic, actually runs as fast as our previous results. With these generalizations, we can automatically verify many more HMP examples, <b>including</b> three <b>small</b> <b>container</b> functions from the Linux kernel. ...|$|R
