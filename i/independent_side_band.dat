40|$|Concentrated {{entangled}} {{polymer chain}} solutions {{are known to}} exhibit a NMR spectrum narrowing effect upon sample rotation. However, the expected <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> normally induced by dipolar coupling modulation are not observed. To explain this property, the spin-system response to a driving field is calculated to fourth order in the dipolar spin interaction, taking the spin coupling modulation into consideration. The fourth moment of the whole spectrum is exactly expressed. It is shown that the spin interaction modulation effect depends upon the resonance line shape observed without modulation; i) the <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> should be well observable when the resonance line has a gaussian shape; ii) the <b>side</b> <b>band</b> amplitudes become negligible when the resonance line has a nearly lorentzian shape...|$|R

5000|$|The video {{bandwidth}} was 3.0 MHz. The {{video signal}} modulates the carrier by Amplitude Modulation. But {{a portion of}} the upper <b>side</b> <b>band</b> is suppressed. This technique is known as vestigial <b>side</b> <b>band</b> modulation (AC3). The polarity of modulation is positive, meaning that an increase in the instantaneous brightness of the video signal results in an increase in RF power and vice versa. Specifically, the sync pulses (being [...] "blacker than black") result in minimum power (possibly zero power) from the vision transmitter.|$|R
5000|$|In {{analogue}} TV broadcasting {{the visual}} radio frequency (RF) signal {{is produced by}} amplitude modulation (AM) i.e., the video signal (VF) modulates the carrier. In AM two symmetric sidebands appear, containing identical information. So the RF bandwidth is two times the VF bandwidth. For example, the RF bandwidth of a VF signal with a bandwidth of 4.2 MHz, is 8.4 MHz. (System M) In order to use the broadcast band more efficiently, one sideband can be suppressed. However, {{it is impossible to}} suppress one sideband completely without affecting the other. Furthermore, a very sharp edge filter characteristic causes intolerable delay problems. So as a compromise, a standard filter is used which reduces a considerable portion of one <b>side</b> <b>band</b> (lower <b>side</b> <b>band</b> in RF) without causing extensive delay problems. Such a filter is known as vestigial <b>side</b> <b>band</b> filter (VSB).|$|R
40|$|In {{gravitational}} wave interferometers, the input laser beam is phase modulated to generate radio-frequency <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> {{that are used}} to lock the cavities. The mechanism is the following: the frequency of the <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> and the carrier is chosen {{in such a way that}} their response to small changes of the longitudinal degrees of freedom is different. This difference is therefore monitored and it serves as an error signal for controlling the optical cavity lengths, as they are linearly related to the set of observed phases between carrier and <b>side</b> <b>bands.</b> Among the others, one longitudinal degree of freedom is optimally sensitive to the space-time distortions propagating through the cosmos, as predicted by the general theory of relativity. The observation of the astrophysical signal relies on the measurement of that specific degree of freedom. The entire problem is more complex when the transverse degrees of freedom are taken into account, because the relative phase between the fields also depends on their overlap. In order to establish an unambiguous relation between length changes and phase measurements, there must be one circulating optical mode and the only difference between carrier and <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> must be their amplitude. We will show that the variability of the transverse degrees of freedom and their different actions on carrier and <b>side</b> <b>band</b> fields puts a severe limit on this assumption. Unless the system is made of perfect and perfectly matched optical cavities, it is never governed by one unique coherent state and any adjustment of the optical lengths results from a compromise between the lengths that are optimal for the carrier field and the <b>side</b> <b>band</b> ones. Such a compromise alters the correspondence between error signals and cavity lengths, calculated in the one-dimensional treatment. We assess the strength of this effect and relate it to the sensitivity of the instrument (which relies on the reconstruction of that correspondence) in realistic circumstances...|$|R

We show that in a ring with an even number of spinless electrons the oscillating potential has a strong effect on the persistent current when the excited <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> {{are close to the}} eigen levels of a pure ring. Resonant enhancement of <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> of the Floquet state generates a sign change of the persistent current. Comment: 2 figure...|$|R

40|$|The modulational {{instability}} of a uniform wave train to <b>side</b> <b>band</b> perturbations {{is one of}} the most plausible mechanisms for the generation of rogue waves in deep water. In a condition of finite water depth, however, the interaction with the sea floor generates a wave-induced current that subtracts energy from the wave field and consequently attenuates the instability mechanism. As a result, a plane wave remains stable under the influence of collinear <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> for relative depths kh ≤ 1. 36 (where k is the wavenumber of the plane wave and h is the water depth), but it can still destabilise due to oblique perturbations. Using direct numerical simulations of the Euler equations, it is here demonstrated that oblique <b>side</b> <b>bands</b> are capable of triggering modulational instability and eventually leading to the formation of rogue waves also for kh ≤ 1. 36. Results, nonetheless, indicate that modulational instability cannot sustain a substantial wave growth for kh < 0. 8...|$|R
40|$|The current {{emphasis}} on lightwave systems is on increasing the spectral efficiency of WDM systems.

This thesis reports the modeling and analysis of an experimental 40 Gbit/s WDM system, which used vestigial <b>side</b> <b>band</b> demultiplexing. The modeling and analysis is carried out using FiberSim, the fiber optic simulator developed at Information and Telecommunication Technology Center, University of Kansas.

Analyses on various optical parameters like channel launch power, dispersion compensation scheme etc is carried out to find their significance on the system performance...|$|R
