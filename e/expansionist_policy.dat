5|$|He succeeded his brother, Bagrat II, as a duke of Tao in 966, {{and through}} his <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> and {{flexible}} diplomacy began assembling a larger state. In order to enact his ambitious plans, David had to secure his {{independence from the}} Byzantine Empire, which would reach its greatest height under the emperor Basil II (r. 976-1025).|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the emergence of}} the Second Bulgarian Empire, the Kingdom of Hungary also persuaded an active <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> in the Balkan Peninsula {{from the end of the}} 12th century. To that end, Oltenia was put under the control of a Hungarian governor, who received the title of ban. The centre of the new province (the Banate of Severin) was Fort Severin (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Romania), on the Danube, in the vicinity of the Iron Gates. Its first ban, Luke, was mentioned in 1233.|$|E
5|$|King Andrew {{transferred}} Béla from Slavonia to Transylvania in 1226. In Slavonia, he was {{succeeded by}} his brother, Coloman. As Duke of Transylvania, Béla adopted an <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> {{aimed at the}} territories over the Carpathian Mountains. He supported the Dominicans' proselytizing activities among the Cumans, who dominated these lands. In 1227 he crossed the mountains and met Boricius, a Cuman chieftain, who had decided to convert to Christianity. At their meeting, Boricius and his subjects were baptized and acknowledged Béla's suzerainty. Within a year, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania was established in their lands.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Eurypontid King of Sparta Eudamidas III, son of Agis IV, died. Pausanias, the Greek writer, {{claims that}} Cleomenes had him poisoned. In order to {{strengthen}} his position against the ephors, who {{were opposed to}} his <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy,</b> Cleomenes recalled his uncle Archidamus V from his exile in Messene to ascend the Eurypontid throne, {{but as soon as}} Archidamus returned to the city, he was assassinated. Cleomenes' involvement in the plot is unclear, since ancient sources contradict each other: Polybius claims that Cleomenes ordered the murder, but Plutarch disagrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{fall of the}} Lekapenoi signalled {{the end of an}} era {{in terms}} of personalities, but Kourkouas's <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> continued: he was succeeded as Domestic of the Schools by Bardas Phokas the Elder, {{followed}} by Nikephoros Phokas, who reigned as emperor in 963–969, and finally, by Kourkouas's own great-nephew, John Tzimiskes, who reigned as emperor in 969–976. All of them expanded the Byzantine frontier in the East, recovering Cilicia and northern Syria with Antioch, and converting the Hamdanid emirate of Aleppo into a Byzantine protectorate.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{forced the}} Armenian rulers of Cilicia {{to accept his}} {{suzerainty}} in the late 1180s. He also secured the County of Tripoli for his second son, Bohemond, in 1187. However, Saladin occupied almost the whole Principality of Antioch {{in the summer of}} 1188. To preserve the peace with Saladin, Bohemond did not provide military assistance to the crusaders during the Third Crusade. Leo of Cilicia's <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> in the 1190s gave rise to a lasting conflict between Antioch and Cilicia. Bohemond was captured in 1194 by Leo, who tried to seize Antioch, but the burghers formed a commune and expelled the Armenian soldiers from the town. Bohemond was released only after he acknowledged Leo's independence.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{internal}} discord and economic downturn of the 1920s, militaristic elements set Japan on a path of expansionism. As the Japanese home islands lacked natural resources needed for growth, Japan planned to establish hegemony in Asia and become self-sufficient by acquiring territories with abundant natural resources. Japan's <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> alienated it from other countries in the League of Nations and by the mid-1930s brought it closer to Germany and Italy, who had both pursued similar <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies.</b> Cooperation between Japan and Germany began with the Anti-Comintern Pact, in which the two countries agreed to ally to challenge any attack by the Soviet Union.|$|R

5|$|In May 1957, Eisenhower tasked the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) {{to provide}} {{a report on the}} {{potential}} effectiveness of fallout shelters and other means of protecting the US population {{in the event of a}} nuclear war. Chaired by Horace Rowan Gaither, the PSAC team completed their study in September, publishing it officially on 7 November as Deterrence & Survival in the Nuclear Age, but today known as the Gaither Report. After ascribing an <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> to the USSR, along with suggestions that they were more heavily developing their military than the US, the Report suggested that there would be a significant gap in capability in the late 1950s due to spending levels.|$|E
5|$|After Andrianampoinimerina reunited {{the divided}} and warring Kingdom of Imerina, he {{successfully}} pursued an <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> that saw his authority extended {{over a large}} portion of Madagascar by {{the time of his death}} in 1810. Having captured Antananarivo by 1793 and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to Antananarivo the following year, Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become imbued with the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building was assigned a name by which it could be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana ("Where It is Pleasant to Rule"), Besakana, Manatsaralehibe ("Vast Improvement", also called Manatsara)—which he alone was authorised to enter—and Marivolanitra ("Beneath the Heavens"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to a rooftop observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of her death in 1796, Catherine's <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> had made Russia into a major European power. This {{continued}} with Alexander I's wresting of Finland from the weakened kingdom of Sweden in 1809 and of Bessarabia from the Ottomans in 1812.|$|E
5|$|Bolesław's <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> were {{costly to}} the Polish state {{and were not}} always successful. He lost, for example, the {{economically}} crucial Farther Pomerania in 1005 together with its new bishopric in Kołobrzeg; the region had previously been conquered with great effort by Mieszko.|$|R
50|$|In the 16th century, the Wetterau Association was {{the main}} {{organizing}} power opposing the <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> of the Landgrave of Hesse. This was achieved in close coöperation with the House of Habsburg, {{in spite of the}} religious differences that occurred after 1517.|$|R
50|$|Lady Firebird {{frequently}} {{disagrees with}} the aggressive <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> favored by her mother and the other nobles (known collectively as the Electorate). She is given an honorary seat in the Electorate, and promptly votes, against orders, against annexing another star system (Veroh) as a planetary buffer system.|$|R
25|$|This {{was done}} without {{consulting}} the British Government, or the local Boers and African states which now found themselves annexed. However, his <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> against the neighbouring Xhosa did win him the local {{support of the}} extremist colonists of the Eastern Cape frontier.|$|E
25|$|The {{borders of}} Moravia cannot exactly be {{determined}} {{because of the}} lack of accurate contemporaneous sources. For instance, the monks writing the Annals of Fulda in the 9thcentury obviously had limited knowledge of the geography of distant regions of Central Europe. Furthermore, Moravian monarchs adopted an <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> in the 830s, thus the borders of their realm often changed.|$|E
25|$|Soon however, {{with the}} advent of Napoleon I, France adopted a {{strongly}} <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> in the Mediterranean and the Near East. Following the Treaty of Campo Formio in 1797, France acquired possessions in the Mediterranean such as the Ionian islands as well as former Venetian bases on the coast of Albania and Greece, geographically close to the Middle-East.|$|E
50|$|Valignano {{joined the}} Society of Jesus in 1566, {{and was sent}} to East Asia in 1573.

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to curb the <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> of Bianca's uncle John II, Marquess of Montferrat, an {{alliance}} was established on the 22 October 1349 between Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy and Giovanni Visconti of Milan. In the agreements, a marriage was arranged between Bianca and Giovanni's nephew Galeazzo II Visconti.|$|R
50|$|Przemysł had to {{deal with}} the <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> of the Brandenburg margraves John I and Otto III, who had {{acquired}} Lubusz Land at the western border of his duchy from the Silesian duke Bolesław II Rogatka in 1248. When he died in 1257, his brother Bolesław became sole ruler over all Greater Poland.|$|R
25|$|South of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the Kingdom of Burundi. It {{was founded}} by the Tutsi chief Ntare Rushatsi (c. 16571705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and {{political}} innovations. Under Mwami Ntari Rugaamba (c. 17951852), Burundi pursued an aggressive <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy,</b> one based more on diplomacy than force.|$|E
25|$|Under Louis XIV (1643–1715), France pursued an <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy,</b> {{particularly}} affecting Belgium. France frequently held {{control of}} territories in the Southern Netherlands, confronted by various opponents including the Netherlands and Austria. There was the War of Devolution (1667–1668), the Franco-Dutch War (1672–1678), the War of the Reunions (1683–1684), and the Nine Years' War (1688–1697). These were then {{followed by the}} War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714).|$|E
25|$|The coup d’etat {{against the}} Bavarian dynasty of Adaloald and Theodelinda, which led Arioald to the throne, opened {{a season of}} {{conflict}} between the two religious components of the realm. Behind or beside the choice of faith, however, the conflict had political colourings, as it opposed the architects of a policy of peace with Byzantium and the Papacy and integration with the Romans to the proponents of a more aggressive and <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> (Arian nobility).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the {{discovery}} of diamonds around Kimberley and gold in the Transvaal led to a later return to instability, particularly because they fueled the rise to power of the ambitious colonialist Cecil Rhodes. As Cape Prime Minister, Rhodes curtailed the multi-racial franchise, and his <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> {{set the stage for}} the Second Boer War.|$|R
50|$|Despite this {{declared}} neutrality, Greece {{became a}} target for Mussolini's <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies.</b> Provocations against Greece included {{the sinking of the}} Greek cruiser Elli on 15 August 1940. Italian troops crossed the border on 28 October 1940, beginning the Greco-Italian War, but were stopped by a determined Greek defence that ultimately drove them back into Albania.|$|R
25|$|Dulles {{never lost}} his {{anxiety about the}} {{destructive}} power of nuclear weapons, but his views on international control and on employing the threat of atomic attack changed {{in the face of}} the Berlin blockade, the Soviet detonation of an A-bomb, and the advent of the Korean war. These convinced him that the communist bloc was pursuing <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies.</b>|$|R
25|$|Disregarding {{traditional}} Portuguese {{institutions of}} governance, John V ruled as an absolute monarch. As {{a continuation of}} a Braganza dynasty policy that {{stressed the importance of}} relations with Europe, John's reign was marked by numerous interventions into the affairs of other European states, most notably as part of the War of the Spanish Succession. On the imperial front, John V pursued an <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy,</b> with significant territorial gains in Portuguese India and Portuguese America.|$|E
25|$|Donnchad mac Domnaill (733 – 6 February 797), called Donnchad Midi, was High King of Ireland. His father, Domnall Midi, {{had been}} the first Uí Néill High King from the south-central Clann Cholmáin based in modern County Westmeath and western County Meath, Ireland. The reigns of Domnall and his successor, Niall Frossach of the Cenél nEógain, had been {{relatively}} peaceful, but Donnchad's rule saw a return to a more <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy</b> directed against Leinster, traditional target of the Uí Néill, and also, for the first time, the great southern kingdom of Munster.|$|E
25|$|Aistulf was the {{political}} {{expression of the}} more aggressive stance of the dukes, who refused an active component of the Roman population. For his <b>expansionist</b> <b>policy,</b> however, he had to reorganize the army to include, albeit in a subordinate position of light infantry, all {{ethnic groups in the}} kingdom. All free men of the kingdom, both those of Roman and Lombard origin, were to be subject to military obligations. The military standards promulgated by Aistulf mention several times the merchants, a sign of how that class had now become relevant.|$|E
50|$|The {{early years}} {{following}} the establishment of diplomatic relation were characterized by calm, which was mainly {{the result of the}} partial restraint in the <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> of the Japanese Empire prior to 1931, as well as the Soviet need to maintain trade and the temporary deterioration in Sino-Soviet relations around the period of the Sino-Soviet war in 1929.|$|R
40|$|In Imperial Israel and the Palestinians, Nur Masalha {{provides}} {{a history of}} Israel's <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies,</b> focusing on the period from the June War of 1967 to the present day. He demonstrates that imperialist tendencies in Israel run the political gamut, from Left to Right. Masalha argues that {{the heart of the}} conflict between Zionist immigrants/settlers and the native Palestinians has always been about land, territory, demography and water. He documents how Israeli policy has made it a priority to expel the Palestinians, either by war or peaceful measures. But these imperialist tendencies are not restricted to extremist zealots. The author uncovers the <b>expansionist</b> <b>policies</b> found in Labour Zionism and Kookist ideology. Chapters cover the Whole Land of Israel Movement, Zionist Revisionism and the Likud Party, Gush Emunim and the religious fundamentalists, parties and movements of the far right and the evolution of Israeli Jewish public attitudes since 1967...|$|R
