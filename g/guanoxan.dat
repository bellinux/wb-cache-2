50|$|The {{guanidine}} part of {{the molecule}} also appears in <b>guanoxan</b> and guanadrel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Guanoxan</b> is a sympatholytic {{drug that}} was marketed as Envacar by Pfizer in the UK to treat high blood pressure. It was not widely used and was {{eventually}} {{withdrawn from the}} market due to liver toxicity.|$|E
40|$|Eight volunteers {{previously}} phenotyped {{for their}} ability to hydroxylate debrisoquine (four extensive metabolisers (EM), four poor metabolisers (PM) were investigated for their metabolic handling of <b>guanoxan</b> and phenacetin. All three drugs are oxidised at carbon centres. Oxidative dealkylation of phenacetin was determined by measuring the rate of formation of paracetamol. The EM subjects excreted mostly metabolites of <b>guanoxan</b> (mean 29 % of dose), whereas the PM group excreted large amounts of unchanged drug (48 % of dose). The rate of formation of paracetamol was noticeably slower in the PM group, and, when analysed by minimum estimates of apparent first-order rate constants, {{the difference between the two}} phenotypes was significant. Thus the hydroxylation defect shown for debrisoquine metabolism carries over to the oxidative metabolism of phenacetin and <b>guanoxan.</b> Some 5 % of the population are genetically defective hydroxylators of drugs. Thus methods for evaluating the metabolism of new drugs in respect of usage and side effects need to be revised...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} source of interindividual differences in drug action are inherited differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs. For most enzymatic reactions of drug biotransformation in the liver, genetic polymorphisms have been observed which lead to a decreased rate of metabolism and/or a different pattern of metabolites in certain subpopulations, ethnic groups or families. Examples of frequent polymorphisms in drug-metabolizing enzymes are deficient N-acetyltransferase (50 - 70 % of the population) and deficient debrisoquine hydroxylase (10 % of the population). "Slow acetylators" inactivate isoniazid, hydralazine, procainamide, phenelzine, dapsone, sulfamethazine (sulfadimidine), sulfapyridine and nitrazepam at a decreased rate. The molecular genetic defect causing deficient debrisoquine hydroxylation is still unclear and also affects the metabolism of phenytoin, phenacetin, <b>guanoxan,</b> sparteine, methoxyamphetamine, nortriptyline, encainide, perhexiline and probably other drugs. A relationship has been observed between the defect of metabolism and the clinical effects and toxicity of the drugs involved...|$|E
40|$|Phenacetin O-deethylase {{activity}} was impaired, both in vivo and in vitro, in poor metabolisers of debrisoquine, {{consistent with the}} work of others. No impairment was observed in the oxidation of acetanilide, amylobarbitone or antipyrine in the PM phenotype. There was a good correlation (r = 0. 804) between the high affinity component of phenacetin O-deethylase and debrisoquine 4 -hydroxylase activities. No such correlation was observed with the low affinity component of phenacetin O-deethylase activity. Although debrisoquine was a competitive inhibitor of phenacetin O-deethylase activity, phenacetin was without effect on debrisoquine 4 -hydroxylation. There was also marked differences in the effects of sparteine, <b>guanoxan</b> and alpha-naphthoflavone on the two activities. Cigarette smoking was associated with a significant, two-fold, increase in phenacetin O-deethylase activity whilst debrisoquine 4 -hydroxylase {{activity was}} not affected. It is concluded that the high affinity component of phenacetin O-deethylase and debrisoquine 4 -hydroxylase activities are catalysed by different isozymes of cytochrome P- 450 but that these are most probably regulated by closely linked genes...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} papers we {{demonstrated that}} cyclosporin A (CsA) was specifically oxidized in rabbit and human liver by cytochrome P- 450 IIIA. We therefore anticipated that any drug {{that is an}} inducer or an inhibitor of this cytochrome should lead to interaction with CsA when given in association with it. In order to confirm this hypothesis, primary cultures of human hepatocytes and human liver microsomes were used to “reproduce” in vitro clinically significant interactions observed between CsA and drugs known either as specific inducers (i. e., rifampicin) or as specific inhibitors (i. e., erythromycin) of P- 450 IIIA. Our results were {{in close agreement with}} the clinical reports. Human hepatocytes maintained in primary cultures for 72 hr in the presence of 50 ΜM rifampicin exhibited increased levels of P- 450 IIIA, determined by Western blot using specific antibodies, and concomitant increase in CsA oxidase activity, determined by HPLC analysis of extra and intracellular media. Conversely, these cultures exhibited erythromycin concentrationdependent decreases in CsA oxidase activity when incubated in the presence of 5, 20, and 100 ΜM erythromycin. In addition, a Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the erythromycin-mediated inhibition of CsA oxidase activity in human liver microsomes revealed competitive inhibition (with K i of 75 ΜM) as expected, this macrolide being a specific substrate of P- 450 IIIA. Using this experimental approach, 59 molecules representative of 17 different therapeutic classes were screened for inducers and inhibitors of CsA oxidase activity. Our results allowed us to elucidate the molecular mechanism of previously observed, but unexplained, drug interactions involving CsA, and to detect drugs that should interfere with CsA metabolism as inducers or inhibitors. Drugs detected as potential inducers of CsA oxidase included: rifampicin, sulfadimidine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, phenylbutazone, dexamethasone, sulfinpyrazone, and carbamazepine. Drugs detected as potential competitive inhibitors included: triacetyloleandomycin, erythromycin, josamycin, midecamycin, ketoconazole, miconazole, midazolam, nifedipin, diltiazem, verapamil, nicardipine, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine, glibenclamide, bromocryptine, ethynylestradiol, progesterone, cortisol, prednisone, prednisolone, and methylprednisolone. Finally cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, isoniazide, doxycycline, spiramycin, sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, pefloxacin, vancocin, trimethoprime, amphotericine B, valproic acid, quinidine, cimetidine, ranitidine, omeprazole, diclofenac, aspirin, paracetamol, debrisoquine, <b>guanoxan,</b> captopril, furosemide, acetazolamide, sparteine, gliclazide, and imipramine were found not to interfere with the hepatic metabolism of CsA...|$|E
