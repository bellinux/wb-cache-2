25|$|The {{position}} of the exhaust outlet changed {{so that it was}} now angled upwards toward the rear wing instead of downwards to face the rear diffuser so as to make the practice of using exhaust blown diffusers—passing <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> over the rear diffuser to improve the car's downforce—extremely difficult to achieve.|$|E
25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another. In twin-scroll designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|E

Individual cells alternately open and close the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> and fresh air apertures. When the aperture on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> side is reached, pressurized <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> flows into the cell and compresses the fresh air there. As the cell rotor continues to rotate and reaches the aperture on the inlet side, the compressed air flows to the engine. Before the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> can flow, the aperture is closed again and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> column is reflected before entering the engine. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> exits at high speed, sucking further intake air into the cell behind it, repeating the process.|$|R

25|$|Rotary exhaust {{temperatures}} reach , and as such, on a motorcycle, {{required a}} specialized exhaust system. Suzuki {{dealt with the}} problem by first exhausting into a large, heavily finned manifold which split the single exhaust into two streams. They then built two twin-shelled exhaust pipes which included air cooling ducts. Each muffler contains a stainless steel inner pipe {{which is a little}} shorter than the length of the external shell. The internal pipe ends in a removable stinger drilled with numerous holes and wrapped in a fibreglass-like material. The stinger (or spark arrestor as Suzuki calls it) exits the exhaust system {{at the end of the}} external shell. At the front of each pipe was a small forward-facing grille which allowed cool ambient air to be forced into the pipe by the bike's forward motion and to travel the length of the exhaust between the internal and external pipes. It then flowed through the holes drilled in the stinger, mixing with the hot <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> before exiting the system. Even so, Suzuki found it prudent to fit heat shields on the outside of the pipe to further protect riders and pillions. The bike's sound is unique among its two- and four-stroke contemporaries but also quite loud. Early in production (December 1974, Frame #11901), Suzuki reduced the size of the spark arrestor tubes, which both reduced noise and horsepower, but the RE5 exhaust note remains distinctive.|$|E

500|$|The OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout {{for their}} new fighter, the I-300 (also called the izdeliye F (model or product F) by the OKB) because it offered the {{advantages}} of improved landing performance and better visibility from the cockpit when landing but it had some drawbacks, such as the unfamiliar tricycle arrangement of the landing gear, protecting the rear fuselage from the jet exhaust, and where to place the aircraft's armament. The all-metal aircraft had unswept, mid-mounted wings with two prominent air intakes in the nose. Its two-spar wings were fitted with slotted flaps and Frise ailerons. Its powerplant comprised two RD-20 turbojets, which were Soviet-manufactured versions of the BMW 003. The two engines were located behind the cockpit in the lower fuselage, with the exhaust exiting under the tail unit. A steel laminate heatshield was installed {{on the bottom of}} the rear fuselage to protect it from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses.</b> There were four bag-type fuel tanks in the fuselage and three in each wing, providing a total internal fuel capacity of 1,625 liters (429 US gallons). The cockpit was not pressurized. The planned armament consisted of a 57mm NL-57 cannon mounted in the centerline engine intake bulkhead and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon mounted on the lower lip of the air intakes.

500|$|The [...] season saw teams running [...] "off-throttle blown diffusers", {{which created}} {{downforce}} by forcing fuel through {{the engine to}} produce exhaust gases and directing it over the diffuser when the driver was not applying the throttle. This concept was originally banned in incremental phases, with increasingly restrictive rules on what teams could and could not do, with a full ban to be applied from the 2011 British Grand Prix onwards. However, the incremental ban was controversial, with several teams applying for and receiving permission to circumvent the total ban. After discussion between the FIA and engine manufacturers, the original regulations were restored, with the full ban delayed until 2012. The regulations in 2012 governed {{the design of the}} exhaust with the teams agreeing to strict constraints on the position of the exhaust tailpipe. This resulted in the exhaust exiting the bodywork much higher up than in 2011, and no longer {{in the vicinity of the}} diffuser. Several teams, including Williams and Mercedes used the Young Driver Tests in Abu Dhabi as an opportunity to test parts for the 2012 season in the face of the ban. In October 2011, a clarification to the amended rules was issued, effectively banning [...] "exotic" [...] engine maps; in November, further amendments were introduced, completely banning the practice of blowing <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> over parts of the car to improve downforce, following a bid by several teams to allow it under certain conditions. Further amendments were made in February 2012 when Mercedes alerted the FIA to a loophole in the regulations that would allow teams to continue using a partially blown diffuser. The FIA responded by re-writing the software governing the engine's Electronic Control Unit to close the loophole.|$|E

2500|$|Carburetion {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five throttle cables, providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small primary ports. Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique [...] "port valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses.</b> Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|E

40|$|<b>Exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> {{emissions}} from ships are increasingly polluting the air environment seriously.

2500|$|Turbochargers start {{producing}} boost {{only when}} {{a certain amount of}} kinetic energy is present in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses.</b> Without adequate exhaust gas flow to spin the turbine blades, the turbocharger cannot produce the necessary force needed to compress the air going into the engine.

2500|$|No crater {{should be}} expected. The 10,000-pound thrust Descent Propulsion System was {{throttled}} very far down {{during the final}} landing. The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander's own weight, which was lessened by the Moon's gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about 10 kilopascals (1.5 PSI). Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses</b> expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander's <b>exhaust</b> <b>gasses,</b> therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines did scatter {{a lot of very}} fine surface dust as seen in 16mm movies of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar regolith is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a [...] "crater". A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and how deep the lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface and {{it was found that the}} engine had eroded between 4 and 6 inches of regolith out from underneath the engine bell during the final descent and landing.|$|E
