25|$|Closed {{reduction}} {{may not be}} satisfactory {{and open}} reduction then becomes necessary. The use of open reduction has been reported as 8-13% among pertrochanteric fractures, and 52% among intertrochanteric fractures. Both intertrochanteric and pertrochanteric fractures may be treated by a dynamic hip screw and plate, or an <b>intramedullary</b> rod.|$|E
25|$|Spinal cord: About 50% of the {{patients}} develop spinal lesions. Only 40% of the spinal lesions are symptomatic. The spinal tumours in NF II are separated in two groups. <b>Intramedullary</b> lesions are located within the spinal tissue and usually belong to the so-called spinal astrocytomas or ependymomas. The extramedullary lesions are located within the small space between {{the surface of the}} spinal cord and the bony wall of the spinal canal. These tumours belong to the schwannomas and meningiomas.|$|E
25|$|Metal rods can be surgically {{inserted}} in the long bones to improve strength, a procedure developed by Harold A. Sofield, MD, at Shriners Hospitals for Children in Chicago. During the late 1940s, Sofield, Chief of Staff at Shriners Hospitals in Chicago, worked there {{with large numbers of}} children with OI and experimented with various methods to strengthen the bones in these children. In 1959, with Edward A. Miller, MD, Sofield wrote a seminal article describing a solution that seemed radical at the time: the placement of stainless steel rods into the <b>intramedullary</b> canals of the long bones to stabilize and strengthen them. His treatment proved extremely useful in the rehabilitation and prevention of fractures; it was adopted throughout the world and still forms the basis for orthopedic treatment of OI.|$|E
50|$|Extradural {{tumors are}} mostly metastases from primary cancers {{elsewhere}} (commonly breast, prostate and lung cancer). Intradural tumours {{can be classified}} as <b>intramedullary</b> (within the spinal parenchyma) or extramedullary (within the dura, but outside the spinal parenchyma). Extramedullary tumours are more common than <b>intramedullary</b> tumours. Common extramedullary tumours include meningiomas, schwannomas, extramedullary ependymomas, haemangioblastomas, while <b>intramedullary</b> tumours include astrocytomas and <b>intramedullary</b> ependymomas.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intramedullary</b> is {{a medical}} term meaning {{the inside of a}} bone. Examples include <b>intramedullary</b> rods used to treat bone {{fractures}} in orthopedic surgery and <b>intramedullary</b> tumors occurring in some forms of cancer or benign tumors such as an enchondroma.|$|E

50|$|It {{is nearly}} {{impossible}} to differentiate ganglioglioma from other more common <b>intramedullary</b> neoplasms based on imaging alone. Astrocytoma and ependymoma are more familiar <b>intramedullary</b> tumors which share many similar features to ganglioglioma, including T2 hyperintensity, enhancement, tumoral cysts, and cord edema. Poorly defined margins may be more suggestive of astrocytoma, while a central location in the spinal cord, hemorrhage, and hemosiderin staining are often seen with ependymoma. Hemangioblastoma and paraganglioma are less usual <b>intramedullary</b> tumors, but since they are more frequently encountered than ganglioglioma, they should also be included in the differential diagnosis.|$|E

5000|$|Gerhard Küntscher (6 December 1900 [...] - [...] ) was a German {{surgeon who}} inaugurated the <b>intramedullary</b> nailing of long bone fractures.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used as}} a {{site for}} the {{insertion}} of a periosteal needle by which <b>intramedullary</b> fluids may be infused in neonates. It can be fractured along with the tibial tuberosity.|$|E
5000|$|They can be {{used for}} {{definitive}} fixation if the fracture fragments are small (e.g. wrist fractures and hand injuries). In some settings they {{can be used}} for <b>intramedullary</b> fixation of bones such as the ulna.|$|E
5000|$|Synthes matrixrib {{fixation}} {{system has}} two options: a precontoured metal plate that uses screws {{to secure the}} plate to the rib; and/or an <b>intramedullary</b> splint which is tunneled into the rib and secured with a set screw.|$|E
50|$|Subtrochanteric {{fractures}} may {{be treated}} with an <b>intramedullary</b> nail or a screw-plate construction and may require traction pre-operatively, though this practice is uncommon. It is unclear if any specific type of nail results in different outcomes than {{any other type of}} nail.|$|E
5000|$|In adults, X-rays {{may reveal}} {{bilateral}} femoral pseudofractures in the lateral [...] diaphysis. These pseudofractures may remain for years, {{but they may}} not heal until they break completely or the patient receives <b>intramedullary</b> fixation. These patients may also experience recurrent metatarsal fractures.|$|E
50|$|Fixation in orthopedics is {{the process}} by which an injury is {{rendered}} immobile. This may be accomplished by internal fixation, using <b>intramedullary</b> rod, Kirschner wire or dynamic compression plate; or by external fixation, using a spanning external fixator, Taylor Spatial Frame or Ilizarov apparatus.|$|E
50|$|Spinal abnormalities, e.g. <b>intramedullary</b> dermoid cysts {{may arise}} more {{frequently}} in the lumbosacral region (quite often {{at the level of}} the conus medullaris) and may be seen with other congenital anomalies of the spine including posterior spina bifida occulta as identified by the neuroradiological analysis.|$|E
50|$|Surgery is {{curative}} despite possible local relapses. Wide resection of {{the tumor}} and resection arthrodesis with an <b>intramedullary</b> nail, vertebrectomy and femoral head allograft replacement of the vertebral body, resection of the iliac wing and hip joint disarticulation {{have been among the}} performed procedures.|$|E
5000|$|Skull bossing is the {{protuberance}} {{of various}} {{bones of the}} skull which most often occurs in the frontal bones beneath the forehead. Skull bossing {{may be due to}} a variety of medical conditions such as when a decrease in bone marrow volume leads to depressed <b>intramedullary</b> hematopoiesis.|$|E
50|$|Closed {{reduction}} {{may not be}} satisfactory {{and open}} reduction then becomes necessary. The use of open reduction has been reported as 8-13% among pertrochanteric fractures, and 52% among intertrochanteric fractures. Both intertrochanteric and pertrochanteric fractures may be treated by a dynamic hip screw and plate, or an <b>intramedullary</b> rod.|$|E
5000|$|Surgery is {{sometimes}} possible. The goals of surgical treatment for spinal tumors can include histologic diagnosis, tumor local control or oncological cure, pain relief, spinal cord decompression and restoration of neurological function, restoration of spine stability, and deformity rectification. Extramedullary tumours are more amenable to resection than <b>intramedullary</b> tumours.|$|E
50|$|An <b>intramedullary</b> rod, {{also known}} as an <b>intramedullary</b> nail (IM nail) or inter-locking nail or Küntscher nail (without {{proximal}} or distal fixation), is a metal rod forced into the medullary cavity of a bone. IM nails have long been used to treat fractures of long bones of the body. Gerhard Küntscher is credited with the first use of this device in 1939, during World War II, for soldiers with fractures of the femur. Prior to that, treatment of such fractures was limited to traction or plaster, both of which required long periods of inactivity. IM nails resulted in earlier return to activity for the soldiers, sometimes even within a span of a few weeks, since they share the load with the bone, rather than entirely supporting the bone.|$|E
50|$|Spinal dermoid cysts are benign ectopic growths {{thought to}} be a {{consequence}} of embryology errors during neural tube closure. Their reported incidence is extremely rare, accounting for less than 1% of <b>intramedullary</b> spinal cord tumours. It has been proposed that a possible 180 cases of spinal dermoid tumours have been identified over the past century in the literature.|$|E
5000|$|Cannulated {{bars are}} used as <b>intramedullary</b> rods for the {{fixation}} of long bone fractures. The central hollow promotes marrow regrowth. In this application, a Kirschner wire may be fed through the hollow to provide fixation and traction {{at each end of}} the implant. Cannulated bars are also used as raw material, in the manufacturing of cannulated screws, drills, taps and medical instruments.|$|E
50|$|Treatment focuses toward {{alleviating}} {{pain and}} in maintaining functionality {{of the affected}} joints through use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, antimalarial drugs and physiotherapy. Surgery is also a possibility, with osteotomy or stabilization with Kirschner <b>intramedullary</b> wire. Tendon relocation, however, {{has been shown to}} only work in 30% of cases. The condition is named after the French 19th century physician Sigismond Jaccoud.|$|E
50|$|In five {{traumatic}} cases, the {{vertebral column}} was often but not invariably fractured and could compress the cord. He recorded one instance in a 33-year-old woman of a thoracic disk prolapse compressing the cord, without evident trauma. Tumours also figured {{in seven of}} his 32 patients; two were metastatic from kidney and lung. Two had <b>intramedullary</b> cervical tumours, and one, a Guy's Hospital nurse, probably had a cystic astrocytoma.|$|E

5000|$|The Albizzia Nail is an <b>intramedullary</b> rod used in limb lengthening. The {{internal}} telescopic nail {{consists of}} a lengthening mechanism that is activated by alternate rotations. With each rotation there is an audible [...] "click" [...] noise that tells the patient how much they have lengthened. 15 clicks per day result in 1mm of lengthening. The Albizzia Nail is revolutionary {{in the field of}} limb lengthening as it allowed for almost full weight bearing activity with the help of crutches immediately after surgery.|$|E
