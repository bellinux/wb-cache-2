40|$|In neural {{networks}} with complex neurons, the angle between adja-cent complex {{points on the}} unit circle is inversely proportional {{to the number of}} <b>gray</b> <b>levels.</b> As a consequence, the recall performance de-teriorates as the number of <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> increases.

40|$|A {{method for}} obtaining a {{quantitative}} assessment of hair density is described. First, a photographic image of the scalp is digitized onto a high-resolution computer graphics screen. Second, the frequency of each of 256 <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> (one for each of 500 vertical × 500 horizontal = 250, 000 locations on the screen) is obtained and the frequency histogram of <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> is displayed. Third, a statistical procedure, gaussian mixture analysis, is used to resolve the frequency distribution into two normally distributed component distributions. The first component distribution describes the range of <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> that are typically associated with hair. The second component distribution describes shades of gray that are typically associated with scalp. The statistical model provides a precise measure of {{the proportion of the}} head that exhibits <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> in each of the two component distributions (hair or scalp).

30|$|Based on the {{analysis}} result in “Threshold analysis of the Otsu method”, one can conclude that the Otsu method will not get satisfactory segmentation until the WCV of the background gets close {{to that of the}} target region. For the infrared images in complex background, the range of <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> is very big. That is to say, the background is rich in varieties of <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> including not only the lower <b>gray</b> <b>levels,</b> but also the higher <b>gray</b> <b>levels.</b> So it will not be reasonable to simply divide the image into two classes comprised of background and target regions. Otherwise, there will be more background pixels to be misclassified into the target region, resulting that the Otsu method fails in segmentation. So if the infrared image with complex background is divided into three classes comprised of the target region, the middle background and the lower background by the Otsu method via the image statistical characteristics, it will be more reasonable to reflect the reality of the image and hence there will be more background pixels classified into the class of middle background and less ones misclassified into the class of target region.|$|R
40|$|MasterIn this thesis, {{we propose}} a new halftoning scheme that {{preserves}} {{the structure and}} tone similarities while maintaining the simplicity of Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion. Our algorithm is based on Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion algorithm, but it is modified {{in the part of}} the threshold modulation to improve over-blurring of Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion algorithm. Since our algorithm changes the quantizer thresholds according to the structure information and random noise, it preserves the details in the textured region. Simultaneously, it also reduces visual artifacts of the original error diffusion in the uniform region. Unlike existing error diffusion algorithms, the proposed algorithm preserves fine texture very well even in low contrast images. Our algorithm has been tested on various types of images including low contrast images and shows visually pleasing results both in the textured region, and in the uniform region. Plasma Display Panels (PDPs) suffer from motion artifacts such as motion picture distortion (MPD). To reduce MPD, PDPs use the limited <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> instead of the whole 256 <b>gray</b> <b>levels.</b> Therefore we need multitoning to represent the absent <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> among the whole <b>gray</b> <b>levels.</b> We extend our algorithm for multitoning in PDP...|$|R

Each equal-sized cell relates to a corresponding area (size and location) of the continuous-tone input image. Within each cell, the high frequency attribute is a centered variable-sized halftone dot composed of ink or toner. The ratio of the inked area to the non-inked area of the output cell corresponds to the luminance or graylevel of the input cell. From a suitable distance, the human eye averages both the high frequency apparent <b>gray</b> <b>level</b> approximated by the ratio within the cell and the low frequency apparent changes in <b>gray</b> <b>level</b> between adjacent equally spaced cells and centered dots.|$|E

The {{reason for this is}} that the given image may contain a number of distinct <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> with narrow difference with their neighborhood pixels. If the <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> of the pixels in an image and their neighbors are mapped in such a way that the difference in the <b>gray</b> <b>levels</b> of the neighbor with the pixel is minimum, then compression ratio as well as the convergence of the network can be improved. To achieve this, a Cumulative Distribution Function is estimated for the image and it is used to map the image pixels.
