We randomly allocated 25 patients from six hospitals into an experimental <b>group</b> (Ca <b>restriction</b> to 500 mg/day, oxalate-rich products discouraged and normalization of animal protein and sodium) and a control <b>group</b> (<b>no</b> <b>restrictions)</b> for one month.

It is {{shown that the}} girth, when it is defined, is 3 except for at most four graphs for which it does not exceed 4. 1. Introduction We investigate here the girth of graphs on Weyl groups with arbitrary root system. We have studied elsewhere the planarity and connectivity of such graphs. The concept of these graphs come from the method employed in proving the truth of Verma's conjecture on Weyl's dimension polynomial {{in connection with the}} irreducible representations of algebraic Chevalley groups and their Lie algebras [1, 2]. A certain matrix was defined there which imposes a new partial order on Weyl groups. This matrix is explored in [3] to study the representations of algebraic Chevalley groups. The same matrix is the weighted incidence matrix for our definition of graphs on Weyl groups. Let E be the Euclidean space of dimension n with a positive definite symmetric bilinear form ( [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Hyponatremia is {{a common}} and {{potentially}} serious complication of transsphenoidal surgery (TSS). Since September 2009, we have implemented moderate water intake restriction (< 2500 mL/day) after TSS {{in an attempt to}} prevent this complication. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the efficacy of a combination of moderate restriction of water intake plus antidiuretic hormone (arginine vasopressin [AVP]) replacement therapy in patients with diabetes insipidus (DI) for reducing the incidence of delayed hyponatremia after TSS. Patients treated from September 2005 to August 2009 were allowed to drink water freely after surgery (the control group), while patients treated from September 2009 to June 2012 were restricted to less than 2500 mL water per day (the water <b>restriction</b> <b>group).</b> To reduce the occurrence of hypernatremia, AVP replacement therapy was provided immediately after the development of DI. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of hyponatremia, DI, and hypernatremia in patients following TSS. Hyponatremia incidence was significantly lower in the water <b>restriction</b> <b>group</b> (P = 0. 017); however, there were no significant differences in DI incidence and hypernatremia incidence between the 2 groups. Under DI control with AVP replacement therapy, the water <b>restriction</b> <b>group</b> showed <b>no</b> significant difference in the daily self-rated thirst level for the patients with and without DI.

40|$|In {{this short}} note, {{exploits}} of constructions of F-structures coupled with technology developed by Cheeger-Gromov and Paternain-Petean {{are seen to}} yield a procedure to compute minimal entropy, minimal volume, Yamabe invariant and to study collapsing with bounded sectional curvature on inequivalent smooth structures and inequivalent PL-structures within a fixed homeomorphism class. We compute these fundamental Riemannian invariants for every high-dimensional smooth manifold on the homeomorphism class of any smooth manifold that admits a Riemannian metric of zero sectional curvature. This includes all exotic and all fake tori of dimension greater than four. We observe that the minimal volume is not an invariant of the smooth structures, yet the Yamabe invariant does discern the standard smooth structure from all the others.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of a severe nutrient restriction on mammary tissue morphology and remodeling, mammary epithelial cell (MEC) turnover and activity, and hormonal status in lactating dairy cows. We used 16 Holstein × Normande crossbred dairy cows, divided into 2 groups submitted to different feeding levels (basal and restricted) from 2 wk before calving to wk 11 postpartum. Restricted-diet cows had lower 11 -wk average daily milk yield from calving to slaughter than did basal-diet cows (20. 5 vs. 33. 5 kg/d). Feed restriction decreased milk fat, protein, and lactose yields. Restriction also led to lower plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 and higher growth hormone concentrations. Restricted-diet cows had lighter mammary glands than did basal-diet cows. The total amount of DNA in the mammary gland and the size of the mammary acini were smaller in the restricted-diet <b>group.</b> Feed <b>restriction</b> had <b>no</b> significant effect on MEC proliferation at the time of slaughter but led to a higher level of apoptosis in the mammary gland. Gelatin zymography highlighted remodeling of the mammary extracellular matrix in restricted-diet cows. Udders from restricted-diet cows showed lower transcript expression of a-lactalbumin and kappa-casein. In conclusion, nutrient restriction resulted in lower milk yield in lactating dairy cows, partly due to modulation of MEC activity and a lower number of mammary cells. An association was found between feed restriction-induced changes in the growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor- 1 axis and mammary epithelial cell dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The {{advent of}} DNA {{microarray}} technologies has revolutionized the {{experimental study of}} gene expression. Clustering {{is the most popular}} approach of analyzing gene expression data and has indeed proven to be successful in many applications. Our work focuses on discovering a subset of genes which exhibit similar expression patterns along a subset of conditions in the gene expression matrix. Specifically, we are looking for the Order Preserving clusters (OP-Cluster), in each of which a subset of genes induce a similar linear ordering along a subset of conditions. The pioneering work of the OPSM model[3], which enforces the strict order shared by the genes in a cluster, is included in our model as a special case. Our model is more robust than OPSM because similarly expressed conditions are allowed to form order equivalent <b>groups</b> and <b>no</b> <b>restriction</b> is placed on the order within a group. Guided by our model, we design and implement a deterministic algorithm, namely OPC-Tree, to discover OP-Clusters.

In addition, a large percentage of OP-Clusters exhibit significant enrichment of one or more function categories, which implies that OP-Clusters indeed carry significant biological relevance...|$|R

For pubertal subjects, maxillary growth restraint was also reported. Nevertheless, skeletal effects alone would not account for the whole Class II correction even in pubertal subjects with dentoalveolar effects always present.

In addition, discomfort when sitting with the prosthesis is reported in both groups. The study group all had a non-vascular amputation and were divided into those supplied with a socket prosthesis (S group) (n= 43, mean age 51 years, 74 % men) or a bone-anchored prosthesis (OI group) (n= 20, mean age 46 years, 75 % men). Active hip ROM was measured with a goniometer, and self-reported problems with discomfort when sitting were recorded. The hip motion decreased in all directions when wearing the socket prosthesis compared to without it (P 5 0. 001 for all directions), and 37 % of the subjects had less than 908 of hip flexion when wearing their prosthesis. Discomfort when sitting was reported among 44 % (n= 19) in the S group and was more common among individuals with less than 908 of hip flexion motion (P= 0. 025). In the OI <b>group,</b> <b>no</b> <b>restriction</b> in hip motion was measured with the prosthesis, and no subject had less than 908 of flexion and 5 % (n= 1) reported discomfort when sitting.
