5|$|A. r. scottii, {{described}} by George Sennett in 1888, is found from northern Arizona to New Mexico south to northeastern Sonora and northwestern Coahuila. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a darker gray than A. r. eremoeca and has narrower and darker rufous streaks on its breast.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} are that La Reforma is a dome which was eroded {{to form a}} circular pattern or a set of tectonic blocks. Although the dome {{was thought to be}} formed by the older Comondú volcanics, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a product of La Reforma activity.|$|E

5|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, rash, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. It {{increases}} the risk of hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile colitis about fourfold. Other antibiotics may be recommended instead due to this reason. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
5|$|Examples of {{important}} inscriptions {{of this nature}} include treaties with local tribes and declarations of rights.

5|$|S. g. robinsoni {{is found}} on the Atherton Tableland in northeastern Queensland. First {{described}} by Gregory Mathews in 1912, it is combined with magnirostris by some authors. Little researched, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be smaller than other subspecies.|$|E
6000|$|... [567:1] Against {{this passage}} Coleridge writes in MS.

5|$|The {{causeway}} {{was originally}} a toll road, and costs for crossing ranged from one penny (1d) {{for a person}} on foot to 6d for a horse-drawn cart. The tolls were subject to an additional levy of 50 per cent during the night hours. The tolls were later removed, and <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been Perth's only toll road.|$|E
5|$|A {{standard}} analogy for compactification is {{to consider}} a multidimensional object such as a garden hose. If the hose is viewed from a sufficient distance, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have only one dimension, its length, but as one approaches the hose, one discovers that it contains a second dimension, its circumference. Thus, an ant crawling inside it would move in two dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} and excreted by acetic acid bacteria, notably the Acetobacter genus and Clostridium acetobutylicum. These bacteria are found universally in foodstuffs, water, and soil, and acetic acid {{is produced}} naturally as fruits and other foods spoil. Acetic acid {{is also a}} component of the vaginal lubrication of humans and other primates, where <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> serve as a mild antibacterial agent.|$|E

5|$|After Aymer's {{death in}} 1324, the castle passed by {{marriage}} to Lawrence, Lord Hastings, and {{was held in}} the Hastings family until 1390, when Reginald Lord Grey de Ruthin acquired it. There are few historical records of the castle beyond this point, but <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been abandoned in the early 14th century and by the 15th century had become ruined.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of her lap contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|B.s. var.spinulosa 'Coastal Cushion' (= 'Schnapper Point') was {{originally}} collected by Neil Marriott and called 'Schnapper Point' {{from the same}} locality as 'Birthday Candles'. This is a more spreading plant to 50cm tall and up to 1.5–2m across with dark red-styled gold flowers (a couple of shades darker than 'Birthday Candles') 15cm high by 6cm across. It is propagated by Richard Anderson of Merricks Nursery. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be more adaptable to points north than other dwarf forms – growing reliably in southeastern Queensland. This form can be very floriferous, with some plants sporting more than 40 inflorescences at any one time.|$|E

5|$|Based on this star's {{kinematic}} properties, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> {{belong to}} a stellar association called the Castor Moving Group. However, Vega may be much older than this group, so the membership remains uncertain. This group contains about 16 stars, including Alpha Librae, Alpha Cephei, Castor, Fomalhaut and Vega. All {{members of the group}} are moving in nearly the same direction with similar space velocities. Membership in a moving group implies a common origin for these stars in an open cluster that has since become gravitationally unbound. The estimated age of this moving group is , and they have an average space velocity of 16.5km/s.|$|E
5|$|Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877– 12 October 1936) was an English cricketer {{best known}} for inventing the googly, a {{delivery}} designed to deceive the batsman. When bowled, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> be a leg break, but after pitching the ball turns {{in the opposite direction}} to that which is expected, behaving as an off break instead. Bosanquet, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} domesticated and bred as poultry {{for use as}} food {{for at least four}} {{thousand}} years. The most important species is the chicken. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food. In ancient Egypt, poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> {{be the only}} adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|Epiacum {{was built}} {{early in the}} 2nd century. It was at least partly {{demolished}} and rebuilt around 200; the destruction coincides with an uprising of the northern tribes in 196. The fort was modified or wholly rebuilt about the year 300. <b>It</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have been preceded by an Iron Age fort, followed by a Roman camp before the permanent fort was constructed.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, {{it was named}} in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It {{is one of three}} or four related species all with pendent inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. No subspecies are recognised. Banksia lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, <b>it</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, {{and is one of the}} easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation.|$|E
