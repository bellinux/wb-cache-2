25|$|Irving Langmuir at the General Electric {{research}} laboratory (Schenectady, New York) had improved Wolfgang Gaede's high-vacuum <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> {{and used it}} to settle the question of thermionic emission and conduction in a vacuum. Consequently, General Electric started producing hard vacuum triodes (which were branded Pliotrons) in 1915. Langmuir patented the hard vacuum triode, but De Forest and AT successfully asserted priority and invalidated the patent.|$|E
25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} rotary vane pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E
25|$|His initial {{contributions}} to science {{came from his}} study of light bulbs (a continuation of his Ph.D. work). His first major development was {{the improvement of the}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump,</b> which ultimately led to the invention of the high-vacuum rectifier and amplifier tubes. A year later, he and colleague Lewi Tonks discovered that the lifetime of a tungsten filament could be greatly lengthened by filling the bulb with an inert gas, such as argon, the critical factor (overlooked by other researchers) being the need for extreme cleanliness in all stages of the process. He also discovered that twisting the filament into a tight coil improved its efficiency. These were important developments {{in the history of the}} incandescent light bulb. His work in surface chemistry began at this point, when he discovered that molecular hydrogen introduced into a tungsten-filament bulb dissociated into atomic hydrogen and formed a layer one atom thick on the surface of the bulb.|$|E
50|$|One major {{disadvantage}} of <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps</b> is {{the tendency to}} backstream oil into the vacuum chamber. This oil can contaminate surfaces inside the chamber or upon contact with hot filaments or electrical discharges may result in carbonaceous or siliceous deposits. Due to backstreaming, oil <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps</b> are not suitable for use with highly sensitive analytical equipment or other applications which require an extremely clean vacuum environment, but mercury <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps</b> {{may be in the}} case of ultra high vacuum chambers used for metal deposition. Often cold traps and baffles are used to minimize backstreaming, although this results in some loss of pumping ability.|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and {{were made by}} lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the vacuum pumps required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir {{led to the development}} of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull red heat (around 700°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.|$|E

The <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> was {{widely used in}} {{manufacturing}} vacuum tubes, the key technology which dominated the radio and electronics industry for 50 years.|$|E
5000|$|The oil <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> is {{operated}} with an oil of low vapor pressure. The high speed jet {{is generated by}} boiling the fluid and directing the vapor through a jet assembly. Note that the oil is gaseous when entering the nozzles. Within the nozzles, the flow changes from laminar, to supersonic and molecular. Often, several jets are used in series to enhance the pumping action. The outside of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> is cooled using either air flow or a water line. As the vapor jet hits the outer cooled shell of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump,</b> the working fluid condenses and is recovered and directed back to the boiler. The pumped gases continue flowing {{to the base of}} the pump at increased pressure, flowing out through the <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> outlet, where they are compressed to ambient pressure by the secondary mechanical forepump and exhausted.|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} clean, oil free space {{simulation}} systems has demanded {{the development of}} large, clean pumping systems. The assurance of optically dense liquid nitrogen baffles over <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps</b> prevents backstreaming to a large extent, but does not preclude contamination from accidents or a control failure. Turbomolecular pumps or ion pumps achieve oil free systems but are only practical for relatively small chambers. Large cryopumps were developed and checked out which do achieve clean pumping of very large chambers. These pumps {{can be used as}} the original pumping system or can be retrofitted as a replacement for existing <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the large}} size {{and the number of}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps,</b> space {{simulation}} chambers cannot be easily calibrated by the usual test dome method for measuring backstreaming from oil <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps.</b> In addition, location dependent contamination may be an important parameter of the test. The backstreaming contamination in the Space Power Facility (SPF) near Sandusky, Ohio, the largest space simulation vacuum test chamber in the U. S. A. was measured. Small size clean silicon wafers as contamination sensors placed at all desired measurement sites were used. The facility used <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps</b> with DC 705 oil. The thickness of the contamination oil film was measured using ellipsometry. Since the oil did not wet uniformly the silicon substrate, two analysis models were developed to measure the oil film: continuous, homogeneous film and islands of oil with the islands varying in coverage fraction and height. In both cases, the contamination film refractive index was assumed to be that of DC 705. The second model improved the ellipsometric analysis quality parameter by up to two orders of magnitude, especially for the low coverage cases. Comparison of the two models for our case shows that the continuous film model overestimates the oil volume by less than 50 percent. Absolute numbers for backstreaming are in good agreement with published results for <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps.</b> Good agreement was also found between the ellipsometric results and measurements done by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on samples exposed to the same vacuum runs...|$|R

50|$|The <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> {{is widely}} used in both {{industrial}} and research applications. Most modern diffusion pumps use silicone oil or polyphenyl ethers as the working fluid. Cecil Reginald Burch discovered {{the possibility of using}} silicone oil in 1928.|$|E
40|$|The SES (Space Environmental Simulator), {{largest of}} the Thermal Vacuum Facilities at The Goddard Space Flight Center, {{recently}} was converted from an oil <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumped</b> chamber to a Cryopumped chamber. This modification was driven by requirements of flight projects. The basic requirement was to retain or enhance the operational parameters of the chamber such as pumping speed, ultimate vacuum, pump down time, and thermal system performance. To accomplish this task, seventeen <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps</b> were removed and replaced with eight 1. 2 meter (48 inch) diameter cryopumps and one 0. 5 meter (20 inch) turbomolecular pump. The conversion was accomplished {{with a combination of}} subcontracting and in-house efforts to maximize the efficiency of implementation...|$|R
50|$|Ion {{pumps are}} {{commonly}} used in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) systems, as they can attain ultimate pressures less than 10−11 mbar. In contrast to other common UHV pumps, such as turbomolecular <b>pumps</b> and <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps,</b> ion pumps have no moving parts and use no oil. They are therefore clean, need little maintenance, and produce no vibrations. These advantages make ion pumps well-suited for use in scanning probe microscopy and other high-precision apparatuses.|$|R
50|$|Unlike turbomolecular <b>pumps</b> and cryopumps, <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps</b> have no {{moving parts}} {{and as a}} result are quite durable and reliable. They can {{function}} over pressure ranges of 10−10 to 10−2 mbar. They are driven only by convection and thus have a very low energy efficiency.|$|R
50|$|An oil <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> is used {{to achieve}} higher vacuum (lower pressure) than is {{possible}} by use of positive displacement pumps alone. Although its use has been mainly associated within the high-vacuum range (down to 10−9 mbar), diffusion pumps today can produce pressures approaching 10−10 mbar when properly used with modern fluids and accessories. The features that make the <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> attractive for high and ultra-high vacuum use are its high pumping speed for all gases and low cost per unit pumping speed when compared {{with other types of}} pump used in the same vacuum range. Diffusion pumps cannot discharge directly into the atmosphere, so a mechanical forepump is typically used to maintain an outlet pressure around 0.1 mbar.|$|E
50|$|Multiple turbomolecular pumps {{in a lab}} or manufacturing-plant can be {{connected}} by tubes to a small backing pump. Automatic valves and <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> like injection into a large buffer-tube {{in front of the}} backing pump prevents any overpressure from one pump to stall another pump.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steam ejector}} {{is a popular}} form of <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> for vacuum {{distillation}} and freeze-drying.

50|$|Diffusion pumps use a {{high speed}} jet of vapor to direct gas {{molecules}} in the pump throat {{down into the}} bottom of the pump and out the exhaust. Invented in 1915 by Wolfgang Gaede using mercury vapor, and improved by Irving Langmuir and W. Crawford, they were the first type of high vacuum pumps operating in the regime of free molecular flow, where the movement of the gas molecules can be better understood as diffusion than by conventional fluid dynamics. Gaede used the name <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> since his design was based on the finding that gas cannot diffuse against the vapor stream, but will be carried with it to the exhaust. However, the principle of operation might be more precisely described as gas-jet pump, since diffusion plays a role also in other high vacuum pumps. In modern text books, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>pump</b> is categorized as a momentum transfer pump.|$|E
50|$|The company {{divested}} {{the pharmaceutical}} sector {{to focus on}} propaedeutic and teaching materials, initiating the serial production of vacuum pumps as of 1906.

50|$|Pumps {{that use}} oil either as their working fluid (<b>diffusion</b> <b>pumps),</b> or as their {{lubricant}} (mechanical rotary pumps), {{are often the}} sources of contamination in vacuum systems.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current {{experiment}} is to make direct comparisons between the arcing results obtained from the <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumped</b> vertical chamber and our newly renovated Teney vacuum chamber which is equipped with a cryogenic pump.

It was concluded that the vertical chamber was unable to remove enough water vapor from the chamber to adequately test the arcing criterion. Because the cryo-pumped Teney chamber has a ten times better pumping speed, (40, 000 liters per sec compared to 4, 000 liters per sec for the <b>diffusion</b> <b>pumped</b> vertical chamber), a decision was made to retest that experiment in both the Teney and Vertical vacuum chambers.
