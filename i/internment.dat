5|$|After {{the start}} of the war with Japan, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed an order for <b>internment</b> of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the West Coast. About 1,700of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or {{businesses}} near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the Livestock Exposition Center (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to <b>internment</b> camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{immigrants}} from Austria, Hungary, Germany and Ukraine {{were sent to}} Banff to work in <b>internment</b> camps. The main camp was located at Castle Mountain, and was moved to Cave and Basin during winter.

Historical plaques and a statue erected by the Ukrainian Canadian Civil Liberties Association commemorate those interned at Castle Mountain, and at Cave and Basin National Historic Site where an interpretive pavilion dealing with Canada's first national <b>internment</b> operations opened in September 2013.|$|E

5|$|After {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the {{proclamation}} of Indonesian independence in August 1945, the Japanese began {{withdrawing from the}} country. In support of the new Republic, Soegijapranata had an Indonesian flag flown {{in front of the}} Gedangan Rectory; however, he did not formally recognise the nation's independence, owing to his correspondence with Willekens regarding the Church's neutrality. He and his clergy treated injured Dutch missionaries, who had recently been released from <b>internment,</b> at the rectory. The Dutch clergy were malnourished, and several required treatment at a hospital. Some were later taken to Indonesian-run <b>internment</b> camps, but the Catholics were still allowed to look after them. Meanwhile, inter-religious strife led to the burning of several mission buildings and the murder of some clergymen. The government also took several buildings, and some that had been seized by the Japanese were not returned.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{collapse}} in November 1918, {{a significant portion}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow under the terms of the Armistice. Westfalen and her three sisters—the oldest dreadnoughts in the German navy-were not among the ships listed for <b>internment,</b> so they remained in German ports. During the <b>internment,</b> a copy of The Times informed the German commander, Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, that the Armistice was to expire at noon on 21 June 1919, the deadline by which Germany was to have signed the peace treaty. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships after the Armistice expired. To prevent this, he decided to scuttle his ships at the first opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.|$|E

5|$|As with <b>internment</b> in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in 1972, IRA {{recruitment}} was boosted, {{resulting in}} a new surge of paramilitary activity. There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and rioting outside the British Embassy in Dublin. Security forces fired 29,695 plastic bullets in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared {{to a total of}} around 16,000 bullets and four deaths in the eight years following the hunger strikes.|$|E
5|$|Booth {{worked his}} way into the company with a string of false claims about his influence, and finally became {{chairman}} of the Board of Directors by claiming that {{it was the only way}} to avoid Gruban being interned due to his German origin.

Gruban successfully appealed against the <b>internment,</b> and brought Booth to court.|$|E
50|$|Diplock {{courts were}} created in the 1970s during The Troubles, to phase out Operation Demetrius <b>internments,</b> {{and because of the}} {{argument}} that juries were intimidated, though this is disputed. The Diplock courts were shut in 2007, but between 1 August 2008 and 31 July 2009, 13 non-jury trials were held, down from 29 in the previous year, and 300 trials per year at their peak.|$|R
25|$|The camps {{were also}} {{inspected}} by delegations from neutral countries, notably Switzerland, and most often {{by representatives of}} the Red Cross.

At the end of the war, the Red Cross took part in prisoners’ repatriation, but it also helped initiate prisoner exchanges and <b>internments</b> in Switzerland.|$|R
