The Dykeman manor house was originally built about 1855, and remodeled and enlarged in the Italian Villa style in 1871. It is a 2 1/2-story, brick dwelling, 5-bays wide and 4-bays deep, on a limestone foundation. It features a hipped roof topped by six foot square cupola. The hatch house is a two-story limestone building measuring 31 feet wide by 36 feet deep. The trout hatchery opened in 1871.|$|E

The natural stability of slopes and mass movement hazards that impact the design and construction of structures are discussed. Additional topics include, {{but are not limited}} to: the development and composition of earth, geologic time, geologic mapping, an introduction to soil mechanics, and an introduction to surface water and groundwater principles.

5000|$|An ash pond is an <b>engineered</b> <b>structure</b> for the {{disposal}} of bottom ash and fly ash. The wet disposal of ash into ash ponds {{is the most common}} ash disposal method, but other methods include dry disposal in landfills. Dry-handled ash is often recycled into useful building materials. Wet disposal has been preferred due to economic reasons, but increasing environmental concerns regarding leachate from ponds has decreased the popularity of wet disposal. The wet method consists of constructing a large [...] "pond" [...] and filling it with fly ash slurry, allowing the water to drain and evaporate from the fly ash over time. Ash ponds are generally formed using a ring embankment to enclose {{the disposal}} site. The embankments are designed using similar design parameters as embankment dams, including zoned construction with clay cores. The design process is primarily focused on handling seepage and ensuring slope stability.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A {{functional}} {{approach to}} programming robot swarms {{brings with it}} well-defined properties that allow for automated concurrency and distributed execution. Further, the particular expressiveness of a pure functional language with first-class closures captures so cleanly certain biologicallyinspired behaviors that program specification often becomes compact enough to allow a programmer to visually inspect the program code for the entire swarm. This benefit comes in contrast to more piece-meal construction methods used to build-up robot software from discrete components. While such programming models capture the <b>engineered</b> <b>structure</b> of a robotic system, the dynamic, decentralized qualities sought after in robot swarms are well-matched by the idioms of functional concurrent programming.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use and}} environmental consequences of <b>engineered</b> <b>structures</b> on reef platform islands in the Maldives. The Maldives comprises 1 500 islands which are mostly low-lying sand cays. These cays are inherently unstable, changing their size, and position on reef platforms in response to short-term and seasonal adjustments in wind, wave and current patterns. Island instability combined with high population densities {{has resulted in the}} proliferation of <b>engineered</b> <b>structures</b> to combat erosion and to provide boat access. In many instances introduction of hard <b>engineered</b> <b>structures</b> has exacerbated island erosion and degraded reef productivity. Reasons for the negative environmental consequences are twofold. First, the design, materials used in construction and the mode of construction contravene most standard measures of sound engineering design. Constraining sound design is a total lack of environmental information, particularly wave and current data. Second, structures are often inappropriate with respect to natural coastal processes. This is illustrated by wave and current measurements on Hulhudhoo Island in Baa Atoll. Results show the nearshore process regime is dominated by strong alongshore current gradients. Furthermore, seasonal shifts in monsoon winds produce reversals in wave, current and sediment transport patterns. The unique circulatory nature of coastal processes around islands has a number of implications for use of <b>engineered</b> <b>structures.</b> First, conventional engineering practices resulting from an understanding of onshore/offshore and alongshore processes are not necessarily appropriate. Second, it requires reconsideration of notions of passive erosion and placement loss. Effects of structures that are usually transferred alongshore are contained within the 360 o island coastline and act to compound island instability and erosion...|$|R
40|$|As MOSFET feature {{sizes are}} scaled {{down to the}} deep sub-tenth micron regime, serious {{degradation}} of MOSFET device performance due to extrinsic elements, including parasitic resistance and capacitance, {{is one of the}} challenging issues for high performance, low voltage device design. In particular, careful source/drain (S/D) engineering is necessary for extremely scaled MOSFETs to maximize the intrinsic performance. In our work, high performance source/drain engineered MOSFETs structures are reported to match the requirements depicted in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). First, bulk MOSFETs design considerations with S/D <b>engineered</b> <b>structure</b> are presented with a Source/Drain on Insulator (SDOI) structure for high performance application with less parasitics. A self-align double spacer process to fabricate SDOI device is proposed and process feasibility is discussed. With careful optimization of SDOI device geometry, both the gate-delay and power consumption can be significantly reduced together. Design guideline and potential performance gain with the SDOI structure are also discussed. Secondly, design considerations with silicon-on-insulator(SOI) source/drain <b>engineered</b> <b>structure</b> are discussed and a Self-Align Recessed Source Drain (ReS/D) Ultra-Thin Body SOI MOSFETs with elimination of gate to drain miller capacitance is designed. The ReS/D structure provides more design flexibility with parasitic source/drain resistance and gate-to-drain miller capacitance Fabrication details and experimental results are presented. The scalability of the ReS/D MOSFETs and the larger design window due to reduced parasitics are demonstrated. More than 20 % resistance reduction in the ReS/D structure with less than 3 % short channel effect (SCEs) degradation is observed with optimized device parameters. Finally, source/drain engineering structure with contact design schemes for double-gate(DG) technologies to enhance the current drive ability and to provide larger design flexibility are discussed. FinFET with side contact scheme shows more potential benefit over conventional top contact scheme to push the CMOS device scaling to its limit...|$|E

40|$|Wide {{variety of}} {{engineering}} design tasks can be formulated as constrained optimization problems where {{the shape and}} topology of the domain are optimized to reduce costs while satisfying certain constraints.

However, it was noted that the approach has certain drawbacks, and in particular high computational cost of the iterative optimization process.

We validate our approaches by supplementing the existing complex variables boundary element code for elastostatic problems with robust tools for fast topological-shape optimization.
