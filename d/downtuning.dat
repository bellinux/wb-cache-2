5000|$|In Kyuss, in {{an attempt}} to attain an {{original}} sound, Homme developed the unconventional method of <b>downtuning</b> his guitar by ear to a pitch around C standard, [...] "tuning down until the strings started to flop, and then (tuning) up a bit." [...] This tuning later became a staple of Homme's sound carried into Queens of the Stone Age.During the tours up until Lullabies to Paralyze, Homme used his Ovation Ultra GP's for such, while switching to first an Airline guitar, then his Gibson Marauder, Maton Mastersounds, and then finally his Epiphone Dot for other tunings. Following the Songs for the Deaf tour Homme desired a fundamental change, and retired his GPs from both live use and recording, and switched to almost exclusively using semihollow guitars such as his Maton BB1200s and MotorAve BelAires. Homme has been listed as a user of Seymour Duncan's SH-11, SHR-1b and SH-1 guitar pickups, but has been known to use many other brands including DiMarzio, Bare Knuckle, and Arcane.|$|E

50|$|Project 86 {{features}} a rap styled vocal delivery over hard-edged, <b>downtuned</b> guitars.

Others saw the prominent influence of other hard music genres such as hardcore, metal, and speed punk.|$|R
