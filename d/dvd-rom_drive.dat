500|$|Certain reviewers criticized {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} {{that had not been}} fixed or altered from previous Myst titles. Computer Gaming World, for example, complained about having to hunt for the small hotspots that allowed actions to occur. A reviewer for The Houston Chronicle judged the method of traveling from node to node as tiresome to navigate. Another complaint was that the slow cursor animations made searching for actions occasionally tedious. Many publications noted the rather steep computer requirements; in addition to requiring a <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drive,</b> the game took up more than 7gigabytes when fully installed. Charles Herold of The New York Times, the only mainstream critic with a negative view of Revelation's music, dismissed the score as [...] "tediously literal".|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 1999, Apple {{discontinued}} the tray-loading iMac. The new iMac {{built upon}} the Revision D's success with a faster processor, double the RAM, {{improvements to the}} built-in speaker system, a slot-loading optical drive, faster ATI Rage 128 VR graphics, a slightly updated case, and support for Apple's 802.11b AirPort wireless networking card. [...] The iMac was joined by two additional standard configurations, the iMac DV ("digital video") and iMac DV Special Edition. Designed to support home movie editing, the iMac DV had a more powerful processor, a VGA-out port, <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drive,</b> larger hard drive, and two FireWire ports for US$1299, in new shades of all five Revision D colors. The iMac DV Special Edition doubled the RAM again and increased hard drive capacity to 13 GB at US$1499, and was available in an exclusive Graphite color. All iMac (slot-loading) models featured convection cooling, keeping them nearly silent during operation.|$|E

50|$|DVD-R DL has {{compatibility}} {{issues with}} legacy <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> known as pickup head overrun. To avoid this issue, the {{two layers of}} the disc need to be equally recorded. But this is a contradiction with the sequential nature of the DVD recording. Thus DVD Forum under Pioneer's lead developed a technology known as Layer Jump Recording (LJR), which incrementally record smaller sections of each layer to maintain compatibility with <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drives.</b> DVD-R DL media has been discontinued by most manufacturers. DVD+R DL is dominating the market for dual layered media.|$|R

5000|$|Nintendo's Wii and Nintendo GameCube {{have their}} own {{specialty}} format for copy protection. It is based on DVD/miniDVD (Game Cube) technology; each disc contains some deliberately placed defects. The exact positions of these defects, which differ for each produced disc, is encoded encrypted in the BCA of each disc. The BCA is readable on most standard <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>Drives,</b> but consumer burners can reproduce neither the BCA nor the defects. As an additional obfuscation mechanism, the on-disc sector format {{is a little bit}} different from normal DVDs. Nevertheless, it can be read using some consumer <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> with a firmware modification or [...] "debug mode". It is also possible to hack the Wii to install unlicensed software, some of which can use the Wii's own drive to create disc images and then play these copies.|$|R
50|$|Usually a CD-R/RW drive {{will play}} the disc but with {{occasional}} stops (about every 10 seconds) and DVD-R/RW drives {{will be able to}} read the data without problems and can be ripped straight to the PC.

50|$|Fujitsu {{released}} the first DVD-ROM-equipped computer on Nov. 6 in GB. Toshiba released a DVD-ROM-equipped {{computer and a}} <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> in Japan in early 1997 (moved back from December which was moved back from November). DVD-ROM drives from Toshiba, Pioneer, Panasonic, Hitachi, and Sony began appearing in sample quantities as early as January 1997, but none were available before May. The first PC upgrade kits (a combination of <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> and hardware decoder card) became available from Creative Labs, Hi-Val, and Diamond Multimedia in April and May 1997. In 2014, every major PC manufacturer has models that include DVD-ROM drives.|$|E

The recording speeds reached by dual-layer media are still well below those of single-layer media.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most popular}} way to access data from GD-ROMs, however, {{is to use}} the Dreamcast itself as a drive, and copy the data to a {{computer}} by means of a [...] "coder's cable" [...] or a Dreamcast Broadband Adapter; another alternative is modding the Dreamcast to add a USB connector.Sega has discontinued production of GD-ROM media. Later CD-ROM and <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> allowed PC software to offered on CDs using only the high-density region as part of the DRM.|$|R
5000|$|Riplock is a {{firmware}} [...] "hobbling feature" [...] of some computer <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> {{that significantly}} slows (throttled back) the drive transfer rate when {{reading and writing}} DVD-Video data, typically to 2×-4× on drives that otherwise (as of mid-2005) could read at 8× or 16×. Proponents argue that this restriction in performance reduces the amount of noise when the drive is playing a DVD by providing the lowest rotational speed that allows for adequate data transfer from the DVD to the computer.|$|R
50|$|Version 3.0, codenamed MUNIR, has higher system {{requirements}} than former releases {{and is the}} first that comes as DVD image. A Pentium II or AMD K6-2 class processor, 256 MB RAM and an IDE/SATA <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> are recommended. Again, a harddisk is not needed. It was released on September 8, 2011.|$|E
50|$|The ThinkPad T20 was {{released}} by IBM as the successor to the ThinkPad 600 laptops. Despite the weight of 4.6 lb, the T20 had a 14.1 in screen making it the lightest laptop offering with that screen size.

50|$|The Xbox {{is based}} on {{commodity}} PC hardware and is much larger and heavier than its contemporaries. This {{is largely due to}} a bulky tray-loading <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> and the standard-size 3.5 inch hard drive. The Xbox has also pioneered safety features, such as breakaway cables for the controllers to prevent the console from being pulled from the surface it rests on.|$|E
50|$|Anime Play DVDs are {{the only}} English-language visual novels that are playable on {{standard}} DVD players; {{they can also be}} played on PCs with <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> or video game consoles that can play DVDs like the PlayStation 2 or Xbox. The restrictions of the DVD format mean that these games are missing many features present in most visual novels such as separate volume controls for music and voices; controlling the speed at which text is played; and ability to save the game at any point.|$|R

50|$|The {{data stored}} in the BCA can be from 12 bytes to 188 bytes in steps of 16 bytes. The BCA can be read using the same laser for reading regular data, but {{requires}} special circuitry to be decoded. It is not mandatory for DVD players to support reading the BCA, but <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drives</b> should, according to the Mt. Fuji specification (an industry-standard optical drive command set). The Burst Cutting Area cannot be written without using special equipment, therefore {{it can be used}} as a tamper-proof means of identifying individual discs.|$|R
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to install and run Windows Vista or Windows 7 on the earlier model laptop. In high-end versions appearing during 2009, Windows Vista is pre-installed. The lack of a <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drive</b> requires creating a bootable USB flash drive (the on-board card reader slots are not bootable) using a USB external DVD drive or PXE boot network install.|$|E
50|$|Xbox Media Player, (or XBMP for short), now obsolete, was the {{predecessor}} to XBMC and XBMC4Xbox, a feature-rich {{free and open}} source media player for the Xbox (console).

This model shipped with a 6GB or 12GB hard drive, a Mini-PCI Modem, either a CD-ROM or <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drive,</b> and 64MB of RAM on the motherboard (upgradeable to 576MB using PC100 SODIMMs).|$|E
50|$|Packet {{writing is}} a scheme in which the {{recorder}} writes incrementally to disc in short bursts, or packets. Sequential packet writing fills the disc with packets from bottom up. To make it readable in CD-ROM and <b>DVD-ROM</b> <b>drives,</b> the disc can be closed at any time by writing a final table-of-contents {{to the start of}} the disc; thereafter, the disc cannot be packet-written any further. Packet writing, together with support from the operating system and a file system like UDF, can be used to mimic random write-access as in media like flash memory and magnetic disks.|$|R
