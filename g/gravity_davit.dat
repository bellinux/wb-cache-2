50|$|For all {{lifeboats}} using {{a roller}} <b>gravity</b> <b>davit</b> and Rottmer releasing gear, {{this is the}} procedure:1. Make sure the Davit tracks are clear of debris2. Remove the lifeboat cover if applicable 3. Put in the lifeboat plugs4. At this time the Rottmer releasing gear is checked to be secure.5. Attach the sea painter to {{the bow of the}} ship.6. Remove the gripes from the lifeboat. 7. Make sure the gripes preventing bar is free from the track.8. Have the assigned brake man life the braking bar and lower the lifeboat to the embarkation deck. 9. Now that the Tricing pendants have pulled the lifeboat in close, attach the Frapping lines to the wire falls by passing them to a worker who is on the lifeboat. 10. Load the lifeboat. Load {{one person at a time}} and seat them so their weight is distributed between the two sides.11. Have the brake man raise the lifeboat slightly so the workers can release the Tricing pendants.12. Brake man lifts bar and lowers the vessel into the water.13. Operate the Rottmer releasing gear and release the davit on the crest of a wave.14. If ship is sinking, pull toggle pin to release the sea painter from the ship.|$|E
2500|$|As built, Andes had 14 {{lifeboats}} with a {{total capacity}} of 1,174 people. There were two , [...] motor boats, ten [...] lifeboats and two [...] lifeboats. All were mounted on Taylor's patent <b>gravity</b> <b>davits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Provision {{was made}} for {{carrying}} the British Landing Craft Assault (LCA) in <b>gravity</b> <b>davits,</b> instead of American assault craft. Provision was also made for carrying Landing Craft Tank (LCT) and Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM), and NL pontoon causeways.|$|R

2500|$|In September 1940 Prinses Beatrix was {{formally}} {{taken over by}} the Admiralty to be converted into an [...] "assault ship" [...] at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. The upper deck was largely cleared and <b>gravity</b> <b>davits</b> installed enabling six LCAs and two LCM(1)s to be carried, along with 450 troops. Prinses Beatrix was armed with two 12-pounder guns, two 2-pounders, four Hotchkiss 20mm machine guns, and four [...]303 cal. machine guns. The ship was commissioned as HMS Princess Beatrix on 22 January 1941 as a special service ship.|$|R

5000|$|The {{bow door}} {{arrangements}} {{were similar to}} the LST (2), but the design arranged the bow ramp in two parts {{in an attempt to}} increase the number of beaches where direct discharge would be possible. The machinery for operating the bow doors and ramp were electrical, but otherwise, steam auxiliaries replaced the electrical gear on the LST (2).The general arrangements of the tank deck were similar, but the design increased headroom and added a ramp to the top deck, as in later [...] "LST (2)"s. Provision was made for carrying LCA on <b>gravity</b> <b>davits</b> instead of the American built assault boats. The arrangements were generally an improvement over the LST (2), but suffered from a deeper draught, and, to some extent, from the haste of construction.|$|R
50|$|Boat deck {{carried the}} ship's six lifeboats, three on each side, {{including}} one motorized boat, the center {{boat on the}} port side. The ship was fitted with <b>gravity</b> roller track <b>davits</b> for the larger aft and center boats. The curved davit arms extended over the open portion of Promenade deck. Radial single pivot davits were implemented for the smaller forward boats.|$|R
