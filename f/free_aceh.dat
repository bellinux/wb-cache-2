40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{restraint}} and confinement {{of the mentally}} ill (called pasung in Indonesia) is common in Aceh. In early 2010, the local government initiated a program called <b>Aceh</b> <b>Free</b> Pasung 2010. The main goal of the program is to release the mentally ill in the province from {{restraint and}} to provide appropriate medical treatment and care. The aim of the paper is to report the findings of a preliminary investigation of the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients who have been admitted to the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital as part of the <b>Aceh</b> <b>Free</b> Pasung program. Methods This is a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital, where people who had been restrained or confined in the community are being admitted for psychiatric treatment and, where necessary, physical rehabilitation, as part of the <b>Aceh</b> <b>Free</b> Pasung program. Results Fifty-nine of former ex- pasung patients were examined. The majority (88. 1 %) of the patients were male, aged 18 to 68 years. The duration of pasung varied from a few days to 20 years, with a mean duration of 4. 0 years. The reasons for applying pasung are many, with concerns about dangerousness being most common. The great majority (89. 8 %) had a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Discussion The development of a community mental health system and the introduction of a health insurance system in Aceh (together with the national health insurance scheme for the poor) has enabled access to free hospital treatment for people with severe mental disorders, including those who have been in pasung. The demographic and clinical characteristics of this group of ex- pasung patients are broadly similar to those reported in previous studies. Conclusions The <b>Aceh</b> <b>Free</b> Pasung program is an important mental health and human rights initiative that can serve to inform similar efforts in other parts of Indonesia and other low and middle-income countries where restraint and confinement {{of the mentally ill}} is receiving insufficient attention. </p...|$|R
2500|$|Soekarno, {{the first}} {{president}} of Indonesia, had reneged on his promise made on 16 June 1948 that Aceh would be allowed to rule itself in accordance with its religious values which had been in place for centuries. [...] Aceh was politically dismantled and incorporated into the province of North Sumatra in 1950. This resulted in the Acehnese Rebellion of 1953–59 which was led by Daud Beureu'eh who on 20 September 1953 declared a <b>free</b> independent <b>Aceh</b> under the leadership of Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosoewirjo. In 1959, the Indonesian government attempted to placate the Acehnese by offering wide-ranging freedom in matters relating to religion, education and culture.|$|R

Relative to most of Indonesia, it is a religiously conservative area. Aceh was the closest point of land to the epicenter of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which devastated much of the western coast of the province. Approximately 170,000 Indonesians were killed or went missing in the disaster. The disaster helped precipitate the peace agreement between the government of Indonesia and the <b>Free</b> <b>Aceh</b> Movement (GAM).|$|E

25|$|The Indonesian Armed Forces {{was formed}} during the Indonesian National Revolution, when it {{undertook}} a guerrilla warfare along with informal militia. As {{a result of}} this, {{and the need to}} maintain internal security, the Armed forces including the Army, Navy, and Air Force has been organised along territorial lines, aimed at defeating internal enemies of the state and potential external invaders. From the 1950s to 1960s, the country struggled to maintain its unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements in some of its provinces. Separatist movements in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have led to armed conflict, and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and brutality from all sides. Following a sporadic thirty-year guerrilla war between the <b>Free</b> <b>Aceh</b> Movement (GAM) and the Indonesian military, a ceasefire agreement was reached in 2005. From 1961 to 1963, the TNI was involved in the military campaign to incorporate Western New Guinea into Indonesia, which pitted the TNI against the Netherlands New Guinea. From 1962 to 1965, the TNI fought in a confrontation against Malaysia. The armed forces under Suharto was directly involved in the mass killings fighting against the Communist Party of Indonesia in 1965. One of the reforms following the 1998 resignation of Suharto was the removal of formal TNI representation in parliament; nevertheless, its political influence remains extensive. There has been a significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws, and a reported decline in the levels of violence and human rights abuses, since the presidency of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Papua.|$|E
500|$|From 1983 to 1985, army squads killed up to 10,000 {{suspected}} {{criminals in}} response to a spike in the crime rate (see [...] "Petrus Killings"). Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as the sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considered Islamic law to be above all other conceptions. The Tanjung Priok massacre saw the army kill up to 100 conservative Muslim protesters in September 1984. A retaliatory series of small bombings, including the bombing of Borobudur, led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, including future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa and Abu Bakar Bashir (later leader of Jemaah Islamiyah). Attacks on police by a resurgent <b>Free</b> <b>Aceh</b> Movement in 1989 led to a military operation which killed 2,000 people and ended the insurgency by 1992. In 1984, the Suharto government sought increased control over the press by issuing a law requiring all media to possess a press operating license (SIUPP) which could be revoked at any time by Ministry of Information.|$|E

Gaddafi was indiscriminate in the causes which he funded, sometimes switching from supporting one side in a conflict to the other, as in the Eritrean War of Independence.

This support was demonstrated during the 1999 plebiscite in Banda Aceh which was attended by nearly half a million people (of four million population of the province). Indonesian central government responded in 2001 by broadening Aceh's autonomy, giving its government the right to apply Sharia law more broadly and the right to receive direct foreign investment. This was again accompanied by repressive measures, however, and in 2003 an offensive began and a state of emergency was proclaimed in the Province. The war was still going on when the tsunami disaster of 2004 struck the province.|$|E
2500|$|Nowadays the Acehnese and West Papuan {{autonomy}} movements currently use {{the term}} to express the concept of freedom, {{and the meaning of}} the term ranges from greater freedom to outright political independence. The major autonomy movement in Aceh, the <b>Free</b> <b>Aceh</b> Movement has the term in its name (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka), as does the major armed independence group in West Papua, the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka). Nowadays too, some conservative and Nationalists had re-thought the 'Merdeka' stance of Indonesia, many question related to it such as [...] "Apakah kita benar-benar sudah merdeka?" [...] (Had we been really independent?). They used the term Merdeka as a motivational battle cry to the public for a change against the increasing free-fight liberalism, globalization, and neo-imperialism in terms of capitalism in Indonesia, though the word [...] "Semangat Reformasi" [...] (Spirit of the Reformation) had since now more been used.|$|E

The double talk policy of the government only exasperated young Moro and students and opting to join extremist group, such as the Abu Sayyaf to mount a violent attacks against the deceptive policy of the Philippine government.

Suharto's imposition of Pancasila as sole ideology caused protests from conservative Islamic groups who considers the Islamic law (sharia) to be above any human conceptions. In September 1984, a violent demonstration in the Tanjung Priok area of Jakarta by conservative Muslims led to soldiers opening fire, massacring up to 100 protesters. A retaliatory series of small bombings (notably the bombing of Borobudur Temple in January 1985) led to arrests of hundreds of conservative Islamic activists, ranging from future parliamentary leader AM Fatwa to radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir (future initiator of terrorist group Jemaah Islamiyah). Attacks on police by resurgent Libyan-aided <b>Free</b> <b>Aceh</b> Movement in 1989 led to a brutal military operation ("Operasi Jaring Merah") which ended the insurgency by 1992 by killing of 2,000 people.
