40|$|AbstractFoil {{bearings}} are self-acting (aerodynamic) hydrodynamic bearings supports {{lightly loaded}} shafts with major advantages like physically non-contacting high speed operation using process fluid as medium in hostile environments. However, {{the lack of}} load carrying capacity at relatively lower speeds limits their applications in heavy turbo machinery and as such are highly suitable in lightly loaded, high speed turbo machinery like small gas turbines. This paper discusses the design and assessment of dynamic characteristics in terms of load carrying capabilities {{as a function of}} speed, gap between the bearing and the runner as well as shape of foils for an air foil thrust bearing. The effects of various bearing parameters like foil thickness, number of foils fixed circumferentially, foil geometry configuration and position of foils along the circumference such that inner edge and outer edge of the same foil are at different height and same height. Characteristics of performance defined essentially in terms of load carrying capabilities and static stiffness have been used for evaluation. Experiments were conducted for sector foils (with inner <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> less than outer <b>edge</b> <b>height)</b> and sector foils (with inner <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> is equal to outer <b>edge</b> <b>height)</b> by varying number of foils. Along with the above two types the load carrying capabilities of air foil thrust bearing using newly conceptualized cascaded foils (Patented) with increased number of wedge films essentially from the point view of increased pressure profile culminating in relatively higher load carrying capabilities as compared to other two types (conventional) Air foil thrust bearing. The experimental results show that the effect of foil assembly, number and improved formation of wedge film which enhances the load carrying capabilities of air foil thrust bearing. Along with the above experimental work an COMSOL model of the thrust bearing have been analysed to know that the pressure distribution profile on the foil which clearly indicates that the pressure developed by the conventional type of foils configuration is less than the newly configured foils in which inner <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> is equal to outer edge along the radial direction i. e the height of the foil with respect to the runner is equal in the radial direction...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle front shape has a {{significant}} influence on pedestrian injuries and the optimal design for overall pedestrian protection remains an elusive goal, especially considering the variability of vehicle-to-pedestrian accident scenarios. Therefore this study aims to develop and evaluate an efficient framework for vehicle front shape optimization for pedestrian protection accounting for {{the broad range of}} real world impact scenarios and their distributions in recent accident data. Firstly, a framework for vehicle front shape optimization for pedestrian protection was developed based on coupling of multi-body simulations and a genetic algorithm. This framework was then applied for optimizing passenger car front shape for pedestrian protection, and its predictions were evaluated using accident data and kinematic analyses. The results indicate that the optimization shows a good convergence and predictions of the optimization framework are corroborated when compared to the available accident data, and the optimization framework can distinguish ‘good’ and ‘poor’ vehicle front shapes for pedestrian safety. Thus, it is feasible and reliable to use the optimization framework for vehicle front shape optimization for reducing overall pedestrian injury risk. The results also show the importance of considering the broad range of impact scenarios in vehicle front shape optimization. A safe passenger car for overall pedestrian protection should have a wide and flat bumper (covering pedestrians’ legs from the lower leg up to the shaft of the upper leg with generally even contacts), a bonnet leading <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> around 750 mm, a short bonnet (17 ° or < 12 °) and a shallow windscreen (≤ 30 °). Sensitivity studies based on simulations at the population level indicate that the demands for a safe passenger car front shape for head and leg protection are generally consistent, but partially conflict with pelvis protection. In particular, both head and leg injury risk increase with increasing bumper lower height and depth, and decrease with increasing bonnet leading <b>edge</b> <b>height,</b> while pelvis injury risk increases with increasing bonnet leading <b>edge</b> <b>height.</b> However, the effects of bonnet leading <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> and windscreen design on head injury risk are complex and require further analysis...|$|E

40|$|Flow past {{a single}} small planar or {{three-dimensional}} roughness {{mounted on a}} smooth surface is investigated theoretically for various edge steepnesses, the oncoming pla-nar motion being within a boundary layer or other near-wall shear. Nonlinear edge properties at large Reynolds numbers largely control the flow responses at the three-dimensional roughness wing-tips and the impacts of separation(s), among other fea-tures. From analysis and computation, criteria are found for the generation of non-linear upstream influence, downstream influence and separations, for two- and three-dimensional roughnesses, as well as wing-tip separations. In particular, it is predicted that with a severe edge (e. g. a 90 forward-facing step) {{the ratio of the}} upstream separation distance over the roughness <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> is a constant times Re 1 = 4 W in two dimensions, the constant being approximately 0 : 142 and the Reynolds number ReW being based on the roughness <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> and the incident velocity slope at the sur-face.

40|$|BACKGROUND Up to {{one third}} of BKP treated cases shows no appreciable height {{restoration}} due to loss of both restored height and kyphotic realignment after balloon deflation. This shortcoming has called for an improved method that maintains the height and realignment reached by the fully inflated balloon until stabilization of the vertebral body by PMMA-based cementation. Restoration of the physiological vertebral body height for pain relief and for preventing further fractures of adjacent and distant vertebral bodies must be the main aim for such a method. A new vertebral body stenting system (VBS) stabilizes the vertebral body after balloon deflation until cementation. The radiographic and safety results of the first 100 cases where VBS was applied are presented. METHODS During the planning phase of an ongoing international multicenter RCT, radiographic, procedural and followup details were retrospectively transcribed from charts and xrays for developing and testing the case report forms. Radiographs were centrally assessed at {{the institution of the}} first/senior author. RESULTS 100 patients (62 with osteoporosis) with a total of 103 fractured vertebral bodies were treated with the VBS system. 49 were females {{with a mean age of}} 73. 2 years; males were 66. 7 years old.

This assumption is justified by many real- world implementations of datacenters. We consider an extension to virtual cluster embedding by introducing replication among data chunks. In many real-world applications, data is stored in distributed and redundant way. This assumption introduces additional hardness in deciding what replica to process. By reduction from classical NP-complete problem of Boolean Satisfia- bility, we show limits of optimality of embedding. Our result holds even in trees of <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> bounded by three.

40|$|The energy {{required}} for tillage processes {{accounts for a}} significant proportion of total energy used in crop production. In many tillage processes decreasing the draft and upward vertical forces is often desired for reduced fuel use and improved penetration, respectively. Recent studies have proved that the discrete element modelling (DEM) can effectively be used to model the soil–tool interaction. In his study, Fielke (1994) [1] examined the effect of the various tool cutting edge geometries, namely; cutting <b>edge</b> <b>height,</b> length of underside rub, angle of underside clearance, on draft and vertical forces. In this paper the experimental parameters of Fielke (1994) [1] were simulated using 3 D discrete element modelling techniques. In the simulations a hysteretic spring contact model integrated with a linear cohesion model that considers the plastic deformation behaviour of the soil hence provides better vertical force prediction was employed. DEM parameters were determined by comparing the experimental and simulation results of angle of repose and penetration tests. The results of the study showed that the simulation results of the soil-various tool cutting edge geometries agreed well with the experimental results of Fielke (1994) [1]. The modelling was then used to simulate a further range of cutting edge geometries to better define the effect of sweep tool cutting edge geometry parameters on tillage forces. The extra simulations were able to show that by using a sharper cutting edge with zero vertical cutting <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> the draft and upward vertical force were further reduced indicating there is benefit from having a really sharp cutting edge. The extra simulations also confirmed that the interpolated trends for angle of underside clearance as suggested by Fielke (1994) [1] where correct with a linear reduction in draft and upward vertical force for angle of underside clearance between the ranges of − 25 and − 5 °, and between − 5 and 0 °. The good correlations give confidence to recommend further investigation of the use of DEM to model the different types of tillage tools...|$|E

This thesis presents the design and evaluation of {{a new type of}} skin friction measurement gauge based on the Stanton gauge concept but not requiring a surface pressure tap. This new skin friction measurement gauge, called a 2 ̆ 2 Flow Tab 2 ̆ 2, can therefore be used on an aerodynamic model or aircraft surface without alteration of the surface. The Flow Tab is thus particularly well-suited to use with Cal Poly 2 ̆ 7 s Boundary Layer Data System (BLDS), a small, self-contained instrument that can be installed onto a model or aircraft surface without permanent alteration of the surface. A series of preliminary experiments conducted in a low-speed wind tunnel on a flat plate model with mild favorable pressure gradient, with both laminar and turbulent boundary layers, led to selection of three variants of the Flow Tab design.

40|$|Abstract — We propose {{new methods}} for {{estimating}} properties of analog objects in properly sampled multi-dimensional grey-scale images. The finite aperture of lenses ensures bandlimitation of the analog image and allows sampling. Many existing measurement procedures {{work on a}} binary object obtained by edge detection and thresholding. The ragged binary edge is disturbed by aliasing which cannot be repaired by smoothing. To solve this problem we propose methods that work directly on the grey-scale image. The grey-scale image contains accurate photometric information. Our new methods yield errors that are generally {{an order of magnitude}} better than the traditional binary ones. For applications where a smooth, constant <b>edge</b> <b>height</b> is a prerequisite we introduce erf-clipping. Erfclipping is a point operation that shapes a linear edge region into a scaled error function. In contrast to thresholding it requires very mild oversampling. 1.

The interaction of the jet with an edge involves formation of primary vorticies in the shear layer surrounding the jet and secondary vorticies near {{the tip of the}} wedge. These vorticies form vortex pairs and eventually merge to form a single large vortex, and moves downstream along the surface of the wedge. Phase averaged flow survey measurements also depict the counter-rotating vortex pair moving along the surface of the wedge.
