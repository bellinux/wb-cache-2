50|$|Land League {{members were}} then {{key to the}} {{formation}} of the Scottish National Party in 1934. When faced with new land raids the government responded by giving the Board of Agriculture the money and powers to do something like what had been promised. The Board's work was assisted by a downturn in the profitability of sheep farming and, by the late 1920s, perhaps 50,000 acres (200 km²) of arable land and 750,000 acres (3,000 km²) of <b>hill</b> <b>pasture</b> had been given over to establishing new crofts. Most of the new crofts were in the Hebrides, the area where Gaelic best survives into to the present day. There at least it became possible to claim that the effects of the clearances had been largely reversed. Crofters benefited also in parts of Caithness, Sutherland, Shetland, and various other localities.|$|E
50|$|Colonial {{settlement}} of the area dates from 1841, with land used mainly for farming and grazing. Robert Jenkins acquired a hundred acres of <b>hill</b> <b>pasture.</b> In order to reach it he made a road up Mount Victoria, fenced much of his land and used it for breeding horses. Population was minimal until the late 19th century. In the early days the area was part of Kilbirnie in the Evans Bay district - so the school opened in Moxham Ave in 1884 was called Kilbirnie School. In 1901 the Hataitai Land Company was formed to sell sections on the hillsides north from Waitoa Road, and the area became known as Hataitai. In 1902 the new suburb was advertised by the cutting of gigantic letters spelling 'HATAITAI' in the turf of the town side of Mount Victoria. Many of the streets in Hataitai are named after native trees: Hinau Street, Konini Road, Matai Road, Rata Road, Rewa Road etc.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 50 th New Zealand Grassland Association Conference, 1 - 3 November 1988, Balclutha. <b>Hill</b> <b>pasture</b> renovation methods have been restricted {{in the past to}} surface oversowing of unaltered, trampled or burnt pastures. Unfortunately the old pasture recovers and may compete vigorously with the establishing new species, slowing pasture improvement. The availability of suitable herbicides has opened up a new opportunity for <b>hill</b> <b>pasture</b> development. Herbicide applied before oversowing can minimise the competition and allow the new species to establish more easily. The benefits include reduced time to attain optimal stocking rates and improved establishment control, but these are offset by higher initial costs. The technical aspects of the herbicide establishment methods are overshadowed by the economic factors which control the profitability of the programme, however successfully applied. As the cash flow patterns differ between the traditional renovation and the herbicide based techniques, changes in interest rates and prices have differential effects. Real interest rates below 7 % make both methods profitable but are more favourable to the herbicide technique at 1987 prices, Also, price increases favour the herbicide method. Among other issues affecting the speed and profitability of development and ultimate gain, management skill is found to be crucial and dominates both establishment methods...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hill</b> <b>pasture</b> {{systems are}} {{inherently}} variable due to both environmental (e. g. rainfall, temperature, altitude, slope, aspect and microtopography) and management (e. g. stock type, stocking rate, grazing behaviour and soil fertility) factors. Fertiliser application and grazing pressure {{are the two}} main tools used for <b>hill</b> <b>pasture</b> management, as hill pastures are non-arable {{and the success of}} oversowing into existing pastures has been limited. One aim of pasture management is to increase the percentage of desirable species (e. g. L perenne and T. repens) by changing composition rather than the addition of new species. Pasture botanical composition affects production directly through the productive capabilities of species present, but it is hypothesised that the number of species present play a role in pasture productivity and stability of <b>hill</b> <b>pasture</b> systems. A field survey and two glasshouse experiments were performed on <b>hill</b> <b>pasture</b> swards to identify the effects of imposed management and environmental factors on botanical composition. The relationship between species diversity and productivity was also investigated. Ten field survey data sets were collected from two research farms. These data sets reflected different management history, climate, season and time (28 year time lapse). Information collected for each data set included botanical composition, Olsen P, hill slope, standing green biomass, and species growth rate over a one month period. The results of the survey indicated that the same species were present on all sites surveyed, but the abundance of those species changed. For example, L. perenne, A. capillaris and T. repens were most abundant on the high fertility sites, A. capillaris was the dominant species on the low fertility sites, flatweeds were more abundant on the dry sites, and Muscii spp. were more abundant in spring than summer. There was no direct relationship between species diversity and pasture production, but factors such as hill slope, fertility and season appeared {{to play a role in}} a more complex, undefined relationship between species diversity and productivity. The first glasshouse experiment involved the application of two simulated management factors (i. e. defoliation height and treading) to <b>hill</b> <b>pasture</b> turves. The turves were removed from three hill country farmlets that had different management conditions imposed on them for 20 years. The abundance of A. capillaris, L. perenne, A. odoratum, Poa spp. and T. repens increased with the tall defoliation height, which was a positive effect, as was the increase in abundance of T. repens with treading. L. perenne and H. lanatus abundance decreased whilst treading was occurring, which was a negative effect. The second glasshouse experiment involved the application of a simulated environmental factor (i. e. moisture deficit and excess moisture) and its interaction with a management factor (i. e. treading) on the same turves. The abundance of H. lanatus, Poa spp., T. repens and other legumes decreased under the moisture deficit treatment. L. perenne abundance was unaffected. The abundance of C. cristatus, A. odoratum, F. rubra and L. perenne decreased under the excess moisture treatment, all others increased. T. repens abundance was increased with a combination of treading and excess moisture. Functional groups were developed as part of the objectives of this research programme, to simplify the system being studied. In response to the management and environmental factors applied to the turves, the functional groups were described as being increasers, decreasers or static. The results of the turves experiments were used to validate the definition of the functional groups. For example, the high fertility responsive grass functional group was more abundant on the high fertility turves and L. perenne, which is also responsive to high fertility conditions, was found to be in a functional group of its own because of its ability to recover from treading. A. capillaris, which like low fertility tolerant grasses was abundant on low fertility sites, was separated into a group of its own because of its great abundance and dominance of the sward. No definitive relationship between species diversity, production and stability of production was observed in the turves experiments. That A. capillaris was particularly dominant in all swards may have significantly influenced the relationship. As with the field survey, however, all species were observed on all turves, and just the abundance of those species changed. The results of this experimental work showed that pasture composition can be altered to a more desirable (leafy green with legumes and adapted to the environment in which they are occurring) form with the use of management factors such as fertiliser application, defoliation height and treading. That composition was changed without a change in the number of species present, suggested that such composition changes are reversible. The work also highlighted the importance of an environmental factor, that cannot be controlled by land managers (i. e. soil moisture), and its interaction with management practices in maintaining a desirable and stable pasture composition...|$|E
