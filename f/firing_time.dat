500|$|The launch {{was carried}} out with no obvious anomalies, but on September 27, 1983, during post-flight {{inspection}} of the solid rocket boosters, severe corrosion was discovered in the left-hand booster. The three-inch (8cm)-thick resin lining protecting the rocket nozzle, {{which was designed to}} erode about half its thickness during firing, was found to have burned down to as little as [...] in places. By some estimations, this left around 14 seconds of <b>firing</b> <b>time</b> before the nozzle would have ruptured, a situation which would have resulted in loss of control and the probable break-up of the spacecraft. It was later determined that this fault was due to the particular batch of resin used on this set of boosters. The burn-through problem was treated as a small mishap by the media, and did not receive significant interest until after the Challenger disaster in 1986; the only major contemporary public criticism came from NASA's Soviet counterparts. As a result of this incident, the flight of STS-9 was delayed for a month while the nozzles of its boosters were changed.|$|E

We propose in particular sufficient conditions under which the average cycle time tends to a finite positive value as the number of transitions tends to infinity. The convergence of the average cycle time, when the variances of the average cycle time, when the variances of the <b>firing</b> <b>times</b> decrease, is established. We also prove that, by putting enough tokens in all places, it is always possible to approach as close as possible to the minimum average cycle time which is equal to the maximum of the average transition <b>firing</b> <b>times.</b> Applications to manufacturing systems are presented.

North American Aviation removed the six M3 [...]50-caliber machine guns from four late-production F-86Es and six block-one F-86Fs, expanded the size of the gun bays, strengthened the surrounding frame assemblies, and mounted four newly developed T-160 20mm cannon in their place. Having a similar rate of fire, the cannons were expected to significantly increase the Sabre's lethality over that of the machine guns, whose armor-piercing incendiary ammunition was usually ineffective against jet aircraft above 35,000 feet of altitude. However, the heavier weight and bulk of the cannons and ammunition, while providing greater effective range, flatter trajectory, and higher velocity, limited the F-86 to only 400 total rounds, which reduced its total <b>firing</b> <b>time</b> by nearly 75%, from 16 to 4.6 seconds.|$|E

For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not so accurate beyond 600 metres. So you normally came in at 600 yards and would open fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and since you had to break away at 200 meters to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds <b>firing</b> <b>time.</b> Now, in two seconds, you can't sight.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the marking optimization of stochastic timed event graphs. The transition <b>firing</b> <b>times</b> are generated by random variables with general distributions. The marking optimization problem consists of obtaining a given cycle time while minimizing a p-invariant criterion. Some important properties have been established. In particular, the average cycle time {{is shown to}} be non-increasing {{with respect to the}} initial marking while the p-invariant criterion is non-decreasing. We further prove that the criterion value of the optimal solution is non-increasing in transition <b>firing</b> <b>times</b> in stochastic ordering's sense. Based on some existing lower bounds and upper bounds of the average cycle time, we show that the p-invariant criterion reaches its minimum when the <b>firing</b> <b>times</b> become deterministic and we establish the reachability conditions of a given cycle time. We also propose a heuristic algorithm. It starts from the optimal solution to the deterministic case and iteratively adds tokens to adequate places as long as the given cycle time is not obtained. Infinitesimal perturbation analysis of the average cycle time with respect to the transition <b>firing</b> <b>times</b> is used to identify the adequate places in which the new tokens are added. Numerical results show that the heuristic algorithm provides near optimal solutions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the performance evaluation of stochastic timed event graphs. The transition <b>firing</b> <b>times</b> are random variables with general distributions. We first consider a stochastic timed event graph {{in which the}} transition <b>firing</b> <b>times</b> are generated by the superposition (or addition) of two sets of random variables. Properties of this system are established.

Based on these superposition properties, we derive various upper bounds of the average cycle time of a general stochastic timed event graph. Especially, we obtain upper bounds which converge to the exact average cycle time as the standard deviations decrease. Finally, we derive performance bounds for stochastic timed event graphs with bounded transition <b>firing</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R
