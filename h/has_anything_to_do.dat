It is unlikely that it <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the optical imperfection of the mirror, which would, in reality, have displayed a focused image of the King and Queen". He notes that [...] "in addition to the represented mirror, he teasingly implies an unrepresented one, without which it is difficult to imagine how he could have shown himself painting the picture we now see".|$|E
500|$|A {{day before}} Pinkerton {{was to be}} {{released}} on September 24, 1996, a restraining order was obtained against the band and Geffen by Encino, California-based security firm Pinkerton's Inc. The company sued Weezer and Geffen for alleged federal trademark infringement, claiming {{they were trying to}} capitalize on the company's reputation. Under the terms of the restraining order, which had Pinkerton's Inc seeking two million dollars in damages, Weezer would be kept from [...] "selling, distributing, or advertising an album with the name Pinkerton." [...] Geffen spokesman Dennis Dennehy defended the title, arguing that [...] "to Weezer, Pinkerton is a character in Puccini's opera Madama Butterfly...It was not meant to be aimed at any sort of corporate entity." [...] Cuomo wrote a six-page paper defending his choice of the title, explaining [...] "why I chose it, and how it works for the album, and how it's essential." [...] The case was thrown out of court after the judge determined that [...] "the hardship of not issuing the Pinkerton disc would be greater for Geffen than any hardship Pinkerton's Inc or its shareholders might incur from consumers who mistakenly presume the company <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the album." ...|$|E

500|$|Hochuli's {{presence}} {{on the football field}} has created a cult following. His rise in popularity {{is believed to have been}} started by Phil Simms, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for the NFL on CBS, who made reference to the size of Hochuli's arms during a telecast. [...] On the Internet, websites that sell Hochuli merchandise as well as blogs with his namesake exist. He is often affectionately referred to as [...] "Hochules", a portmanteau of his last name and [...] "Hercules", in homage to his large biceps. While he is aware of his celebrity status, Hochuli does not understand it. He said in a USA Today interview, [...] "I get a kick out of the notoriety, because I'm just a referee. I'm not the players. The players are the game. They're what this is all about. I get notoriety because I explain things, and I get notoriety because I have a decent physique, which is funny because I'm a shrimp, a peewee compared to those players. Neither one of those things <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with whether I'm a good referee." [...] His recognition extends to the streets, in airports, and in the courtroom. He has been approached by notable athletes such as former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Charles Barkley at the airport. [...] "It never ceases to amaze me," [...] Hochuli told the Arizona Daily Star. [...] "The number of people that will just come up to me and recognize me." [...] He appreciates the attention, saying, [...] "I enjoy the fact that there are people who like me as a referee. I hear from a lot of people and I enjoy that. Like anybody, I like praise. Probably because of my personality, I thrive on that more than other people." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fearnley-Sander (1986) went {{one step}} further, {{defining}} Leibniz's characteristica {{as a combination}} of the algebra of logic (which Fearnley-Sander defined as the calculus ratiocinator) and the algebra of geometry (defined as the characteristica geometrica). Fearnley-Sander suggested that this combination had [...] "come to pass" [...] with the rise of universal algebra. Some people other than Fearnley-Sander working in the area of [...] "universal algebra," [...] the study of the mathematical and logical properties of algebraic structures generally, do not believe that universal algebra <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the characteristica.|$|E
2500|$|Asghar Bukhari of the UK Muslim Public Affairs Committee {{said that}} both the British Government and the Muslim {{community}} were at fault in dealing with [...] "extremism". He criticised the British Government for being involved in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan while [...] "completely denying that it <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the political situation around the Muslim world", and said that Muslim organisations [...] "have failed their own community by not teaching these young, angry men {{how to get a}} democratic change to this policy that's ruining so many lives". He described Muslim leaders as unwilling to bring about change, focussing on points of theology, rather than the practical education of young people in ways to achieve political change.|$|E
2500|$|But some {{scholars}} {{do not believe}} Āryabhaṭa's sine table <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with Hipparchus's chord table which does not exist today. Some scholars {{do not agree with}} this hypothesis that Hipparchus constructed a chord table. Bo C. Klintberg states [...] "With mathematical reconstructions and philosophical arguments I show that Toomer's 1973 paper never contained any conclusive evidence for his claims that Hipparchus had a 3438'-based chord table, and that the Indians used that table to compute their sine tables. Recalculating Toomer's reconstructions with a 3600' radius [...] i.e. the radius of the chord table in Ptolemy's Almagest, expressed in 'minutes' instead of 'degrees' [...] generates Hipparchan-like ratios similar to those produced by a 3438' radius. It is therefore possible that the radius of Hipparchus's chord table was 3600', and that the Indians independently constructed their 3438'-based sine table." ...|$|E

Ibrahimović's parents divorced when he was a child, and although his upbringing was divided between them, he spent more time with his father: 'I had time with my mother but I really lived with my father.' He has said in an 2012 interview with PSG that: [...] "My father is Muslim, my mother is Catholic, but none of that <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with football. I received a special education. I'm me and football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome..." [...] In an interview with CNN on 24 November 2015, he stressed that his Muslim background was [...] "not a factor" [...] in fans' perception of him: [...] "For me, it didn't change (anything) because my father is Muslim and my mother is Catholic...
