40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major prof es sor) The {{field-effect transistor}} offers advantages as a chopping de-vice since {{it does not}} have an offset voltage and it is not speed lirnited by its response tirne. Offset and drift are caused by Ieakage current and capacitive coupling between the control gate and the signal path. The capacitive component of this drift is proportional to frequency so in order to increase the chopping frequency and rnaintain low drift, it is neces-sary to cornpensate for the capacitive drifts. Two techniques of balancing a second capacitor against the detrirnental gate-drain capacitance of the chopper are investigated. First a <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitor</b> is used for balance, and capacitive off-set is reduced by about t / ZO. This balance is then irnproved by using the capacitance of a second FET for balance. This irnproves capacitive balance by a factor of two over the <b>fixed</b> <b>capacitor</b> technique and also allows for Redacted for Privacy cancellation of leakage currents.

So the power factor in this system gets reduced due to the inductive reactive power. But the electricity board has a standard limits regarding the power factor values and if the power factor goes below the specified limit; the electricity company charges the penalty to {{the industrial}} consumers. The automatic power factor correction panel provides the required compensation to overcome the inductive reactance by using the power capacitors. The microcontroller 8051 receives current signal from current transformer and simultaneously gives the signals to the various contactors to connect the capacitors in the line for the compensation. Thus by adding the capacitor to the line will compensate the reactive power and maintains the power factor near to unity.
