2500|$|A Burning Man {{spokeswoman}} {{replied that}} the policies are not new, {{were written by}} a {{former head of the}} EFF, were used when suing to block pornographic videos and ultimately arose from participant concerns: [...] "We’re proud that Black Rock City (a private event held on public land) is widely acknowledged as a bastion of creative freedom. ut that protection [...] does necessitate the acceptance of some general terms of engagement when it comes to cameras... EFF seems to think that anyone attending any event somehow has an absolute right to take photographs, and then to do whatever they want with those images without any effective restriction or manner of enforcement. While we believe that such rights do make sense <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> taking pictures in purely public spaces, this is not true in the private space of Burning Man – if it were it would mean that Burning Man couldn’t protect participant privacy or prevent commercialization of imagery." ...|$|E
2500|$|Studds was {{a central}} figure in the 1983 Congressional page sex scandal, when he and Representative Dan Crane were each {{separately}} censured by the House of Representatives for an inappropriate relationship with a congressional page — in Studds' case, a 1983 sexual relationship with a 17-year-old male. During {{the course of the}} House Ethics Committee's investigation, Studds publicly acknowledged his homosexuality, a disclosure that, according to a Washington Post article, [...] "apparently was not news to many of his constituents." [...] Studds stated in an address to the House, [...] "It is not a simple task <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to meet adequately the obligations of either public or private life, let alone both, but these challenges are made substantially more complex when one is, as I am, both an elected public official and gay." [...] He acknowledged that it had been inappropriate to engage in a relationship with a subordinate, and said his actions represented [...] "a very serious error in judgment." ...|$|E

50|$|A major benefit, {{compared}} to 40mm launchers, {{of this system}} is that it requires no licensing (and therefore no paperwork) <b>for</b> <b>any</b> level <b>of</b> <b>US</b> Government. This makes it a relatively easy purchase for Police and First Responders.|$|R
60|$|Now the {{conversation}} was getting awkward; {{it could not be}} pleasant <b>for</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to talk about what the world of the future might think of Mr. Crowder when it came to know all about him, and, appreciating this, my host quickly changed the subject.|$|R

6000|$|... "Madam," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have not}} pretended to {{misunderstand}} you. I {{think that you}} have spoken wisely. Your stepdaughter must solve for herself the great riddle.

60|$|Having come to {{know that}} this cabin belonged to the Hamilton plantation, there was every reason to believe Hunt would watch it closely, {{therefore}} <b>for</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> three lads to venture out even though we might be starving, would be much the same as advertising him of our whereabouts.|$|R
6000|$|... "To be honest, Arbuthnot, I don't {{think that}} there will be real good luck <b>for</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> over this woman--not in the {{ordinary}} sense, I mean.

6000|$|... "I might {{differ from}} you there, {{and say that}} the higher blonde types like the Anglo-Saxon--to say nothing of the wily Greeks--were the {{deceitful}} races: it might be difficult <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to say what a sly and deceitful man should be like"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will never}} escape," [...] replied von Horn, [...] "his own creatures will see to that.

60|$|Thus, we see, {{the matter}} is brought to this issue: We must either believe what God {{directly}} commands us in Holy Scripture, or we must wholly reject the Scripture, and the Christian religion which we pretend to profess. But this, I hope, is too desperate a step <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to make.|$|E
5000|$|Section 413(c) {{said that}} an {{employer}} who placed a worker with another employer was liable <b>for</b> <b>any</b> displacement <b>of</b> <b>US</b> {{workers at the}} other employer's worksite. Therefore, if required to make additional attestations due to being H-1B-dependent or having committed a past willful misrepresentation of material fact, it was the employer's responsibility {{to make sure that}} the other employer was not firing a US worker between 90 days before and after the placement.|$|R
60|$|These thing are far {{too serious}} <b>for</b> me or <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to indulge in {{controversy}} upon, {{but it is a}} satisfaction to be able to point out to the House that the policy we instructed the Governor-General to follow, has so far worked extremely well.|$|R

6000|$|... "I know it SEEMS {{so to the}} WORLD," [...] {{answered}} Julia in a subdued, thoughtful tone, [...] "but it scarcely {{seems so}} to ME.

6000|$|... "Come, come," [...] he remonstrated, [...] "no need <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to {{lose our}} tempers. Let us {{sit down and}} discuss this little matter like gentlemen. I am quite sure Mr. Pratt will do the square thing. I propose that we adjourn to the Milan. A bottle of the old sort, eh, Pratt?" ...|$|E
60|$|All {{yesterday}} {{writing my}} mail {{by the hand}} of Belle, to save my wrist. This is a great invention, to which I shall stick, {{if it can be}} managed. We had some alarm about Paatalise, but he slept well all night for a benediction. This lunatic asylum exercise has no attractions <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
500|$|Persistent trouble {{from the}} submarine's diesel engines then cut short the patrol after only eleven days, after which McCain {{returned}} to Pearl Harbor.

60|$|We cooked our meal as usual, only to {{discover}} that what Yva had said about the Life-water was quite true, since we had but little appetite for solid food, though this returned upon the following day. The same thing happened upon every occasion after drinking of that water which certainly was a most invigorating fluid. Never <b>for</b> years had <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> felt so well as it caused us to do.|$|R

60|$|We {{continue}} to get on very well together. We really do admirably. I lose no opportunity of inculcating the lesson {{that it is of}} no use to be out of temper in travelling, and it is very seldom wanted <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us.</b> Egg is an excellent fellow, and full of good qualities; I am sure a generous and staunch man at heart, and a good and honourable nature.|$|E
60|$|Each country {{producing}} {{that which}} it is best fitted to produce?--Yes, {{as well as it}} can; not striving to imitate or compete with the productions of other countries. Finally, I believe that the way of ascertaining what ought to be done for the workman in <b>any</b> position, is <b>for</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to suppose that he was our own son, and that he was left without any parents, and without any help; that there was no chance of his ever emerging out of the state in which he was, and then, that what we should each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> like to be done for our son, so left, we should strive to do for the workman.|$|R

500|$|In late 1949, President Truman asked Dean Acheson to {{concentrate}} {{on the question of whether}} the United States should develop the hydrogen bomb. Acheson formed a working group under the United States National Security Council (NSC) executive secretary Sidney Souers, consisting of R. Gordon Arneson, Paul Nitze and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind. He said, [...] "The four principals in the State Department were Acheson, Nitze, Fisher and myself. I don't think it was necessary <b>for</b> <b>any</b> one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> to persuade anybody else; we all were of a mind that there really wasn't any choice." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (M28) It is {{superfluous}} <b>for</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> at {{this day}} to pass judgment.
