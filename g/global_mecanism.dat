This work initiated by Caurier et al. has been recently revisited. Calculations in a large valence space involving the fp proton shell and the fpgd neutron shells including a strongly reduced 1 g 9 / 2 - 2 d 5 / 2 neutron gap down to ≈ 1. 5 MeV affect the whole N = 40 region and point out a new island of inversion similar to those known for light nuclei around N = 8 and N = 20. A <b>global</b> <b>mecanism</b> could be deduced, in the frame of the shell-model approach, of the emergence of islands of inversion at Harmonic-Oscillator shell gaps driven by two particle-two hole neutron excitations into quadrupole-partner orbitals across these gaps. Since now, no 5 / 2 + state has been assigned in previous studies of 69 Ni, an ideal laboratory to search for the neutron 2 d 5 / 2 orbital. A (d,p) reaction onto a 68 Ni beam produced at GANIL has been used to probe the single-particle energy of the 2 d 5 / 2 neutron orbital in 69 Ni. Two 5 / 2 + states with important spectroscopic Shell Model as a Unified View of Nuclear Structure / Livre des résumés 10 factors lying around 2. 5 MeV excitation energy have been observed, for the first time, in 69 Ni. The doublet is understood as the mixing of two main configurations of spherical nature. These results are in good agreement with large-scale shell-model calculations in which 2. 5 MeV 1 g 9 / 2 - 2 d 5 / 2 gap for neutrons is included, and confirm experimentally Caurier's assumption of a reduced 1 g 9 / 2 - 2 d 5 / 2 neutron gap at N = 40...|$|E
