5|$|Growth came rapidly {{over the}} next few years as the town saw the {{construction}} of a bank, a public school, a city hall, several sizable industries and a series of amusement parks at present-day Treaty Oak Park. In 1910 Atlantic Boulevard opened between South Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches, further cementing South Jacksonville's place as a hub for car and ferry traffic. By 1917 the town's population was ten times what it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> it was incorporated, so local leaders planned the original Acosta Bridge, connecting Jacksonville and South Jacksonville by road for the first time.|$|E
5|$|In February 1907, {{with nearly}} 300 new stockholders, Harvey began {{construction}} {{on his next}} hotel, Oklahoma Row, also designed by A. O. Clarke. It was built {{to the west of}} Missouri Row with a wide lawn. It had a similar log, concrete stone, and tile construction. The dining room was on the north end. Each of the 40 rooms had fireplaces, as did the dining room and center hall. Every room featured electric lights, sewerage, and running spring water. The hotel also boasted a three-story concrete tower, one of the earliest multistory concrete constructions in the country. Oklahoma Row and other construction projects drained Harvey's funds. Harvey managed to raise enough money to finish Oklahoma Row, but due to his lack of funds, when that hotel finally opened there was no gala event, as there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> Missouri Row was finished.|$|E

25|$|During Burebista's time, the Dacians became {{closer to}} the {{remaining}} Celtic populations than they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> the Celts ruled Transylvania. Evidence from the earlier period shows Celtic burials and settlements with only occasional Dacian elements, while Dacian settlements with Celtic finds are infrequent. This situation reversed after Burebista's conquest when a distinctive hybrid Celtic-Dacian culture emerged on the Hungarian plain and in the Slovakian regions.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 40 (the {{same age}} his father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> he married), Esau took two Hittite wives, Judith the {{daughter}} of Beeri, and Basemath the daughter of Elon, who vexed Isaac and Rebecca to no end, as these women were also idol-worshippers. One reason why Isaac became blind in his old age {{was due to the}} smoke of the incense that these women offered to their idols.|$|E

25|$|A {{shift in}} {{preferences}} at the microeconomic level, {{caused by an}} income effect can change the make-up of {{the consumer price index}} to include proportionately more expenditure on services. This alone may shift the consumer price index, and might make the non-trade sector look relatively less productive than it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> demand was lower; if service quality (rather than quantity) follows diminishing returns to labour input, a general demand for a higher service quality automatically produces a reduction in per-capita productivity.|$|E
25|$|The {{first was}} the US9 exit, revamped in 1999 {{at a cost of}} $25 million. I-84 was widened in both {{directions}} approaching the exit, a second overpass was added and the exit ramps were widened and signage improved. Around that time the two agencies also announced plans, and received federal funding, for a redone exit7 that would allow traffic to go directly between I-84 and the Thruway instead of using a short stretch of NY300, which by then was more heavily developed than it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> the interstates were first built. The three-phase construction project was initialized in May 2003 and completed in December 2009.|$|E

Wie remained the youngest to advance to match play in this tournament until 2014 when Lucy Li surpassed her by one week. In 2001, at the age of 11, she won both the Hawaii State Women's Stroke Play Championship and the JennieK. Wilson Women's Invitational, the oldest and most prestigious women's amateur tournament in Hawaii. She also advanced into match play at the Women's U.S. Amateur Public Links Championship.|$|E

Throughout 2005, while the Disengagement Plan was underway, some US government officials suggested to the Palestinian leadership to move the provisional capital back to Gaza, where it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> the Palestinian Aurhority was first established in 1994. President Abbas, however, refrained from doing so, arguing that at this point, it was important to keep the administrative center in the West Bank in order to remind the international community that the West Bank was still awaiting territorial solution.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's plan to {{convince}} Hoover {{to run for}} the Democratic nomination fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself to be a Republican, but Roosevelt nonetheless decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination. After Governor James M. Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the party formally nominated Roosevelt by acclamation. Although his nomination surprised most people, Roosevelt was considered as bringing balance to the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name. Roosevelt had just turned 38, four years younger than Theodore <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> he received the same nomination from his party. Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the Cox–Roosevelt ticket.|$|E
25|$|Bryansk Front {{was under}} the command of Gen. Andrey Yeryomenko. During the balance of August and most of September he ordered his forces, {{including}} the relatively fresh 50th Army, into repeated clashes with the German XLVII Motorized Corps over its possession of a bridgehead over the Desna anchored on the towns of Pochep and Pogar. This was also an attempt to disrupt 2nd Panzer Army as it prepared to strike southwards towards Kiev. These operations had little effect on the German forces and also severely weakened the Front just as it was to face its greatest test. As of Sept. 30, strength returns for 50th Army showed 61,503 personnel, 780 guns and mortars (of which 149 were antitank guns), but only 7 tanks. It was still one of the stronger armies before Moscow, but not so strong as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> formed.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} regeneration or renewal {{was that the}} Doctor's body would rebuild itself in a younger, healthier form. The Second Doctor {{was intended to be}} a literally younger version of the First; biological time would turn back, and several hundred years would get taken off the Doctor's age, rejuvenating him. In practice, however, since the Doctor stated his age in the Second Doctor serial The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), his age has been recorded progressively (see below). In six out of ten transitions, the new actor was younger than his predecessor <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> he began the role. In the revived programme, the pattern is resumed with the transition of the Ninth to the Tenth and the Tenth to the Eleventh Doctor, although Steven Moffat is on record stating the intention was to cast an actor in his mid-30s to 40s for the role of the Eleventh Doctor, despite casting Matt Smith, who is the youngest actor to ever have played the role.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she looks a lot like Hazumu.|$|E
25|$|But {{the main}} problem for the British was discontent among their soldiers. The troops in India were no longer as {{uncritical}} as they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> considering what they were being asked to do. Like other units of the British Army many of the troops considered the war over and looked forward to being demobilised. The Indian Army had been heavily committed to the First World War and had suffered {{a large number of}} casualties. Many of its units still had not returned from overseas, and those that had, had begun the process of demobilisation and as such many regiments had lost almost all their most experienced men. Likewise, the British Army in India had been gutted. Prior to 1914 there had been 61 British regiments serving in India. However, of these all but 10 (two cavalry and eight infantry) had been withdrawn in order to fight in Europe or the Middle East. In their place, units of the Territorial Army (TA), part-time soldiers usually only intended for home defence but who had volunteered for overseas service, had been sent in order to release regular units for the fighting in France. After four years of mundane garrison duty, away from their families and disaffected, most of these men were really only interested in demobilisation and returning to Britain to get on with their lives. They were in no way prepared for a hard fought campaign on the Indian frontier.|$|E

25|$|After Mickey dies in 2010, Maggie {{begins a}} new {{friendship}} with Victor Kiriakis. The two grow closer, despite Victor's marriage to Vivian Alamain. The vengeful Vivian plots to have Maggie entombed in a crypt in the Kiriakis mausoleum, but as fate has it, ends up there herself. When Vivian is freed, {{she manages to}} entrap Maggie, and for days, her relatives are worried about her absence. Eventually, Victor finds her and she is rushed to the hospital. Maggie is stunned when she discovers that Victor knew Vivian was entrapped and did nothing about it. After Victor demands a divorce from Vivian, he begins to court Maggie. She struggles to accept Victor and his criminal past, but is able to build a relationship with him. Maggie and Victor begin to date and Victor proposes to Maggie in September 2011. During their engagement, Hope comes across a letter from Alice to Maggie, written the day before Alice died. Alice reminds Maggie about an experimental program she and Mickey entered into over thirty years prior, Maggie had attempted to harvest some of her eggs. Eventually she and Mickey abandoned the project, though the eggs were preserved. It was revealed that Daniel Jonas was her biological son, a product of these missing eggs. This also makes Melanie Layton her granddaughter. On November 8, 2011, Victor and Maggie get married. That Christmas Julie tells Maggie that she {{will always be a}} member of the Horton family, and extends an ornament to Victor, Daniel, and Melanie, despite their not being biological Hortons. In 2012, Maggie and Victor experience brief marital trouble when it is revealed that Victor knew about Maggie's missing eggs all those years. Maggie was eventually able to forgive him although she continues to keep him in line when his ruthless ways get the better of him. Maggie also said goodbye to Melanie, who left town. Additionally, Maggie opened her home to her nephew, Nick Fallon, Marie's grandson, who was recently paroled. Though Maggie has a new husband, son, granddaughter, and home, she is considered to be the matriarch of the Horton Family and still maintains a relationship with the members of the Horton family.In February 2016 her son Daniel Jonas was injured in a car accident that also injured Eric Brady, Brady Black and Jennifer Horton. He eventually dies from his injuries and Maggie makes the decision to take Daniel off Life Support and donate his heart to her Step-Grandson Brady. Maggie's life began to get more complicated when a young woman named Summer showed up in Salem and informed her that she was the child Maggie had when she was only 17 and had believed to be stillborn. In the middle of all of this, Victor's estranged brother, Deimos, showed up, vowing revenge against Victor. He poisoned Maggie with pills that caused her to have dizzy spells. After one serious dizzy spell, Maggie fell down the stairs in the Kiriakis mansion, was rushed to the hospital, where Victor was informed that not only had she broken her back, but that her legs were once again paralyzed, like they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> she had first met Mickey. Victor learned that Deimos had poisoned her and had an antidote which he would give Maggie on the condition that Victor turn all his assets over to him. Determined to save Maggie from instant death, Victor agreed. Maggie's recovery seemed more psychological than physical, but with support from her husband and the Horton's, Maggie became encouraged to fight to walk once again, and Victor declared his determination to stand by her in her time of need, even deciding to retire from Titan to devote all of his time to her.|$|E
