25|$|Davidson {{points out}} that beliefs and {{meanings}} are inseparable. A person holds a sentence true {{based on what he}} believes and what he takes the sentence to mean. If the interpreter <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> person believed when that person held a sentence to be true, the meaning of the sentence could then be inferred. Vice versa, if the interpreter <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> person took a sentence to mean when that person held it to be true, the belief of the speaker could be inferred. So Davidson doesn't allow the interpreter to have access to beliefs as evidence, since the interpreter would then be begging the question. Instead, Davidson allows that the interpreter can reasonably ascertain when a speaker holds a sentence true, without knowing anything about a particular belief or meaning. That will then allow the interpreter to construct hypotheses relating a speaker and an utterance to a particular state of affairs at a particular time.|$|E

[...] Though the arrangement preserved the American label, The Black Crowes transferred to Columbia after privately expressing {{their desire to}} disassociate themselves from American Recordings founder Rick Rubin. [...] Despite working under a larger label, the band felt they had more freedom and support under Columbia; Chris remarked, [...] "At American, I never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> record company did.

500|$|Criticism of Landis having {{both the}} {{judicial}} and baseball positions began {{almost as soon}} as his baseball appointment was announced in November 1920. On February 2, 1921, lame duck Congressman Benjamin F. Welty (Democrat-Ohio) offered a resolution calling for Landis's impeachment. On February 11, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer opined that there was no legal impediment to Landis holding both jobs. [...] On February 14, the House Judiciary Committee voted 24–1 to investigate Landis. Reed Landis later stated, [...] "one of the other congressmen wanted Father impeached but they did want him to come down and defend himself because they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> show it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|The synergy between Taylor Street’s Little Italy and the Hull House complex; i.e., the {{settlement}} {{house and its}} summer camp, the Bowen Country Club, is well documented. [...] Alice Hamilton, medical professional and early member of that elite Hull House hierarchy, wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Those Italian women <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> baby needed, far better than my Ann Arbor professors did." [...] The ancillary literature between, among and about members of Hull House's inner sanctum of sociologists and philanthropists is littered with such comments, reinforcing the relationship that existed between Taylor Street's Little Italy and Hull House. [...] A review of the ethnic composition of those who registered for and utilized the services provided by the Hull House complex, during its 74 years as a tenant of the near-west side, suggests an ethnic bias. Of the 257 known WWII veterans who were alumni of the Bowen Country Club, [...] "virtually all had a vowel {{at the end of}} their names...denoting their Italian heritage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to England {{after two years}} abroad, he presented to his parents a mature, sophisticated, well-mannered, [...] "modish" [...] gentleman, though Samuel Pepys noted young Penn's [...] "vanity of the French". Penn had developed a taste for fine clothes, {{and for the rest}} of his life would pay somewhat more attention to his dress than most Quakers. The Admiral had great hopes that his son then had the practical sense and the ambition necessary to succeed as an aristocrat. He had young Penn enroll in law school but soon his studies were interrupted. With warfare with the Dutch imminent, young Penn decided to shadow his father at work and join him at sea. Penn functioned as an emissary between his father and the King, then returned to his law studies. Worrying about his father in battle he wrote, [...] "I never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> father was till I had wisdom enough to prize him...I pray God...that you come home secure." [...] The Admiral returned triumphant but London was in the grip of the plague of 1665. Young Penn reflected on the suffering and the deaths, and the way humans reacted to the epidemic. He wrote that the scourge [...] "gave me a deep sense of the vanity of this World, of the Irreligiousness of the Religions in it." [...] Further he observed how Quakers on errands of mercy were arrested by the police and demonised by other religions, even accused of causing the plague.|$|E
2500|$|Josephus gives {{a similar}} account in his Antiquities of the Jews, Bk 8, Ch 7, [...] Section 5, “Solomon was fallen headlong into {{unreasonable}} pleasures, and regarded not those admonitions; {{for when he}} had married seven hundred wives, the daughters of princes and of eminent persons, and three hundred concubines, and those besides the king of Egypt's daughter, he soon was governed by them, until he came to imitate their practices. He was forced to give them this demonstration of his kindness and affection to them, to live according {{to the laws of}} their countries. And as he grew into years, and his reason became weaker by length of time, it was not sufficient to recall to his mind the institutions of his own country; so he still more and more condemned his own God, and continued to regard the gods that his marriages had introduced nay, before this happened, he sinned, and fell into an error about the observation of the laws, when he made the images of brazen oxen that supported the brazen sea, and the images of lions about his own throne; for these he made, although it was not agreeable to piety so to do; and this he did, notwithstanding that he had his father as a most excellent and domestic pattern of virtue, and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> glorious character he had left behind him, because of his piety towards God.” ...|$|E
