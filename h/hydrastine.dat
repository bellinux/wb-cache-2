50|$|Goldenseal {{contains}} the isoquinoline alkaloids: <b>hydrastine,</b> berberine, berberastine, hydrastinine, tetrahydroberberastine, canadine, and canalidine. A related compound, 8-oxotetrahydrothalifendine was identified in one study. One study analyzed the <b>hydrastine</b> and berberine contents of twenty commercial goldenseal and goldenseal-containing products and found they contained variously 0%-2.93% <b>hydrastine</b> and 0.82%-5.86% berberine. Berberine and <b>hydrastine</b> act as quaternary bases and are poorly {{soluble in water}} but freely soluble in alcohol. The herb seems to have synergistic antibacterial activity over berberine in vitro, possibly due to efflux pump inhibitory activity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydrastine</b> is an {{alkaloid}} {{which was}} discovered in 1851 by Alfred P. Durand.

50|$|The {{first attempt}} {{for the total}} {{synthesis}} of <b>hydrastine</b> was reported by Sir Robert Robinson and co-workers in 1931. Following studies, which were mostly troublesome for the synthesis of the key lactonic amide intermediate (structure 4 in Figure). The major breakthrough was achieved in 1981 when J. R. Falck and co-workers reported a four-step total synthesis of <b>hydrastine</b> from simple starting materials. The key step in the Flack synthesis was using a Passerini reaction to construct the lactonic amide intermediate 4.|$|E
50|$|Starting from {{a simple}} phenylbromide variant 1, {{alkylation}} reaction with lithium methylisocyanide gives the isocyanide intermediate 2. Reacting isocyanide intermediate 2 with opianic acid 3 initiated the intramolecular Passerini reaction to give the key lactonic amide intermediate 4. The tetrahydro-isoquinolin ring was formed by first a ring-closure reaction under dehydration conditions using POCl3 and then a catalyzed hydrogenation using PtO2 as the catalyst. Finally, <b>hydrastine</b> was synthesized by installing the N-methyl group via reductive amination reaction with formaldehyde.|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of papers Manske (1) reports the {{isolation}} and {{the determination of the}} structure of several new alkaloids from Fumariaceous plants. Bicuculline was found in Dicentra cucul-lana, Corydalis sempervirens, Corydalis aurea and Adlumia fungosa; from the latter plant adlumine was also isolated. A supply of these alkaloids was made available through the gen-erosity of Dr. Manske, of the National Research Council Labora-tories, Ottawa, thus enabling us to undertake a study of their pharmacological properties. The intimate chemical relationship which exists between these alkaloids and <b>hydrastine</b> suggested that a study should include comparisons with <b>hydrastine.</b> It may be seen that bicuculline differs from <b>hydrastine</b> only by the substitution of a methyl-enedioxy group for the dimethoxy grouping of the latter; in ad-lumine the dimethoxy grouping and the methylenedioxy group of <b>hydrastine</b> are reversed in position.

40|$|Abstract Background The growing {{popularity}} of Chinese herbal medicine in the United States has prompted large-scale import of raw herbs from Asia. Many of the Asian herbs have phylogenetically related North American species. We compared three phylogenetically related species, namely Coptis chinensis (Huanglian), Hydrastis canadensis and Coptis trifolia to show whether they can be substituted by one another in terms of alkaloid content. Methods We used microwave assisted extraction to obtain alkaloids berberine, coptisine, palmatine and <b>hydrastine.</b> High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to quantify each alkaloid. Results Hydrastis canadensis has the most berberine, whereas Coptis trifolia has the most coptisine. <b>Hydrastine</b> and palmatine were unique to Hydrastis canadensis and Coptis chinensis respectively. Conclusion Neither Hydrastis canadensis nor Coptis trifolia contains all the alkaloids found in Coptis chinensis used in Chinese medicine.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{robustness}} and the versatility of pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) {{for a variety}} of analytes and matrices. Applications discussed include: selective extraction of alkaloids in goldenseal followed by their degradation studies; in-cell clean-up of pesticides in medicinal plants employing custom made molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) sorbents; in-cell pre-concentration followed by desorption of aflatoxins in plants with MIPs; desorption of pesticides from electrospun nanofiber sorbents; and removal of templates from MIPs sorbents. It was demonstrated that selective extractions could be achieved by just changing the temperature of water while adjusting the pressure. For instance, the alkaloids in goldenseal (<b>hydrastine</b> and berberine), were extracted at 140 °C, 50 bars, 1 mL min⁻¹ in 15 min; organochlorine pesticides from medicinal plants were extracted at 260 °C, 80 bars, 1 mL min- 1 in 10 min; while aflatoxins AFG 2, AFG 1, AFB 2 and AFB 1 were extracted at 180 °C, 60 bars and a flow rate of 0. 5 mL min⁻¹ in 10 min. The selectivity of PHWE was further enhanced by combining it with selective MIPs sorbents at higher temperatutes. In-cell clean-up of interfering chlorophyll was successfully removed from the medicinal plants during pesticides analysis while clean-up of aflatoxins AFG 2, AFG 1, AFB 2 and AFB 1 was achieved in two extraction cells connected in series. Ultrasound was also combined with PHWE for extraction of <b>hydrastine</b> and berberine at 80 °C and 40 bars in 30 min. PHWE was further evaluated for removal of templates from quercetin, phthalocynine and chlorophyll MIPs. The templates were thoroughly washed off their MIPs within 70 min with PHWE compared to over 8 h for Soxhlet and ultrasound assisted extraction. Pesticides were also desorbed from electrospun nanofibers at 260 °C, 80 bars in 10 min employing only water at 0. 5 mL min⁻¹. In the light of green chemistry, the decrease in the usage of organic solvents was 100 %, resulting in no organic solvent waste. ...|$|E

40|$|To promote {{recovery}} and crop potential of Hydrastis canadensis [...] -a botanical threatened in Canada [...] -wild populations were phytochemically surveyed. Berberine, <b>hydrastine</b> and canadine were characterized in root-rhizome, stem-leaf, and berry pulp. Comparisons with cultivated material showed {{no difference in}} alkaloid content, thus the medicinal value of cultivated material is not likely increased with addition of wild plants. Quantitative analyses suggested genetic diversity among wild populations. Regression analyses indicated a minor relationship between latitude and alkaloid yield. Because H. canadensis and other botanicals may cause adverse botanical-drug interactions, 22 botanicals were assayed for cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 C 19, CYP 3 A 4 and CYP 19 inhibition. Eight botanicals inhibited CYP 2 C 19 by ≥ 57 %, 17 inhibited CYP 3 A 4 by ≥ 40 % and CYP 19 by ≥ 50 %, of which Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, H canadensis, Oenothera biennis, Rhodiola rosea and Sanguinaria canadensis were most potent.

40|$|AbstractGoldenseal {{has been}} used for the {{treatment}} {{of a wide variety of}} ailments including gastrointestinal disturbances, urinary tract disorders, and inflammation. The five major alkaloid constituents in goldenseal are berberine, palmatine, <b>hydrastine,</b> hydrastinine, and canadine. When goldenseal was evaluated by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) in the standard 2 -year bioassay, goldenseal induced an increase in liver tumors in rats and mice; however, the mechanism of goldenseal-associated liver carcinogenicity remains unknown. In this study, the toxicity of the five goldenseal alkaloid constituents was characterized, and their toxic potencies were compared. As measured by the Comet assay and the expression of γ-H 2 A. X, berberine, followed by palmatine, appeared to be the most potent DNA damage inducer in human hepatoma HepG 2 cells. Berberine and palmatine suppressed the activities of both topoisomerase (Topo) I and II. In berberine-treated cells, DNA damage was shown to be directly associated with the inhibitory effect of Topo II, but not Topo I by silencing gene of Topo I or Topo II. In addition, DNA damage was also observed when cells were treated with commercially available goldenseal extracts and the extent of DNA damage was positively correlated to the berberine content. Our findings suggest that the Topo II inhibitory effect may contribute to berberine- and goldenseal-induced genotoxicity and tumorigenicity...|$|E

40|$|A quick, {{efficient}} and environmentally beneficial approach for {{the extraction of}} alkaloids in goldenseal based on pressurized hot water extraction (PHWE) is presented. PHWE was evaluated following the extraction of <b>hydrastine</b> and berberine which are the two main alkaloids of goldenseal. The effect s of temperature and other parameters on extraction yields were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The extraction yields were compared to those achieved through reflux and ultrasonic extraction methods. PHWE employed hot water at an optimal temperature of 140 ℃, a pressure of 50 bars and flow rate of 1 mL. min - 1 for extraction experiments conducted in the dynamic mode. Both PHWE and conventional methods achieved comparable extraction yields. Reflux and ultrasonic extractions had procedures that were slower (over 6 h) and employed large quantities (200 mL) of organic solvents. The PHWE method was simple and relatively fast as extraction was achieved in 15 min. At 95 % con fidence level (n = 3), reflux and ultrasonic methods recorded extraction yields that {{were not significantly different}} from that of PHWE. Moreover, PHWE employed a more readily available “ green ” solvent, (water) to achieve comparable results to those of conventional methods which utilize d organic solvents. The percentage relative standard deviations (%RSD) for the extraction yields were less than 3 % in all cases indicating the high reproducibility of the method. However, when using PHWE to extract thermally labile analytes like alkaloids, degradation effects also occurred. Increasing the temperatures certainly achieved higher extraction yields but also led to degradation of these thermally labile compounds indicating a necessity for optimization. </p...|$|E

The methods included {{the use of the}} polymeric Agilent Bond Elut Plexa solid phase extraction and electrospun polymer-silica composite sorbents for clean-up and preconcentration. Sample clean-up for alkaloids (<b>hydrastine</b> and berberine) in goldenseal, Hydrastis canadensis and flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin) in Ginkgo biloba was achieved using Bond Elut Plexa SPE sorbent. Clean-up of flavonoids in Ginkgo biloba was also achieved using electrospun polymer-silica composite (polystyrene-silica, polyacrylonitrile-silica and nylon 6 -silica) sorbents. All analysis of flavonoids and alkaloids was carried out using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC coupled with a diode array detector. Good peak separation was achieved in less than 6 min employing an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C 18 column (4. 6 x 75 mm, 3. 5 μm) at 35 ⁰C. The mobile phases employed were 0. 1 % phosphoric acid/methanol gradient and 0. 5 % phosphoric acid/methanol (40 : 60) for alkaloids and flavonoids respectively. The calibration curves exhibited linearity up to 120 μg mL⁻¹ with correlation coefficients of more than 0. 9980. The recoveries ranged from 73 - 109 % with relative standard deviation of less than 5 % for all analytes. Agilent Chem Elut supported liquid extraction was employed {{for the development of a}} sample preparation method for the determination of 24 banned aromatic amines from azo dyes in textile following the EU standard method EN 14362 - 1 : 2003 (E) and the Chinese standard method GB/T 17592 - 2006. The supported liquid extraction was effective in the extraction of the aromatic amines from textile (cotton, wool and polyester/cotton [80 %: 20 %]). Most of the recoveries obtained were conforming to the minimum requirements set in the EN 14362 - 1 : 2003 (E) standard method and the relative standard deviations were less than 15 %. Good peak separation was obtained within 70 min run time using the Agilent Zorbax SB-Phenyl column (4. 6 mm x 250 mm, 5 -micron) or the Agilent DB- 35 MS (J & W) (30 m x 0. 25 mm, 0. 25 μm film thickness.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{constituents of}} Ochrosia oppositifolia, Rauvolfia reflexa (Apocynacea) and Actinodaphne machrophylla (Lauracea) have been studied. The compounds were {{extracted from the}} bark and leaves of the plants using n-hexane, dichloromethane and methanol as solvents. The crudes were subjected to extensive chromatographic techniques such as column chromatography (CC), preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Structural elucidation was established through several spectroscopic methods, such as 1 D-NMR (1 H, 13 C, DEPT, NOE), 2 D-NMR (COSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC), UV, IR, and MS (GCMS, LCMS and HREIMS) and comparison with the published data. In this study, a total of twenty eight known and new compounds were isolated. Three known indole alkaloids namely isoreserpiline (120), neisosposinine (121) and reserpinine (122) were isolated from the bark of Ochrosia oppositifolia. Ten indole alkaloids and one β- carboline alkaloid {{were obtained from the}} bark of Rauvolfia reflexa, these are rauvolfine B (123), rauvolfine C (124) vinorine (125), rescinnamine (126), cantleyine (127), akuammilan- 17 -oic acid, 1, 2 -dihydro- 3 -hydroxy- 1 -methyl-, methyl ester (128), undulifoline (129), macusine B (130), isoreserpiline (120), akuammilan- 17 -oic acid, 12 -hydroxy-, methyl ester (131) among these rauvolfine B (123) and rauvolfine C (124) appeared to be new. In addition, six known phenolic compounds and one new β- carboline alkaloid were isolated from the leaves of Rauvolfia reflexa namely 17 -methoxy-carbonyl- 14 - heptadecaenyl- 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy cinnamate (132), 3 -methyl- 10, 11 -dimethoxyl- 6 -methoxycarbonyl- β- carboline (133), (E) -methyl 3 -(4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dimethoxyphenyl) acrylate (134), 1, 2, 3, 4 - tetrahydro - 1 - oxo-β- carboline (135), 3 -hydroxy-β-carboline (136), (E) - 3 -(3, 4, 5 -trimethoxyphenyl) acrylic acid (137) and benzenepropanoic acid, 3 - methoxy ii (138). 17 -methoxy-carbonyl- 14 - heptadecaenyl- 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxy cinnamate (132), and 3 - methyl- 10, 11 -dimethoxyl- 6 - methoxycarbonyl- β- carboline (133) were the new compounds isolated from the leaves of Rauvolfia reflexa. The bark of Actinodaphne machrophylla has afforded eight known isoquinoline alkaloids, cycleanine (139), (-) - 10 -demethylxylopinine (140), reticuline (141), (+) - laurotetanine (142), (+) - bicuculine (143), (-) α- <b>hydrastine</b> (144), (+) - parafumine (145) and (+) - anolobine (146). Six samples from the bark and leaves of ochrosia oppositifolia including three crude extracts and three indole alkaloids and eight isoquinoline alkaloids from the bark of Actinodaphne machrophylla have been tested for their in-vitro inhibitory activity against P. falciparum 3 D 7. Among the crude extracts of Ochrosia oppositifolia dichloromethane crude extract of bark showed the most potent inhibitory activity, with the IC 50 value of 0. 05051 μg/mL, the other crude extracts and compounds showed weak or no inhibitory activity against P. falsiparum as compare as standard which is chloroquine. Three indole alkaloids isolated from the bark of Ochrosia oppositifolia and eight isoquinoline alkaloids isolated from the bark of Actinodaphne machrophylla showed moderate in vitro antiplasmodial activities against Plasmodium falciparum 3 D 7 with the IC 50 of 0. 29 μM, 0. 75 μM and 1. 13 μM for isoreserpiline (120), neisosposinine (121), reserpinine (122) and 0. 08 μM, 1. 18 μM, 3. 11 μM, 0. 65 μM, 0. 26 μM, 3. 99 μM and 1. 38 μM for cycleanine (139), (-) - 10 -Demethylxylopinine (140), reticuline (141), (+) - laurotetanine (142), (+) – bicuculine (143), (-) - a- <b>hydrastine</b> (144), (+) - parfumine (145) and (+) - anolobine (146) respectively which are comparible with standard chloroquine. Antialzheimer activity of crude extracts and pure compounds isolated from the leaves and the bark of Rauvolfia reflexa was carried out. The dichloromethane and ethanol crude iii extracts of the leaves and methanol crude extract of the bark exhibited good inhibitory activity against both enzymes, while the methanol crude extract of the leaves showed moderate inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Cytotoxic effects of rauvolfine B (123), macusine B (130) and isoreserpiline (120) against different cancer and normal cell lines were determined. At the tested concentrations (1. 5 – 250 μM), macusine B (130) and isoreserpiline (120) did not effectively suppress the cell proliferations of cancer cells. Rauvolfine B (123) revealed moderate cytotoxic effects against two breast cancer cells (MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231) and colon cancer cells (HT- 29). However, test on colon cancer cells (HCT- 116), rauvolfine B (123) elicited the strongest cytotoxic effect with IC 50 value of 46. 86, 39. 93 and 33. 38 μM after 24, 48 and 72 h of treatment respectively. Rauvolfine B (123) was selected for further study on the possible mechanism as it shown potential activity activity against HCT- 116 cell line. Morphological changes in the treated HCT- 116 cells with rauvolfine B (123) were observed under fluorescent microscope.
