40|$|The {{trademark}} cancellation petitions {{and subsequent}} appeals surrounding the Washington Redskins’ allegedly disparaging trademarks lay useful groundwork {{in determining the}} applicability of the equitable defense <b>of</b> <b>laches</b> {{in the face of a}} purported greater public interest. The Lanham Act gives individuals the power to petition to cancel federally registered marks that may be disparaging to a group of individuals, while also permitting trademark holders to assert the equitable defense <b>of</b> <b>laches</b> in the event of unreasonable delay and consequential prejudice. In Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo, the District Court for the District of Columbia and the D. C. Circuit held that the defense <b>of</b> <b>laches</b> is applicable to a claim that a trademark is disparaging, finding that applying a public interest exception is untenable. However, in what is essentially a relitigation of Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo, the Eastern District of Virginia disallowed the application of the defense <b>of</b> <b>laches</b> in cancellation petitions based on disparagement claims, citing a greater public interest in Pro-Football, Inc. v. Blackhorse. While circuits often split, this inconsistency is avoidable as the public interest exception to the defense <b>of</b> <b>laches</b> is contrary to the essence of trademark law and attempts to apply a sweeping rationalization to a narrow subset of the population. The Fourth Circuit’s impending decision on appeal from the Eastern District of Virginia will have extensive ramifications for the private interests of trademark holders...|$|R
40|$|This Comment {{argues that}} {{inconsistent}} application of limitations periods to ATCA claims {{does not provide}} sufficient and certain notice to potential parties {{to allow them to}} bring a timely claim, thereby potentially denying them an opportunity to receive a fair hearing in federal courts. Absent a U. S. Supreme Court ruling to provide consistent guidance on the applicable ATCA limitations period, Congress should amend the statute to provide a specific ten-year limitations period for most torts. Because both international and U. S. laws provide that murder committed as part of the crime of genocide has no statute of limitations, 2 ̆ 2 ATCA claims arising from genocidal acts should also be free of any limitations period. Part II provides general background on statute of limitations jurisprudence and related concepts, such as borrowing statutes, the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> repose and <b>laches,</b> equitable tolling, and the discovery rule. Part II also examines the application of limitations law in federal courts. Part III reviews the history and progression of application of limitations law to the ATCA, focusing on the inconsistency of the limitations periods in representative ATCA claims. Part IV examines arguments for and against amending the ATCA to include a fixed limitations period, and evaluates several proposed alternatives for Congress to consider when amending the ATCA. Part IV also presents the key elements that the amended ATCA should contain. Part V presents conclusions about the appropriate limitations period for Congress to adopt...|$|R

50|$|The Court then {{considered}} the applicability <b>of</b> <b>laches</b> {{to the case}} at hand. Because the defense depends on the laxity of the plaintiff in pursuing his rights - which can not effectively be pursued until the plaintiff has {{reached the age of}} majority - the Court found that the defense could not be applied against the youngest plaintiff, who was only one year old when the trademarks were first registered in 1967.
