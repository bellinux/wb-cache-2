This time Want took command of his own 6-gun 60-man Spanish brigantine named Dolphin, fitted out in Philadelphia, and he obtained a privateering commission from the <b>governor</b> to <b>cover</b> his activities. In 1694 Tew and Want sailed out alongside another Providence companion, Joseph Faro in the Portsmouth Adventure.|$|R

5000|$|In 1670, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) {{was granted}} a charter by King Charles II, giving it a trading {{monopoly}} over the watershed of all rivers and streams flowing into Hudson Bay, an area known as [...] "Rupert's Land" [...] (named in honour of Prince Rupert of the Rhine, the king's cousin and the company's first <b>governor).</b> This <b>covered</b> an area of 3.9 million km2 (1.5 million sq mi), over one-third the area of Canada today.|$|R
2500|$|The Louisiana media gave wide {{coverage}} to the McKeithen-Lyons battle. Adras LaBorde, {{managing editor of}} the Alexandria Daily Town Talk,' took advantage of the state's first heated Democrat-Republican campaign for <b>governor</b> and <b>covered</b> the election widely in his column [...] "The Talk of the Town". Both Shreveport papers, The Times and the now defunct Shreveport Journal, owned by Douglas F. Attaway and edited by the conservative journalist George W. Shannon, covered nearly every aspect of the campaign. Both papers endorsed Lyons and later in the year Goldwater.|$|R
50|$|Considering {{the fact}} that the Law No. 96-06 of 18th January 1996 did not yet came into force, a region is under the {{authority}} of a Governor appointed by Presidential Decree meaning that the governor represents the authority of the President of the Republic and implicitly upholds the authority of the State in the province/region where he is appointed. Each Ministers assigns to each region a competent provincial delegate in charge of implementing the policy of the state in his province {{within the framework of the}} responsibility assigned to their respective Ministerial department. For example, the Minister of Public Health appoints to each province a Delegate in charge of Public Health to coordinate the duty assigned to the Ministry of Public Health at the regional level. It is the same for all the Ministerial departments. With the collaboration of provincial delegates, the <b>governor</b> <b>covers</b> the general administration and co-ordination of the work of the civil service in the province, with the exception of those aspects that fall within the remit of the Minister for justice. And we also have to notice that all local government officials are employees of the central government’s Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.As the country is subdivided into regions, the regions are subdivided into departments.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most famous}} scandal of the 19th and 20th centuries {{was known as}} the Dance of the Forty-One. [...] The {{incident}} revolved around a raid executed on November 18, 1901, during Porfirio Díaz's term of office. The raid, executed on Calle de la Paz (since renamed Calle Ezequiel Montes), was against a dance attended by 41 men, of which 22 were dressed as men and 19 as women. The Mexican press fed on the event, despite the <b>Governor's</b> efforts to <b>cover</b> it up, since the participants belonged to the upper echelons of society. The list of the detainees was never published.|$|R
50|$|The current Newtown {{residence}} {{was designed}} in an Arts & Crafts {{style in the}} manner of a half-timbered Tudor mansion. As it was intended to evoke a large English Country House the rooms were designed in a range of styles from Elizabethan and Tudor to Georgian and Regency. Throughout the house are examples of what was considered good taste at the time; marble fireplaces, parquet floors, oak panelling, Mahogany doors, leadlight windows, bronze electric light fixtures and fine neo-Georgian plasterwork ceilings. Various portraits of successive Governors and other significant people are displayed along with a collection of New Zealand art, some of which has been donated by previous <b>Governors.</b> The house <b>covers</b> 4200 m2.|$|R
5000|$|In {{anticipation}} of US midterm elections, News Corp. donated $1 {{million to the}} Republican Governors Association in June 2010. The move was criticised by Democrats, who said this was evidence of News Corp's media outlets conservative leanings (see Fox News Channel controversies). The Democratic Governors Association also criticised the donation and demanded more transparency in the reporting by News Corp companies. DGA head Nathan Daschle wrote to the chairman of News Corp company Fox News, Roger Ailes: [...] "In the interest of some fairness and balance, I request that you add a formal disclaimer to your coverage any time any of your programs <b>covers</b> <b>governors</b> or gubernatorial races between now and election day." ...|$|R
50|$|She did {{not join}} The Times-Picayune, her last employer, until 1979. She {{continued}} with Figaro, by then a separate magazine, in which she revealed {{the story of the}} feuding sons of the late political boss Leander Perez and the breakup of their political empire and oil lands in nearby Plaquemines Parish. She covered David Duke, the former figure in the Ku Klux Klan who served briefly in the state legislature and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate and for governor. Other Kelso topics included female politicians, the environment, abortion, teenage pregnancy, and the nationally known Neshoba County Fair in her native Neshoba County, where Ronald W. Reagan in 1980 launched his general election campaign. She listed Eleanor Roosevelt as her single most interesting interviewee and Edwin Edwards as the most interesting of the six <b>governors</b> that she <b>covered,</b> but she determined that her readers especially enjoyed her columns on her own family.|$|R
40|$|The {{governor}} collections at the Colorado State Archives are a {{rich source}} for research and information about social science {{and the history of}} the state, but they are not always easy to research due to their differences in taxonomy through different eras. In my work with creating an archival research handbook for a governor collection I chose governor Ralph Carr to both illustrate the challenges as well as the thrills with historical research in a collection from the office of the governor. Ralph Carr's collection takes patience to research. Some series will have inconsistent taxonomy and other series lack sub-series, and if a researcher is not familiar with the terminology of state affairs, many documents can pose a challenge. It is my hope that this handbook will be of use for both amateur researchers as well as provide a few short-cuts for more seasoned scholars. <b>Governor</b> Carr's collection <b>covers</b> some of the most dramatic years in Colorado history, the first part of WWII, and it is frequently requested for research, but many researchers get stuck between the vast amount of documents only sorted by dates, for instance in the series marked "Council of Defense", which contains many interesting documents about the Japanese-Americans who were to be deported to the Granada Relocation camp, or Camp Amache, as it was popularly called. It is my hope that the guide will not only provide such researchers some relief, but also to get the reader a sense for Colorado History, The Colorado State Archives and for the Governor collections in general...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study, is to explore whether or not prison {{sentences}} of less than a year, are appropriate, when judged from an individual preventive angle. This will be discovered through processing the interviews of a criminologist, a district prosecutor and a prison <b>governor.</b> Their expertise <b>covers</b> the areas of criminals, institution and crime prevention. Our data is drawn from parts of the theory about denial of freedom by Michel Foucault, who explores prison as an institution; the theory about prisonization by Donald Clemmer, who explored the process of socialization, that occurs when an individual goes to prison, and becomes {{a part of the}} prison sub culture; also the theory of moral sociology by Èmile Durkheim, who defines what we call a society, the basis of moral action and how these two interact. The result showed that prison sentences of less than a year are not appropriate, when judged from an individual preventive angel. Though judged from a general preventive angle, it can be seen as appropriate.  Studien syftar till att undersöka om fängelse som påföljd, gällande straff kortare än ett år, är ändamålsenligt utifrån ett individualpreventivt perspektiv. Detta uppnås genom tre kvalitativa intervjuer med en kriminolog, en kammaråklagare och en anstaltschef som utifrån deras olika yrkesroller bidrar med expertis inom det valda området. Empirin tolkas sedan utifrån delar av teorin om den frihetsberövande sanktionen av Michel Foucault som tittar närmare på fängelset som institution; teorin om prisonisering av Donald Clemmer, som tar fakta på den socialiseringsprocess som sker med individen när denne hamnat i fängelse och anammat en del av fängelsets subkultur, samt utifrån moralsociologin av Émile Durkheim som beskriver vad som utmärker ett samhälle, vad som är grunderna för ett moraliskt handlande och hur dessa två samspelar med varandra. Resultatet visade att fängelsestraff kortare än ett år ur ett individualpreventivt perspektiv inte är ändamålsenligt. Däremot kan det ur ett allmänpreventivt syfte verka avskräckande för samhällets övriga medborgare. ...|$|R
