5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the <b>excess</b> <b>energy</b> as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E

We first characterized the temporaland spatial properties of THz pulses generated from a large-aperture photoconductive antena, and then used them {{for the study of the}} ultrafastdynamics of electrons in semiconductros. We studied the dynamics of electrons generated by femtosecond optical pulses with positive andnegative <b>excess</b> <b>energies</b> in GaAs and InP by observing the waveform of the emitted THz radiation.

5|$|The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes {{different}} factions {{within the}} state to collaborate on mitigation projects. This policy takes a more of a community-based approach by adding several groups {{for the purpose of}} multiple perspectives and inventive approaches. The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits for both parties.

5|$|In modern times, Earth's {{perihelion}} occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates {{change over}} time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun {{at about the same}} time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the <b>excess</b> <b>energy</b> is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.|$|E

Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as fat. Researchers studied 16 men over a 14-day period and fed them 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and carbohydrates. They discovered that carbohydrate overfeeding produced 75–85% <b>excess</b> <b>energy</b> being stored as body fat and fat overfeeding produced 90–95% storage of <b>excess</b> <b>energy</b> as body fat.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{thermodynamic}} properties of liquid (Au–Sb–Sn) alloys were studied with an electromotive force (EMF) method using the eutectic mixture of KCl/LiCl with addition of SnCl 2 as a liquid electrolyte. Activities of Sn in the liquid alloys were measured at three cross-sections with constant molar ratios of Au:Sb= 2 : 1, 1 : 1, and 1 : 2 with tin in the concentration range between 5 at. % and 90 at. % from the liquidus {{of the samples}} up to 1073 K.

40|$|The {{analysing}} power {{measurements for}} the ~pp → ppη reaction studied in this dissertation {{are used in}} the determination of the reaction mechanism of the η meson production in nucleon-nucleon collisions. Measurements have been performed in the close-to-threshold energy region at beam momenta of pbeam = 2. 010 and 2. 085 GeV/c, corresponding to the <b>excess</b> <b>energies</b> of Q = 10 and 36 MeV, respectively. The experiments were realised by means of a cooler synchrotron and storage ring COSY along with a cluster jet target. For registration of the reaction products the COSY- 11 facility has been used.
