[...] Then <b>Ed</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Thank you buddies and sweethearts. Good old Buster Brown shoes are on the air out here in Hollywood for another good old Saturday hullabaloo." [...] Produced on a small budget, the show was a success, bringing to life the Buster Brown advertising characters that had existed for decades and helping to sell millions of shoes. The show was initially filmed in front of a live audience, but as McConnell's health deteriorated, prefilmed children's reaction shots were intercut with the studio performance.|$|E

If the government wants to target me, it should do so directly. My family and I are quite prepared to face the ‘malicious onslaught’ launched by government.” On December 16, the ED seized Chidamabaram's laptop and files.

On 27 September 2013, the Daily Mail published an article disputing Ralph Milibands patriotism with the headline [...] "The man who hated Britain". Three days later after negotiations the paper published a response by Ed Miliband describing his fathers life, and saying the Daily Mails article was character assassination. At {{the same time as}} publishing this response, the newspaper reiterated its assertion and published an editorial refusing to apologise. The Labour leaders office responded that Miliband [...] "wanted the Daily Mail to treat his late fathers reputation fairly. Rather than acknowledge it has smeared his father, the newspaper has repeated its original claim. This simply diminishes the Daily Mail further. It will be for people to judge whether this newspapers treatment of a war veteran, Jewish refugee from the Nazis and distinguished academic reflects the values and decency we should all expect in our political debate." [...] Ed Milibands response gained support from across the political spectrum, and was endorsed by the Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron. When it was found that a Mail on Sunday reporter had intruded on the private funeral of Ed Milibands uncle, the newspaper groups proprietor Lord Rothermere and the Sunday papers editor apologised for this.|$|E

40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Comunicação e Expressão. Programa de Pós-Graduação em Letras/Inglês e Literatura Correspondente. The goal of {{this study}} is to perform a {{comparative}} analysis of several theoretical models and corresponding interpretations of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness in order to arrive at a position with respect to the conflicting aspects of these theoretical models and interpretations within a broader rereading of Heart of Darkness. As demonstrated in an extensive selection of critical texts, literary criticism today remains contentiously divided, and Heart of Darkness is frequently cited and interpreted as evidence in the debates concerning the nature and limits of criticism (Gandhi, 1998; Jameson, 1981; Kimbrough, ed. 1988; Murfin, <b>ed.,</b> 1989; <b>Said,</b> 1993). This study engages the problematic split between those theoretical models and interpretations that focus on the fragmented nature of language and those others that stress the relationship between texts and non-textual, historical reality. Through its comparative analysis, this study argues that the explicit terms of the polemic split between history and language are problematic because of how they deny the shared tendencies of these two approaches. Finally, this study's reading of Heart of Darkness emphasizes the inseparability of these two critical approaches, even though some irreconcilable aspects exist in both...|$|R

40|$|Good Question? I am a 48 {{year old}} woman with two {{children}} ages 5 and 10 (I {{waited a long time}} to put together a family). Why is this information relevant? Because I currently work part-time and I treasure the balance that part time employment brings my family and me. And as a special education teacher with a demanding caseload, I value the balance it brings to my job. I have more energy and enthusiasm for both hats I wear. Now that I’ve got that out of my system, how did I get into teaching? After 15 (+) years in the mental health system, I found myself drifting more into administration and further away from kids and families. Working in some capacity in the schools was increasingly attractive to me because I strongly felt that schools (apart from family) have the greatest ability to impact children. My previous experience working with troubled adolescents and their families, led me to wanting to work with younger children. In addition, I truly loved working with those children with emotional and behavioral disabilities (<b>ED</b> teachers are <b>said</b> to be a little ED themselves). I found my niche as an ED (Emotional Disturbance) teacher at the elementary school level. With the move to cross-categorical programming and changes in criteria, I’m still finding my niche at Lincoln Elementary School. We have structured our special education program, so those of u...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{transfer}} of responsibility for patient care across clinical specialties is a complex process. Published and anecdotal data suggest that referrals often fail {{to meet the needs}} of one or both parties and that patient focus can be lost during the process. Little is known about the Australian situation. Methods: To obtain a more complete understanding of the referral process, including the nature of communication in an Australian context, we conducted semistructured interviews in a convenience sample of 25 volunteers. Two established strategies for analyzing qualitative data were used. Results: All respondents considered the following information essential components of a referral: an account of the patient’s current condition, a working diagnosis or problem statement and history of the presenting concern, key test results or tests awaiting results, a potential management plan, and any special characteristics of the patient. Respondents acknowledged implied, if not literal, power to accept or reject an emergency department (<b>ED)</b> referral and <b>said</b> the imbalance of power was reinforced when the ED physician was junior to the inpatient clinician. Respondents also noted that in addition to the predominant organizational culture, an independent culture is associated with specific shifts. Foremost among the nonclinical aspects of a referral considered to be important was the timeliness of the contact made to achieve the transition. Respondents also said the success of a referral depended on the speaking and listening abilities of all parties. The individual’s motivation to accept or reject a referral can also have an impact on communication...|$|R
