40|$|Semiconductor devices {{based on}} the {{thyristor}} structure (GTOs, IGCTs, etc.) or power diodes exhibit high values of the parameter I 2 t. This enables them to be protected by the so called semiconductor fuses. However, in the dc feeding lene of the inverter, the short-circuit waveforms are strongly different from a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave,</b> {{and the best way}} to find the proper fuse is to employ appropriate computer software...|$|E
40|$|The firing {{characteristics}} of insensitive electroexplosive devices to certain impulsive waveforms have been investigated. For these waveforms, energy is {{delivered in a}} time short compared to the thermal time constant and therefore cooling plays a negligible role. One waveform is a terminated capacitor discharge wherein the regular discharge of a capacitor is terminated at a preset point. Another is a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> pulse. The theory, design, and application of both impulsive waveform generators are presented together with certain limited experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with non-linear coupling of in-plane rigid-body and flexural motion in capacitive MEMS ring sensors due to shock excitation. A Lagrangian approach is used to derive the equations of motion for the system, including non-linear electrostatic forces. The shock acceleration is modelled as a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> input and acts on the rigid-body motion only. The mechanism of modal coupling is derived theoretically, and numerical simulations are performed to quantify the coupling. Different electrode configurations are considered by including electrostatic plates {{both inside and outside}} the ring, and insights into modal coupling are gained...|$|E
50|$|When {{the target}} disappears the {{photocell}} triggers a switch that inverts {{the output of}} the original signal. For instance, when the disk reaches the 3 o'clock position and the target disappears, the cell triggers the switch. This is the same instant that the original AC waveform begins the negative voltage portion of its waveform, so the switch inverts this back to positive. When the disk reaches the 9 o'clock position the cell switches again, no longer inverting the signal, which is now entering its positive phase again. The resulting output from this cell is a series of <b>half-sine</b> <b>waves,</b> always positive. This signal is then smoothed out to produce a DC output, in this case positive, which is sent to the control system and commands the missile to turn up.|$|R
40|$|The power {{switching}} devices IGCT exhibit high {{values of the}} parameter I 2 t. This property enables their short-circuit protection by the so called semiconductor fuses. For both the thyristors and the rapid semiconductor fuses, the parameter I 2 t is usually defined for a <b>half-sine</b> current <b>wave</b> with the duration of 10 ms. However, in the dc feeding line of an inverter, the short-circuit waveforms are strongly different, {{and the best way}} to find the proper fuse for protection is to employ appropriate computer software...|$|R
50|$|Vibrating tables or shake {{tables are}} {{sometimes}} {{used to test}} products to determine or demonstrate their ability to withstand vibration. Testing of this type is commonly done in the automotive, aerospace, and defense industries. These machines are capable of producing three different types of vibration profile sine sweep, random vibration, and synthesized shock. In {{all three of these}} applications, the part under test will typically be instrumented with one or more accelerometers to measure component response to the vibration input. A sine sweep vibration profile typically starts vibrating at low frequency and increases in frequency at a set rate (measured in hertz per second or hertz per minute). The vibratory amplitude as measured in gs may increase or decrease as well. A sine sweep will find resonant frequencies in the part. A random vibration profile will excite different frequencies along a spectrum at different times. Significant calculation goes into making sure that all frequencies get excited to within an acceptable tolerance band. A random vibration test suite may range anywhere from 30 seconds up to several hours. It is intended to synthesize the effect of, for example, a car driving over rough terrain or a rocket taking off. A synthesized shock pulse is a short duration high level vibration calculated as a sum of many <b>half-sine</b> <b>waves</b> covering a range of frequencies. It is intended to simulate the effects of an impact or explosion. A shock pulse test typically lasts less than a second. Vibrating tables can also be used in the packaging process in material handling industries to shake or settle a container so it can hold more product.|$|R

Electric analog techniques are used, with a series inductance, capacitance, and resistance circuit forming a direct analog to the mechanical structure. The circuit arrangement permits a determination of system response for a sequence of periods at constant damping. Provision is made for obtaining zero damping in the circuit. An arbitrary function generator of the variable width film photoelectric cell type is described. The results obtained with the function generator- spectrum analyzer system for a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> pulse are compared with the mathematically obtained exact answers for the zero damping case, and {{the accuracy of the}} system is shown to be satisfactory...|$|E
30|$|At first, the {{critical}} load which initiates helical buckling in vertical wellbores is approximately {{considered to be}} 0 (F = 0) for a tubular string with rather small bending stiffness, such as tubing. As a result, the down-hole tubular string deflection {{is divided into two}} parts with the neutral point (F = 0) as the dividing point: the initial straight configuration above the dividing point and a full helix depicted by Eq. (10) below the dividing point. Later, it was realized that it is too conservative to take the neutral point as {{the critical}} helical buckling force for the drill string. Wu (1992) improved the calculation method for the critical force between the three-dimensional sinusoidal buckling and helical buckling in vertical wellbores with the energy method shown in Table  1. In Wu’s analysis, the tubular string buckles into a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> under the critical sinusoidal buckling condition and into a pitch of helix under the critical helical buckling condition.|$|E
40|$|This {{technical}} note presents the exact {{solutions for the}} vibration frequencies of rectangular membranes placed in a vertical plane. The membranes are fixed on the top edge and side edges. The bottom edge may be either free and carrying a uniformly distributed mass, or fixed. It is found that {{the width of the}} membrane b and lateral tension ratio c appears in the exact solution in a combined form ξ = b/√(c). This important similarity parameter implies that a larger width has the same frequencies as lowered lateral tension, therefore, this parameter greatly reduces the number of tables. For the vibrating vertical membranes, we find that when ξ increases generally, the frequencies decrease. For small ξ (small width or large lateral tension ratio), the horizontal modes are all n = 1, or a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> in the horizontal direction. For large &xi, the horizontal modes increase with each increased frequency. The fundamental frequencies always correspond to n = 1...|$|E
40|$|In an {{airborne}} electromagnetic system, which transmits time-domain <b>half-sine</b> current <b>waves</b> {{generated by}} a resonance circuit, the inductance of the transmitting loop is of great significance and directly related to parameters of the half-sine current waveform. However, in general, {{the effect of a}} finite-conducting ground on the inductance of the transmitting loop was neglected, or the ground was handled as a perfect conductor. In other words, there was no accurate method to evaluate ground’s effect on the inductance of the transmitting loop. Therefore, a new and convenient algorithm, calculating ground’s effect on the inductance of a rectangular loop, is proposed in this paper. An experiment was constructed afield, showing that the inductance increased gradually when the loop was lifted up from 0 [*]m to 30 [*]m, which supported the algorithm positively...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{model of}} a building supported by a rectangular, flexible foundation embedded in nonlinear soil is analyzed. The model is excited by a <b>half-sine</b> SH <b>wave</b> pulse, which travels towards the foundation. The {{results show that the}} spatial distribution of permanent, nonlinear strain in the soil depends upon the incident angle, the amplitude, and the duration of the pulse. If the wave has large amplitude and short duration, the nonlinear zone in the soil appears immediately or after the reflection from the half-space, in which case it is located close to the free surface. This results from interference of the reflected pulse from the free surface and the incoming part of the pulse that still has not reached the free surface. The work spent for the development of nonlinear strains in the soil can consume {{a significant part of the}} input wave energy, and thus less energy is available for excitation of the building. Key words: soil-structure interaction: nonlinear waves in the soil; distribution of wave energy...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} (2 -D) {{model of}} a building supported by a semi-circular flexible foundation embedded in nonlinear soil is analyzed. The building, the foundation, and the soil have different physical properties. The model is excited by a <b>half-sine</b> SH <b>wave</b> pulse, which travels toward the foundation. The {{results show that the}} spatial distribution of permanent, nonlinear strain in the soil depends upon the incident angle, the amplitude, and the duration of the pulse. If the wave has a large amplitude and a short duration, a nonlinear zone in the soil appears immediately after the reflection from the half-space and is located close to the free surface. This results from interference of the reflected pulse from the free surface and the incoming part of the pulse that still has not reached the free surface. When the wave reaches the foundation, it is divided on two parts—the first part is reflected, and the second part enters the foundation. Further, there is separation of this second part at the foundation-building contact. One part is reflected back, and one part enters the building. After each contact of the part of the wave that enters the building with the foundation-building contact, one part of the wave energy is released back into the soil. This process continues until all of the energy in the building is released back into the soil. The work needed for the development of nonlinear strains spends part of the input wave energy, and thus a smaller amount of energy is available for exciting the building...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} cutting a {{roll-formed}} steel section to specified length {{may lead to}} cross section distortion and may cause initial geometric imperfection. Two roll-formed steel lipped C-sections of grade G 450 were cut to stub columns using an electric saw. Cross section distortions of cut segments and stub columns were measured using a vernier caliper. Initial geometric imperfections of the cut stub columns along the longitudinal direction were estimated using a laser transducer. When a roll-formed steel lipped C-section is cut into two segments, there will be cross section distortions {{in the vicinity of}} the cut. For a cut stub column, variation of imperfection along the longitudinal direction at the flanges can be represented by a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave.</b> The initial geometric imperfection of a cut stub column attains maximum values at the flanges, and is insignificant at the corners where the web and the flanges intersect.

40|$|Computations were {{performed}} {{to determine the effect}} of an overall bow-type imperfection on the reliability of structural panels under combined compression and shear loadings. A panel's reliability is the probability that it will perform the intended function - in this case, carry a given load without buckling or exceeding in-plane strain allowables. For a panel loaded in compression, a small initial bow can cause large bending stresses that reduce both the buckling load and the load at which strain allowables are exceeded; hence, the bow reduces the reliability of the panel. In this report, analytical studies on two stiffened panels quantified that effect. The bow is {{in the shape of a}} <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> along the length of the panel. The size e of the bow at panel midlength is taken to be the single random variable. Several probability density distributions for e are examined to determine the sensitivity of the reliability to details of the bow statistics. In addition, the effects of quality control are explored with truncated distributions...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{and solid}} rocket motor {{propulsion}} systems create an overpressure wave during ignition, {{caused by the}} accelerating gas particles pushing against or displacing the air contained in the launch pad or launch facility and by the afterburning of the fuel-rich gases. This wave behaves as a blast or shock wave characterized by a positive triangular-shaped first pulse and a negative <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> second pulse. The pulse travels up the space vehicle and {{has the potential of}} either overloading individual elements or exciting overall vehicle dynamics. The latter effect results from the phasing difference of the wave {{from one side of the}} vehicle to the other. This overpressure phasing, or delta P environment, because of its frequency content as well as amplitude, becomes a design driver for certain panels (e. g., thermal shields) and payloads for the Space Shuttle. The history of overpressure effects on the Space Shuttle, the basic overpressure phenomenon, Space Shuttle overpressure environment, scale model overpressure testing, and techniques for suppressing the overpressure environments are considered...|$|E

40|$|When {{vehicles}} are driven on consecutive speed control humps, {{the parameters of}} speed control humps such as height, width, and space and vehicle’s speed are the important factors to affect safety and comfort of passengers. The paper assumes that the excitation function of the consecutive speed control humps is a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> and a SCHs-speed coupling excitation model called 7 -DOF nonlinear full-vehicle model and differential equation are established by introducing the time delay of incentive input and then by using numerical simulation to analyze chaotic vibration in 7 -DOF nonlinear full-vehicle model excited by consecutive speed control humps. The numerical simulation results show that chaotic vibration phenomenon possibly appears as {{vehicles are}} driven on consecutive speed control humps. Further studies indicate that the influence of nonlinear running state of vehicle on driving comfort becomes manifest as the state changes from chaotic motions to the periodic motion of the high speed and the periodic motion of the low speed, and this phenomenon can be avoided by changing the parameters of consecutive speed control humps. The results can be applied in design of vehicle and road humps pavement...|$|E
40|$|Feasibility of rock dynamic {{properties}} by split-Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) was experimentally and numerically evaluated with ANSYS/LS-DYNA. The effects of different diameters, different loading rates, and different propagation distances on wave dispersion of input bars in SHPB with rectangle and <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> loadings were analyzed. The {{results show that}} the dispersion effect on the diameter of input bar, loading rate, and propagation distance under half-sine waveform loading is ignorable compared with the rectangle wave loading. Moreover, the degrees of stress uniformity under rectangle and half-sine input wave loadings are compared in SHPB tests, and the time required for stress uniformity is calculated under different above-mentioned loadings. It is confirmed that the stress uniformity can be realized more easily using the half-sine pulse loading compared to the rectangle pulse loading, and this has significant advantages in the dynamic test of rock-like materials. Finally, the Holmquist-Johnson-Concrete constitutive model is introduced to simulate the failure mechanism and failure and fragmentation characteristics of rock under different strain rates. And the numerical results agree with that obtained from the experiment, which confirms the effectiveness of the model and the method...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} model was constructed {{to predict the}} magnitude of stresses produced by rubbing a turbine blade against its tip seal. This model used a linearized approach to the problem, after a parametric study, found that the nonlinear effects were of insignificant magnitude. The important input parameters to the model were: the arc through which rubbing occurs, the turbine rotor speed, normal force exerted on the blade, and the rubbing coefficient of friction. Since {{it is not possible}} to exactly specify some of these parameters, values were entered into the model which bracket likely values. The form of the forcing function was another variable which was impossible to specify precisely, but the assumption of a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> with a period equal to the duration of the rub was taken as a realistic assumption. The {{analytical model}} predicted resonances between harmonics of the forcing function decomposition and known harmonics of the blade. Thus, it seemed probable that blade tip rubbing could be at least a contributor to the blade-cracking phenomenon. A full-scale, full-speed test conducted on the space shuttle main engine high pressure fuel turbopump Whirligig tester was conducted at speeds between 33, 000 and 28, 000 RPM to confirm analytical predictions...|$|E
40|$|A {{semiconductor}} {{solid state}} switch has been constructed and tested in the prototype extraction kicker pulse generator of CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1]. The switch is made of 10 modified 4. 5 kV, 66 mm symmetric GTO's (also called FHCT-Fast High Current Thyristor), connected in series. It holds off a d. c. voltage of 30 kV and conducts a 5 µs <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> current of 20 kA with an initial di/dt of 10 kA/µs. Major advantages of the switch are the extremely low self-firing hazard, no power consumption during the ready-to-go status, instantaneous availability, simple condition control, very low noise emission during soft turn-on switching and easy maintenance. However, the inherent soft, relatively slow turn-on time is a non negligible part of the required rise time and this involves adaptation of generator components. A dynamic current range of 16 is achieved with variations in rise time, which stay within acceptable limits. Important generator improvements have been made with the series diodes and freewheel diodes. A more efficient droop compensation circuit is being studied. It is directly connected in series with the freewheel diode stack and maintains an acceptable flattop variation of 5 % of the magnet current during 90 µs. This paper presents the complete generator, in particular the {{solid state switch}} and discusses related electrical measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{behavior of}} steel tied-arch bridges {{is determined by}} the presence of a large compressive force. As a consequence, slender steel arches are highly sensitive to in-plane as well as out-of-plane buckling. At present, no specific buckling curves for out-of-plane buckling exist for nonlinear or curved elements in the international codes and calculation methods. This research is mainly concerned with quantifying the geometric imperfections of real arch bridges {{based on the results of}} on-site strain measurements. The arches of six bridges have been equipped with strain gauges along their entire length. For the actual determination of the imperfections, a detailed finite-element model has been developed. It is assumed that the actual geometric imperfections are a linear combination of a number of theoretical imperfections. These imperfections are characterized by a theoretical lateral displacement in a single cross section of the arch. The influence of these theoretical imperfections can be calculated using the described finite-element models. The actual imperfections are determined based on the comparison of measured strain values with the strain values based on a linear combination of theoretical imperfections. This method is verified using the results of topographical measurements of one of the studied bridges. Both sets of results are in agreement when it comes to size and shape of the imperfections. The shape of the resulting geometric imperfection is a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> for most of the studied bridges. However, the most important result is that for all considered bridges, the size of the imperfections is substantially smaller than the one predicted by design codes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Transcranial {{magnetic}} stimulation (TMS) commonly uses so-called monophasic pulses {{where the}} initial rapidly changing current flow {{is followed by}} a critically dampened return current. It has been shown that a monophasic TMS pulse preferentially excites different cortical circuits in the human motor hand area (M 1 -HAND), if the induced tissue current has a posterior-to-anterior (PA) or anterior-to-posterior (AP) direction. Here we tested whether similar direction-specific effects could be elicited in M 1 -HAND using TMS pulses with a <b>half-sine</b> <b>wave</b> configuration. Results In 10 young participants, we applied half-sine pulses to the right M 1 -HAND which elicited PA or AP currents with respect to the orientation of the central sulcus. Measurements of the motor evoked potential (MEP) revealed that PA half-sine stimulation resulted in lower resting motor threshold (RMT) than AP stimulation. When stimulus intensity (SI) was gradually increased as percentage of maximal stimulator output, the stimulus–response curve (SRC) of MEP amplitude showed a leftward shift for PA as opposed to AP half-sine stimulation. Further, MEP latencies were approximately 1 ms shorter for PA relative to AP half-sine stimulation across the entire SI range tested. When adjusting SI to the respective RMT of PA and AP stimulation, the direction-specific differences in MEP latencies persisted, while the gain function of MEP amplitudes was comparable for PA and AP stimulation. Conclusions Using half-sine pulse configuration, single-pulse TMS elicits consistent direction-specific effects in M 1 -HAND that are similar to TMS with monophasic pulses. The longer MEP latency for AP half-sine stimulation suggests that PA and AP half-sine stimulation preferentially activates different sets of cortical neurons that are involved in the generation of different corticospinal descending volleys. </p...|$|E
