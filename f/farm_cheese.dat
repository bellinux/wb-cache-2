50|$|The {{village is}} an {{economic}} and business center to the surrounding villages, and the main street {{is part of the}} route from Belgrade to Sarajevo.

This is not the only opportunity to shop in Lešnica. There are butcheries, grocery shops, fishmongers, bakeries, and many other shops. The bakeries of the village (of which there are many) have a reputation for their excellent pastries, probably a result of the competition between them.|$|E
50|$|Queso Palmita is a soft, salty, fresh white <b>farm</b> <b>cheese.</b> The Palmita {{cheese is}} usually made in large {{circular}} containers 6 {{feet in diameter}} and four feet in height. Each Palmita Cheese batch can vary in taste depending on the ingredients which are mixed slowly for 2 to 3 days until the cheese has settled. Then the containers are set for an additional 10 days until coagulation. For the best taste, {{it is imperative that}} the cheese reaches an optimum level of saltiness. It is packaged into pressed wooden crates of 30 kilos each and set for distribution. Once the cheese is packaged, it must be sold within two to three days due to the sweating (loss of liquid) of the cheese from the boxes. Queso Palmita is originally from the Zulia State in northwestern Venezuela, which is the main source of dairy products in the country.|$|E

40|$|Specific tracing parameters, {{also useful}} as quality indicators, have been {{utilized}} to evaluate if quality changes occur, due to <b>farm,</b> <b>cheese</b> production, and environmental variables, in milk and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana PDO samples {{of commercial and}} experimental origin.

40|$|Istrian {{cheese is}} the {{traditional}} hard cheese produced exclusively from the raw milk of the autochthonous Istrian sheep. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the bacteriological quality, physicochemical properties of the sheep milk and Istrian cheese as well as proteolysis of cheese produced on six family farms during the cheese ripening. The hygienic microbial indicators of the sheep milk were poor in comparison to the other East Adriatic regions. However, the number of bacterial indicators rapidly declined during the ripening and they were under the detection limit for “ready to consume” cheese and therefore indicated their good bacteriological quality. Regression function of the effects of the ripening time on physicochemical properties of Istrian cheese during ripening showed a substantial increase in total solids, in salt, in moisture and in salt content as well as in the lactic acid in the total solids. However, these changes were not significant due to the high variability of the Istrian cheese production. The <b>farm</b> <b>cheese</b> making procedure affected the electrophoretic profile of the primary proteolysis in the cheese samples. Significant (P 5 %). Equal degradation of as 1 -casein and ß-casein during ripening of Istrian cheese occurred. A low percentage of nitrogen fractions soluble in water and in 12 % trichloroacetic acid were determined...|$|E
40|$|Serra da Estrela {{cheese is}} the most famous variety of <b>farm</b> <b>cheese</b> {{manufactured}} in Portugal. Its manufacture is artisanal, from raw ewe's milk of a native breed (Bordaleira da Serra da Estrela), which is coagulated using an aqueous extract of the wild thistle (Cynara cardunculus), without deliberate addition of any starter culture [1 - 2]. The study of microstructure in specialty cheeses is relevant to sensory features and to fundamental explanation of the changes observed throughout cheese ripening [3]. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the physical, chemical and sensorial characteristics of Serra da Estrela cheese produced with different thistle ecotypes. In this study 29 samples of Serra da Estrela cheese produced with 6 different thistle ecotypes in various dairies in the area demarcated for the production of Serra da Estrela cheese were analysed. The chemical properties assessed were moisture content, pH, chloride, ash and proteins; the physical properties evaluated were colour and texture; and finally a sensory evaluation was undertaken. The results obtained showed values for moisture between 34. 9 % and 49. 8 %, for ashes varying from 3. 4 % to 5. 5 %, and for proteins varying from 21. 9 % to 13. 0 %. The chlorides ranged between 1. 1 % and 3. 0 % and pH between 4. 8 and 5. 7. It was further observed that for longer ripening, and therefore lower humidity, the samples exhibited higher firmness and lower stickiness and adhesiveness. The values of hardness of the skin and flesh varied in the ranges 1. 56 - 9. 40 N and 0. 4 - 3. 4 N, respectively. The stickiness was quite high (- 26. 29 to - 2. 21 N. sec), which reflects the creamy character of these soft paste cheeses. The colour coordinates were evaluated on the skin and the values obtained were 53. 57 to 64. 34 for L*, - 4. 53 to 1. 29 for a* and 15. 56 to 29. 03 for b*, showing a clear yellowish colour. The results of the sensory analysis did not show a noticeable variability between the different ecotypes, and it was further observed that, in general, the instrumental analyses eventually confirm the perception of panellists...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a rapid and simple NMR method to {{discriminate}} Asiago d’Allevo cheese samples from different production chains is described.

PCA of both 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra showed a good separation of alpine farm products from the other ones, whereas the lowland and mountain industrialized cheeses are undistinguishable.
