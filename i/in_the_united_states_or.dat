5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>or</b> other {{countries}} where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively {{small portion of the}} pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.|$|E

A twenty-episode series called Lemur Kingdom (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States)</b> <b>or</b> Lemur Street (in the United Kingdom and Canada) aired in 2008 on Animal Planet.

5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to grow on horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to grow on relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>or</b> autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E

Following an international contest for the city's design, a blueprint by American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin {{was selected}} and construction commenced in 1913.

5|$|There are no {{official}} counts or {{estimates of the}} number of active taiko groups <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>or</b> Canada, as there is no governing body for taiko groups in either country.

One estimate suggested that around 120 groups were active in the US and Canada as of 2001, many of which could be traced to the San Francisco Taiko Dojo; later estimates in 2005 and 2006 suggested there were about 200 groups in the United States alone.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} {{negotiations}} in the U.S. embassy, Chen did not request asylum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>or</b> considered leaving China, but instead demanded to remain {{there as a}} free man.

While in the hospital, Chinese security personnel barred U.S. diplomatic staff from meeting with him. Rumors emerged that Chinese officials had coerced Chen into leaving the embassy by threatening his family. U.S. negotiators stated that while in the embassy, Chen {{had been told by}} Chinese officials that if he sought asylum in the United States, his wife and daughter would likely remain under house arrest in Shandong. However, they maintained that they had not heard of the threats from local officials that his family would be beaten, and that they had not communicated such a message to Chen. On 3 May, Chen clarified to the BBC that he had become aware of the threats against his family after leaving the embassy, and at that point changed his mind about wishing to stay in China.|$|E
