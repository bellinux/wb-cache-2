50|$|The Friends of Distinction {{formed in}} 1968 in Los Angeles with {{original}} members Floyd Butler (June 5, 1937 - April 29, 1990), Harry Elston (born November 4, 1938), Jessica Cleaves (December 10, 1948 - May 2, 2014), and Barbara Jean Love (born July 24, 1941). Butler and Elston had worked together in The <b>Hi-Fi's</b> {{in the mid}} 1960s, often opening for Ray Charles.

5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some <b>hi-fi</b> aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy a larger number of consumers. Home subwoofers grew in popularity, as they were easy to add to existing multimedia speaker setups and they were easy to position or hide.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Tim Gane formed McCarthy, a {{band from}} Essex, England {{known for their}} left-wing politics. Gane met the French-born Lætitia Sadier at a McCarthy concert in Paris and the two quickly fell in love. The musically-inclined Sadier was disillusioned with the rock scene in France and soon moved to London to be with Gane and pursue her career. In 1990, after three albums, McCarthy broke up and Gane {{immediately}} formed Stereolab with Sadier (who had also contributed vocals to McCarthy's final album) and ex-Chills bassist Martin Kean. The group's name was taken from a division of Vanguard Records demonstrating <b>hi-fi</b> effects.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the uptake of DAB has {{increased}} since {{the launch of}} the BBC national DAB ensemble in 1995. Lower prices, new radio stations and marketing have increased the uptake of DAB radio in the UK. Digital radios were first sold as car radios in 1997, priced around £800, with <b>hi-fi</b> tuners costing up to £2,000 being released two years later. In 2001, Digital One invested in Frontier Silicon to produce a new processing chip which would allow cheaper portable radios to be produced. Roberts Radio, Goodmans and in 2002, Pure Digital's award winning Evoke series of radios broke the £100 price barrier, and DAB take up {{has increased}} since.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway <b>Hi-Fi</b> invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Art of Losing" [...] is {{the first}} single from American <b>Hi-Fi's</b> second album The Art of Losing. It has {{appeared}} in the movies Freaky Friday and American Wedding and in one episode of Malcolm in the Middle. It was also used in trailers for the films The Perfect Score, Fever Pitch, Hot Rod, Mr. Woodcock, and Speed Racer. It was also featured in a Shane Dawson YouTube video entitled, [...] "Crazy Girlfriend From Hell." ...|$|R
5000|$|Freaky Friday: Original Soundtrack is {{the soundtrack}} album to the 2003 Disney {{film of the}} same name. The soundtrack {{features}} songs by various artists. The album was called a [...] "mixed bag" [...] by allmusic, which specifically cited American <b>Hi-Fi's</b> [...] "The Art of Losing," [...] The Donnas' [...] "Backstage", Andrew W.K.'s [...] "She Is Beautiful," [...] and Joey Ramone's [...] "What a Wonderful World" [...] as good, and strongly criticized {{the rest of the}} album.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, McDonald {{began working with}} the Los Angeles-based vocal group called the <b>Hi-Fi’s.</b> He {{replaced}} Rex Middleton as the Musical Director. They changed their name to The Vocals and began working with American soul singer Lonnie Sattin.The Vocals, changed their name to [...] "The 5th Dimension" [...] around 1964. Clarence lent his own special groove to classics like [...] "Up Up and Away". While touring, they were contacted to be the opening act for Ray Charles and traveled with Charles in 1964-65.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a {{reported}} US$80million, {{at the time}} the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, New Adventures in <b>Hi-Fi,</b> though critically acclaimed, fared worse commercially than its predecessors. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued the group as a trio. Through some changes in musical style, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the world's best-selling music artists of all time. In 2007, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their first year of eligibility. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, announcing the split on its website.|$|E
5|$|R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a {{reported}} $80million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated with the media), {{rumored to be}} the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in <b>Hi-Fi</b> debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of the previous five years. Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him {{by a member of the}} band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.|$|E
5|$|It {{had become}} {{apparent}} in around 1987 {{that a number}} of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, particular the woofer. Measurements of the 1–1.5kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in <b>Hi-fi</b> News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained.|$|E
50|$|The {{group members}} {{went through the}} Army at the same time, {{continuing}} to work together whenever possible, and {{it was during this}} period that they got their name. They initially started working together as the Beltones and the <b>Hi-Fi's,</b> but their manager, taking his lead from the manufacturer of the pencil he had in his hand at the time, decreed that they should become The Kestrels. It also fit in with an American tradition of harmony vocal groups that were named after birds (the Crows, the Penguins etc).|$|R

25|$|In 1951, at the {{beginning}} of the post-World War II high fidelity (<b>hi-fi)</b> popularity, the Audio Engineering Society (AES) developed a standard playback curve. This was intended for use by <b>hi-fi</b> amplifier manufacturers. If records were engineered to sound good on <b>hi-fi</b> amplifiers using the AES curve, this would be a worthy goal towards standardization. This curve was defined by the time constants of audio filters and had a bass turnover of 400Hz and a 10,000Hz rolloff of −12dB.|$|E

The band released a single in 1980 featuring [...] "I Don't Know Why (You Love Me)" [...] and on the B side [...] "Look What You've Done". The record was not a big commercial success, though, and when they couldn't get a record deal in Toronto, they headed off to New York. [...] A while after returning to Toronto from New York, Keelor and Cuddy formed Blue Rodeo.|$|R
