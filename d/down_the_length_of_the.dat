5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{exploration of the}} Tanana Valley and the Tanana River {{did not take place}} until 1885, but historians believe Russian traders from Nulato and Hudson's Bay Company traders ventured into the lower reaches of the Tanana and possibly the Chena River {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. In 1885, Henry Tureman Allen of the U.S. Army led the {{first recorded}} expedition <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tanana River, charting the Chena River's mouth along the way.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E

5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill. This technique involves inserting the bill {{into the ground and}} opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity â€“ this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beach, {{in order to keep the}} sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E

25|$|Also, {{the test}} tube {{confines}} motion to the direction <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube, so vB is opposite to u1 and the Coriolis force is opposite to u2, that is, {{against the wall}} of the tube.

For more details, see the articles on sedimentation and the Lamm equation.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in an era}} of relaxed garb and standards, Woollettt was colourful. He wore a leopardskin flying {{helmet and}} gauntlets when he flew. His {{aircraft}} was equally distinctive, with the propeller spinner painted as a Native American's face and a dragon trailing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage. He also briefly adorned his aircraft with white 'splotches' as experimental camouflage to aid his balloon busting, but his superiors made him remove them.|$|E
25|$|An endolymphatic duct {{runs from}} the saccule up through the head, and ending close to the brain. In {{cartilaginous}} fish, this duct actually opens onto {{the top of the}} head, and in some teleosts, it is simply blind-ending. In all other species, however, it ends in an endolymphatic sac. In many reptiles, fish, and amphibians this sac may reach considerable size. In amphibians the sacs from either side may fuse into a single structure, which often extends <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, parallel with the spinal canal.|$|E

25|$|It {{is known}} that changes in {{dendritic}} excitability affect action potential back propagation. Action potentials begin near the axon hillock and propagate <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> axon, but they also propagate backward through the soma into the dendritic arbor. Active back propagation is dependent on ion channels and changing the densities or properties of these channels can influence {{the degree to which}} the signal is attenuated. Plasticity of back-propagation in the dendrites occurs in less than one minute and lasts longer than 25 minutes. Back propagation is a method of signaling to the synapses that an action potential was fired. This is important for spike-timing-dependent plasticity.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Broncos kicker Jason Elam {{converted}} a 45-yard field goal to cut Green Bay's lead to 3 points. In the fourth quarter, after getting {{the ball back}} with 2:27 remaining in the game, Cutler led a drive that began on the Bronco seven-yard line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field to the Green Bay four-yard line. On a 3rd and 1 Cutler attempted a quarterback draw to win the game, but Ryan Pickett stopped Cutler for no gain on the play. With no time outs remaining Elam and the kicking unit ran onto the field and converted a field goal {{to tie the game}} on the final play of the quarter.|$|E
25|$|The Strait of Dover {{is thought}} to have been created around 200,000 years ago by a catastrophic GLOF caused by the {{breaching}} of the Weald-Artois Anticline, which acted as a natural dam that held back a large lake in the Doggerland region, now submerged under the North Sea. The flood would have lasted several months, releasing as much as one million cubic metres of water per second. The cause of the breach is not known but may have been caused by an earthquake or simply the build-up of water pressure in the lake. As well as destroying the isthmus that connected Britain to continental Europe, the flood carved a large bedrock-floored valley <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English Channel, leaving behind streamlined islands and longitudinal erosional grooves characteristic of catastrophic megaflood events.|$|E

50|$|In 2007, Green Bay Net {{which at}} the time claimed Internet service {{membership}} in the thousands, partnered with On Broadway inc to deploy a free wi-fi mesh network <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> Broadway. This system was operational until the end of 2010.|$|R
25|$|The oxide {{particles}} then agglomerate to form {{large particle}} chains, which subsequently deposit {{on the walls}} of the tube as soot. The deposition is due to the large difference in temperature between the gas core and the wall causing the gas to push the particles outwards (this is known as thermophoresis). The torch is then traversed up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tube to deposit the material evenly. After the torch has reached the end of the tube, it is then brought back to the beginning of the tube and the deposited particles are then melted to form a solid layer. This process is repeated until a sufficient amount of material has been deposited. For each layer the composition can be modified by varying the gas composition, resulting in precise control of the finished fiber's optical properties.|$|E
25|$|As {{with all}} arch-based constructions, {{there is an}} outward thrust {{generated}} against the walls underneath a barrel vault. There are several mechanisms for absorbing this thrust. One is, of course, to make the walls exceedingly thick and strong - this is a primitive and sometimes unacceptable method. A more elegant method is to build two or more vaults parallel to each other; the forces of their outward thrusts will thus negate each other. This method was most often used in construction of churches, where several vaulted naves ran parallel <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. However, the outer walls of the outermost vault {{would still have to}} be quite strong or reinforced by buttressing. The third and most elegant mechanism to resist the lateral thrust was to create an intersection of two barrel vaults at right angles, thus forming a groin vault.|$|E
25|$|The {{queen snake}} {{is similar in}} {{appearance}} to a garter snake, genus Thamnophis, so is often confused with that group. The queen snake is olive to gray or dark brown in overall coloration, with peach or yellow stripes that run down its length at the first scale row. There are also four prominent ventral stripes of a darker colour, and as no other similar species has stripes running {{down the length of}} its belly, this is an important feature in identifying this snake. In the young and juvenile snakes there are three extra stripes: one stripe that runs along the vertebral dorsal scales, and two stripes (one on each side) that run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body at scale rows five and six. These extra stripes tend to fade as the snake matures, but when young the snake will have a total of seven stripes, three on the back and four on the belly, which gives cause for its taxonomical reference name, Regina (queen) septemvittata (seven-striped). The belly of the snake is a cream to yellow colour.|$|E
25|$|Callichthyidae is {{a family}} of {{catfishes}} (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> their bodies. This family contains {{some of the most}} popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of Corydoras.|$|R
