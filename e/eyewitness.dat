50|$|Any Muslim {{witness who}} accuses a Muslim of zina, but fails to produce four adult, pious male <b>eyewitnesses,</b> commits {{the crime of}} false {{accusation}} (qadhf, القذف). Some contend that this sharia requirement of four <b>eyewitnesses</b> severely limits a man's ability to prove zina charges against women, a crime often committed without <b>eyewitnesses.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{usefulness}} of cognitive interviews {{depends upon the}} presence of <b>eyewitnesses</b> {{at the scene of}} a crime. If there are no <b>eyewitnesses</b> or bystanders present during a crime, the use in performing a cognitive interview becomes limited to non-existent. Cognitive interviews are most effective in situations such as robberies or batteries where <b>eyewitnesses</b> {{are more likely to be}} present.|$|R
40|$|It was my {{objective}} {{to understand}} whether accurate and inaccurate <b>eyewitnesses</b> could be distinguished by their decision-making during a sequential-lineup. All <b>eyewitnesses,</b> except in Study 6, were shown a video-taped crime and presented with sequential lineups. Study 1 {{was designed to}} identify the decision processes of <b>eyewitnesses.</b> While viewing a culprit-present lineup, witnesses were asked to “think aloud” and later describe in writing their thoughts as they reached a decision for each photograph; five decision process statements were then created or selected from previous research. In Study 2, the main dependent measure asked <b>eyewitnesses</b> to endorse all applicable decision process statements from Study 1. Factor analysis revealed a simple matching strategy containing three decision processes and a deliberative strategy with four decision processes. Accurate <b>eyewitnesses</b> {{were significantly associated with}} the simple matching strategy, and inaccurate <b>eyewitnesses</b> with the deliberative strategy. An automatic recognition statement was added to the decision proces...|$|R
5|$|Demonstrations {{began on}} the evening of 5 July with a protest in the Grand Bazaar, a {{prominent}} tourist site, and crowd reportedly gathering at the People's Square area. The demonstration began peacefully, and official and <b>eyewitness</b> accounts reported that it involved about 1,000 Uyghurs; the WUC said approximately 10,000 protesters took part.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} generated by Porteous's {{book and the}} 2011 television documentary, the FBI is standing by its position that Christiansen cannot be considered a prime suspect. It cites a poor match to <b>eyewitness</b> physical descriptions, a level of skydiving expertise above that predicted by their suspect profile, and an absence of direct incriminating evidence.|$|E
5|$|John's coup {{was written}} {{extensively}} about by contemporaries: the historian Niketas Choniates deals with it briefly and rather dismissively, but Nicholas Mesarites left a long <b>eyewitness</b> account of events, in which his own role is suitably emphasized. The scholars Nikephoros Chrysoberges and Euthymios Tornikes wrote speeches in celebration of the coup's failure.|$|E
40|$|<b>Eyewitnesses</b> {{are often}} asked in {{real-world}} cases whether {{their responses to}} a lineup were affected by various external influences, but their ability to answer these types of questions accurately is unknown. Two experiments used a new paradigm to examine <b>eyewitnesses</b> 2 ̆ 7 abilities to estimate the influence of lineup manipulations. <b>Eyewitnesses</b> were administered either confirming post-identification feedback or no post-identification feedback (Experiment 1, n = 103), or a cautionary pre-lineup instruction or no cautionary pre-lineup instruction (Experiment 2, n = 114). <b>Eyewitnesses</b> then gave actual responses (retrospective confidence, view, and attention measures in Experiment 1; identification decision in Experiment 2) as well as counterfactual responses stating how they would have responded in the alternative condition. Results across both studies showed an asymmetric estimation of influence pattern: <b>Eyewitnesses</b> who received an influencing manipulation estimated significantly less {{of a change in}} their responses than <b>eyewitnesses</b> who did not receive an influencing manipulation. In Experiment 1, <b>eyewitnesses</b> who received confirming feedback accurately estimated the influence of feedback whereas <b>eyewitnesses</b> who did not receive feedback overestimated the influence of feedback. In Experiment 2, <b>eyewitnesses</b> who received a cautionary pre-lineup instruction underestimated the 2 influence of the instruction whereas <b>eyewitnesses</b> who did not receive the cautionary instruction accurately estimated its influence. The observed asymmetric estimation of influence pattern is consistent with research on the hindsight bias as well as research on counterfactual thinking. Variations in the asymmetric estimation of influence pattern might be explained by the different implicit theories witnesses have about the influence of various lineup manipulations. A 48 -hr delay between actual and counterfactual responses was not shown to moderate any effects...|$|R
25|$|The defence {{pointed to}} various {{substantial}} discrepancies in The Crown's case. While some <b>eyewitnesses</b> testified they saw Ryan {{to the east}} of Hodson when a single shot was heard, other <b>eyewitnesses</b> testified Ryan was to the west of Hodson. The discrepancies in evidence were substantial and wide-ranging. Opas contended that each of the fourteen <b>eyewitnesses</b> evidence were so contradictory that little store could be placed on them.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how grammar and reference in journalistic narratives help {{to represent the}} viewpoints of <b>eyewitnesses</b> to shocking criminal acts. Grammatical roles of <b>eyewitnesses</b> and non-eyewitnesses and the expressions referring to them were analyzed in four journalistic narratives about different shocking events and compared to four non-narrative newsreports about the same events. Results show that in the narratives, {{but not in the}} newsreports, <b>eyewitnesses</b> appear more often in subject position of a clause than non-eyewitnesses. This indicates that in narratives, journalists choose <b>eyewitnesses</b> as the lens through which they narrate the events. Furthermore, <b>eyewitnesses</b> are more often referred to with pronouns than nouns, whereas non-eyewitnesses are more often referred to with nouns than pronouns. This indicates that <b>eyewitnesses</b> are cognitively highly accessible in news narratives and that their viewpoints are conceptually most proximate to the viewpoints of journalist and reader. It is argued that the strategic use of grammatical roles and referential expressions in journalistic crime narratives puts the reader in the position of a ‘‘mediated witness’’...|$|R
