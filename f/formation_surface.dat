As described by B.R.Bell and I.T.Williamson:At {{the base of}} the twin summits of Preshal More and Preshal Beg, near Talisker, the laterally-restricted Preshal Beg Conglomerate Formation crops out. These heterogebeous sedimentary rocks include debris flow (?lahars), alluvial fan and fluviolacustrine facies volcanoclastic deposits accumulated with a substantial and long-lived valley drainage system which developed upon the Glen Oraid Lava <b>Formation</b> <b>surface.</b> Subsequently this topography was inundated by two thick (at least 120m) intracanvon flows of compositionally distinctive tholeiitic basalt belonging to the Talisker Lava Formation. These flows mark a significant change in the chemical signature of the lava sequence and have a strong compositional affinity with the various intrusive units of the Cuillin Centre. … the Preshal More flows may represent the only remnants of an originally significant lava shield that developed above the Cuillin centre.|$|E
40|$|Rotary {{drilling}} with roller {{cone bit}} is {{often accompanied by}} wide fluctuations of the weight on bit (WOB). In certain cases the WOB periodically reduces to null. It has been postulated that in these cases the bit lifts off from the <b>formation</b> <b>surface.</b> The present study models the interaction among the lift-off of the bit, the WOB variation, and the modulation of the amplitude of the lobes on the <b>formation</b> <b>surface.</b> The analytical model is used to obtain numerical results for a specific drillstring.

40|$|The far-infrared - radio {{correlation}} connects {{star formation}} and magnetic fields in galaxies, {{and has been}} confirmed over a large range of far-infrared luminosities. Recent investigations indicate that it may even hold in the regime of local dwarf galaxies, and we explore here the expected behavior in the regime of star <b>formation</b> <b>surface</b> densities below 0. 1 M_sun kpc^{- 2 } yr^{- 1 }. We derive two conditions that can be particularly relevant for inducing {{a change in the}} expected correlation: a critical star <b>formation</b> <b>surface</b> density to maintain the correlation between star formation rate and the magnetic field, and a critical star <b>formation</b> <b>surface</b> density below which cosmic ray diffusion losses dominate over their injection via supernova explosions. For rotation periods shorter than 1. 5 x 10 ^ 7 (H/kpc) ^ 2 yrs, with H the scale height of the disk, the first correlation will break down before diffusion losses are relevant, as higher star formation rates are required to maintain the correlation between star formation rate and magnetic field strength. For high star <b>formation</b> <b>surface</b> densities Sigma_SFR, we derive a characteristic scaling of the non-thermal radio to the far-infrared / infrared emission with Sigma_SFR^{ 1 / 3 }, corresponding to a scaling of the non-thermal radio luminosity L_s with the infrared luminosity L_{th} as L_{th}^{ 4 / 3 }. The latter is expected to change when the above processes are no longer steadily maintained. In the regime of long rotation periods, we expect a transition towards a steeper scaling with Sigma_SFR^{ 2 / 3 }, implying L_s~L_th^{ 5 / 3 }, while the regime of fast rotation is expected to show a considerably enhanced scatter. These scaling relations explain the increasing thermal fraction of the radio emission observed within local dwarfs, and can be tested with future observations by the SKA and its precursor radio telescopes.
