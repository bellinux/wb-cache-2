5|$|<b>Existence</b> is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and imperfection, strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to imperfection, actuality to potency, and <b>existence</b> to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either <b>existence</b> is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure <b>existence.</b> Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or imperfection. The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no imperfection in the reality of <b>existence,</b> and imperfection is added to <b>existence</b> only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of <b>existence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of <b>existence</b> (apart from {{as part of our}} ideas of other objects), we cannot claim that the idea of God implies his <b>existence.</b> He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that <b>existence</b> is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's <b>existence.</b> Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{his recent}} books, from {{the notions of}} phenomenography, ontography and ontology, Albert Piette elaborates {{anthropology}} as an empirical and theoretical science, different from sociology and ethnology. It would have its own methods of observation, phenomenography and ontography, and its own objects to observe, describe and analyse: humans’ <b>existences</b> and non-human’s <b>existences</b> around people. Piette’s anthropological world is filled with Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, apes and monkeys, gods and institutions, <b>existences</b> and presences, activity and passivity, instants and evolution. According to Piette, that is an existential anthropology.|$|R

5|$|Descartes {{argued that}} God's <b>existence</b> can be deduced from his nature, just as {{geometric}} ideas can be deduced {{from the nature}} of shapes—he used the deduction of the sizes of angles in a triangle as an example. He suggested {{that the concept of}} God is that of a supremely perfect being, holding all perfections. He seems to have assumed that <b>existence</b> is a predicate of a perfection. Thus, if the notion of God did not include <b>existence,</b> it would not be supremely perfect, as it would be lacking a perfection. Consequently, the notion of a supremely perfect God who does not exist, Descartes argues, is unintelligible. Therefore, according to his nature, God must exist.|$|E

Much of this has been useful, but not all of it has been commensurate. In this paper, we make the case for the limits to theoretical developments that lack clearly specified ontological commitments by attempting an inductive synthesis of the ontological content of empirical generalizations {{in evolutionary}} economics. We call this 2 ̆ 7 evolutionary realism 2 ̆ 7 and present it in three axioms - (1) all <b>existences</b> are bimodal matter-energy actualizations of ideas, (2) all <b>existences</b> associate, and (3) all <b>existences</b> are processes. We conclude with discussion of the sort of analytical framework that we might consistently build on these axioms; a three-level analytical structure of micro, meso and macro domains...|$|R

Analysis from a perspective of empiricism revealed that: 1) An interpretative framework is a complex configuration made up of real <b>existences</b> and knowledge/memories of each participant,and those components are correlated in such a way as to co-identify with each other, 2) Metaphorical correlations between real <b>existences</b> and knowledge/memories of each participant can be confirmed bi-directionally, and 3) Coordination of interpretative frameworks between participants can be successfully accomplished through a trial and error process referring to the perceptible features of real <b>existences.</b> The possibility of these findings is discussed in terms of future studies focusing on interactive communications...|$|R
