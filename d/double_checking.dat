5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>check.</b> A <b>double</b> <b>check</b> is a {{check from}} two {{pieces to the}} opponent's king in a single move. This happens when a moved piece attacks the king, {{resulting}} in a second piece giving check by discovered check. It can also happen, though very rarely, when an en passant capture opens two lines of attack simultaneously. In algebraic chess notation, a <b>double</b> <b>check</b> move is sometimes noted with a [...] "++" [...] after the written move {{in place of the}} usual [...] "+", although [...] "++" [...] has been used to indicate checkmate (along with [...] "#"). A <b>double</b> <b>check</b> cannot be blocked, nor can it be met by capturing one of the checking pieces (unless the king itself makes the capture), because there is check from two directions.|$|R
50|$|A {{special case}} of a {{discovered}} <b>check</b> is a <b>double</b> <b>check,</b> where both the piece being unmasked and the piece being moved attack the enemy king.

50|$|Several million {{successful}} jumps {{have taken}} place since 1980. This safety record is attributable to bungee operators rigorously conforming to standards and guidelines governing jumps, such as <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> calculations and fittings for every jump. As with any sport, injuries can still occur (see below), {{and there have been}} fatalities. A relatively common mistake in fatality cases is to use a cord that is too long. The cord should be substantially shorter than the height of the jumping platform to allow it room to stretch. When the cord becomes taut and then is stretched, the tension in the cord progressively increases. Initially the tension is less than the jumper's weight and the jumper continues to accelerate downwards. At some point, the tension equals the jumper's weight and the acceleration is temporarily zero. With further stretching, the jumper has an increasing upward acceleration and at some point has zero vertical velocity before recoiling upward.

50|$|Initially the State and Church {{were not}} {{separated}} {{in the constitution}} of the ZAR, citizens of the ZAR had to be members of the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1858 these clauses were altered in the constitution to allow for the Volksraad to approve other Dutch Christian churches. The Reformed Church was approved by the Volksraad in 1858, which had the effect of allowing Paul Kruger, of the Gereformeerde Kerk to remain a citizen of the ZAR. The Bible itself was also often used to interpret the intention of legal documents. The Bible was also used to interpret a prisoner exchange agreement, reached in terms of the Sand River Convention, between a commando of the ZAR, led by Paul Kruger and a Commando of the Orange Free State. President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff had issued a death sentence over two ZAR citizens, for treason. Paul Kruger argued with President Boshoff that the Bible said punishment does not mean a death sentence and at the prisoner exchange, it was agreed that the accused would be punished if found guilty. After <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> Commandant Paul Kruger's Bible, President Boshoff commuted the sentences to lashes with a sjambok.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} design techniques is redundancy. This means that if one part of the system fails, there is an alternate success path, such as a backup system. The reason why this is the ultimate design choice is related to the fact that high-confidence reliability evidence for new parts or systems is often not available, or is extremely expensive to obtain. By combining redundancy, together {{with a high level of}} failure monitoring, and the avoidance of common cause failures; even a system with relatively poor single-channel (part) reliability, can be made highly reliable at a system level (up to mission critical reliability). No testing of reliability has to be required for this. In conjunction with redundancy, the use of dissimilar designs or manufacturing processes (e.g. via different suppliers of similar parts) for single independent channels, can provide less sensitivity to quality issues (e.g. early childhood failures at a single supplier), allowing very-high levels of reliability to be achieved at all moments of the development cycle (from early life to long-term). Redundancy can also be applied in systems engineering by <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> requirements, data, designs, calculations, software, and tests to overcome systematic failures.|$|E
50|$|Those with {{obsessive-compulsive}} disorder continually practice rituals or routines {{in order to}} satisfy their intrusive worries and fears. Emily Colas describes several routines that she completes daily {{in order to ensure that}} she does not contract a disease. Colas has a rather complex routine for taking out the garbage. She had her husband undergo an extensive procedure of taking out the trash to ensure that no germs entered her home. Colas also had a habit of <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> things. When putting on the dishwasher she would check several times to be certain that her cats were not inside the appliance. Eventually she started locking the cats in the bathroom when it was time to wash the dishes. Routines like Colas' are typical of OCD patients. These routines are meant to satisfy their worries and make the person feel better temporarily. Often the patients feel compelled to perform these rituals. A person's worries generally fit into three categories: overestimation of threat, intolerance of uncertainty, and the over-importance of one's thoughts and the desire to control these thoughts. Common rituals or routines of OCD patients include excessive cleaning, checking locks, ordering or arranging items in a certain way, and saving or sometimes hoarding items. These routines are exhausting for the person to keep up with and they only satisfy their worries temporarily.|$|E

40|$|Medication {{errors are}} a {{significant}} global concern and can cause serious medical consequences in children. <b>Double</b> <b>checking</b> of medicines by two nurses is one strategy used by many children's hospitals to prevent errors from reaching paediatric patients. This thesis involves different studies that evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process in reducing and preventing medication administration errors in a children's hospital. In addition, a systematic review was conducted of medication errors studies in the Middle East. A systematic review was also conducted of published studies of <b>double</b> <b>checking.</b> Six electronic databases were searched for articles that assessed the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process during the administration of medicines. Sixteen articles were identified. Only {{one of them was a}} randomised controlled clinical trial in a clinical setting. Only one study was conducted in a children's hospital. The review found that there is insufficient evidence to either support or refute the practice of <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> and more clinical trials are needed to evaluate the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process in children's hospitals. Based on the findings that were highlighted from the systematic review, a prospective observational study of paediatric nurses using the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process for medication administration was undertaken. The study aimed to evaluate how closely <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> policies are followed by nurses in different paediatric areas, and also to identify any. medication administration errors during the study period. 2, 000 drug dose administration events were observed. There was variation between paediatric nurses adherence to <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> steps and different medication administration errors were identified. Based on the observational study, a semi-structured questionnaire study was developed. It was designed to explore the paediatric nurses' knowledge and opinions about the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process. The study showed that many nurses have insufficient knowledge on the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process and the hospital policy for medication administration. A simulation study was conducted to examine whether single or <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> is more effective in detecting and reducing medication errors in children. Each participant in this study was required to prepare and administer medicines in scenarios for two "dummy patients" either with another nurse (<b>double</b> <b>checking)</b> or alone (single checking). Different confounders were built into each scenario (prescribing and administration) for nurses to identify and address during the administration process. Errors in drug preparation, administration and failure to address confounders were observed and documented. The main findings from this study were that the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> process is more likely to identify medication administration errors and contraindicated drugs than single checking. The time taken for drug administration was similar for both processes. Another systematic review was conducted to identify the published medication errors studies that have been undertaken in the Middle East. The review identified 45 studies from 10 Middle Eastern countries. Nine of the studies focused on medication errors in paediatric patients. Educational programmes on drug therapy for doctors and nurses are urgently needed in the Middle East. These studies have contributed to the field of medication safety by providing more information about double and single checking medication administration processes in paediatric hospitals. More educational and training programmes for nurses about the importance of <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> and improving their adherence rate to the <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> steps during medication administration are required to improve its effectiveness...|$|E

40|$|RATIONALE AND AIM: The <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> of {{medicines}} {{in health care}} is a contestable procedure. It occupies an obvious position in health care practice and is understood to be an effective defence against medication error but the process is variable and the outcomes have not been exposed to testing. This paper presents an appraisal of the process using data from part of a larger study on the contributory factors in medication errors and their reporting. METHODS: Previous research studies are reviewed; data are analysed from a review of 991 drug error reports and a subsequent series of 40 in-depth interviews with health professionals in an acute hospital in northern England. RESULTS: The incident reports showed that errors occurred despite <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> but that action taken did not appear to investigate the checking process. Most interview participants (34) talked extensively about <b>double</b> <b>checking</b> but believed the process to be inconsistent. Four key categories were apparent: deference to authority, reduction of responsibility, automatic processing and lack of time. Solutions to the problems were also offered, which are discussed with several recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Double</b> <b>checking</b> medicines should be a selective and systematic procedure informed by key principles and encompassing certain behaviours. Psychological research may be instructive in reducing checking errors but the aviation industry may also have a part to play in increasing error wisdom and reducing risk...|$|E
