5|$|Eight {{commercial}} {{contractors are}} currently {{licensed by the}} International Seabed Authority (an <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>organization</b> established to organize and control all mineral-related activities in the international seabed area {{beyond the limits of}} national jurisdiction) to explore nodule resources and to test mining techniques in eight claim areas, each covering 150,000km². When mining ultimately begins, each mining operation is projected to directly disrupt 300–800km² of seafloor per year and disturb the benthic fauna over an area 5–10 times that size due to redeposition of suspended sediments. Thus, over the 15-year projected duration of a single mining operation, nodule mining might severely damage abyssal seafloor communities over areas of 20,000 to 45,000km² (a zone at least the size of Massachusetts).|$|E

It {{is the largest}} international economic organization in the world.

Most {{of the issues that}} the WTO focuses on derive from previous trade negotiations, especially from the Uruguay Round (1986–1994).|$|E

In a 2004 report, the WWF agreed the Barents Sea cod fishery appeared to be healthy, but that the situation may not last due to illegal fishing, industrial development, and high quotas. In 2005, the WWF—Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on the Grand Banks, in the form of bycatch. WWF also claimed poor enforcement by NAFO, an <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>organization</b> with a mandate to provide scientific fishery advice and management in the northwestern Atlantic.|$|E

In the Canadian system however under the 2002 Species at Risk Act the ultimate determination of conservation status (e.g. endangered) is a political, cabinet-level decision; Cabinet decided to not accept COSEWIC's 2003 recommendations. Bell has explained how both COSEWIC and public perceptions were manipulated, and the governing law broken, to favour that decision. In 2005 the WWF-Canada accused both foreign and Canadian fishing vessels of deliberate, large-scale violations of the restrictions on cod fishing on the Grand Banks, {{in the form of}} bycatch and of poor enforcement of the restrictions by NAFO, an <b>intergovernmental</b> <b>organization</b> with a mandate to provide scientific advice and management of fisheries in the northwestern part of the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
