5|$|The argasid tick Hyalomma marginatum {{was found}} in pale crag martin nests on a {{sarcophagus}} and an ancient tomb in Egypt. This tick has been implicated in the transmission of Bahig virus, a pathogenic arbovirus previously thought to be transmitted only by mosquitoes.

5|$|Active {{elliptical}} galaxies of a form {{similar to}} M87 {{are believed to}} form {{as a result of}} one or more mergers between smaller galaxies. There is now little dust remaining to form the diffuse nebulae where new stars were created, so the stellar population is dominated by old, population II stars that contain relatively low abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium. M87's elliptical shape is maintained by random orbital motions of its member stars, in contrast to the more orderly rotational motions <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spiral galaxy such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|Agathaeromys is an extinct genus of oryzomyine rodents {{from the}} Pleistocene of Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles. Two species are known, which differ {{in size and}} some details of tooth morphology. The larger A.donovani, the type species, is known from {{hundreds}} of teeth, found in four localities that are probably 900,000 to 540,000 years old. A.praeuniversitatis, the smaller species, is known from 35teeth <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single fossil site, which is probably 540,000 to 230,000 years old.|$|E
5|$|All {{excavated}} tombs were intrusive burials interred under residential platforms. They {{were all}} <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> squatting position without any particular orientation. Many {{of the remains}} were found accompanied by a broken obsidian blade.

5|$|Arran {{also has}} three rare endemic species of tree, the Arran Whitebeams. These are the Scottish or Arran {{whitebeam}}, the cut-leaved whitebeam and the Catacol whitebeam, which are amongst the most endangered tree {{species in the}} world. They are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> protected national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 283 Arran whitebeam and 236 cut-leaved whitebeam were recorded as mature trees in 1980. The Catacol whitebeam was discovered in 2007 and steps {{have been taken to}} protect the two known specimens.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would be <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cometary nucleus. Although {{a substantial amount of}} water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
