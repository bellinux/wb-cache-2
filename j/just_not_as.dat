Due to the PlayStation's limited RAM capacity, Capcom removed tag team battles {{in an attempt to}} preserve the game's speed and graphical integrity. Consequently, the PlayStation port received positive reviews, <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> much as the Dreamcast version. A sequel to Clash of Super Heroes, , was released in 2000.|$|E
25|$|In the {{meantime}} the war continued, <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> successfully for Muscovy. As Lithuanian forces arrived to the region, the Muscovite forces {{had to move}} slowly. Additionally, the Livonian Order, led by Wolter von Plettenberg, joined the war as an ally of Lithuania. The Livonian troops won the Battle of the Siritsa River in August 1501, besieged Pskov, and won the Battle of Lake Smolino in September 1502. In 1502, Ivan III organized a campaign to capture Smolensk, but the city withstood the siege as Muscovites chose poor strategy {{and did not have}} enough artillery. Peace negotiations began in mid-1502. Alexander asked Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary to act as the mediator, and a six-year truce was concluded on the Feast of the Annunciation (March 25) in 1503. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lost approximately , or a third of its territory: Chernihiv, Novhorod-Siverskyi, Starodub, and lands around the upper Oka River. Russian historian Matvei Kuzmich Liubavskii counted Lithuanian losses at 70 volosts, 22 towns, and 13 villages. The Lithuanians also acknowledged Ivan's title, sovereign of all Rus.|$|E

U.S. News and World Report likens it to many real companies in its size range: [...] "It is facing an increasingly competitive marketplace.

500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore."

It just has to learn to run differently." ...|$|E
500|$|John Sinnott of DVD Talk {{said that}} while [...] "the show still {{has a lot of}} charm," [...] he felt it did not live up to the {{standards}} of the first season.

[...] However, he felt there were good episodes, naming [...] "Sleepers" [...] as his favourite, and also saying he liked [...] "Hero". He summed up that the season was [...] "still worth watching and enjoyable, <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> gripping as the first season," [...] believing it comes [...] "recommended" [...] to those who wish to purchase the season box set.

I'm glad I'm still giving this show a second chance as it continues to deliver great character arcs and stories." [...] Blackwell named [...] "Pavor Nocturnus", [...] "Veritas" [...] and [...] "Haunted" [...] as the standout episodes. CliqueClack TV believed the season was a [...] "mixed bag"; [...] "End of Nights" [...] was considered [...] "the most thrilling hours of television Sanctuary has ever produced," [...] but the season later [...] "suffered mostly from failure to follow through with the Cabal/Ashley story arc." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{they got}} their start as a visual kei band, the members of Dir en Grey seem to be irked being {{associated}} with the term in some interviews.

On 26 April 2013, HIM released their eight studio album Tears on Tape, which was once again produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa, and mixed by Tim Palmer. Tears on Tape charted in nine countries, peaking at number two in Finland and Germany, number seven in Austria, and at number fifteen in the US. The title-track, [...] "Into the Night" [...] and [...] "All Lips Go Blue" [...] were released as singles, all of which received music videos.

Tears on Tape received mostly positive reviews, scoring 67 out of 100 at Metacritic.

2500|$|GameSpy's Kevin Murphy, too, {{criticized the}} PS2 version's limited {{use of the}} sword: [...] "This {{ultimately}} hurts the game, as it's really fun hacking with the sword." [...] He also disliked the combat system; [...] "Players are just pushing the right analog stick around and don't have any control over the actual moves Blade uses, just {{the direction of his}} attack. While this is a wonderful control scheme when enemies surround you, it's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> good as letting the player decide to punch, kick, or throw." [...] He concluded [...] "Blade II isn't all bad. It has its moments and fans of the character will be content, but not overjoyed with the title. Hardcore and casual gamers alike, however, will tire of it very quickly." [...] Steve Steinberg wrote of the Xbox version's combat system, [...] "it probably made more sense in theory than it does in actual application," [...] calling it [...] "the stick version of button-mashing." [...] He also criticized the AI, saying: [...] "The game would have been far better with fewer, but more intelligent, enemies. As it is, it's just you against wave after wave of poorly developed enemies." [...] He concluded, [...] "Ultimately, Blade II plays more like a platformer for adults than like an action title [...] Clean up some of the rough language, give Blade a big, bulbous, cutesy head, and replace the millions of vampires per level with an equal number of collectible trinkets and you'll have something the Nintendo crowd can tackle when they're done with the latest Mario romp." ...|$|E
