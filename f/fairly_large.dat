30|$|It {{should be}} pointed out that the {{difference}} in the amount of the degradation of compound VII between the oxygen-alkali treatments with and without the presence of compound II is <b>fairly</b> <b>larger</b> than that of compound VI. Although this result cannot clearly be related to the reactivity of AOS toward the different substructures between compounds VI and VII, there can be a possible interpretation. AOS attack hydroxymethylene group more preferentially than hydroxymethyl group, which was suggested in our previous study in the reaction of AOS with some alditols [12]. The reactivity of AOS toward the aryloxyl carbons cannot be clarified in this study.|$|R
5|$|Cave 21 is {{approached}} {{through a}} small crevice from cave 20, {{in the absence of}} any direct approach. Its living space has a veranda of <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> size. There is also an inner cell with a grooved door frame. Seating benches have been cut into shallow spaces both in the cell and in the veranda.|$|E
5|$|Geschwaderkommodore Major Gerhard Michalski {{commanded}} the force. Five pilots {{were shot down}} by ground fire. Another pilot got lost during the flight and ended up near Eindhoven where he was shot down and killed. Reduced in number, 8–10 fighters of IV./JG 4 continued to their target. After 10 minutes, they located a <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> airfield and attacked, believing it to be Le Culot. It was in fact Sint-Truiden.|$|E
5|$|The German Type IXA {{submarine}} was a sub-class of the German Type IX submarine {{built for}} Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine between 1937 and 1938. These U-boats were designed between 1935 and 1936 and {{were intended to}} be <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> ocean-going submarines. The inspiration for the Type IXA submarine came from the German Type IA submarine, which had a similar diving depth and identical submerged horsepower.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSupercapacitors are {{promising}} devices for energy storage. Being able {{to measure and}} predict their performances is a key step in order to optimize them. In the present study, we propose an original methodology to calculate the capacitance of a single nanoporous carbon electrode in contact with an ionic liquid, using molecular dynamics simulations. The results are compared to experimental electrochemical measurements conducted on the same systems at high temperature (close to 100 ◦C). The two approaches are in qualitative agreement and show that, {{in the case of}} a butyl-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte combined with a carbide-derived carbon with an average pore size of 0. 9 nm, the positive electrode capacitance is <b>fairly</b> <b>larger</b> than the negative one...|$|R
40|$|Microwave {{remote sensing}} {{is the most}} recent {{experimental}} methodology suitable to the non-contact measurement of deflections on large structures, in static or dynamic conditions. After {{a brief description of}} the radar measurement system, the paper addresses the application of microwave remote sensing in ambient vibration testing of two historic masonry towers. The study clearly highlights that: (a) the actual displacement of the investigated towers under ambient excitation (wind, micro-tremors) is <b>fairly</b> <b>larger</b> than the radar sensitivity; (b) the deflections are generally quite low, so that only the lower modes can be identified from the deflection time-histories; (c) only few points of the investigated towers were characterized by appropriate electromagnetic reflectivity, allowing accurate measurements of the relevant deflection time-histories...|$|R
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Otarioidea and Phocoidea diverged 33mya. The Phocidae {{are likely to have}} descended from the extinct family Desmatophocidae in the North Atlantic. Desmatophocids lived 23–10 mya and had elongated skulls, <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> eyes, cheekbones connected by a mortised structure and rounded cheek teeth. They also were sexually dimorphic and may have been capable of propelling themselves with both the foreflippers and hindflippers.|$|E
5|$|According to Tino's account, {{on the day}} of the election, Selvo was {{attending}} mass for the funeral of the late Doge at the new monastery church of San Nicolò built under Domenico Contarini on Lido, an island in the Venetian Lagoon. The location was ideal for the funeral of a Doge not only because St Mark's Basilica was under construction at the time, but the new church was also spacious enough to hold a <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> number of people. The location also proved ideal for the election of a new Doge for the very same reasons.|$|E
5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} nests in hollows situated high {{in trees}} with <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> diameters, generally Eucalyptus. With {{much of its}} habitat lost to land clearing and development and threatened by further habitat destruction, Carnaby's black cockatoo is listed as an endangered species by the Federal and Western Australian governments. It is also classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Like most parrots, it is protected by CITES, an international agreement that makes trade, export, and import of listed wild-caught species illegal.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the nineteenth century, and the situation was further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled. By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> family to be established, nested within a series of subfamilies (Amaryllidoideae) and tribes (Narcisseae). It shares {{its position in the}} latter tribe with Sternbergia.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} usually found in {{eucalyptus}} woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly {{parts of the}} country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> diameters, generally Eucalyptus. Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by deforestation and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to aviculture, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with unemployment rates of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E

Geophysical results do not produce conclusive, explicit results, but rather show subsurface variations in physical properties (Breiner, 1973) ...|$|R
30|$|Schumm (1956) {{suggested}} the inverse of ‘Dd’ or the constant of channel maintenance (C) {{as a significant}} aspect of landform. The constant express the per km 2 of basin surface essential to develop and sustain a channel 1  km long. It is mainly dependent on the rock form, permeability, climatic regime, foliage cover and relief along with duration of erosion. The ‘C’ value designates the comparative size of landforms components in a river basin and has a precise genetic meaning (Strahler 1957). The ‘C’ value in the basin is 0.92 and is coming under very less structural disturbances and less runoff condition (Table  1). High ‘C’ value in any basin displays the basin area of lower stream order drainages are <b>fairly</b> <b>larger</b> than the sub-basins which have lower C value. Low ‘C’ value in the basin reduces length of overland flow (Lg), thus water discharges rapidly as channel flow in scant vegetation cover (Samal et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|The {{consideration}} {{of this work}} focuses on the recyclability of glass cloth waste coated by PVC as a fiber reinforced composite by using compression and injection molding methods. In the compression molding of composite, the sheet-type wastes were laminated in the die, and PVC resin was melted by using hot press. It is concluded from the bending test of molded composite that the strength increases with increasing mold temperature because of the good-adhesion of each lamination and good penetration of PVC resin into the glass cloth for higher mold temperature. In the injection molding method of composite, the wastes were fed directly into the injection molding machine. It is concluded from the tensile test of molded composite that the strength of PVC/glass composite is smaller than that of PVC {{because of the lack}} of adhesion between PVC and glass. The strength of PVC/glass/PP mixture, however, is <b>fairly</b> <b>larger</b> than that of PVC...|$|R
5|$|NGC 1664 is a <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> open cluster, with a {{diameter}} of 18 arcminutes, and moderately bright, with a magnitude of 7.6, comparable to several other open clusters in Auriga. One open cluster with a similar magnitude is NGC 1778, with a magnitude of 7.7. This small cluster has {{a diameter}} of 7 arcminutes and contains 25 stars. NGC 1857, a small cluster, is slightly brighter at magnitude 7.0. It has {{a diameter of}} 6 arcminutes and contains 40 stars, making it far more concentrated than the similar-sized NGC 1778. Far dimmer than the other open clusters is NGC 2126 at magnitude 10.2. Despite its dimness, NGC 2126 is as concentrated as NGC 1857, having 40 stars in a diameter of 6 arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii was a <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> rodent, {{larger than}} the black rat (Rattus rattus). A {{member of the family}} Cricetidae and {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae, it shares several distinctive characters with Holochilus and related genera within the tribe Oryzomyini, including high-crowned molars with simplified crown features and the presence of several ridges on the skull which help anchor the chewing muscles. Although a suite of traits suggest that Holochilus is its closest relative, it is distinctive in many ways and is therefore classified in a separate genus, Noronhomys. Its close relatives, including Holochilus and Lundomys, are adapted to a semiaquatic lifestyle, spending much of their time in the water, but features of the Noronhomys bones suggest that it lost its semiaquatic lifestyle after arrival at its remote island.|$|E
5|$|Scuba diving {{fatalities}} have a {{major financial}} impact by way of lost income, lost business, insurance premium increases and high litigation costs. Equipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and when {{the cause of death}} is recorded as drowning, it is usually the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events in which drowning is the endpoint because it occurred in water, while the initial cause remains unknown. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, often as a consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, occasionally aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.|$|E

5|$|The Eriskay Pony {{developed}} in the Hebrides, a group of western isles in Scotland. The origins of the breed are ancient, with roots in Celtic and Norse breeding. It is physically similar to drawings of ponies on ancient Pictish stones found in north and west Scotland. It is related to other northern breeds, including the Icelandic horse and the Faroe pony. The Eriskay {{takes its name from}} the island of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Originally, the breed had a <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> population, and until the mid-19th century the Eriskay and similar ponies were found throughout the western islands of Scotland. They were used as crofters' ponies, as pack animals, for light draught and as mounts for children.|$|E
5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> songbird, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending to between the first molars (M1). The bony palate is broad and short, with the posterior margin between the third molars (M3). Nephelomys levipes is the only other oryzomyine with such a short palate, although that of Eremoryzomys polius is only slightly longer. The posterolateral palatal pits (openings in the back part of the palate near the M3) vary from small to <b>fairly</b> <b>large</b> and are located in slight fossas (depressions). In Eremoryzomys, these fossas are deeper. The roof of the mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind the palate, is completely closed or contains small sphenopalatine vacuities. The vacuities are much larger in Eremoryzomys. The alisphenoid strut, a piece of bone that separates two foramina (openings), is present in all Drymoreomys specimens examined, except in one juvenile specimen.|$|E
