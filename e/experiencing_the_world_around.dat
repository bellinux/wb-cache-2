[...] His use of materials, processes, and scale, inform and shape his work, forging new ways of seeing and <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us. The work walks the line between photography and painting. Derived from photographs, his painterly surfaces combine highly detailed aerial landscape images, with acrylic inks, unique materials, and innovative printing processes he’s pioneered.|$|E
40|$|Collaboration {{between the}} arts and {{sciences}} has helped to create new ideas, processes and knowledge. By working together we open up new ways of seeing and <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us and the current relationship between art-making, science and ecology. How can we work across art and science to enable a creative discourse about ideas that shape the perception {{and the experience of}} our changing environment? Can artistic practices inspire engagement in environmental issues, and sustain engagement through ongoing activities? This session seeks out those curious about the critical and intriguing topics that combine art, science and the environment. An interdisciplinary view about interpreting the world around us that embraces the natural environment and art by combining a fascination with how people create, interacts with, and impacts the landscape they inhabit...|$|E
40|$|Marshal McLuhan, the Canadian medium guru and Edward T. Hall, the {{distinguished}} American anthropologist, are two intellectual giants of the 20 th century. Each of them has, {{in his own}} way, set up a completely new outlook on our life and {{a new way of}} <b>experiencing</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us. Though working in different fields of study, these two great masters think very much alike. Both of them seem to have profound insight and penetrating perception in unveiling the true relationship between man and his environment. They both regard man’s technological creations as extensions of man and recognize the immense power of media in shaping and reorganizing human life; they have been searching for basic rules and patterns in media forms rather than in the content; they both recognized the psychic and social consequences of media or extensions of man. But each of them deals with human extensions from different perspectives and focuses on different aspects of human life. McLuhan seems to be more interested in the life of forms and their surprising modalities, while Hall concerns more about cultural forms or how environment variations bring about different life patterns in different cultures. Together they have led us to see both the forest and the tree in the multicultural global village. By comparing these two geniuses, we can better understand their epoch-making ideologies and thus better understand ourselves and the world around us. What we can benefit from this comparison is, besides the enlightening ideas and discoveries, a rethinking of our own research approach and way of perceiving the world. It is time for us to stop being distracted by the superficial content of things and begin to look for the truth in the things themselves and in their own cultural contexts. Only in this way can we find true nature of human man communication and human relationships...|$|E

Yet, while we <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us with all our senses this experience is mostly introspect and intellectual.

Research shows that sensory processing in the brain of people with autism differs significantly from neurotypical people. That explains the 'how' and 'why'. Consequences are that the have much more difficulties in social relationships and in (work) participation. To participate costs more of energy, people with autism experience a lot of stress and often feel exhausted. They need to take that into account when participating in social relationships, education and work. Interventions can help to make them aware of their sensory processing issues and to make adjustments in education and work if helpful...|$|R

The whole anthropological linguistics is based on the research of this relationship. Cognitive scientists investigate the structure of languages and their impact on the shaping of people’s thinking. Thinking is metaphorical. Language is full of metaphorical concepts that we nowadays take as normal language. This paper will try to show a number of different linguistic structures designed to show different ways of perception of the reality around us. We are also going to try to compare some idioms in different languages. Metaphors lie in the foundation of idioms. Idioms show how we <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us and in what framework we think about it. Comparing idioms we will compare different ways of thinking and different cultures...|$|R

40|$|Part 4 : PrivacyInternational audienceSince the 1990 s, two {{technologies}} have reshaped how {{we see and}} <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us. These technologies are the Internet and mobile communication, especially smartphones. The Internet provides a cheap and convenient way to explore and communicate with distant people. A multitude of services have converged on the smartphone platform, and potentially the most notable is social networking. With increased interconnectivity and use of online services, concerns about consumers’ security and privacy are growing. In this paper, we evaluate the security- and privacy-preserving features provided by existing mobile chat services. This paper also puts forwards a basic framework for an End-to-End (E 2 E) security and privacy-preserving mobile chat service and associated requirements. We implemented the proposal to provide proof-of-concept and evaluate the technical difficulty of satisfying the stipulated security and privacy requirements...|$|R

40|$|Time {{is intimately}} {{embedded}} {{in the way that}} we <b>experience</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>around</b> us. Indeed, our subjective temporal experiences seem so natural that we assume that this aspect of our conscious lives conveys something of the true nature of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that we observe- that the events around us really do unfold in a temporally ordered and continuous way. However, deeper reflection combined with our understanding of the physics of the universe reveals a problem of subtle complexity that seems to confound any classical approach to a solution. Time can be addressed by its following aspects: (i) Physical time: this is usually clock time; for example, time in attosecond unit can now be measured. (ii) Biological time: although all brain areas can be considered as biological clocks, the suprachiasmatic nucleus is the master molecular clock; it can be measured in msec units. (iii) Perceptual rate of time: this can be measured in cycles per second (Hz) using critical flicker frequency (CFF) psychophysical method.

The young Kappus wrote to Rilke, who had also attended the academy, between 1902 and 1908 when he was uncertain about his future career as a military officer or as a poet. [...] Initially, he sought Rilke's advice as to the quality of his poetry, and whether he ought to pursue writing as a career.

These stressors may occur when children are transitioning into schools and communities and are required to demonstrate more independence to be successful.

DCAD’s associate of fine arts (AFA) degree program is offered in six disciplines: Animation, Fine Arts, Graphic Design, Illustration, Interior Design, and Photography. Apart from the traditional disciplines of the fine artist, these include opportunities in publishing, marketing, computer graphics, advertising, packaging, display design, and photography. In addition to studio courses, courses in art history and writing and literature (combined) complete the curriculum. Most students transfer to other colleges that offer the BFA degree; Pratt, Corcoran, MICA, RISD, the School of the Chicago Art Institute, PAFA, UArts, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston are {{but some of the}} fine schools to which students are accepted and attend.
