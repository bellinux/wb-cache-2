On {{each of the three}} exposed sides there is a face of the clock with a diameter of 3.25 m. The clock faces are decorated with stained glass representing the 12 astrological signs. Two young men dressed in national costumes, are painted {{on the sides of the}} clock faces guarding the clock (design element inspired from the Peleș Castle). The stained glass windows and the cross shaped crenelations are electrically illuminated during the night. The Carillon in the tower has 8 bells that are singing each hour the Union Hora song with the help of a <b>drum</b> <b>with</b> 69 <b>pins.</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{study the}} pinning control design for {{feedback}} stabilization of constrained Boolean control networks (BCNs) via the semitensor product of matrices. Firstly, a constrained algebraic representation is obtained for constrained BCNs <b>with</b> <b>pinning</b> control, and a necessary and sufficient condition is {{established for the}} reachability of constrained BCNs <b>with</b> <b>pinning</b> control. Secondly, a general procedure is proposed for the pinning control design of state feedback stabilization of constrained BCNs. Thirdly, a necessary and sufficient condition is presented for the output feedback stabilization of constrained BCNs <b>with</b> <b>pinning</b> control. Finally, two illustrative examples are worked out to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} obtained new results.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} biomechanical {{properties}} of dual bone fixation (DBF) constructs to radial locking compression plating (LCP) in an ex vivo feline antebrachial fracture gap model. Study Design: Ex vivo study. Sample Population: Cadaveric feline antebrachii (n= 12 pairs). Methods: Antebrachii were radiographed to confirm normal skeletal appearance and maturity. After {{creation of a}} 5 mm radial and ulnar ostectomy, each antebrachium received 1 of 3 constructs using an incomplete randomized block design (n= 8 per group). All groups received a 10 hole 2. 0 mm radial LCP. DBF groups received either a 1. 2 mm ulnar intramedullary <b>pin</b> (LCP <b>with</b> <b>pin)</b> or an 8 hole 2. 0 mm ulnar LCP {{in addition to the}} radial LCP. Biomechanical testing was performed in axial compression and caudocranial and mediolateral 4 -point bending before destruction in axial compression. Results: DBF constructs (LCP <b>with</b> <b>pin</b> and dual LCP) were significantly stiffer than radial LCP alone in axial compression and caudocranial bending. There were no differences between LCP <b>with</b> <b>pin</b> and dual LCP constructs in axial compression and caudocranial bending or between any constructs in mediolateral bending. Failure load was significantly greater for dual LCP than LCP <b>with</b> <b>pin</b> or LCP alone constructs. Failure loads were not different between LCP <b>with</b> <b>pin</b> and LCP alone. Conclusion: DBF significantly increased construct stiffness and strength. Given the high complication rate reported in cat antebrachial fractures when only the radius is stabilized, surgeons should consider DBF...|$|R
