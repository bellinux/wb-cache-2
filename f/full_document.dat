40|$|Text {{classification}} (TC) can {{be described}} as the act of assigning text documents to predefined classes or categories. Its necessity comes from the large amount of electronic documents on the web. The classification accuracy is affected by the content of documents and the classification technique being used. Automatic text summarization is based on identifying the set of sentences that are most important for the overall understanding of document(s). The need for text summarization comes from the large amount of electronic documents and the need for saving processing time. In this research, an automatic text summarizer has been used to summarize documents. Two classification methods have been used to classify Arabic documents before and after applying the summarization, then the classification accuracy of classifying the <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> and summarized documents have been compared. Classification accuracy resulted from classifying <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> is close to that resulted from classifying summarized documents. Nevertheless, memory space required and run time for classifying summarized documents are less than the memory and time needed for classifying <b>full</b> <b>documents...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{display of}} document retrieval results is a ranked list of query-biased summaries. When examining and processing search results, users must make complex {{decisions about how}} to allocate their time and relevance judging effort between evaluation of summaries and the <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> reachable with a mouse click on a summary. We performed a cluster analysis of the search results processing behavior of 48 user study participants. This analysis produced three clusters of behavior. Across these clusters, we found participants to employ two approaches to the evaluation of summaries: fast and liberal, or slow and neutral. Liberal judges of summaries tolerate clicking on non-relevant summaries {{in an effort to}} avoid missing relevant documents. The best performing group employed a fast and liberal approach to summaries and also quickly evaluated <b>full</b> <b>documents.</b> The two lower performing groups utilized opposite strategies with one group trading {{a short amount of time}} on the summaries for more time spent evaluating <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> and the other group invested more time in evaluating summaries and spent a shorter time on documents. 1...|$|R

We set-up a comparison framework to study the effect of different summarisation algorithms of various compression rates in this task and compare the classification accuracy of summaries and documents for associating documents to classes. We make use of SVM algorithms to associate numerical ratings to opinionated documents. The algorithms are informed by linguistic and sentiment-based features computed from <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> and summaries. Preliminary results show that some types of summaries could be as effective or better as <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> in this problem. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Result merging {{is a key}} {{component}} in a metasearch engine. Once the results from various search engines are collected, the metasearch system merges them into a single ranked list. The effectiveness of a metasearch engine {{is closely related to}} the result merging algorithm it employs. In this paper, we investigate a variety of resulting merging algorithms based {{on a wide range of}} available information about the retrieved results, from their local ranks, their titles and snippets, to the <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> of these results. The effectiveness of these algorithms is then compared experimentally based on 50 queries from the TREC Web track and 10 most popular general-purpose search engines. Our experiments yield two important results. First, simple result merging strategies can outperform Google. Second, merging based on the titles and snippets of retrieved results can outperform that based on the <b>full</b> <b>documents.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} {{clustering}} documents {{in a manner}} which produces accurate and compact clusters becomes increasingly significant mainly with the vast size {{of information on the}} web. This problem becomes even more complicated with the multi-topics nature of documents these days. In this paper, we deal with the problem of clustering documents retrieved by a search engine, where each document deals with multiple topics. Our approach is based on segmenting each document into a number of segments and then clustering segments of all documents using the Lingo algorithm. We evaluate the quality of clusters obtained by clustering <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> directly and by clustering document segments using the distance-based average intra-cluster similarity measure. Our results illustrate that average intra-cluster similarity is increased by approximately 75 % as a result of clustering document segments as compared to clustering <b>full</b> <b>documents</b> retrieved by the search engine. </p...|$|R
