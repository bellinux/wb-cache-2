40|$|This {{paper is}} in three parts {{describing}} {{the analysis and}} simulation of the grinding process. This first part {{is concerned with the}} generation of the wheel surface by single point <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing.</b> In grinding, the grinding wheel has to be dressed periodically to restore wheel form and cutting efficiency. Understanding the process of generating the grinding wheel surface is important for the control of the grinding process. Generation of the wheel surface is simulated as a single <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing</b> process on a computer generated wheel. The wheel is simulated by grains randomly spaced in the wheel volume. The topography of the wheel cutting surface is generated by simulating the action of an ideal dressing tool as it dresses the wheel. The simulation of the wheel topography takes account of the motion of the dressing tool, grain size, grain spacing, grain fracture and grain break-out. The simulated cutting surface is used for further simulations of grinding. The simulation of grinding using the simulated grinding wheel surface is described in Sections 2 and 3 where a comparison is made of results predicted from simulation with results obtained from experiments. By matching simulated and experimental results, it is possible to explain the relative importance of dressing and grinding parameters...|$|R

This paper presents some of the interesting results of the systematic research work which was done by the authors to make a step forward in pure dry grinding based on: - The optimisation of the chip formation reduces the friction and rubbing in the process - Process heat transfer without using coolant lubricant Results focused on grinding forces and the corresponding heat generation. A new method is presented to reduce heat energy by special conditioning using a <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing</b> disc, for dressing of the CBN vitrified bond wheel, based on a new innovative concept.

In {{order to determine the}} incision depth and ideal laser pass separation distance, laser exposures are first performed on high purity, low porosity aluminum oxide blocks and subsequently analyzed with an optical profiler operating in confocal mode. This ablation data is then applied to path planning for grinding wheel profiling experiments, with division of the necessary removal depth according to the measured incision depth and ideal pass separation distance. X-ray computed tomography is utilized to determine the resulting profile accuracy as a function of process parameters.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} new {{algorithm}} for predicting the cross-sectional surface roughness of the workpiece for the grinding process, which reduces three-dimensional modeling to two-dimensional modeling {{by virtue of}} the cross-sectional area of the undeformed grinding chip.

The simulated results are consistent with the measurement data, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Intorduction So far, a great number of research activities have been devoted to modeling and predicting surface roughness for the grinding process[1]. Chen. X and W.

40|$|Current {{techniques}} for {{the manufacture of}} functional micro scale surface structures are both time consuming and expensive. Techniques for Ultra-Precision (UP) abrasive machining of functional surfaces, using specially manufactured tools, have previously been described for example in the grinding of riblets. However these methods are both costly and limited in their functionality. Using conventional UP grinding tools and a novel dressing technique, adapted from macro scale grinding, provides an alternative solution offering both low cost and ease of adaptability. Such a system {{would be capable of}} producing regular deterministic surface textures over a large area to a depth of 10 - 20 μm grinding in single or multiple passes. To achieve this, the grinding wheel surface is shaped with specialised geometries using a single point <b>diamond</b> <b>dressing</b> tool. The required geometry for a given surface texture can be modelled and used to design a dressing solution consisting of a dressing depth and feedrate. Adapting a conventional grinding machine (Precitech Nanoform 250 Ultra-Grind) for such a process presents many technical challenges to overcome. The quality of the finished surface will be dependent on the accuracy of the dressing process and the tool/workpiece interaction. Methods for controlling and measuring the dressing depth, feedrate, spindle speed and runout have been designed and trialled to determine the feasibility of the process. The results of the trials have been compared against the model to determine the deviation from ideal and hence the quality of the finished surface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A diamond {{conditioner}} or dresser {{is needed}} to regenerate the asperity structure of the pad and recover its designed ability in chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. In this paper a new design of diamond conditioner is made by shaping a sintered matrix of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) to form teethed blades. These blades are arranged and embedded in epoxy resin to make a designed penetration angle, called the blade <b>diamond</b> disk. The <b>dressing</b> characteristics of pad surface textures are studied by comparison with conventional diamond conditioner. It is found that the height variation of the diamond tip of blade diamond disk is significantly smaller than the conventional <b>diamond</b> disk. The <b>dressing</b> rate of blade diamond disk is {{lower than that of}} the conventional diamond disk, and hence the pad life is prolonged. As a result, reduction of the cost CMP is expected. In addition the pad surface roughness Ra of about 3. 79 μm is less than Ra of about 4. 15 μm obtained after dressing using a conventional diamond disk...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental investigation of workpiece surface waviness that stems from poor single point <b>diamond</b> wheel <b>dressing</b> procedures in cylindrical grinding. If done improperly, single point dressing {{can produce a}} thread on the grinding wheel surface that is then imposed on the workpiece during machining. The circumferential waviness exhibited by the threaded workpiece {{is similar to that}} resulting from one per rev vibrations of the grinding wheel. In order to differentiate between these two sources of waviness, a geometrical approach to predicting the circumferential and axial waves produced during grinding is presented. The concepts presented are illustrated through a series of plunge grinding tests incorporating dressing procedures of varying quality. Test results verify that dressing induced circumferential waviness is similar to waviness resulting from one per rev type vibrations of the grinding wheel. The two sources can be distinguished, however, through examination of the workpiece waviness in the axial direction...|$|R
