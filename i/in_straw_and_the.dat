40|$|Displacement of {{the fungus}} Fusarium pseudograminearum from stubble by antagonists is a {{potential}} means of biocontrol of crown rot in cereals. The role of carbon and nitrogen nutrition in interactions between the pathogen and the antagonists Fusarium equiseti, Fusarium nygamai, Trichoderma harzianum and the non-antagonistic straw fungus Alternaria infectoria was investigated. Sole carbon source utilization patterns on Biolog plates were similar among the three Fusarium species, suggesting a possible role for competition. However, carbon niche overlap was unlikely {{to be important in}} antagonism by T. harzianum. Straw medium supplemented with sugars generally reduced the inhibitory effect of antagonists on growth of F. pseudograminearum in dual culture, indicating that availability of simple carbon sources does not limit antagonism. Adding nitrogen as urea, nitrate or ammonium to straw medium had little effect on antagonism by F. equiseti and F. nygamai, but ammonium addition removed the inhibitory effect of T. harzianum on growth of F. pseudograminearum. Displacement of F. pseudograminearum from straw by all fungi in a Petri dish assay was greater when urea or nitrate was used as a nitrogen source than with ammonium. All forms of nitrogen significantly increased displacement of F. pseudograminearum from straw under simulated field conditions when straws were either inoculated with T. harzianum or exposed to resident soil microbes. However, in 2 out of 3 experiments urea and nitrate were more effective than ammonium. The results suggest that availability of nitrogen, but not carbon, is limiting the activities of antagonists of F. pseudograminearum <b>in</b> <b>straw,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> way nitrogen is applied can influence the rate of displacement and mortality of the pathogen in host residues...|$|E

The results of this study indicated that peri-urban organic wastes with 50 % straw or less can be composted but with measures being taken to achieve temperatures greater than 55 °C for at least 3 days to destroy weed seeds and pathogens. This highlights the potential of composting peri-urban organic materials as a waste disposal method. The composts with 30 % straw mixture had the greatest potential as a soil amendment in peri-urban areas of Harare as they effectively reduced nitrogen losses.

In this study, we used such measurements to assess Cd uptake and transport in wheat grown on three agricultural soils under controlled conditions. Isotope ratios of Cd were determined in <b>the</b> bulk C <b>and</b> A horizons, in the Ca(NO 3) 2 -extractable Cd soil pool, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> roots, <b>straw,</b> <b>and</b> grains. <b>The</b> Ca(NO 3) 2 -extractable Cd was isotopically heavier than the Cd in the bulk A horizon (Δ(114 / 110) Cdextract-Ahorizon = 0. 16 to 0. 45 ‰). The wheat plants were slightly enriched in light isotopes relative to the Ca(NO 3) 2 -extractable Cd or showed no significant difference (Δ(114 / 110) Cdwheat-extract = - 0. 21 to 0. 03 ‰). Among the plant parts, Cd isotopes were markedly fractionated: straw was isotopically heavier than roots (Δ(114 / 110) Cdstraw-root = 0. 21 to 0. 41 ‰), and grains were heavier than straw (Δ(114 / 110) Cdgrain-straw = 0. 10 to 0. 51 ‰). We suggest that the enrichment of heavy isotopes in the wheat grains was caused by mechanisms avoiding the accumulation of Cd in grains, such as the chelation of light Cd isotopes by thiol-containing peptides <b>in</b> roots <b>and</b> <b>straw.</b> These results demonstrate that Cd isotopes are significantly and systematically fractionated in soil-wheat systems, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fractionation patterns provide information on the biogeochemical processes in these systems...|$|R

The range between B deficiency and toxicity {{is smaller than}} most plant nutrients, though B requirement among different crops varies widely. The adequate dose of B for one genotype can either be insufficient or toxic to other. Hence, without knowing the actual requirements of crop varieties, B application can be risky due to the toxicity hazards. A field experiment was undertaken at experimental farm of Nuclear Institute of Agriculture (NIA) Tandojam during 2013, to evaluate the B requirement of two non-aromatic rice varieties. The experiment was arranged in split plot design with three repeats. Two rice varieties Sarshar and Shandar were grown in main plots with four rates of B: 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 kg ha- 1 and control (0 kg ha- 1) in sub plots. Both the varieties responded differently to B rates. Sarshar produced the highest paddy yield (5691 kg ha- 1) {{at a rate of}} 1. 5 kg B ha- 1 and was 18 % greater than control, Shandar produced the highest yield (6075 kg ha- 1) at a rate of 1. 0 kg B ha- 1 and was 5 % greater than control.

40|$|This thesis {{compares the}} {{performance}} of hypothetical biorefineries in Brazil and Scandinavia that produce biofuel for use in large marine vessels using one of three thermochemical technologies—hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), fast pyrolysis with hydrodeoxygenation (FP), and gasification with Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (GFT) —and one of ten lignocellulosic residues from forestry <b>and</b> agriculture. <b>The</b> biorefineries were modeled using black-box mass balances for biofuel production and electricity <b>and</b> heat cogeneration. <b>The</b> results of this model, along with local costs factors, were used to estimate the economic performance of biorefineries in each country where each feedstock is available. Estimates of capital expenses, operating expenses, and annual earnings were {{used to calculate the}} minimum selling price of the biofuel, which is used as an indicator of economic performance. The environmental performance of each combination was estimated using the indicators of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions, sulfur dioxide emissions, nitrogen oxide emissions, and non-renewable energy use. <b>The</b> economic <b>and</b> environmental indicators for each feedstock-technology-country combination are compared to each other and also compared to reference values for other marine emission-reducing technologies, including liquid natural gas, emission scrubbers, <b>and</b> soy biodiesel. <b>The</b> results are subject to sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of uncertainty of capital costs, feedstock costs, biorefinery scale, biorefinery siting, biorefinery configuration, biofuel yields, biofuel blending, and environmental impact allocation. The biofuels modeled in this study have significantly lower life cycle greenhouse gas and sulfur dioxide emissions and non-renewable energy use than those of heavy fuel oil, but have higher life cycle nitrogen oxide emissions, due to the lower quality of <b>the</b> fuel produced <b>and</b> combusted. Economically, none of the biofuels are competitive with current fossil fuel prices when estimated with <b>the</b> scale <b>and</b> cost factors in this study. The feedstock-technology-country combinations with the lowest minimum biofuel selling price, when considered as a ratio to the current local price of marine gas oil, are the hydrothermal liquefaction of barley <b>straw</b> <b>in</b> Sweden, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> fast pyrolysis of corn stover and rice residues in Brazil. Each of those combinations has a minimum biofuel selling price ratio of 3. 2 times that of marine gas oil. Performance trends between technologies and feedstocks are weak, and superior economic performance does not correlate with superior environmental performance.

40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was conducted on}} moth bean during kharif, 2016 at Agronomy Farm, College of Agriculture, Bikaner. The experiment was laid out in randomized block design with three replications. The treatments consisted of four varieties namely, RMO 40, RMO 225, RMO 435 and RMO 257 and four levels of phosphorus viz., 20, 40, 60 and 80 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1. Variety RMO 257 found superior to RMO 225 and RMO 435 in terms of nitrogen uptake <b>in</b> grain, <b>straw,</b> total nitrogen uptake and phosphorus uptake in grain however, it was at par with RMO 40 in all these characters.

40|$|A {{total of}} 13 {{phosphate}} transporters in rice (Oryza sative) {{have been identified}} as belonging to the Pht 1 family, which mediates inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake and transport. We report <b>the</b> biological property <b>and</b> physiological role of OsPht 1; 4 (OsPT 4). Overexpressing OsPT 4 resulted in significant higher Pi accumulation <b>in</b> roots, <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> brown rice, and suppression of OsPT 4 caused decreased Pi concentration <b>in</b> <b>straw</b> <b>and</b> brown rice. Expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene driven by the OsPT 4 promoter showed that OsPT 4 is expressed in roots, leaves, ligules, stamens, and caryopses under sufficient Pi conditions, consistent with the expression profile showing that OsPT 4 has high expression in roots <b>and</b> flag leaves. <b>The</b> transcript level of OsPT 4 increased significantly both in shoots and roots with a long time Pi starvation. OsPT 4 encoded a plasma membrane-localized protein and was able to complement the function of the Pi transporter gene PHO 84 in yeast. We concluded that OsPT 4 is a functional Pi-influx transporter involved in Pi absorption in rice that might play a role in Pi translocation. This study will enrich our understanding about the physiological function of rice Pht 1 family genes...|$|R
