5000|$|The {{earliest}} Jamaican {{immigrants to}} post-war Britain found differences in diet {{and availability of}} food an uncomfortable challenge. In later years, as the community developed and food imports became more accessible to all, grocers specialising in Caribbean produce opened in British high streets. Caribbean restaurants can now {{also be found in}} most areas of Britain where Jamaicans and other such groups reside, serving traditional Caribbean dishes such as curry goat, fried dumplings, and ackee and saltfish (the national dish of Jamaica). [...] "Jerk" [...] is a style of cooking from Jamaica in which meats (including pork and chicken) are <b>dry-rubbed</b> or wet marinated with a very hot spice mixture. The best known Caribbean food brands in the UK are Dunn's River, Tropical Sun, Walkerswood and Grace Foods. Grace Foods is originally from Jamaica but is now a multi national conglomerate. In March 2007 Grace Foods bought ENCO Products, owners of the Dunn's River Brand, as well as [...] "Nurishment", a flavoured, sweetened enriched milk drink, and the iconic Encona Sauce Range. Tropical Sun products and ingredients have been widely available in the UK for over 20 years and were originally known as Jamaica Sun with products mainly sourced from the Caribbean. Walkerswood is now owned by New Castle Limited has a range of sauce and marinade products.In 2001 Port Royal started manufacturing Jamaican patties in London, which are available in supermarkets and Caribbean takeaways across the UK. A patty is the Caribbean version of a Cornish Pasty, pastry with a meat filling.|$|E

In 2012 in the U.S., A1 Steak Sauce had slightly over 50% {{of the market}} share for all meat sauce products, and was the category leader. Montreal steak seasoning is a spice mix used to flavor steak and grilled meats {{that was based on}} the pickling <b>dry-rub</b> mix used in preparing Montreal smoked meat.|$|R
50|$|Montreal steak seasoning, {{also known}} as Montreal steak spice, Canadian steak seasoning, or Canadian steak spice, is a spice mix used to flavour steak and grilled meats {{that was based on}} the {{pickling}} <b>dry-rub</b> mix used in preparing Montreal smoked meat. The smoked meat seasoning is derived from pickling mixes used in Eastern Europe or Romanian Jewish cuisine. The primary constituents of Montreal steak seasoning include garlic, coriander, black pepper, Cayenne pepper flakes, dill seed, and salt. The spice mix recipe varies slightly among restaurants and manufacturers.|$|R
60|$|The snow having {{disappeared}} from elevations below 11,000 feet, the yaks, sheep, and ponies {{had just been}} driven 2000 feet up the valley, and the inhabitants were preparing to follow, with their tents and goats, to summer quarters at Tallum and Tungu. Many had goitres and rheumatism, for the cure of which they flocked to my tent; <b>dry-rubbing</b> for the latter, and tincture of iodine for the former, gained me some credit as a doctor: I could, however, procure no food beyond trifling presents of eggs, meal, and more rarely, fowls.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} had not been seen by Linda's eyes for nearly a month, when Peter Steinmarc and Madam Staubach settled between them that the ice should be broken. On the {{following}} morning aunt Charlotte prepared herself for the communication to be made, and, {{when she came in}} from her market purchases, went at once to her task. Linda was found by her aunt in their lodger's sitting-room, busy with brooms and brushes, while Tetchen on her knees was <b>dry-rubbing</b> the polished board round the broad margin of the room. [...] "Linda," [...] said Madame Staubach, [...] "I have that which I wish to say to you; would you come with me for a while?" [...] Then Linda followed her aunt to Madame Staubach's own chamber, and as she went there came over her a guilty fear. Could it be that her aunt had heard of the words which the {{young man had}} spoken to her? ...|$|R

[...] "If she makes a fair start, and there is neither jam nor <b>dry-rub,</b> smack see goes into the water, like a sail let run in a calm; but, if she once brings up, {{a good deal of}} labour is to be gone through to set her in motion again. Now, in order to wedge up my ideas, and to get the story slushed, so that I can slip through it with ease, it is needful to overrun the part which I have just let go; which is, how my father was a fisherman, and how I doubled the Horn--Ah! here I have it again, clear of kinks, fake above fake, like a well-coiled cable; so that I can pay it out as easily as the boatswain's yeoman can lay his hand on a bit of ratling stuff. Well, I doubled the Horn, as I was saying, and might have been the matter of four years {{cruising}} about among the islands and seas of those parts, which were none of the best known then, or for that matter, now. After this, I served in his Majesty's fleet a whole war, and got as much honour as I could stow beneath hatches. Well, then, I fell in with the Guinea--the black, my Lady, that you see turning in a new clue-garnet-block for the starboard clue of the fore-course." ...|$|R
40|$|Higher {{risks of}} food-borne illness {{associated}} with increased consumption of poultry products make it necessary to identify potential sources of contamination and apply intervention strategies that will prevent or {{minimize the risk of}} contamination during processing. This study investigated the effects of chemical and natural decontamination treatments including sprayed application of acidified calcium sulfate (ACS) in combination with -polylysine (EPL), <b>dry-rubbing</b> kosher salt coating and molten paraffin wax dipping application on microbial populations of broiler carcasses and parts. Treatments were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing the numbers of artificially inoculated rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium strain NVSL 95 - 1776 on the skin surface of bone-in chicken breasts. General model procedures were used to find statistical differences (P 2 log reductions) were also observed in validation trials in both pre- and post-chilled samples when compared to non-treated pre- and post-chilled controls. Only for psychrotrophic counts, chilled and post-chill interventions did not have a significant effect (P> 0. 05). The use of molten paraffin wax caused < 0. 51 CFU/ml log reductions on rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium in chicken breasts. In addition, drip loss on kosher treated samples was 53. 8 % lower than non-treated counterparts. However, kosher salt application caused a decrease in lightness (*L values) and yellowness (*b values) on treated carcasses when compared to controls, redness (*a values) were not significantly affected. Results indicate that the combined use of ACS and EPL at the stated conditions and the coating application of kosher salt on broiler carcasses significantly reduce pathogen contamination and microbial indicator loads, thus providing an alternative validated antimicrobial intervention for potential use by the poultry industry...|$|R
