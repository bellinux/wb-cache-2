5|$|Although the {{creation}} of literature was predominantly a male scribal pursuit, some works {{are thought to have}} been written by women. For example, several references to women writing letters and surviving private letters sent and received by women have been found. However, Edward F.

5|$|American captain Robert Gray and British captain George Vancouver, who {{explored}} {{the river in}} 1792, proved {{that it was possible}} to cross the Columbia Bar. Many of the challenges associated with that feat remain today; <b>even</b> <b>with</b> modern engineering alterations to the mouth of the river, the strong currents and shifting sandbar make it dangerous to pass between the river and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{its high}} {{resistance}} to P.cinnamomi dieback, the feasibility of using B.integrifolia as a rootstock for susceptible Banksia species in the cut flower trade is under investigation.
