It {{is considered}} the first and most important of Mexico City's [...] "lungs", with trees that replenished oxygen to the Valley of Mexico. It is a large unpaved area that allows for aquifer recharge, ameliorates the [...] "heat-island" [...] effect, and attracts rain. It is a refuge for migratory birds from Canada, the U.S. and other regions of Mexico, including the red-tailed hawk, the Harris's hawk, wild ducks, geese, and others. Anywhere from 38 to 60 species of birds can be found here, including some native non-migratory species such as the Yucatán canary and a type of heron called the [...] "water dog". There are also more than a dozen species of reptiles and amphibians, and a number of species of various types that are in danger of extinction, including the axolotl, Goodeidae, alandrias, the carpenter bird, and the white-tailed hummingbird. The park is home to a large number of Montezuma cypress, locally called [...] "ahuehuete" [...] trees, with some hundreds of years old. Many of them were planted by the Aztecs. There are also 165 other species, mostly in the third section. It is estimated by city authorities that MXN$100 million are needed annually to maintain the ecology of the park.|$|E

40|$|Tropical {{mountains}} contain unique biological diversity, and {{are subject}} to many consequences of global climate change, exasperated by concurrent socioeconomic shifts. Glaciers are in a negative mass balance, exposing substrates to primary succession and altering downslope wetlands and streams. A review of recent trends and future predictions suggests a likely reduction in areas of open habitat for species of high mountains due to greater woody plant cover, accompanied by land use shifts by farmers and pastoralists along the environmental gradients of tropical mountains. Research is needed on the biodiversity and ecosystem consequences of successional change, including the direct effects of retreating glaciers and the indirect consequences of combined social and ecological drivers in lower elevations.

40|$|Species {{categories}} {{commonly used}} in nature conservation, such as protected, endangered, reintroduced,or invasive, are open to various interpretations that can result in diverging and sometimes serious con-sequences. This is vividly apparent with respect to invasiveness because the categorization of speciesand individual animals as invasive impacts on how they are treated in practice. This article demonstrateshow different constructions of invasiveness in science, policy, and wildlife management can be tracedback to different assessments of the origin, behavior, and impact of the invasives. Specifically, the focus ison the different conceptions of space {{and the role of}} data in the categorization of invasives. We find that,in science and policy, invasiveness is constructed mainly in terms of the origin and impact of invasivesbut that these domains differ in how they treat space in their assessment of origin: whereas scienceuses <b>ecological</b> <b>spaces,</b> such as biogeographical regions, to assess whether a species belongs to, or isinvasive in, a certain area, policy uses policy spaces such as countries or states to do so. In assessing theimpact of invasives, science argues about including it in its definition, whereas policy requires detaileddata about ecological, societal, and economic damage in order to take action. In wildlife management,the focus in the construction of invasiveness shifts from origin and impact to behavior of invasives. Thisrequires detailed data about where the invasives are, where they are going, and what they are doing. By showing the dynamic and context-specific nature of the construction of invasiveness, the article con-tributes to ongoing research about classifications of nature, their difficulties and ambiguities, and theirimplementation and consequences in practice...|$|R

50|$|Competition is {{also present}} between species ("interspecific"). When {{resources}} are limited, several species {{may depend on}} these resources.

As a result, species less suited to compete for the resources may die out unless they adapt by character dislocation, for instance.

40|$|Aim In {{the face}} of global {{environmental}} change, identifying the factors that shape the ecological niches of species and understanding the mechanisms behind them can help to draft effective conservation plans. The differences in the ecological factors that shape species distributions may then help to highlight differences between closely related taxa. We investigate the applicability of ecological niche modelling and the comparison of species distributions in <b>ecological</b> niche <b>space</b> to detect areas with priority for biodiversity conservation and to analyse differences in the <b>ecological</b> niche <b>spaces</b> used by closely related taxa. Location United States of America, Mexico and Central America. Methods We apply ordination and ecological niche modelling techniques to assess the main environmental drivers {{of the distribution of}} Mexican white pines (Pinus: Pinaceae). Furthermore, we assess the similarities and differences of the ecological niches occupied by closely related taxa. We analyse whether Mexican white pines occupy similar or equivalent ecological niches. Results All the studied taxa presented different responses to the environmental factors, resulting in a unique combination of niche conditions. Our stacked habitat suitability maps highlighted regions in southern Mexico and northern Central America as highly suitable for most species and thus with high conservation value. By quantitatively assessing the niche overlap, similarity and equivalency of Mexican white pines, our results prove that the distribution of one species cannot be implied by the distribution of another, even if these taxa are considered closely related. Main conclusions The fact that each Mexican white pine is constrained by a unique set of environmental conditions, and thus, their non-equivalence of ecological niches has direct implications for conservation as this highlights the inadequacy of one-fits all type of conservation measure...|$|R

Although these groups share a common <b>ecological</b> <b>space</b> that could transcend state borders, their interests, knowledge and use of resources within the watershed are mostly disproportionate and divergent, resulting to the activities of a specific group adversely impacting on other groups. Examples being the Minamata Bay poisoning that occurred from 1932 to 1968, killing over 1,784 individuals and the Wabigoon River incidence of 1962. Furthermore, while some knowledgeable groups are shifting from efficient water resource exploitation to efficient utilization, net gain for the watershed ecology could be lost when other groups seizes the opportunity to exploit more resources. This gap in cooperative communication among multilateral stakeholders within an interconnected watershed, even with the likely presence of the usually reactive and political boundary-constraint state regulations, makes it necessary for the institutionalisation of an ecological-scale cooperative network of stakeholders. [...] This concept supports an integrated management style for interconnected natural resources; resonating strongly with the Integrated Water Resources Management system proposed by Global Water Partnership.|$|E
