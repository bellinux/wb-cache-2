5|$|Between 1932 and 1936, the Cipher Bureau took on {{additional}} responsibilities, including {{radio communications}} between military-intelligence posts in Poland and abroad, {{as well as}} radio counterintelligence — mobile <b>direction-finding</b> and intercept stations for the locating and traffic-analysis of spy and fifth-column transmitters operating in Poland.|$|E
5|$|No. 111 Squadron {{managed to}} get into {{position}} above Kenley at 3,000 feet. With luck they could intercept 9 Staffel. Biggin Hill soon took the same precaution of ordering all fighters into the air by order of Group Captain Richard Grice. At 13:10 the German bombers were within 40 miles of the BBC high-power transmitter at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. In accordance with policy, it was shut down to deny the Germans the opportunity {{to use it as}} <b>direction-finding</b> beacon and the BBC Home Service was kicked off air in the process. Using the railway lines, Roth, in the lead Do 17, homed in on Kenley from the south. They were now just six miles away.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the H-11 and H-16 the H-20, equipped with two Jumo 211F-2s, had more powerful armament and radio communications. The defensive armament consisted of one MG 131 in an A-Stand gun pod for the forward mounted machine gun position. One rotatable Drehlafette DL 131/1C (or E) gun mount in the B-stand was standard and later MG 131 machine guns were added. Navigational <b>direction-finding</b> gear was also installed. The Peil G6 was added to locate targets and the FuBI 2H blind landing equipment was built in to help with night operations. The radio was a standard FuG 10, TZG 10 and FuG 16Z for navigating to the target. The H-20 also was equipped with barrage balloon cable-cutters. The bomb load of the H-20 could be mounted on external ETC 1000 racks, or four ESAC 250 racks. The sub variant H-20/R4 could carry 20 50kg (110lb) bombs as external loads.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in the}} Kabaty Woods, at Pyry, on 25 and 26 July 1939 {{with war}} looming that, on {{instructions}} from the Polish General Staff, the Cipher Bureau's chiefs, Lt. Col. Gwido Langer and Major Maksymilian Ciężki, the three civilian mathematician-cryptologists, and Col. Stefan Mayer, chief of intelligence, revealed Poland's achievements to cryptanalytical representatives of France and Britain, explaining how they had broken Enigma. They undertook to give each country a Polish-reconstructed Enigma, along with details of their equipment, including Zygalski sheets and Rejewski's cryptologic bomb. In return, the British pledged to prepare two full sets of Zygalski sheets for all 60 possible wheel orders. The French contingent consisted of Major Gustave Bertrand, the French radio-intelligence and cryptology chief, and Capt. Henri Braquenié of the French Air Force staff. The British sent Commander Alastair Denniston, head of Britain's Government Code and Cypher School, Dilly Knox, chief British cryptanalyst and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the Royal Navy's intercept and <b>direction-finding</b> stations.|$|E
25|$|Type 286 radar {{was fitted}} during 1941, later {{supplemented}} by Type 271 and Type 291, while HF/DF radio <b>direction-finding</b> gear was also fitted.|$|E
25|$|Type 286 radar {{was fitted}} {{early in the}} war, which was {{replaced}} by Type 271 in March 1942, when HF/DF radio <b>direction-finding</b> gear was also fitted.|$|E
25|$|If any south-pointing chariot {{was really}} used for long-distance navigation, {{it must have}} relied (after initialization) on a non-mechanical <b>direction-finding</b> method. It might have been {{operated}} non-mechanically by someone riding in it, as outlined above. Alternatively, if it had a mechanical mechanism, {{it must have been}} frequently re-initialized non-mechanically to eliminate accumulated errors and uncertainties.|$|E
25|$|River-class frigates {{were the}} first Royal Canadian Navy {{warships}} to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter {{in addition to the}} irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and <b>direction-finding</b> equipment improved the RCN's ability to find and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.|$|E
25|$|For much {{of their}} service with the airships, the Sparrowhawks' {{effectiveness}} was greatly hampered by their poor radio equipment, and they were effectively limited to remaining {{within sight of the}} airship. However, in 1934 new <b>direction-finding</b> sets and new voice radios were fitted which allowed operations beyond visual range, exploiting the extended range offered by the belly fuel tanks and allowing the more vulnerable mother ship to stay clear of trouble.|$|E
25|$|In early 1918 {{experiments}} {{were conducted with}} Handley Page Type O bombers, based at Andover and Cranwell, fitted with Radio <b>Direction-Finding</b> (RDF as it was called) equipment for night flying. The intention was to guide British bombers to and from Berlin, and early results led to 550 sets of RDF equipment being ordered by the United States Army Air Service, but the First World War ended before any attempts {{could be made to}} use the system operationally. This was the first attempt to develop a viable long-range electronic navigation system, of a kind that is today used routinely worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Several {{articles}} in the radio magazine Popular Communications published in the 1980s and early 1990s described hobbyists using portable radio <b>direction-finding</b> equipment to locate numbers stations in Florida and in the Warrenton, Virginia area of the United States. From the outside, they observed the station's antenna inside a military facility, the Warrenton Training Center. The station hunter speculated that the antenna's transmitter at the facility was connected by a telephone wire pair to a source of spoken numbers in the Washington, D.C. area. The author said the Federal Communications Commission {{would not comment on}} public inquiries about numbers stations on American territory.|$|E
25|$|Y-Gerät an {{automatic}} beam-tracking {{system and the}} most complex of the three devices, which was operated through the autopilot. The pilot flew along an approach beam, monitored by a ground controller. Signals from the station were retransmitted by the bomber's equipment, which allowed the distance the bomber had travelled along the beam to precisely be measured. <b>Direction-finding</b> checks also enabled the controller to keep the pilot on course. The crew would be ordered to drop their bombs either by a code word from the ground controller or {{at the conclusion of}} the signal transmissions which would stop. The maximum range of Y-Gerät was similar to the other systems and it was accurate enough on occasion for specific buildings to be hit.|$|E
25|$|The Italian captain, ten {{officers}} and 92 sailors were rescued, one seriously wounded, four slightly injured. One Italian sailor {{had been killed}} by shellfire. The seriously wounded man died in surgery during the afternoon and was buried at sunset. The prisoners said that Ramb I had been badly damaged by the shell hits and as Leander closed, the order to abandon ship had been given. Leander sailed eastward and arrived at Addu Atoll next morning. The Italian prisoners were transferred to the oiler Pearleaf, with an armed guard of nineteen ratings and an officer and the ship made for Colombo, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Wireless <b>direction-finding</b> had indicated Axis ships {{in the vicinity of the}} Saya de Malha Bank, several hundred miles south-east of the Seychelles Islands and north-east of Madagascar; Leander was sent to investigate.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, {{the company}} {{expanded}} its electronics capability through acquisitions {{that included the}} Submarine Signal Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles. In 1950, its Lark missile became the first such weapon to destroy a target aircraft in flight. Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air Sparrow and ground-to-air Hawk missiles—projects that received impetus from the Korean War. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, among them the Patriot antimissile missile and the air-to-air Phoenix missile. In 1959, Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Apelco Applied Electronics, which significantly increased its strength in commercial marine navigation and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and <b>direction-finding</b> gear. In the same year, it {{changed its name to}} Raytheon Company.|$|E
25|$|The {{curriculum}} at Ward Island had {{many of the}} same topics at the three ARM Secondary Schools, but with a number of notable differences. The Navy’s airborne equipment was physically much smaller than shipboard and land-based electronics, and had to use the power generated by the carrying vehicle. Also, it was often designed to be operated by either the aircraft pilot or a crew member who had other primary duties; thus, it was necessarily easier to adjust – often including automatic tuning; therefore, lecture instruction included topics to support these requirements. Most airborne radios operated in VHF bands, and the associated antennas and their placement were important topics. Microwave radar, which required less physical space than its VHF predecessor, soon became the dominant feature in airborne applications; this required considerable attention be given to dish antennas and their mechanical drives. Sonar was not included, but there was more attention given to recognition (IFF), <b>direction-finding,</b> and LORAN radio-navigation systems. There were also special courses on subjects such as the Norden bombsight, the magnetic anomaly detector (MAD), and the Target Drone Denny (TDD-1).|$|E
25|$|Bravo and Charlie {{companies}} of 1st Battalion 5th SFG crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges {{to clear a}} path through the sand berms. Charlie company's seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of Nukyab, Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA 534 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab serching for mobile SCUB-B TEL launch sites. Bravo company set out for the central town of Ar Rutba and H-3 Air Base with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio <b>direction-finding</b> facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. whilst waiting, the reconnaissance team fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (whom were clearing suspected east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove {{into the middle of the}} firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of her}} {{conversion}} to a survey ship in 1949–50, the ship was disarmed and her interior was extensively reworked to improve her endurance and accommodations. Her bridge was remodelled to improve visibility {{and a pair of}} echo sounders were fitted in addition to a navigational radar and <b>direction-finding</b> gear. The changes increased her displacement to [...] at standard and [...] at deep load. Her crew now consisted of 82 officers and ratings.|$|E
500|$|Between 1940 and 1941, Alexander {{held the}} rank of Captain in the Naval Intelligence Service, working on radio <b>direction-finding</b> at Singapore Naval Base. She became Senior Physicist and Head of the Operational Research Section of the Radio Development Laboratory in Wellington, New Zealand in 1942, where she {{remained}} until 1945. There she was responsible for most radio and radar research, including pioneering of radio meteorology in conjunction with Washington State College, development of the microwave radar program, and research on anomalous propagation leading to the post-war international project, Project Canterbury. In 1945, Alexander identified the [...] "Norfolk Island Effect" [...] as solar radiation, confirming that solar interference increased with sunbursts. This discovery {{marked the beginning of}} Australian radio-astronomy after she left New Zealand when her contract ended {{with the end of the}} war in 1945. There has been some debate over whether Alexander or Ruby Payne Scott was actually the first woman to work in the field of radio astronomy.|$|E
500|$|As {{it became}} clear that war was {{imminent}} and that Polish financial resources were insufficient {{to keep pace with the}} evolution of Enigma encryption (e.g., due to the prohibitive expense of an additional 54 bombas and due to the Poles' difficulty in producing in timely fashion the full 60 series of 26 [...] "Zygalski sheets"), the Polish General Staff and government decided to initiate their Western allies into the secrets of Enigma decryption. The Polish methods were revealed to French and British intelligence representatives in a meeting at Pyry, south of Warsaw, on 25 July 1939. France was represented by Gustave Bertrand and Air Force cryptologist Captain Henri Braquenié; Britain, by Government Code and Cypher School chief Alastair Denniston, veteran cryptologist Alfred Dillwyn Knox, and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the section that had developed and controlled the Royal Navy's intercept and <b>direction-finding</b> stations. The Polish hosts included Cipher Bureau chief Gwido Langer, the Bureau's German-Section chief Maksymilian Ciężki, the Bureau's General-Staff-Intelligence supervisor Stefan Mayer, and the three cryptologists Rejewski, Różycki and Zygalski.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong {{realized}} that if radio <b>direction-finding</b> (RDF) receivers could be operated at a higher frequency, this would allow better detection of enemy shipping. However, at that time, no practical [...] "short wave" [...] (defined then as any frequency above 500kHz) amplifier existed, due to the limitations of existing triodes.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1943, Viscount {{returned}} to North Atlantic convoy duty.

2500|$|Whitehall {{continued}} on Atlantic convoy duty without major incident until April 1943, when she joined Hesperus, Vanessa, corvettes of her escort group, and the 5th Support Group [...] {{consisting of the}} escort aircraft carrier [...] and four destroyers [...] in escorting Convoy ONS 4. The convoy came under attack by German submarines of Wolfpack Meise. Hesperus sank the submarine , and the escorts damaged other submarines; Whitehall and the corvette [...] pursued a radio <b>direction-finding</b> fix on [...] on 23 April, but were unable to attack because U-732 dived [...] to avoid attack by aircraft from Biter before their arrival on the scene. In May 1943, Whitehall, Hesperus, and ships of the 2nd Escort Group were among eight escorts of the 25-ship Convoy SC 129, which came under attack by 21 German submarines of Wolfpack Elbe on 11 May. The submarines sank two of the convoys merchant ships that day, and Whitehall, Hesperus, and the corvette [...] joined forces to drive off [...] and [...] Hesperus damaged [...] and sank [...] on 11–12 May, while Whitehall pursued two radio <b>direction-finding</b> contacts {{on the afternoon of}} 12 May, attacking one submarine with depth charges and another with gunfire and depth charges without sinking them. German attacks ceased on 13 May after Biter arrived to provide air cover.|$|E
2500|$|While Douglas {{had only}} limited {{modifications}} between the wars, an early change during the Second World War was {{the replacement of}} the amidships 4.7-inch gun by two 2-pounder (40 mm) [...] "pom-pom" [...] autocannon, with the aft funnel shortened to improve the field of fire for the 3 inch anti-aircraft gun. Three Oerlikon 20 mm cannon later supplemented the short-range anti-aircraft armament, while a further two Oerlikons finally replaced the 2-pounders. Radar (Type 286, later replaced by Type 290 and Type 271) was fitted during the war, as was HF/DF radio <b>direction-finding</b> gear.|$|E
2500|$|Ultra {{intelligence}} from decrypted German cipher messages {{had informed}} the Allies that U-boats were operating near Cape Verde, {{but had not}} revealed their exact locations.

Around the edge of the octagon are the remnants of a reinforced parapet, which has long been removed. There are also signs of a Fletton brick wall running westward away from the raised area. The octagonal shape of the base indicates that a <b>direction-finding</b> station operator's hut stood there. It would have consisted of a double-skinned wooden structure in which the cavity was filled with shingle designed to make them [...] "splinter proof" [...] or [...] "bulletproof".

2500|$|The Luftwaffes {{technical}} edge {{was slipping}} away. A front line experience {{report of the}} Luftwaffenbefehlshaber Mitte covering {{the last quarter of}} 1941, contained a myriad of complaints, including inadequate early-warning and <b>direction-finding</b> radar, lack of Zerstörer (Destroyer) aircraft with all weather capabilities and the poor climbing power of the Bf 109. Generalfeldmarschall Erhard Milch was to assist Ernst Udet with aircraft production increases and introduction of more modern types of fighters. However, they explained {{at a meeting of the}} [...] Reich Industrial Council on 18 September 1941 that the new next generation aircraft had failed to materialise, and that obsolescent types such as the Heinkel He 111 bomber and Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber had to be continued to keep up with the growing need for replacements.We are simply faced with the question of whether we are to have no aircraft at all in 1943 or are to have large numbers of aircraft types which hitherto have proved adequate. For this reason I have recommended to the Reichsmarschall that in 1942–43 we should construct the tried and tested types in large numbers.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 January 1942, Volunteer put to sea {{from the}} Clyde with Vanoc, Walker, Witherington, and the {{destroyer}} [...] {{as the local}} escort of the military convoy WS 15 during its passage of the Northwestern Approaches, detaching on 15 January {{to return to the}} Clyde.

2500|$|Some {{sources have}} noted Earhart's {{apparent}} {{lack of understanding of}} her <b>direction-finding</b> system, which had been fitted to the aircraft just prior to the flight. The system was equipped with a new receiver from Bendix that operated on five wavelength [...] "bands", marked 1 to 5. The loop antenna was equipped with a tuneable loading coil that changed the effective length of the antenna to allow it to work efficiently at different wavelengths. The tuner on the antenna was also marked with five settings, 1 to 5, but, critically, these were not the same frequency bands as the corresponding bands on the radio. The two were close enough for settings 1, 2 and 3, but the higher frequency settings, 4 and 5, were entirely different. Earhart's only training on the system was a brief introduction by Joe Gurr at the Lockheed factory, and the topic had not come up. A card displaying the band settings of the antenna was mounted so it was not visible. Gurr explained that higher frequency bands would offer better accuracy and longer range.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1942, Whitehall {{returned}} to the United Kingdom to rejoin her escort group, and was selected for conversion into a Long-Range Escort.
