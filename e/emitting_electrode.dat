The morphology {{and structure of}} the resultant nanofibers were characterized, and the NAP release behaviors were investigated. It was found that NAP dispersed in the CA matrix in molecular level, and no aggregation and dimers of NAP were found in the resultant NAP/CA hybrid nanofibers due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between NAP and CA.

40|$|A {{class of}} {{proposed}} thermionic cooling devices would incorporate precise arrays of metal nanowires as electron emitters. The proposed devices could be highly miniaturized, enabling removal of heat from locations, {{very close to}} electronic devices, that have previously been inaccessible for heat-removal purposes. The resulting enhancement of removal of heat would enable operation of the devices at higher power levels and higher clock speeds. Moreover, the mass, complexity, and bulk of electronic circuitry incorporating these highly miniaturized cooling devices could be considerably reduced, relative to otherwise equivalent circuitry cooled by conventional electromechanical, thermoelectric, and fluidic means. In thermionic cooling, one exploits the fact that because only the highest-energy electrons are thermionically emitted, collecting those electrons to prevent their return to the <b>emitting</b> <b>electrode</b> results in the net removal of heat from that electrode. Collection is effected by applying an appropriate positive bias potential to another electrode placed near the <b>emitting</b> <b>electrode.</b> The concept underlying the proposal is that the thermionic-emission current and, hence, the cooling effect attainable by use of an array of nanowires could be significantly greater than that attainable by use of a single <b>emitting</b> <b>electrode</b> or other electron- emitting surface.

To enhance heat transfer, air cooling of forced convection remains one of the main solutions. For example, conventional rotary-fan air cooling is still dominant in many areas. However, with the increasing of heat generation in these systems, the limitation of the conventional rotary-fan air cooling is become more obvious. So, demands in novel air cooling technology become necessary, e. g., silent and high efficient air cooling. Recently, ionic wind, which has no moving part and is easily miniaturized, shows great potential in heat dissipation and attracts widespread attentions. In this work, ionic wind, which is produced by wire to plate configuration for forced convection enhancement of horizontal flow along the plate, is numerically investigated. Firstly, a multi-physic model, which accounts for electric field, charge distribution, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer phenomenon, is presented.

40|$|Abstract. Amorphous diamond can emit {{electrons}} in vacuum when applied with an electrical field {{of only a}} few volts per micron. It is also extremely thermionic so the emitted current can increase millions times when heated to only a few hundreds degrees centigrade. As a result, amorphous diamond can be a thermal generator or a solar cell. The energy conversion efficiency can have much higher (e. g. 50 %) than that (e. g. 15 %) of silicon based solar cells that can absorb only a narrow spectrum of sun light. As a solar cell, amorphous diamond has another advantage that its radiation hardness is the highest of all materials, hence, its thermal electricity efficiency will not attenuate as does the solar cell based on photo electric semiconductorls. An immediate application of amorphous diamond is to coat it on electron <b>emitting</b> <b>electrodes,</b> such as that used as cold cathode fluorescence lamps (CCFL) that illuminate liquid crystal displays (LCD) for fornote books and television sets.

40|$|One main {{challenge}} {{associated with}} solid-state thermoelectric materials is to combine electron-crystal electrical conductivity and phonon-glass thermal properties {{that are difficult}} to conciliate. A markedly different principle of thermoelectric conversion is based on the micro-thermionic generator that exploits electron injection and heat rejection across two electrodes, hot and cold, immersed in vacuum [1], a promising pathway to new electronic devices. To properly operate thermionic emission converters near room temperature, highly efficient <b>emitting</b> <b>electrodes</b> must be integrated. This naturally motivates the development and characterization of coatings that feature a very low work function, lower than 1 eV. Even better than alkalis like K and Cs, their oxides have been reported to produce work functions as low as 0. 4 and 0. 9 eV [2], respectively. In this paper, to promote material integration, the optimal synthesis conditions of Cs 2 O are first determined from the calculated volatility diagram and appear to be less restrictive than those of K 2 O 2.

In this part II, so-called external charging atomizers, where high voltage is applied to <b>emitting</b> <b>electrode</b> needles, are considered.

Part I dealt with direct charging atomizers, where potential is applied directly to the rotating bell.

40|$|The work is {{concerned}} with the study of ionization and related processes occurring during the transition to breakdown at ultra high frequencies. Electrons are injected into a parallel plate gap through holes in one electrode and drift towards the other under a small unidirectional field. A stronger ultra high frequency field is superimposed upon this drift field to give collision ionization in the gap. Measurements of the number of electrons crossing the gap show that as the high frequency field increases the gap current decreases initially and then rises as breakdown is approached. A theory is presented to explain the initial drop quantitatively in terms of a back diffusion current to the <b>emitting</b> <b>electrode.</b> An extention of this theory to the subsequent rise show that the electron density initially increases exponentially across the gap but as breakdown is approached this changes to a sinusoidal form. A quantitative treatment of the first case is presented. Provision is made to modulate the emitted electron stream with the object of measuring transit times. Preliminary measurements have demonstrated the feasibility of the method. It is shown that, as a consequence of diffusion, the time measured in such experiments is that for the propagation of the pulse of electrons rather than the time it would take individual electrons to drift across the gap. Instabilities and drift of gap current have been traced to the presence of partially insulating films on the electrodes. It is shown experimentally that in combined drift and ultra high frequency fields, the drift field may be progressively reduced by the charging of these films. Methods for measuring film constants and calculating the resultant drift fields are given. Firm evidence is presented that such films are built up by discharges from impurities in the gap...|$|E
40|$|Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) {{thrusters}} utilize ion neutral collisions in air {{to produce}} a propulsive force. The ions are generated at an <b>emitting</b> <b>electrode</b> in an asymmetric capacitor by a corona discharge. This thesis presents a Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) formulation for solving the EHD thruster governing equations {{with the exception of}} fluid flow equations. The problem is two-way coupled and non-linear. A smoothed charge injection model from the literature for the corona discharge is included in the HDG scheme. The formulation is validated against a model problem which has an analytical solution and parallel wire single stage and dual stage thruster performance data from the literature. The model problem consists of concentric cylinders with charge density and potential specified on the inner and outer cylinders. The inner cylinder is offset to test the charge injection boundary condition in an asymmetric solution. The single stage thruster consists of two parallel wires of different diameters separated by a 1 cm gap. The dual stage thruster consists of three inline parallel wires of different diameters separated by 1 cm and 3 cm. The HDG solution for the model problem is found to produce normalized errors on the order of 10 - 3 for the potential and charge density solutions. The charge density applied to the inner emitter electrode is increased over several solution iterations to resolve high charge density gradients. The charge density boundary condition applied to the offset case represented the expected qualities of a corona discharge. The smoothed boundary condition is shown to be tunable to allow for a trade-off between accuracy and numerical stability. The single stage thruster model replicated experimental thrust results within 14 % error using homogeneous charge injection and the smoothed charge injection model requires a less stable setting to achieve similar accuracy. The dual stage model shows the necessity of a mixed outflow boundary condition to avoid non-unique solutions. by Andrew Dexter. Thesis: S.

The desorption rates of electrons and seed atoms and ions (which were given by quoted functions of the surface temperature, the surface degree of coverage, and the electric field at the surface) were related to the appropriate boundary conditions for the governing continuum-type plasma equations in the electric boundary layer.

Both CS circuits were affected by the loading voltage problem. A bootstrapping technique is investigated and integrated with both CS circuits to overcome the loading voltage problem. The research shows that both CS circuits were unable to achieve a high frequency bandwidth (i. e. ≥ 10 MHz) and were limited to 2 - 3 MHz. Alternatively, a discrete components current source was also investigated and developed to achieve a high frequency bandwidth and other desirable performance parameters. The research also introduces a microcontroller module to control the multiplexing involved for different CS circuit configurations via serial port interface software running on a PC. For breast cancer diagnosis, the interesting characteristics of breast tissues mostly lie above 1 MHz, therefore a wideband excitation source covering high frequencies (i. e. ≥ 1 - 10 MHz) is required. Hence, a second type of the excitation system is investigated. A constant voltage source (VS) circuit was developed for a wide frequency bandwidth with low output impedance. The research investigated three VS architectures and based on their initial bandwidth comparison, a differential VS system was developed to provide a wide frequency bandwidth (≥ 10 MHz). The research presents the performance of the developed VS excitation system for different loading configurations reporting acceptable performance parameters. A voltage measurement system is also developed in this research work. Two different differential amplifier circuits were investigated and developed to measure precise differential voltage at a high frequency. The research reports a performance comparison of possible types of excitation systems. Results are compared to establish their relationship to performance parameters: frequency bandwidth, output impedance, SNR and phase difference over a wide bandwidth (i. e. up to 10 MHz). The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate which design is the most appropriate for constructing a wideband excitation system for the Sussex EIM system or any other EIT based biomedical application with wide a bandwidth requirement...|$|R
