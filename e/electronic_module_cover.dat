40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{life time}} prediction of wire bond structure {{in a power}} <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> based on computational approach that integrates methods for high fidelity analysis, reduced order modelling, and life time prediction using reduced order model. This methodology is demonstrated {{for the design of}} a wire bond structure in a power <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> with aim of reducing the chance of failure due to the wire bond lift off in power <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> when a random load is applied to the aluminium wire. In particular, wire bond reliability of the power module related to the thermal fatigue material degradation of aluminium wire {{is one of the main}} concerns. In the power <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> reliability, understanding the performance, reliability and robustness of wire bond is a key factor for the future development and success of the power <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> technology, because wire bond lift off failure ignites other catastrophic failures. The main focus in this study is on the application of reduced order modelling techniques and the development of the associated models for fast evaluation and analysis. The discussion is on methods for approximate response surface modelling based on interpolation techniques using Kriging and radial basis functions. The reduced order modelling approach uses prediction data for the electro-thermo-mechanical behaviour of the power module wirebond design obtained through non-linear transient finite element simulations, in particular for the fatigue life-time of the aluminium wire attached to the silicon chip of the wire in the module. The reduced order models are used for the analysis of predicting the life time of the wire bond structure under random load. One of the widely used cycle counting algorithm, so called rainflow counting algorithm is utilised to count the cycles of temperature profile at the a specific point of the wire bond structure in a power <b>electronic</b> <b>module.</b> Using the cycle results from rainflow algorithm mean life time of the wire bond structure is predicted by a linear cumulative damage model such as Palmgren–Miner rule.

40|$|A modern power <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> {{can save}} {{significant}} energy usage {{in the power}} electronic systems by improving their switching efficiencies. One way to improve {{the efficiency of the}} power <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> is to reduce its parasitic circuit elements. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the mitigation of parasitic circuit elements in power <b>electronic</b> <b>modules.</b> General methods of mitigating parasitic inductances were analyzed by the Q 3 D Extractor and verified by the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements. In most cases, the TDR measurement results closely matched those predicted by the Q 3 D Extractor. These methods were applied to design and analyze a 50 KVA 650 V silicon carbide (SiC) half-bridge power <b>electronic</b> power <b>module</b> consisting of three separate power substrates interconnected in parallel. The layout of this power module was constrained by the existing module housing. The parasitic inductances of the power module substrates were measured by TDR, and compared to those simulated values by the Q 3 D Extractor.

40|$|This thesis {{research}} investigates thermal performance, parasitic extraction and wirebond/encapsulation {{reliability of}} power <b>electronic</b> <b>modules.</b> Thermal performance {{is critical to}} the power <b>electronic</b> <b>modules.</b> As such, thermal analysis {{is an important part of}} the power <b>electronic</b> <b>module</b> design process. Several cases are studied on generalized power modules with a full bridge layout. A database is built based on these results. The studies are performed using SolidWorks thermal simulation tool. The database involves several parameters such as power dissipation, maximum junction temperature, ambient temperature, convection coefficient required to cool the module, size of the baseplate, heat-sink size, substrate size, spacing between dies, and different materials that can be used for the power <b>electronic</b> <b>module.</b> Using this database, procedures to select appropriate parameters in a thermally efficient layout for the power <b>electronic</b> <b>modules</b> are illustrated using examples. It was found that, for optimum performance, ∆T (maximum junction temperature - ambient temperature) should be greater than 125 ᴼC for power modules with medium and high power dissipation. Also, for a low ∆T and high power dissipation, baseplate acts more like a thermal resistance than a heat-spreader. Hence, it is ineffective to employ base-plates for these cases. Increasing substrate size to bring down maximum junction temperature is more effective in higher power dissipation cases than those for medium or low power dissipation. Parasitic extraction for an <b>electronic</b> power <b>module</b> using a time domain reflectometry (TDR) method in the form of differential inductance waveforms was developed. These measured parasitic inductance and parasitic capacitance are compared with the parasitic parameters extracted using a Q 3 D extractor software. The accuracy of the measurement results from these two different approaches is studied in detail. Reliability of wirebonds in the case of encapsulated and un-encapsulated power modules were investigated by subjecting them temperature cycling from - 55 ᴼC to 250 ᴼC. It was found that the solder flux affected the reliability of the wirebonds. As such, it is recommended that the power connectors on the power substrate should be free of flux, as the residual solder flux can affect the nearby wirebonds in the power modules. As expected, the differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion between the power substrate bond wires and encapsulation affect the reliability of the wirebonds. Large diameter wirebonds tend to be stronger and can withstand the stress and strain created by the different material systems in the power <b>electronic</b> <b>modules...</b>|$|R
