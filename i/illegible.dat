5|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s day-release prisoners have {{assisted}} with {{maintenance of the}} cemetery grounds. In Australia's bicentennial year, 1988, a $16,000 grant was awarded for restoration work in the cemetery, at which time some broken gravestones were cemented together, and some <b>illegible</b> ones were 'cut back' and the letters repainted.|$|E
5|$|According to Edward Trollope, {{the oldest}} {{tombstone}} {{in the church}} was from the 13th century; it was faded and <b>illegible</b> when he recorded it in or before 1872. A 14th-century slab, originally for a now-lost effigy, is in the church, and brass plate {{from the same period}} was discovered during the 1853 restoration. Richard Dokke, along with his wife Joanna and son John, are commemorated in a plaque dating to the 1430s, and a plaque to William Harebeter and his wife Elizabeth also dates to the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Five large stelae {{were raised}} in 741, {{although}} {{the name of the}} king responsible is <b>illegible</b> on all of them and he has been labelled as Ruler Y. Calakmul's presence in the wider Maya area continued to wane, with two of the city's major allies suffering defeats at the hands of Tikal. El Peru was defeated in 743 and Naranjo a year later and this resulted in the final collapse of Calakmul's once powerful alliance network, while Tikal underwent a resurgence in its power.|$|E
5|$|Thored {{may be the}} Thored {{who appears}} {{for the first time}} in charter {{attestations}} during the reign of King Edgar (95975), his earliest possible appearance being in 964, witnessing a grant of land in Kent by King Edgar to St Peter's, Ghent. This is uncertain because the authenticity of this particular charter is unclear. A charter issued by Edgar in 966, granting land in Oxfordshire to a woman named Ælfgifu, has an <b>illegible</b> ealdorman witness signature beginning with Þ, which may be Thored.|$|E
5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now <b>illegible</b> text.|$|E
5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely <b>illegible.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, <b>illegible,</b> incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination {{to identify any}} damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{decoration}} {{of the opening}} few words of each Gospel was lavish. These pages were, in effect, turned into carpet pages. The {{decoration of}} these texts is so elaborate that the text itself is almost <b>illegible.</b> The opening page (folio 29r) of Matthew may stand as an example. (See illustration at left.) The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is in a church inventory from 1829, and it says that the stone was <b>illegible.</b> Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, it was still in the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Alcorn first {{examined}} Bushnell's schematics for Computer Space, {{but found}} them to be <b>illegible.</b> He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic and Bushnell's game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball's angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{uncovered}} after Lie's {{death in}} 1912 suggested that Siti Akbari was {{heavily influenced by}} the earlier Sjair Abdoel Moeloek (1847), variously credited to Raja Ali Haji or Saleha. This tale was transliterated by Arnold Snackey, then later translated into Sundanese. Sources disagree on the translator. The documentarian Christiaan Hooykaas, writing {{in a letter to}} literary critic Nio Joe Lan, suggested that Lie's inspiration had come from a version of Sjair Abdoel Moeloek held in the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences Library in Batavia. Biographer Tio Ie Soei, meanwhile, suggested that the version which inspired Lie was translated in 1873 by Lie's teacher, Sierk Coolsma. According to Tio, Coolsma had based his translation off a stage performance and written it hurriedly, such that it was nearly <b>illegible.</b> As he had better handwriting, Lie purportedly copied the story for Coolsma and kept the original in his own collection. The literary historian Monique Zaini-Lajoubert writes that none of these intermediary versions has been found.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternate}} story line, Nemo admits to Anna he cannot swim; the two spend time together {{and fall in}} love. Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping to run into Anna by chance. They finally see one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note <b>illegible.</b> Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone was}} already in a ruined state when Rogberg {{depicted}} the stone in 1763. Rogberg noted {{that it had been}} used as a bridge across a brook and because of this the runes had been worn down so much that most of them were virtually <b>illegible,</b> a statement that is contradicted by later depictions. Since the runestone had passed unnoticed by the runologists of the 17th century, it is likely that it was used as a bridge. In a traveller's journal written in 1792 by Hilfeling, the bottom part of the stone is depicted for the first time, though the artist {{does not appear to have}} realised that the two parts belonged together. In 1822, Liljegren arrived to depict it. A surviving yet unsigned drawing is attributed to Liljegren (see illustration). In 1922, the runologist Kinander learnt from a local farmer that some 40 years earlier, the runestone had been seen walled into a bridge that was part of the country road, and the inscription had been upwards. Someone had decided to remove the runestone from the bridge and put it beside the road. Kinander wanted to see the stone and was shown a large worn down stone in the garden of Eriksstad. However, according to Kinander it was not possible to find any remaining runes on what was supposed to be the runestone.|$|E
5|$|The two 1215 {{charters}} {{held by the}} British Library, {{known as}} Cotton MS. Augustus II.106 and Cotton Charter XIII.31a, were acquired by the antiquarian Sir Robert Cotton in the 17th century. One of these was originally found by Humphrey Wyems, a London lawyer, who may have discovered it in a tailor's shop. The other was found in Dover Castle in 1630 by Sir Edward Dering. The Dering charter is usually identified as the copy originally sent to the Cinque Ports in 1215. (In 2015 {{it was announced that}} David Carpenter had found Dering's copy to be identical to a 1290s transcription made from Canterbury Cathedral's 1215 copy and so he suggests that the Dering copy's destination was the Cathedral rather than the Cinque Ports.) This copy was damaged in the Cotton library fire of 1731, when its seal was badly melted. The parchment was somewhat shrivelled but otherwise relatively unscathed, and an engraved facsimile of the charter was made by John Pine in 1733. In the 1830s, however, an ill-judged and bungled attempt at cleaning and conservation rendered the manuscript largely <b>illegible</b> to the naked eye. This is, nonetheless, the only surviving 1215 copy still to have its great seal attached.|$|E
5|$|Scholars such as Herman TeVelde, I. E. S. Edwards and Toby Wilkinson {{believe the}} {{inscription}} {{of the famous}} Annal stone of Fifth dynasty, a black olivin-basalt slabstone displaying a very detailed king list, argues against {{the division of the}} realm. On the stone the kings from 1st to 7th dynasty are listed by their Horus name, their gold name and their cartouche name, their name banderoles end with the name of their royal mother. The lists also contain rectangular windows presenting year events from the day of king's coronation up to his death. The most famous fragments of the Annal stone are called Palermo Stone and Cairo Stone. On the Cairo stone, in line IV, the nine last years of king Nynetjer are preserved (but most of the year windows are <b>illegible</b> now). The date of Nynetjer's death is followed by a new king. Recent investigations reveal that the serekh of that new king is surmounted by a four-legged animal, not by the Horus-falcon. Since the only four-legged heraldic serekh animal in early Egypt was the chimera of the god Seth, despite passionate disagreement, the indicated ruler is likely to be Peribsen. Egyptologists such as TeVelde, Barta and Edwards do not agree; Peribsen might have not been the only king with a Seth-name. The year events under Nynetjer show increasing references to Seth, suggesting the tradition of a Horus name as the sole name of kings might have already evolved. The rise of a king allied with Seth was thus unsurprising. TeVelde, Barta and Edwards think that, in addition to Peribsen, the rulers Wadjenes, Nubnefer or Sened might have been Seth-kings as well; one of them surely was the true direct successor of Nynetjer. The comparatively large amount of archaeological finds from Peribsen's reign contradict the brief estimated length of rulership, only 10 to 12 years, as presented on the Annal stone.|$|E

25|$|A {{joint project}} with Brigham Young University using multi-spectral imaging {{technology}} has been extremely successful in recovering previously <b>illegible</b> writing. With multi-spectral imaging, many pictures of the <b>illegible</b> papyrus are taken using different filters, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light. Thus, researchers can find the optimum spectral portion for distinguishing ink from paper in order to display otherwise completely <b>illegible</b> papyri. The amount of text potentially to be deciphered by this technique is huge. A selection of the images obtained during the project and {{more information on the}} latest discoveries has been provided on the project's website.|$|E
25|$|Using multi-spectral imaging it is {{possible}} to read <b>illegible</b> papyrus, such as the burned papyri of the Villa of the Papyri or of Oxyrhynchus, or the Archimedes palimpsest. The technique involves taking pictures of the <b>illegible</b> document using different filters in the infrared or ultraviolet range, finely tuned to capture certain wavelengths of light. Thus, the optimum spectral portion can be found for distinguishing ink from paper on the papyrus surface.|$|E
25|$|The Jurchen {{script was}} {{apparently}} fairly widely known among Jurchens, which is attested by numerous graffiti (unfortunately, mostly <b>illegible)</b> left by Jurchen visitors in Bai Ta Pagoda in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} this are {{commonly}} seen on old gravestones, where acid rain can cause the inscriptions to become completely <b>illegible.</b> Acid rain also increases the corrosion rate of metals, in particular iron, steel, copper and bronze.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} coins imitate the drachmas of Emporion or Massalia, {{while others have}} Iberian legends, a few {{of which can be}} related to towns or peoples but many of which are unknown or <b>illegible.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1801 Diamonds {{ownership}} changed. The {{entry in}} Lloyd's Register is <b>illegible,</b> but the {{entry in the}} 1802 issue shows her master as Clark, her owner as Parry & Co., and her trade as London-Africa.|$|E
25|$|Eliza first {{appears in}} British {{registries}} in 1812 {{in a relatively}} <b>illegible</b> entry in the supplementary pages to Lloyd's Register. The table below shows the somewhat inconsistent entries from both Lloyd's Register and the Register of Shipping for 1813.|$|E
25|$|Unlike a typeface, {{irregularity}} in the characters' size, style, {{and colors}} increases aesthetic value, though the content may be <b>illegible.</b> Many {{of the themes}} and variations of today's contemporary Western calligraphy {{are found in the}} pages of The Saint John's Bible. A particularly modern example is Timothy Botts' illustrated edition of the Bible, with 360 calligraphic images as well as a calligraphy typeface.|$|E
25|$|The first {{petition}} {{was presented}} to the Clerk of the House of Representatives on 29 February 2008, who vetted the signatures along with the Chief Electoral Officer. Of 280,275 signatures required to force a referendum, only 269,500 were confirmeda shortfall of 10,775. A number of signatures were excluded because they were <b>illegible,</b> had incorrect date of birth information, or appeared more than once.|$|E
25|$|The {{characters}} must be legible. As calligraphy is {{the method}} of writing well, a calligraphic work must be recognizable as script, and furthermore be easily legible to those familiar with the script style, {{although it may be}} <b>illegible</b> to those unfamiliar with the script style. For example, many people cannot read cursive, but a calligraphic work in cursive can still be considered good if those familiar with cursive can read it.|$|E
25|$|Earlier editions also omitted many of Madison's {{writings}} {{because they}} were <b>illegible,</b> inaccessible, and/or written in code. The PJM project provides {{a better understanding of}} all of Madison's writings by methodically collecting, transcribing, and interpreting even the most difficult of his papers. Additionally, the PJM project publishes some important third-party materials that are known to have passed through Madison's hands and that demonstrably informed his conduct in significant ways.|$|E
25|$|Advances in {{multispectral}} photography have enabled imaging specialists at the British Library led by Christina Duffy to scan and upload images of previously <b>illegible</b> Anglo-Saxon manuscripts damaged in the fire. Images will {{form part of}} Fragmentarium (Digital Research Laboratory for Medieval Manuscript Fragments), an international collaboration of libraries and research institutions to catalogue and collate vulnerable manuscript fragments, making them available for research under a Creative Commons public domain license.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1993, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration used digital {{infrared}} imaging technology to produce photographs of Dead Sea Scrolls fragments. In {{partnership with the}} Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center and West Semitic Research, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully worked to expand {{on the use of}} infrared photography previously used to evaluate ancient manuscripts by expanding the range of spectra at which images are photographed. NASA used this multi-spectral imaging technique, adapted from its remote sensing and planetary probes, in order to reveal previously <b>illegible</b> text on fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The process uses a liquid crystal tunable filter in order to photograph the scrolls at specific wavelengths of light and, as a result, image distortion is significantly diminished. This method was used with select fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls to reveal text and details that cameras that take photographs using a larger light spectrum could not reveal. The camera and digital imaging assembly was developed specifically for the purpose of photographing <b>illegible</b> ancient texts.|$|E
25|$|After college, Smith was {{a junior}} chemist for the National Bureau of Standards in Washington, D.C., {{developing}} standards for butter and for oysters. He may {{have served as a}} lieutenant in the U.S. Army during World War I, but details are unknown. His draft card, partly <b>illegible,</b> seems to show that Smith requested exemption from military service, based on his wife's dependence and on his contribution to the war effort as a civilian chemist.|$|E
25|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was written}} by two scribes (A and B). Scribe B copied only the first 8 lines of page 47 and is not otherwise represented in the Nag Hammadi collection. Scribe A copied all leaves except the 8 lines on page 47, employed several styles, and left some blank pages because the text from which he copied was imperfect or <b>illegible</b> (probably). Scribe A is identical with the scribe of Codex XIII.|$|E
25|$|Other {{objects are}} also {{associated}} with the church from colonial days. The silver-plated chalice is probably and earlier {{one that has been}} “reworked”. There is a sundial to the south of the church either donated or fabricated by Philip Smith in 1717. Five colonial grave markers are spaced throughout the churchyard: in 1963, three were <b>illegible</b> and two were table tombs moved from “Wilmington” (Wilmington, Virginia, is over one hundred miles northwest of Yeocomico).|$|E
25|$|When {{an outline}} font is used, a {{rasterizing}} routine (in the application software, operating system or printer) renders the character outlines, interpreting the vector instructions {{to decide which}} pixels should be black and which ones white. Rasterization is straightforward at high resolutions such as those used by laser printers and in high-end publishing systems. For computer screens, where each individual pixel {{can mean the difference}} between legible and <b>illegible</b> characters, some digital fonts use hinting algorithms to make readable bitmaps at small sizes.|$|E
25|$|The PSFS sign {{has become}} a Philadelphia icon. At the time of construction, {{abbreviations}} were rarely used but architects Howe and Lescaze pushed for their use as the full name would have been <b>illegible</b> from the ground. When Loews announced {{it was going to}} be converted into a hotel, the first question asked by reporters was what was happening to the sign. Loews briefly considered altering the sign by projecting the Loews name on it, but the idea was soon scrapped.|$|E
25|$|It {{contains}} Prolegomena to the Hebrews, {{the tables}} of the κεφαλαια (tables of contents) precede the three later Gospels with very unusual variations, but without corresponding {{numbers of the}} κεφαλαια (chapters) at the margin. There is no division into chapters or sections, no references to the Eusebian Canons, no liturgical markings at the margin. The marginal notes are often <b>illegible.</b> It contains subscriptions {{at the end of}} each book. In subscriptions are given numbers of στιχοι and numbers of ρηματα.|$|E
