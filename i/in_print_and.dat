5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden even when the gyroscopic effects of their wheels are canceled out, the hypothesis that the gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common <b>in</b> <b>print</b> <b>and</b> online.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} stimulated much further work. Generalizations to three dimensions—constructing a sphere tangent to four given spheres—and beyond have been studied. The {{configuration}} of three mutually tangent circles has received particular attention. René Descartes gave a formula relating the radii {{of the solution}} circles and the given circles, now known as Descartes' theorem. Solving Apollonius' problem iteratively in this case leads to the Apollonian gasket, {{which is one of}} the earliest fractals to be described <b>in</b> <b>print,</b> <b>and</b> is important in number theory via Ford circles and the Hardy–Littlewood circle method.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{appointment}} as a judge, Hand became politically {{active in the}} cause of New Nationalism. With reservations, in 1911 he supported Theodore Roosevelt's return to national politics. He approved of the former president's plans to legislate on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and <b>in</b> <b>print,</b> <b>and</b> wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, The Outlook. His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Myron entered Dewey into {{a charity}} pet {{photograph}} contest {{as a way}} to promote the library; Dewey won the contest after receiving more than 80% of the votes. Dewey's win was covered in The Des Moines Register, which led to increased local and state publicity <b>in</b> <b>print</b> <b>and</b> on television, and the library never again made an effort to increase Dewey's publicity outside of the local area. An appearance in the June/July 1990 issue of Country magazine took Dewey's story national, after which eleven people claimed to have been the person who left Dewey in the book drop {{as a way to}} protect him from the cold.|$|E

5|$|Of the two, lateral {{dynamics}} {{has proven}} to be the more complicated, requiring three-dimensional, multibody dynamic analysis with at least two generalized coordinates to analyze. At a minimum, two coupled, second-order differential equations are required to capture the principal motions. Exact solutions are not possible, and numerical methods must be used instead. Competing theories of how bikes balance can still be found <b>in</b> <b>print</b> <b>and</b> online. On the other hand, as shown in later sections, much longitudinal dynamic analysis can be accomplished simply with planar kinetics and just one coordinate.|$|E
