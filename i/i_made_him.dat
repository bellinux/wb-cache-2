25|$|On 21 June 1716, he {{was made}} Baron Cadogan of Reading, having {{recently}} purchased Caversham Park, Oxfordshire (now Berkshire) near that town. He was also made a Knight of the Thistle and, the following year, {{a member of the}} Privy Council. (He was a Whig MP for Woodstock from 1705 to 1716.) On 8 May 1718 George <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> 1st Baron Cadogan, of Oakley, co. Buckingham, Viscount Caversham, of Caversham, co. Oxford and Earl Cadogan. In later years he also served as Master of the Robes (1714–1726), Governor of the Isle of Wight (1715–1726) and Master-General of the Ordnance (1722–1725). However, the Opposition's staunch hostility towards him meant that he had lost any political influence several years before his death on 17 July 1726.|$|E
25|$|He {{received}} several awards from allied nations after the battle. He was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 4 January 1815 and on 21 August 1815 {{he was made}} Knight Commander of the Order of Maria Theresa of Austria and Knight of St George of Russia. On 27 August 1815 the Dutch King William <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> a Commander of the exclusive Military Order of William. At the Coronation of George IV in 1821, Lord Hill bore the Standard of England in the procession from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey. From 1828 to 1842, he succeeded the Duke of Wellington as Commander-in-Chief of the Forces. He was also appointed Governor of Plymouth on 18 June 1830 and became Viscount Hill of Almaraz on 22 September 1842.|$|E
25|$|In 1853, Konstantin's father Tsar Nicholas <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> General-Admiral of the Imperial Navy {{and head}} of the Department of the Imperial navy. In this position, {{he was in charge of}} {{reforming}} a navy that had largely remained unchanged since the time of Peter the Great. It fell upon Konstantin to not only preside over an archaic fleet but also to see it through the disaster of the Crimean War. In the midst of the conflict, his father died and Konstantin advised his brother to search for peace in a war already lost. In early 1856, he accompanied his brother Alexander II to the Crimea to view first-hand the devastation of the War. These early military experiences gave Konstantin a loathing of army life and the futility of war. From then on, he was a man of peace, despite his keen interest in the navy, and in political terms a progressive. There was a close working relationship between the two brothers, which was responsible for many reforms. Konstantin was also sent on a diplomatic mission to Napoleon III.|$|E

500|$|Crossing Bay-Abi {{on these}} {{imported}} Polish mares proved particularly successful for Varian. , the Varian ranch bred nine generations of horses descended from these foundation mares, and stood six successive generations of stallions descended from Bay Abi. The cross produced, among other champions, Varian's successor to Bay-Abi, the 1969 colt Bay el Bey (Bay Abi × Naganka), who was U.S. Reserve National Champion stallion twice, 1977 Canadian National Champion stallion, and a regional champion in English pleasure. At the time, the Arabian industry had {{little interest in}} western disciplines, so Varian competed with her horses in English riding classes. Of Bay el Bey, she commented, [...] "He could easily have been an open reining horse, but <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> into an English pleasure horse because he could do it, he was so athletic." [...] Her English champions also included Bay el Bey's full brother, Mikado, a gray stallion who was a champion park horse.|$|E
500|$|When {{talking about}} [...] "On the Floor", during an {{interview}} with MTV, Lopez said that she wanted a song that would evolve her sound, [...] "it feels like me today, which I like. It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big part of who I am since I started. Since I was a little girl, I just totally connected with the idea of getting out there." ...|$|E
500|$|Kristen Stewart {{was on the}} set of Adventureland when Hardwicke {{visited her}} for an {{informal}} screen test that [...] "captivated" [...] the director. Hardwicke had trouble finding an actor otherworldly enough to play vampire Edward Cullen. Then she got a call about a guy in London. [...] "I looked at a couple pictures and was like, ‘I’m not sure,’?" [...] Hardwicke says. [...] "He had been fired from his last job, he was unemployed, he was in debt." [...] Pattinson flew to Los Angeles on his own dime to read with Stewart. Shiloh Fernandez, Jackson Rathbone, Ben Barnes, and Robert Pattinson were the final four up for the role of Edward. Hardwicke did not initially choose Robert Pattinson for the role of Edward Cullen, but after an audition at her home with Stewart, he was selected. Hardwicke said, [...] "Kristen was like, ‘It’s got to be Rob!’ She felt connected to him from the first moment. That electricity, or love at first sight, or whatever it is." [...] Hardwicke gave him the part, but he had to make a promise. [...] "You’ve got to realize that Kristen is 17 years old," [...] Hardwicke told him, [...] "She’s underage. You’ve got to focus, dude, or you’re going to be arrested. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> swear on a stack of Bibles." [...] Pattinson was unfamiliar with the novel series prior to his screen test but read the books later on. Meyer allowed him to view a manuscript of the unfinished Midnight Sun, which chronicles the events in Twilight from Edward's point of view. Fan reaction to Pattinson's casting as Edward was initially negative; Rachelle Lefèvre remarked that [...] "very woman had their own Edward [...] they had to let go of before they could open up to , which they did." [...] Meyer was [...] "excited" [...] and [...] "ecstatic" [...] in response to the casting of the two main characters. She had expressed interest in having Emily Browning and Henry Cavill cast as Bella and Edward, respectively, prior to pre-production.|$|E

2500|$|As for Hopkins, he {{was upset}} with the {{official}} decision {{and said that he}} was robbed of a clear points win. Hopkins said, [...] "I just really feel like I took the guy to school. I feel like <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> fight my fight, not his. I wanted him to run into my shots. I think <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> do that, and I think I made it look pretty easy. I think I controlled the pace, and I controlled the fight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although many {{consider}} him {{not a part}} of the Battle of the Little Bighorn that is still up for debate. Most of Red Shirt's history has been written down. Living family members of his tell of his bravery in battle. Buffalo Bill Cody was impressed with Red Shirt. “Among the prominent chiefs thus engaged was Red Shirt, a redoubtable warrior and second only in influence to Sitting Bull himself. A short while before his engagement with us he had quelled an uprising among his people, instigated by a pretender to the chieftainship of the tribe, by invading the pretender's camp with only two of his followers and shooting the leader dead before the eyes of his affrighted wife. This fearless act had served to elevate him very much in the eyes of his people, who thereafter accepted him as a leader. When, therefore, he decided to join the Wild West show, under the flattering offers <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him,</b> his influence aided us very much in procuring our complement of Indians, not only from his own tribe, but from others as well.” ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the accused}} mutineers was David Creagh, second officer of the Charles II. He testified that after refusing to {{participate}} in the mutiny—the only officer to do so—he was ordered to return below deck. On the way to his cabin, Creagh encountered William May, Captain Gibson's former steward. May, described by Every as one of the [...] "true cocks of the game, and old sportsmen," [...] was zealously supportive of the mutiny, and Creagh testified of their bone-chilling exchange:I met with W. May, the Prisoner at the Bar. What do you say here? says he. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> no Answer, but went down to my Cabin; and he said, God damn you, you deserve to be shot through the Head; and he then held a Pistol to my Head. Then I went to my Cabin, and presently came orders from Every, that those that would go ashore, should prepare to be gone. And when the Captain was got out of Bed, who was then very ill of a Feaver, Every came and said, I am a Man of Fortune, and must seek my Fortune.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} {{shall not}} tell you a lie. Mr. Dalrymple has asked me to be his wife, and <b>I</b> have <b>made</b> <b>him</b> no answer. If he asks me again I shall accept him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{sit down}} by me {{on a little}} couch that just held two.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> no answer. I sat staring before me, trying in vain {{to devise}} some countervailing thought.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>him</b> my salutations, and complimented him {{upon his}} look of health; for I feared he had perhaps been ill.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he objected, [...] "is an {{impotent}} question. It is not I {{who had the}} moulding of your brother's character. It is not <b>I</b> who <b>made</b> <b>him</b> {{a forger}} and a weakling." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} generous about it," [...] Wingrave {{answered}} coldly. [...] "It is the arrangement <b>I</b> <b>made</b> with <b>him,</b> {{and to which}} I propose to adhere. You understand what I want you to do?" ...|$|R
