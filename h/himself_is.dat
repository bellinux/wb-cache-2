5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation of the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> often regarded as a hero and liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E

5|$|After Blake's funeral, Manhattan {{is accused}} on {{national}} television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues. When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously, Manhattan exiles himself to Mars. As Manhattan {{is one of the}} United States' greatest military powers, his departure throws humanity into political turmoil, with the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness. Rorschach's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian Veidt narrowly survives an assassination attempt, and Rorschach <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> framed for murdering Moloch, a former supervillain, and imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{rebellion}} did not itself achieve lasting success, {{it is commonly}} cited as a watershed moment in Nyasaland history. The rebellion had lasting effects on the British system of administration in Nyasaland and some reform was enacted in its aftermath. After World War II, the growing Malawian nationalist movement reignited interest in the Chilembwe revolt, and after the independence of Malawi in 1964 it became celebrated as a key moment in the nation's history. Chilembwe's memory, which remains prominent in the collective national consciousness, has often been invoked in symbolism and rhetoric by Malawian politicians. Today, the uprising is celebrated annually and Chilembwe <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> considered a national hero.|$|E

5|$|Arthur is {{a central}} figure in the legends making up the Matter of Britain. The legendary Arthur {{developed}} as a figure of international interest largely through the popularity of Geoffrey of Monmouth's fanciful and imaginative 12th-century Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). In some Welsh and Breton tales and poems that date from before this work, Arthur appears either as a great warrior defending Britain from human and supernatural enemies or as a magical figure of folklore, sometimes associated with the Welsh Otherworld, Annwn. How much of Geoffrey's Historia (completed in 1138) was adapted from such earlier sources, rather than invented by Geoffrey <b>himself,</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E
5|$|Bond then {{travels to}} Bangkok to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Siamese {{entrepreneur}} suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured {{and placed in}} Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping {{with the aid of}} Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the fights}} between Troilus and Diomedes from the {{traditional}} narrative of Benoît and Guido take place {{the next day in}} Shakespeare's retelling. Diomedes captures Troilus' horse in the first fight and sends it to Cressida. Then the Trojan triumphs in the second, though Diomedes escapes. But in a deviation from this narrative it is Hector, not Troilus, whom the Myrmidons surround in the climatic battle of the play and whose body is dragged behind Achilles' horse. Troilus <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> left alive vowing revenge for Hector's death and rejecting Pandarus. Troilus' story ends, as it began, in medias res with him and the remaining characters in his love-triangle remaining alive.|$|E

5|$|Ferb was {{originally}} {{going to be}} voiced by actor Mitchel Musso. However, when Phineas and Ferb was picked up as a full series, Povenmire and Marsh chose to make Ferb British and cast Thomas Sangster as his voice. However, they enjoyed Musso to a level that they recast him {{as the voice of}} the character Jeremy Johnson; although Musso no longer voices a title character, his new role allows him more lines. Sangster <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England. Marsh himself had lived in the country for seven years and developed a fondness for the culture and people.|$|E
5|$|In 1654, Rupert {{appears to}} have been {{involved}} in a plot to assassinate Oliver Cromwell, an event that would then have been followed by a coup, the landing of a small army in Sussex, and the restoration of Charles II. Charles <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> understood to have rejected the assassination proposal, but three conspirators—who implicated Rupert in the plan—were arrested and confessed in London. Rupert's presence at the royal court continued to be problematic; as in 1643, he was regarded by Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon) and others as a bellicose figure and an obstacle to peace negotiations; in 1655 Rupert left for Germany.|$|E
5|$|In Albanian folklore, the dhampir is {{the hybrid}} {{child of the}} karkanxholl (a werewolf-like {{creature}} with an iron mail shirt) or the lugat (a water-dwelling ghost or monster). The dhampir sprung of a karkanxholl has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl; from this derives the expression the dhampir knows the lugat. The lugat cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> usually {{the son of a}} lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.|$|E

In Ynglinga saga chapter 5, a heavily euhemerized {{account of the}} gods is provided, where Thor is described as having been a gothi—a pagan priest—who was given by Odin (who <b>himself</b> <b>is</b> explained away as having been an exceedingly powerful magic-wielding chieftain from the east) a dwelling in the mythical location of Þrúðvangr, {{in what is now}} Sweden. The saga narrative adds that numerous names—at the time of the narrative, popularly in use—were derived from Thor.|$|E
5|$|James Graham's {{exploits}} at Waterloo {{became much}} celebrated throughout Great Britain, and many {{accounts of the}} battle make reference to his actions, including a biography of Wellington, the memoirs of another sergeant, and Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words.
