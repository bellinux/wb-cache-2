25|$|In all, Binchy {{published}} 16 novels, four short-story collections, a {{play and}} a novella. A 17th novel, A Week in Winter, was published posthumously. Her literary career began with two books of short stories: Central Line (1978) and Victoria Line (1980). She published her debut novel Light a Penny Candle in 1982. In 1983, {{it sold for}} the largest sum ever paid for a first novel: £52,000. The timing was fortuitous, as Binchy {{and her husband were}} two months behind with the mortgage at the time. However, the prolific Binchy – who joked that she could write as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> talk – ultimately became one of Ireland's richest women.|$|E
2500|$|Guachapins {{greatest}} {{moment of}} glory came {{later that year}} on 18 August 1801. On that day [...] was between Martinique and St. Lucia [...] {{when she saw the}} Guachapin in an unequal fight against a Spanish letter of marque armed with 18 brass guns - 32 and 12-pounders. Heureux sailed up as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> but even before she arrived the Spaniard had struck to Guachapin. The two-hour engagement had cost Guachapin three men killed and three wounded, and the Spaniard nearly the same. The Spaniard was the Theresa, under the command of an officer of the Spanish Navy, and had a crew of 120 men.|$|E
2500|$|While the Vizcaya {{was under}} fire, the Cristóbal Colón had drawn ahead. Within {{a little more}} than an hour, five of the six ships of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron had been {{destroyed}} or forced aground. Only one vessel, the speedy new armored cruiser Cristóbal Colón, still survived, steaming as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> for the west and freedom. Though modern in every respect and possibly the fastest ship in either fleet, Cristóbal Colón had one serious problem: She had been only recently purchased from Italy, and her main [...] armament was not yet installed because of a contractual issue with the British firm of Armstrong. She therefore sailed with empty main turrets, albeit retaining her ten [...] secondary battery. This day, speed was her primary defense.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes--yes--yes!" [...] exclaimed Rose, hurrying {{one word}} on the other <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> and vehemently <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> articulate--"Let us go--let us go to the darkest dungeon--darkness befits us better than light." ...|$|R
60|$|He broke off. They {{reached the}} station, {{but they had}} dawdled on the way, and Philip had barely time to say good-night. He kissed her quickly and ran towards the wicket <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> stood where he left her. He was strangely {{grotesque}} when he ran.|$|R
6000|$|I don't know as {{even this}} would have {{overcome}} Mrs. Quack's fears if it hadn't been for the taste of that good corn in her mouth, and her empty stomach. She couldn't, she just couldn't resist these, and presently she was back among the rushes, hunting out the corn and wheat <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> When at last <b>she</b> <b>could</b> eat no more, she felt so comfortable that somehow the Smiling Pool didn't seem such a dangerous place after all, and she quite forgot Farmer Brown's boy. She found a snug hiding-place among the rushes too far out from the bank for Reddy Fox to surprise her, {{and then with a}} sleepy [...] "Good night" [...] to Jerry and Peter, she tucked her head under her wing and soon was fast asleep.|$|R
2500|$|At a Cabinet {{meeting on}} 3 May 1939, the First Lord of Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, stated that [...] "at {{the present time}} Germany was {{building}} ships as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> but {{that she would not}} be able to exceed the 35 per cent ratio before 1942 or 1943". Chatfield, now Minister for the Co-ordination of Defence, commented that Hitler had [...] "persuaded himself" [...] that Britain had provided the Reich with a [...] "free hand" [...] in Eastern Europe in exchange for the agreement. Chamberlain stated that Britain had never given such an understanding to Germany, and he commented that he first learned of Hitler's belief in such an implied bargain during his meeting with the Führer at the Berchtesgaden summit in September 1938. In a later paper to the Cabinet, Chatfield stated [...] "that we might say that we now understood Herr Hitler had in 1935 thought that we had given him a free hand in Eastern and Central Europe in return for his acceptance of the 100:35 ratio, but that as we could not accept the correctness of this view it might be better that the 1935 arrangements should be abrogated".|$|E
60|$|Lenore nodded and, holding Dorn's arm closely, {{she walked}} as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> down the lane.|$|E
60|$|But Ol' Mistah Buzzard wouldn't {{say another}} word, so old Granny Fox started for home as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> run.|$|E
60|$|For Richard Talbot {{had held}} out his arm, and, as Cis ran up to him, he had seated her on his knee, and held her close to him. Humfrey {{likewise}} started up with an impulse to contradict, which was suddenly cut short by a strange flash of memory, so {{all he did was}} to come up to his father, and grasp one of the girl's hands <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> trembled and shivered, but there was something in the presence of this strange man which choked back all inquiry, and the silence, the vehement grasp, and the shuddering, alarmed the captain, lest she might suddenly go off into a fit upon his hands.|$|R
60|$|He {{kissed her}} for the last time, and was off the next minute, walking <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>She</b> shouted after him, and then seeing there was no use, she dressed herself and pursued him. He never stopped, nor stayed, nor looked back, and still she kept him in sight; {{and when he was}} on the hill she was in the hollow, and when he was in the hollow she was on the hill. Her life was almost leaving her, when, just as the sun was setting, he turned up a lane, and went into a little house. She crawled up after him, and when she got inside there was a {{beautiful}} little boy on his knees, and he kissing and hugging him. 'Here, my poor darling,' says he, 'is your eldest child, and there,' says he, pointing to a woman that was looking on with a smile on her face, 'is the eagle that carried him away.' She forgot all her sorrows in a moment, hugging her child, and laughing and crying over him. The woman washed their feet, and rubbed them with an ointment that took all the soreness out of their bones, and made them as fresh as a daisy. Next morning, just before sunrise, he was up, and prepared to be off, 'Here,' said he to her, 'is a thing which may be of use to you. It's a scissors, and whatever stuff you cut with it will be turned into silk. The moment the sun rises, I'll lose all memory of yourself and the children, but I'll get it at sunset again. Farewell!' But he wasn't far gone till she was in sight of him again, leaving her boy behind. It was the same to-day as yesterday: their shadows went before them in the morning and followed them in the evening. He never stopped, and she never stopped, and as the sun was setting he turned up another lane, and there they found their little daughter. It was all joy and comfort again till morning, and then the third day's journey commenced.|$|R
6000|$|Poor Jo blushed {{till she}} couldn't blush any redder, {{and her heart}} began to beat uncomfortably <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> thought what she had said. For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she {{resolved}} to stay {{and get out of}} the scrape <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> A second look showed her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which lessened her fear a good deal. The gruff voice was gruffer than ever, as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, [...] "So you're not afraid of me, hey?" ...|$|R
60|$|These {{and many}} other {{questions}} rained upon the wearer of the old costume, and she answered them as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, my fine lady, you're {{really done}} for this time,' said the wicked woman, {{and she made}} her way home as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'Where are they?' said an old woman, coming hobbling {{across as}} <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> from the {{opposite}} side of the way. 'Why did you run away from 'em?' ...|$|E

60|$|Mark's happy-go-lucky way {{of taking}} things did not {{convince}} his sister; but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do nothing, <b>she</b> submitted {{and made her}} friends <b>as</b> comfortable <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{managed in}} a very short way," [...] Captain Wilson said. [...] "She hung them <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> caught them.

60|$|She ran on as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> A {{regiment}} of gigantic snowflakes came against her, {{but they}} melted when they touched her, {{and she went}} on with fresh courage.|$|E
60|$|Hot tears again surged to her eyes, as {{she would}} not let him see them, she turned quickly within, and ran as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> up to her own rooms.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next moment}} she had {{disappeared}} in the gloom. <b>She</b> fled <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> dared in the inky blackness of this November night. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> have run for miles, or for hours, away! away from all this sordidness, this avarice, this deceit and cruelty! Away! away from him!! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, you wicked little thing!' cried Alice, {{catching}} up the kitten, {{and giving it}} a little kiss to make it understand {{that it was in}} disgrace. 'Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You OUGHT, Dinah, you know you ought!' she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> manage--and then <b>she</b> scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn't get on very <b>fast,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might.|$|R
60|$|Alice {{thought the}} whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave {{that she did not}} dare to laugh; and, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not think of {{anything}} to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking <b>as</b> solemn <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Bill {{stood up}} {{straight}} and wiped ’is face with his shirt-sleeve and started digging again, and then his wife just put something on and rushed downstairs as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> go.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{give you}} up!" [...] she cried once more--this time quite with passion; {{on which she}} got away from him as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> and left him staring after her.|$|E
60|$|Then Emily sprang up, saying, {{she must}} go. She had walked four miles, {{and she must}} get back as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> Most likely mamma would think her at Spinney Lawn.|$|E
60|$|The child's {{heart beat}} <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> listened to these things. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not understand, {{but she seemed}} to feel far-off things. It gave her a deep, joyous thrill, to know she hailed from far off, from Poland, and that dark-bearded {{impressive}} man. Strange, her antecedents were, and she felt fate {{on either side of}} her terrible.|$|R

6000|$|The lamia ran as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> after them, {{to catch}} them up, {{and when she came}} to a field where people were working she asked them: 'Have you seen any one pass this way?' ...|$|E
