5|$|Zinc {{production}} {{with the}} ISP {{is more expensive}} than with <b>electrolytic</b> zinc plants, so several smelters operating this technology have closed in recent years. However, ISP furnaces {{have the advantage of}} being able to treat zinc concentrates containing higher levels of lead than can <b>electrolytic</b> zinc plants.|$|E
5|$|A second common {{refining}} process is leaching the metal matte into a nickel salt solution, {{followed by the}} electro-winning of the nickel from solution by plating it onto a cathode as <b>electrolytic</b> nickel.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 German chemist Hermann Kolbe {{synthesised}} {{acetic acid}} from inorganic compounds {{for the first}} time. This reaction sequence consisted of chlorination of carbon disulfide to carbon tetrachloride, followed by pyrolysis to tetrachloroethylene and aqueous chlorination to trichloroacetic acid, and concluded with <b>electrolytic</b> reduction to acetic acid.|$|E
5|$|James Hargreaves (1834–1915) was {{a chemist}} and inventor, who, along with Thomas Bird, {{developed}} {{a process for}} the electrolysis of brine using asbestos diaphragms. In 1899, he became director of the newly opened General <b>Electrolytic</b> Alkali Company at Middlewich.|$|E
5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, <b>electrolytic</b> or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and is extracted by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium is extracted by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature <b>electrolytic</b> reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E
5|$|In {{reducing}} conditions, mendelevium(III) can {{be easily}} reduced to mendelevium(II), which is stable in aqueous solution. The standard reduction potential of the E°(Md3+→Md2+) couple was variously estimated in 1967 as −0.10V or −0.20V: later 2013 experiments established the value as /Md2+ Reduction Potential Studied with Flow <b>Electrolytic</b> Chromatography |journal=Inorganic Chemistry |volume=52 |issue=21 |pages=12311–3 |doi=10.1021/ic401571h}} In comparison, E°(Md3+→Md0) should be around −1.74V, and E°(Md2+→Md0) should be around −2.5V. Mendelevium(II)'s elution behavior has been {{compared with that of}} strontium(II) and europium(II).|$|E
5|$|The <b>electrolytic</b> {{finishing}} {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% heavy water, was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first, leaving the heavy water behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99.75% heavy water.|$|E
5|$|Tin(II) chloride, {{also known}} as stannous chloride, is a white {{crystalline}} solid with the formula 2. It forms a stable dihydrate, but aqueous solutions tend to undergo hydrolysis, particularly if hot. SnCl2 is widely used as a reducing agent (in acid solution), and in <b>electrolytic</b> baths for tin-plating. Tin(II) chloride {{should not be confused}} with the other chloride of tin; tin(IV) chloride or stannic chloride (SnCl4).|$|E
5|$|Bismuth {{travels in}} crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, {{until it is}} removed by the Kroll-Betterton process which {{separates}} the impurities as slag, or the <b>electrolytic</b> Betts process. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper. The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi). World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.|$|E
5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, <b>electrolytic</b> reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|Cominco had {{produced}} <b>electrolytic</b> hydrogen at Trail, British Columbia, since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 {{that it could}} produce heavy water. To the existing $10million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon catalyst {{for the first three}} stages while Urey developed a nickel-chromia one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from Trail was used for Chicago Pile 3, the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is a {{component}} of mixed-metal oxide (MMO) anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures, and for <b>electrolytic</b> cells for such processes as generating chlorine from salt water. The fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen, finding use in optode sensors for oxygen. Ruthenium red, 6+, is a biological stain used to stain polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy. The beta-decaying isotope 106 of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors, mainly malignant melanomas of the uvea. Ruthenium-centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties. Compared with platinum complexes, those of ruthenium show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors.|$|E
5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. <b>Electrolytic</b> metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the anode mud of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E
5|$|Sodium forms alloys {{with many}} metals, such as {{potassium}}, calcium, lead, {{and the group}} 11 and 12 elements. Sodium and potassium form KNa2 and NaK. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at ambient temperature. It is excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of <b>electrolytic</b> production of sodium from binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl2 and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl2-BaCl2. Calcium is only partially miscible with sodium. In liquid state, sodium is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolycally on molten lead cathodes. NaPb3, NaPb, Na9Pb4, Na5Pb2, and Na15Pb4 {{are some of the}} known sodium-lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with gold (NaAu2) and silver (NaAg2). Group 12 metals (zinc, cadmium and mercury) are known to make alloys with sodium. NaZn13 and NaCd2 are alloys of zinc and cadmium. Sodium and mercury form NaHg, NaHg4, NaHg2, Na3Hg2, and Na3Hg.|$|E
5|$|The three {{ships were}} the Italian 8,500-ton {{merchant}} vessel Duchessa d'Aosta, the second a large German tug Likomba, the third a diesel-powered barge Bibundi. Duchessa d'Aosta had a working radio which {{was considered a}} threat, {{with the potential to}} provide details of Allied naval movements. Her declared cargo was 3 million pounds of wool, 316,610 pounds of hides and skins, 1.3 million pounds of tanning materials, 4 million pounds of copra, 544,660 pounds of crude asbestos fibre and over 1.1 million ingots of <b>electrolytic</b> copper. The first page of the ship's cargo manifest, was not presented to the port authorities and the ship's captain refused to provide them with any details, which led to speculation it was also carrying arms or ammunition. In his visits to the island, SOE agent Leonard Guise kept the ships under observation, and in August 1941 submitted a plan to seize Likomba and disable Duchessa d'Aosta. Approval for the military operation in a neutral port was given by the Admiralty on 20 November 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{recognised}} metalloids can {{be obtained}} by chemical reduction of either their oxides or their sulfides. Simpler or more complex extraction methods may be employed depending on the starting form and economic factors. Boron is routinely obtained by reducing the trioxide with magnesium: B2O3 + 3 Mg → 2 B + 3MgO; after secondary processing the resulting brown powder has a purity of up to 97%. Boron of higher purity (> 99%) is prepared by heating volatile boron compounds, such as BCl3 or BBr3, either in a hydrogen atmosphere (2 BX3 + 3 H2 → 2 B + 6 HX) or to the point of thermal decomposition. Silicon and germanium are obtained from their oxides by heating the oxide with carbon or hydrogen: SiO2 + C → Si + CO2; GeO2 + 2 H2 → Ge + 2 H2O. Arsenic is isolated from its pyrite (FeAsS) or arsenical pyrite (FeAs2) by heating; alternatively, it {{can be obtained}} from its oxide by reduction with carbon: 2 As2O3 + 3 C → 2 As + 3 CO2. Antimony is derived from its sulfide by reduction with iron: Sb2S3 → 2 Sb + 3 FeS. Tellurium is prepared from its oxide by dissolving it in aqueous NaOH, yielding tellurite, then by <b>electrolytic</b> reduction: TeO2 + 2 NaOH → Na2TeO3 + H2O; Na2TeO3 + H2O → Te + 2 NaOH + O2. Another option is reduction of the oxide by roasting with carbon: TeO2 + C → Te + CO2.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> {{capacitors}} {{form the}} bulk of the <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors used in electronics because of the large diversity of sizes and the inexpensive production. Tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors, usually used in the SMD version, have a higher specific capacitance than the aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors and are used in devices with limited space or flat design such as laptops. They are also used in military technology, mostly in axial style, hermetically sealed. Niobium <b>electrolytic</b> chip capacitors are a new development in the market and are intended as a replacement for tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> chip capacitors.|$|E
25|$|The modern <b>electrolytic</b> capacitor, an {{essential}} component of most rectifier circuit configurations was also developed from the <b>electrolytic</b> rectifier.|$|E
25|$|Applying a lower voltage {{may have}} a {{positive}} influence on <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors. For aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors a lower applied voltage can in some cases extend the lifetime. For tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduces the expected failure rate.|$|E
25|$|Niobium <b>electrolytic</b> {{capacitors}} are {{in direct}} competition with industrial tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors because niobium is more readily available. Their properties are comparable.|$|E
25|$|Series {{connection}} is also sometimes used to adapt polarized <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors for bipolar AC use. See <b>electrolytic</b> capacitor#Designing for reverse bias.|$|E
25|$|The {{electrical}} characteristics of <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors {{depend on the}} structure of the anode and the electrolyte used. This influences the capacitance value of <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors, which depends on measuring frequency and temperature. <b>Electrolytic</b> capacitors with non-solid electrolytes show a broader aberration over frequency and temperature ranges than do capacitors with solid electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|The first solid {{electrolyte}} of manganese dioxide developed 1952 for tantalum capacitors had a conductivity 10 {{times better than}} all other types of non-{{solid electrolyte}}s. It also influenced the development of aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors. In 1964 the first aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors with solid electrolyte SAL <b>electrolytic</b> capacitor came on the market, developed by Philips.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors {{in the early}} 1950s with manganese dioxide as solid electrolyte, which has a 10 times better conductivity than all other types of non-solid electrolytes, also influenced the {{development of}} aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors. In 1964 the first aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors with solid electrolyte (Solid aluminum capacitor (SAL)) appeared on the market, developed by Philips.|$|E
25|$|The {{encapsulation}} {{of aluminum}} <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors is also made of aluminum {{in order to}} avoid galvanic reactions, normally with an aluminum case (can, tub). For radial <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors it is connected across the electrolyte with a non-defined resistance to the cathode (ground). For axial <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors, however, the housing is specifically designed with a direct contact to the cathode.|$|E
25|$|The {{volume of}} an <b>electrolytic</b> {{capacitor}} {{is defined by}} the product of capacitance and voltage, the so-called CV-volume. However, in comparing the permittivities of different oxide materials, it is seen that tantalum pentoxide has an approximately 3 times higher permittivity than aluminum oxide. Tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors of a given CV value can therefore be smaller than aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> {{capacitors}} {{with solid}} electrolyte cannot withstand transients or peak voltages {{higher than the}} surge voltage. Transients {{for this type of}} <b>electrolytic</b> capacitor may destroy the component.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> {{capacitors}} {{with solid}} electrolyte {{do not have}} wear-out failures so {{they do not have}} a lifetime specification in the sense of non-solid aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Standard <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors, and {{aluminum}} {{as well as}} tantalum and niobium <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors are polarized and generally require the anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage.|$|E
25|$|Super{{capacitors}} {{compete with}} <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors and rechargeable batteries especially lithium-ion batteries. The following table compares the major {{parameters of the}} three main supercapacitor families with <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors and batteries.|$|E
25|$|The {{dielectric}} {{thickness of}} <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors is very slight, {{in the range}} of nanometers per volt. On the other hand, the voltage strengths of these oxide layers are quite high. With this very thin dielectric oxide layer combined with a sufficient high dielectric strength the <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors can already achieve a high volumetric capacitance. This is one reason for the high capacitance values of <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors compared to conventional capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the present}} article only refers in essence to {{aluminum}} <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors with non-solid electrolyte, {{an overview of the}} different types of aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors is given here in order to highlight the differences. Aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors are divided into two sub-types depending on whether they make use of liquid or solid electrolyte systems. Because the different electrolyte systems can be constructed with a variety of different materials, they include further sub-types.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> {{capacitors}} with non-solid electrolytes have, {{in terms}} of quality, a relatively negative public image. This is contrary to industrial experience, where <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors {{are considered to be}} reliable components if used within their specified specifications during the calculated lifetime. The negative public image might be, among other reasons, because failed <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors in devices are easily and immediately visible. This is exceptional and not the case with other electronic components.|$|E
25|$|Aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors, {{the most}} common type of <b>electrolytic,</b> suffer a {{shortening}} of life expectancy at higher ripple currents. If ripple current exceeds the rated value of the capacitor, it tends to result in explosive failure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> {{capacitors}} have {{a metallic}} anode covered with an oxidized layer used as dielectric. The second electrode is a non-solid (wet) or solid electrolyte. <b>Electrolytic</b> capacitors are polarized. Three families are available, categorized {{according to their}} dielectric.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> {{capacitors}} {{with solid}} manganese oxide or polymer electrolyte, and aluminum {{as well as}} tantalum <b>electrolytic</b> capacitors can not withstand transients or peak voltages higher than surge voltage.
