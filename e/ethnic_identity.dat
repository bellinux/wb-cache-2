40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to explore how second-generation young adults with foreign {{background}} understand their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> and how they relate to their national identities. Semi-structured interviews with 7 second-generation young adults with foreign background were conducted. The basis for our analysis was social identity theory, identity theory and previous research. As the result shows, the participants in this study had developed an understanding of their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in relation to their national identities based on influential factors. The influential factors that elicited these understandings of their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in relation to their national identities were: influential people and cultural influences. On the basis of these influential factors, it had become easier for some participants to identify themselves more with their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities.</b> However, for other participants, the understanding of their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> did not influence their feelings of belongingness to the host society, which means they have considered themselves to belong to both their <b>ethnic</b> and national <b>identities.</b> For those participants who could not identify themselves with both their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> and relate to their national identities chose to identify themselves with something else, which in this case religion. ...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{process of}} {{emigration}} and immigration in this 21 st century {{has resulted in}} a remarkable population change across national borders. This trend has led to the re-assertion of <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> and the attention on ethnic differences as an important agenda for many societies. Accordingly, <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> have become relevant in how we understand the process of communication between diverse people in this global world. Despite the consciousness of <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities,</b> the tendency to approach intercultural communication through the lens of nationality remains dominant in the field. As researchers are influenced by the idea that “national culture” is shared by all cultural members, utilizing nationality as the unit of analysis often forces researchers to analyse the unifying elements that describe the whole populations and ignore differences between groups. Consequently, such tendency has led researchers to utilize homogenizing views in their analysis, hence simplifying the complex nature of heterogeneous environment where people of different <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> may co-exist. As such, scholars have pointed out that <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> are not fully addressed in the analysis of intercultural communication. This study explores the representation of <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in intercultural experiences among diverse students in a Malaysian university. In-depth phenomenological interviews were conducted with fifteen participants. Two themes emerged from the data analysis that elucidates the intricate nature of <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in students’ intercultural experiences: (i) identifying self as an ethnic being and (ii) encountering differences between self and the other. The central metaphorical interpretation that emerged from this study, that is, “what they do that we don’t do”, recognizes not only participants’ consciousness of their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> that filter their interpretations of selves and the other in their communication, but also consciousness of dissimilar communication behaviours. The findings of this study offer an interesting insight on <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> as it is situated within students’ intercultural experiences. It contributes into thinking through the complex representation of <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> as a framework for understanding the process of intercultural communication...|$|R

5|$|Anson {{argues that}} some Hellenic authors {{expressed}} complex or even ever-changing and ambiguous {{ideas about the}} exact <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> of the Macedonians, who were considered by some such as Aristotle in his Politics as barbarians and others as semi-Greek or fully Greek. Roger D.

Any preconceived ethnic differences between Greeks and Macedonians faded by 148BC soon after the Roman conquest of Macedonia and then the rest of Greece with the defeat of the Achaean League by the Roman Republic at the Battle of Corinth (146 BC).|$|E
40|$|This {{project has}} two {{intertwined}} goals: 1) {{to understand the}} formation of Japanese-Peruvians' national <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> across Peru, Japan and the United States of America by analyzing data from 40 -indepth interviews with Japanese-Peruvians living the United States, and 2) to develop and explain the Stacked Bar Model of Ethnicities and <b>Ethnic</b> <b>Identities</b> as a new analytical system by which to understand the national <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> of migrants. In order to do this, Japanese-Peruvians' <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> are treated as working outside of a zero-sum context and shown to function as multiple ordinal variables that can grow and shrink independently of each other. National ethnic requirements and ethnic othering qualifiers are then identified as ideal types of ethnic traits that govern the identities that are restricted and made available to Japanese-Peruvians in each country...|$|R

5|$|There is some {{disagreement}} {{among both}} ancient authors and modern scholars about the <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> {{of the ancient}} Macedonians. Ernst Badian notes that nearly all surviving references to antagonisms and differences between Greeks and Macedonians exist in the written speeches of Arrian, who lived {{at the time of}} the Roman Empire, when any notion of an ethnic disparity between Macedonians and other Greeks was incomprehensible. Hatzopoulos argues that there was no real ethnic difference between Macedonians and Greeks, only a political distinction contrived after the creation of the League of Corinth in 337BC (which was led by Macedonia through the league's elected hegemon PhilipII, when he was not a member of the league itself). Other academics who concur that the difference between the Macedonians and Greeks was a political rather than a true ethnic discrepancy include Michael B. Sakellariou, Malcolm Errington, and Craige B. Champion.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to being merchants, monks, and government officials, Sogdians also served as soldiers in the Tang military. An Lushan, whose father was Sogdian and mother a Gokturk, rose {{to the position of}} a military governor (jiedushi) in the northeast before leading the An Lushan Rebellion (755 – 763 AD), which split the loyalties of the Sogdians in China. The An Lushan rebellion was supported by many Sogdians, and in its aftermath many of them were slain or changed their names to escape their Sogdian heritage, so that {{little is known about the}} Sogdian presence in North China since that time. Sogdians continued as active traders in China following the defeat of the rebellion, but many of them were compelled to hide their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity.</b> A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War, and Duke of Liang who, in 756, asked Emperor Suzong of Tang to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu because of his shame in sharing the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li.|$|E
5|$|When it {{was first}} raised, an {{auxiliary}} regiment would have been recruited from the native tribe or people whose name it bore. In the early Julio-Claudian period, it seems that {{efforts were made to}} preserve the ethnic integrity of units, even when the regiment was posted in a faraway province. But in the later part of the period, recruitment in the region where the regiment was posted increased and became predominant from the Flavian era onwards. The regiment would thus lose its original <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity.</b> The unit's name would thus become a mere curiosity devoid of meaning, although some of its members might inherit foreign names from their veteran ancestors. This view has to be qualified, however, as evidence from military diplomas and other inscriptions shows that some units continued to recruit in their original home areas e.g. Batavi units stationed in Britain, where some units had an international membership. It also appears that the Danubian provinces (Raetia, Pannonia, Moesia, Dacia) remained key recruiting grounds for units stationed all over the empire.|$|E

5|$|Mongolian is the {{official}} national language of Mongolia, where it is spoken (but not written) by nearly 3.6 million people (2014 estimate), and {{the official}} provincial language (both spoken and written forms) of Inner Mongolia, China, where {{there are at least}} 4.1 million ethnic Mongols. Across the whole of China, the language is spoken by roughly half of the country's 5.8 million ethnic Mongols (2005 estimate) However, the exact number of Mongolian speakers in China is unknown, as there is no data available on the language proficiency of that country's citizens. The use of Mongolian in Inner Mongolia, has witnessed periods of decline and revival over the last few hundred years. The language experienced a decline during the late Qing period, a revival between 1947 and 1965, a second decline between 1966 and 1976, a second revival between 1977 and 1992, and a third decline between 1995 and 2012. However, in spite of the decline of the Mongolian language in some of Inner Mongolia's urban areas and educational spheres, the <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> of the urbanized Chinese-speaking Mongols is most likely going to survive due to the presence of urban ethnic communities. The multilingual situation in Inner Mongolia does not appear to obstruct efforts by ethnic Mongols to preserve their language. Although an unknown number of Mongols in China, such as the Tumets, may have completely or partially lost the ability to speak their language, they are still registered as ethnic Mongols and continue to identify themselves as ethnic Mongols. The children of inter-ethnic Mongol-Chinese marriages also claim to be and are registered as ethnic Mongols.|$|E

25|$|Other {{theoretical}} frameworks {{can also}} explain {{the construction of}} ethnic divergence between Tutsis and Hutus. First, the creation of salient ethnic identities {{can be seen as}} a better mechanism of capturing class resentment on the part of Hutus; layering an ethnic dimension over class identities was a better strategy for mobilizing the masses and legitimizing resistance against upper-class, ethnically different Tutsis. Second, a reworking of Michael Mann’s security dilemma in the Rwandan case produces the “ethnic” security dilemma: Hutus perceived that the Tutsis were forming a distinct <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity,</b> pushed by the Belgians, to legitimize political control. Whether or not this perception was true, as Mann’s classic security dilemma maintains, Hutus responded to this supposed “ethnic attack” by forming their own <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity.</b> In reaction to being labeled the superior ethnic group by the Belgians and in the face of rising Hutu ethnicity, the Tutsis actually accepted and internalized this ethnic label, promoting Tutsi <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> as a defense. This ethnic security dilemma model is a feasible theoretical explanation for the construction of divergent ethnic identities.|$|E
