5|$|Milhouse's mother, Luann Van Houten, {{makes her}} first {{appearance}} in this episode. She was designed to look very similar to Milhouse. Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse, who is voiced by Pamela Hayden. The producers felt that her impression sounded out of place so she ended up using a more normal sounding voice. It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name, Van Houten, which <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> one of his wife's friends.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1850, Thoreau and Channing journeyed from Boston to Montreal and Quebec City. These would be Thoreau’s only travels outside of the United States. It is {{as a result of}} this trip that he {{developed}} lectures that eventually became A Yankee in Canada. He jested that all <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> this adventure “was a cold.” In fact, this proved an opportunity to contrast American civic spirit and democratic values with a colony apparently ruled by illegitimate religious and military power. Whereas his own country had had its revolution, in Canada history had failed to turn.|$|E
25|$|At a {{very early}} ageas young as fiveJesperson would capture and torture animals.

He would capture birds and stray cats and dogs around the trailer park where he lived with his family, severely beating the animals and then strangling them to death, something he claims his father was proud of him for. In the years following, Jesperson said he often thought about {{what it would be like}} to do the same to a human.|$|E
25|$|Although the USA is most {{commonly}} known as the cradle of graffiti, American writers were also influenced by European tendencies. BG138 from Tats Crew confirmed in an interview that Europe was more advanced in some aspects, among those also being the 3D-style and a very cooperative working process – DAIM and Loomit shaped both. DAIM also realized works in Los Angeles and Miami among other cities in the USA. Crome, a writer from Miami commented on getting to know DAIM and Loomit and being impressed by how much planning was involved in their working process. In that way the graffiti could be finished at the location at a much faster pace. After the meeting Crome began to plan his works in advance, too. He also talked about his insights into proportions that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> the Europeans. The writer Pest from Miami talks about DAIM and Loomit bringing the first Belton cans there, which changed the colour palette of the local writers. Freek used the (German) Belton cans only very economically and only as a crowning finale mixed with American colour, because he could never be sure when the next shipping was going to happen.|$|E

He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practise of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of Brahmananda. [...] In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi.

He loved practical jokes, and allegedly kept a halfpenny in his pocket to trick pickpockets. On another occasion he played a joke on the delegates at a Prehistoric Society conference by lecturing them on a theory that the Neolithic monument of Woodhenge had been constructed as an imitation of Stonehenge by a nouveau riche chieftain.

500|$|Jolin's {{time at the}} Academy {{proved more}} {{educational}} for him than the schools he had previously attended and the experience <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> having an established artist as mentor, was important for his development as an artist. Even so, the influence of Matisse on his young pupils should not be exaggerated. Jolin learned croquis at the academy and also developed a natural, spontaneous speed in his brushwork. He mostly painted models and still life, and {{during a visit to}} the south of France in 1911, he made his earliest landscapes. At the school, Jolin got his first nickname; the other students, as well as Matisse, used to call him [...] "The Puppy" [...] since he was the youngest of the students.|$|E
500|$|The couple's {{marriage}} reflected {{aspects of}} their personalities and courtship. [...] George was devoted to Lenore, and tried to bring her a flower every day, often a single rose with a love note. [...] George was also a strong, blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will, but the more self-controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him. [...] The couple quarreled often, so much that their grandchildren would later nickname them [...] "the Bickersons". [...] In the end, their closeness {{would allow them to}} settle arguments amicably, often by her finally accepting what he wanted. [...] She still had a restive nature; Mitt later recalled that, [...] "It always seemed that she wanted something a little more for herself."

Ozy also suffers from annual baldness, usually through either a freak accident or because of Millie. Although it is caused by a gypsy curse (later revealed by Llewellyn to be a myth) which has passed on through Ozy's adoptive father's heritage largely unnoticed, it does affect Ozy badly since he is the first Llewellyn with any hair to lose. Ozy is also quiet and serene, usually playing the [...] "straight person". Under Llewellyn's guidance, Ozy also practices Zen; or rather a humorous version of it.|$|E

500|$|During {{six weeks}} in the studio, the Strokes' gritty sound became the {{emphasis}} of the sessions. The band usually recorded songs only once, based on Casablancas's preference for [...] "raw efficiency". RAT effects pedals and overdriving amplifiers were used at times, [...] "taking sounds, disintegrating them and then bringing them back". The band wanted things to be only slightly stressed, with no heavy-handedness in terms of studio effects; only distortion and reverse echo were widely used. Throughout the process, Raphael improvised according to the reactions that <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> the group. At one point, he {{had to cope with}} the threat of eviction from his Transporterraum studio, but once the Strokes received backing from RCA, time and money were no longer pressing concerns. The label's A delegate initially did not like what had been recorded and felt that the album {{was not going to be}} professional enough. The producer and the band were given complete control only when Casablancas persuaded the delegate by playing him some of the new material on a boom box.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{excavation}} of the [...] foundations began in mid-November 1928 and {{was completed in}} mid-January 1929, when the bedrock was reached. A total of [...] of rock and [...] of soil was excavated for the foundation, representing 63% of the future building's weight. Construction of the building proper began on January 21, 1929. The Carnegie Steel Company provided the steel beams, {{the first of which}} was installed on March 27, and by April 9, the first upright beams had been set into place. The steel structure was [...] "a few floors" [...] high by June 1929, but the frame was at 35 floors by by early August and completed by September. Despite a frantic steelwork construction pace of about four floors per week, no workers died during the construction of the skyscraper's steelwork. Chrysler lauded this achievement, saying, [...] "It {{is the first time that}} any structure in the world has reached such a height, yet the entire steel construction was accomplished without loss of life". In total, 391,881 rivets were used and approximately 3,826,000 bricks were manually laid, to create the non-loadbearing walls of the skyscraper. Walter Chrysler personally financed the construction through the income <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> his car company. The Chrysler Building's height officially surpassed the Woolworth's on October 16, 1929, thereby becoming the world's tallest structure.|$|E
500|$|Green recounted [...] "a strong energy" [...] that Binky Brown {{drew from}} his readership, the first {{significant}} response <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>from</b> his work. [...] The story has had a wide influence on underground and alternative comics, where its self-mocking and confessional approach has inspired numerous cartoonists to expose intimate and embarrassing details of their lives. [...] Under the influence of Binky Brown, in 1972 Aline Kominsky published her first strip, the autobiographical [...] "Goldie: A Neurotic Woman" [...] in Wimmen's Comix [...] [...] Other contemporary underground cartoonists were soon to incorporate confessional autobiography into their work. [...] Robert Crumb followed the same year with [...] "The Confessions of R. Crumb" [...] and continued with numerous other such strips. [...] Art Spiegelman, who had seen Binky Brown in mid-creation in 1971, {{went as far as}} to state that [...] "without Binky Brown there would be no Maus"—Spiegelman's most prominent work. [...] The same year as Binky Browns publication, Green asked Spiegelman to contribute a three-page strip to the first issue of Funny , which Green edited and was published by Apex Novelties. Spiegelman delivered the three-page [...] "Maus" [...] in which Nazi cats persecute Jewish mice, inspired by his father's experiences in the Auschwitz concentration camp; years later he revisited the theme in the graphic novel of the same name. [...] Comics critic Jared Gardner asserts that, while underground [...] was associated with countercultural iconoclasm, the movement's most enduring legacy was to be autobiography.|$|E

[...] Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until Andy calls him to say that he cannot make it until the next Friday.
