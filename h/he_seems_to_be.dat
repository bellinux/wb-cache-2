5|$|A {{character}} named Michael {{was introduced}} in Sister Location, whose identity and motives are currently unknown. The character {{was introduced in}} a cutscene, in which <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> speaking to his father.|$|E
5|$|High {{states that}} {{afterward}} Skaði {{went back up}} to the mountains to Þrymheimr and recites a stanza where Skaði skis around, hunts animals with a bow, and lives in her fathers old house. Chapter 24 begins, which describes Njörðr as the father of two beautiful and powerful children: Freyr and Freyja. In chapter 37, after Freyr has spotted the beautiful jötunn Gerðr, he becomes overcome with sorrow, and refuses to sleep, drink, or talk. Njörðr then sends for Skírnir to find out who <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so angry at, and, not looking forward to being treated roughly, Skírnir reluctantly goes to Freyr.|$|E
5|$|A {{short while}} {{later at the}} Andronikov Monastery, a {{messenger}} arrives from Moscow to ask Andrei for his assistance in decorating the Annunciation Cathedral with Theophanes the Greek. Both Daniil and Kirill are agitated by the recognition that Andrei receives. Daniil refuses to accompany Andrei and reproaches him for accepting Theophanes’ offer without considering his fellows, but soon repents of his temper and tearfully wishes Andrei well when the younger monk comes {{to say goodbye to}} his friend. Kirill is jealous of Andrei and in a fit of anger, decides to leave the monastery for the secular world, throwing accusations of greed in the face of his fellow monks, who also dismiss him. Kirill stumbles out of the monastery into the snowy countryside and is pursued by his dog, but Kirill savagely beats it with his walking stick and leaves it for dead. Andrei leaves for Moscow with his young apprentice Foma (Mikhail Kononov). Foma is another creative character, representing the light-hearted and practical-minded commercial artist. Still <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> contemplative enough to get along with Andrei.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{carrying}} out the joke pretty thoroughly, I thought.|$|R
60|$|He trembled violently. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> labouring {{under some}} great excitement.|$|R
60|$|Hunterleys made no {{immediate}} reply. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considering the name.|$|R
5|$|Lyle spots {{an unknown}} person {{running away from}} them in the subway and the team follows. When the group {{approaches}} {{the spot where the}} train lost power, Melnick starts crying out in pain. Visible electrical flashes start destroying the skin on his left arm. Scully tells Doggett to pour water on it, which stops the flashes. Lyle takes the badly injured Melnick to the surface and Doggett continues onward with Bianco. When Melnick returns to the surface, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> getting worse, but Lyle appears healthy. Scully then sees the three bodies being taken away by non-CDC hazmat people. When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect the bodies and accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC.|$|E
25|$|What <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{describing}} is {{an agricultural}} country that uses barns for threshing grain {{rather than the}} Mediterranean outside floor of sun-baked mud and manufactures a drink, possibly mead.|$|E
25|$|Hamlet: the Prince of Denmark, nephew to Claudius. Throughout {{the play}} <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{putting on a}} {{different}} face for different people much as he does in Shakespeare's work.|$|E
60|$|Then came a pause while <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{struggling}} with himself.|$|R
60|$|He patted Aaron affectionately; <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the older}} of the two.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{measuring}} the distance across {{the park with}} his eyes.|$|R
25|$|Dr Kenneth: The {{longtime}} {{doctor of}} Gimmerton {{and a friend}} of Hindley's who is present at the cases of illness during the novel. Although not much of his character is known, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a rough but honest person.|$|E
25|$|David Kronke, The Daily News of Los Angeles (April 22, 2001) — Nero Wolfe, alas, is {{undone by}} uneven {{performances}} {{and a sense}} that it's more witty and urbane than it really is. Hutton is too antic — <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing the sassy newsroom copy boy in a '30s B-picture — and his narration tries far too hard to push jokes that just aren't funny. Maury Chaykin, a normally reliable character actor, is alternately flat or rudderlessly blustery as Wolfe.|$|E
25|$|Kris Marshall (2000–05) portrays Nick Harper. Nick Harper is {{the oldest}} sibling. He is a {{complete}} layabout who is constantly changing jobs – a self-employed stuntman one minute, a gorilla-o-gram the next, at one point a sperm-donor. Extremely laid-back, Nick cannot be trusted to look after money or handle important tasks. He was last seen moving into his own flat, and from phone conversations Ben and Susan have with him, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> coping with living on his own.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Beale grinned affably. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{a man of}} equable temperament.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Waddington hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{feeling the}} shame of these avowals.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{was very}} grave. He ate slowly, and <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thinking.|$|R
25|$|Edgar Derby: A {{middle-aged man}} who has pulled strings {{to be able to}} fight in the war. He was a high school teacher who felt that he needed to {{participate}} rather than just sending off his students to fight. Though relatively unimportant, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only American before the bombing of Dresden to understand what war can do to people. German forces summarily execute him for looting. Vonnegut has said that this death is the climax of the book as a whole.|$|E
25|$|Phooka- On {{their way}} to the elves, the Grace kids find a phooka, a shapeshifter {{resembling}} a cross between a monkey and a black cat. It sits in a tree branch, talks in riddles and plays with its body shape in a way resembling the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland. Although he doesn't seem {{to be related to the}} elves nor to Mulgarath and his army, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of the destiny of Arthur Spiderwick and his nephews, giving them advice in riddles.|$|E
25|$|His {{best friend}} is Mungyeong Seong, who goes to school with him and Fanta. Ryang was held back a year because he missed too much school, for a reason {{that has not been}} {{disclosed}} yet, but <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a decent student. He is fairly athletic as well, as he is an extremely fast runner and good skateboarder. It is said that Ryang has no problem attracting girls, something that would get him into trouble later on. As for Ryang himself, {{there are more and more}} hints that he is attracted to Fanta.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{busy with}} the horses, and Berenger could not catch his eye.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{waking up}} by degrees from that trance, and waking up calmed.|$|R
60|$|The expert <b>was</b> silent. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thinking. The other {{watched his}} face, humbly.|$|R
25|$|Captain Jaggery – Captain Jaggery {{at first}} appears to Charlotte, the narrator, {{as a true}} gentleman, stylishly dressed and {{possessing}} elegant manners. <b>He</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a man who she can trust and depend upon, even though he warns her that he will, at times, be compelled to treat the crew harshly. He later reveals himself as cruel and petty. He loses his temper easily and flies into violent rages. It turns {{out that he was}} charming to Charlotte only to make use of her, and is willing to kill anyone, such as Hollybrass, who threatens his position as captain.|$|E
25|$|Probably Delacroix's best-known painting, Liberty Leading the People is {{an unforgettable}} image of Parisians, having taken up arms, marching forward {{under the banner}} of the tricolour {{representing}} liberty, equality, and fraternity. Although Delacroix was inspired by contemporary events to invoke this romantic image of the spirit of liberty, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> trying to convey the will and character of the people, rather than glorifying the actual event, the 1830 revolution against Charles X, which did little other than bring a different king, Louis-Philippe, to power. The warriors lying dead in the foreground offer poignant counterpoint to the symbolic female figure, who is illuminated triumphantly, as if in a spotlight.|$|E
25|$|Underneath the bay on the {{far left}} is the bronze statue of Perseus by Benvenuto Cellini. It shows the mythical Greek hero holding his sword in his right hand and holding up the Medusa's severed head in his left. The well-proportioned muscular body of Perseus stands poised on the right leg. Perseus is {{reflecting}} and <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> frightened by his same action. Blood is gushing from the head and the neck of the dead Medusa. The richly decorated marble pedestal, also by Cellini, shows four graceful bronze statuettes of Jupiter, Mercurius, Minerva and Danaë. The bas-relief on the pedestal, representing Perseus freeing Andromeda, is a copy of the one in Bargello.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} Wally said nothing. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> digesting what <b>he</b> had heard.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} it as it receded. Then <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> staring at distant things.|$|R
60|$|He <b>was</b> unable <b>to</b> {{disentangle}} {{thoughts from}} words. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> speaking in his mind.|$|R
25|$|His {{description}} of aqueduct construction includes {{the way they}} are surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed, although Frontinus (a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many aqueducts of Rome), writing a century later, gives much more detail of the practical problems involved in their construction and maintenance. Surely Vitruvius' book would have been of great assistance in this. Vitruvius was writing in the 1st century BC when many of the finest Roman aqueducts were built, and survive to this day, such as those at Segovia and the Pont du Gard. The use of the inverted siphon is described in detail, together with the problems of high pressures developed in the pipe {{at the base of the}} siphon, a practical problem with which <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> acquainted.|$|E
25|$|By 1747, single wicket had {{superseded}} the 11-a-side version as {{the most}} popular form of cricket and the 1748 season was the halcyon days of single wicket. Richmond {{made the most of}} it and his Slindon fives and threes were a regular feature of the great matches at the Artillery Ground. However, Newland did not always captain his team in 1747. There was a threes match in September in which he was again opposed by his rival Colchin, but the captaincy of his side had been given to Stephen Dingate, who was a regular fixture in Richmond's teams at this time. This could be evidence that Newland was past his best. In July 1747, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reconciled with Colchin because for the first time they played on the same side but, significantly, it was Long Robin's XI that Newland was playing for. In 1749, Newland was a member of an All-England team captained by Colchin.|$|E
25|$|Scrooge has a nasty {{temper and}} rarely hesitates to use cartoon {{violence}} {{against those who}} provoke his ire (often his nephew Donald, but also bill and tax collectors as well as door-to-door salesmen); however, <b>he</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{against the use of}} lethal force. On occasion, he has even saved the lives of enemies who had threatened his own life but were in danger of losing their own. According to Scrooge's own explanation, this is to save himself from feelings of guilt over their deaths; he generally awaits no gratitude from them. Scrooge has also opined that only in fairy tales do bad people turn good, and that he is old enough to not believe in fairy tales. Scrooge believes in keeping his word—never breaking a promise once given. In Italian-produced stories of the 1950s to 1970s, however, particularly those written by Guido Martina, Scrooge often acts differently from in American or Danish comics productions.|$|E
60|$|The Colonel {{was silent}} for a few moments. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{reflecting}} on Heneage's words.|$|R
60|$|The doctor did {{not reply}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{thinking}} out some problem.|$|R
60|$|Thus encouraged, {{our hero}} began by {{remarking}} that <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{preparing for a}} trip.|$|R
