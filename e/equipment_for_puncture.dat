40|$|Abstract — Accurate {{analysis}} of (non-punctured) convolutional codes using the state diagram and transfer function has been well-established; but <b>for</b> <b>punctured</b> convolutional codes, approximation {{has been the}} typical treatment. This paper discusses {{a simple way to}} derive the exact state diagram and transfer function of a punctured convolutional code. The key is to represent the punctured code in an equivalent closedform form. It is shown that such a representation is always possible and that the new code typically has the same or fewer number of states. Implications and applications of this finding on performance bounds, puncturing pattern design, decoder implementation <b>for</b> <b>punctured</b> convolutional and punctured turbo codes are also discussed.
