The committee's questioning of their next witness, EC publisher William Gaines, focused on violent scenes of the type Wertham had described. Though the committee's final report did not blame comics for crime, it recommended that the comics industry tone down its content voluntarily. Publishers then developed the self-censorship Comics Code Authority.|$|E

Webb then composed and recorded each song's instrumental track at Noisegate Studios, hewing as closely as possible to the style of the genre or artist in question. The finished vocal and backing tracks were later returned to Noisegate for post-production by Webb and colleague Matt Katz.|$|E
