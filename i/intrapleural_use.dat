30|$|We {{found that}} a proenzyme, single chain {{urokinase}} plasminogen activator, scuPA, effectively clears pleural adhesions and removes organizing fibrinous material from the pleural space [8 – 10]. In both pleural and airway fluids, scuPA was found to form bioactive complexes with α-macroglobulins (αM), which are resistant to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1) and durably release low levels of active plasminogen activator [11, 12]. Over a 20  years preclinical experience [13], now extended by good laboratory practices (GLP) toxicology done {{with support from the}} National Heart Lung and Blood Institute SMARTT Program (Contract HHSN 268201100014 C), we found that <b>intrapleural</b> <b>use</b> of relatively large doses of intrapleural scuPA were well-tolerated preclinically and did not cause systemic fibrinogenolysis or serious bleeding complications. Based upon these findings, we postulated that scuPA could be advantageous for nebulized delivery to the airway, that it could clear airway casts effectively, improve outcomes and that it would mitigate the risk for local bleeding complications. We used our established model of ISIALI in sheep to test this postulate and compare efficacy and safety outcomes versus those {{associated with the use of}} nebulized tPA; activase/alteplase, a commercially available plasminogen activator, or vehicle.|$|E
40|$|Complicated pleural effusions and empyema with loculation {{and failed}} {{drainage}} are common clinical problems. In adults, intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT) {{is commonly used}} with variable results, and therapy remains empiric. Despite the <b>intrapleural</b> <b>use</b> of various plasminogen activators (PAs) - fibrinolysins - for about 60 years, {{there is no clear}} consensus about which agent is most effective. Emerging evidence demonstrates that intrapleural administration of PAs is subject to rapid inhibition by PA inhibitor- 1 and that processing of fibrinolysins is significantly influenced by other factors, including the levels and quality of pleural fluid DNA. Current therapy for loculation that accompanies pleural infections also includes surgery, which is invasive and for which patient selection can be problematic. Most of the clinical literature published to date has used flat dosing of IPFT in all subjects, but little is known about how that strategy influences the processing of the administered fibrinolysin or how this influences outcomes. We developed a new test of pleural fluids ex vivo, which is called the fibrinolytic potential, in which a dose of a fibrinolysin is added to pleural fluids ex vivo after which the fibrinolytic activity is measured and normalized to baseline levels. Testing in preclinical and clinical empyema fluids reveals a wide range of responses, indicating that individual patients will likely respond differently to flat dosing of fibrinolysins. The test remains under development but is envisioned as a guide for dosing of these agents, representing a novel candidate approach to personalization of IPFT...|$|E

40|$|Mohamed A Hendaus, Ahmad Abushahin Department of Pediatrics, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar Background: Intrapleural fibrinolytics {{have been}} used {{successfully}} worldwide {{for the management of}} complicated pleural effusions and empyema. Bleeding complications are usually mentioned as rare side effects, but there is no clear information in the literature addressing the alarming outcome that might result following the use of alteplase as a fibrinolytic in the management of complicated parapneumonic effusions. We present a rare, if not unique, case of intrapleural hemorrhage requiring transfusion after alteplase use as a fibrinolytic in a 6 -year-old male with complicated parapneumonic effusion. Methods: A search of the PubMed database was carried out, using a combination of the following terms: alteplase, fibrinolytic, intrapleural hemorrhage, and side effects. Results: The majority of studies found in the search concentrated on the efficacy of intrapleural fibrinolytics in the management of pleural effusion, but very few of the reports addressed the bleeding complications which may be caused by the treatment. Conclusion: Although intrapleural and systemic hemorrhage are rare side effects of <b>intrapleural</b> fibrinolytic <b>use,</b> the health care provider must be watchful for these potentially life-threatening complications. Further studies are needed to understand not only the efficacy of fibrinolytics but also their safety, especially in children.

40|$|Pleural empyema is an {{important}} entity in thoracic surgery with poor prognosis unless treated properly. It can cause sepsis and other complications which may increase morbidity and mortality. The treatment of choices in pleural empyema are thoracentesis, intercostal tube or pleural catheter drainage, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open surgery (1, 2). Tube drainage often fails if the empyema is loculated with fibrinous adhesions, hence surgical treatment becomes necessary. Enzymatic debridement <b>using</b> <b>intrapleural</b> instillation of streptokinase is a minimally invasive option for loculated empyema and an alternative approach to surgery. Herein we report two patients with multiloculated pleural empyema in which we performed intrapleural streptokinase with favourable outcome. Case Reports Case 1. 16 year-old boy who had undergone left posterolateral thoracotomy and lower lobectomy with the diagnosis of bronchiectasis four months previously. The patient was admitted to our clinic with cough and high feve...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hepatic {{hydrothorax}} {{is defined}} as a significant pleural effusion in patients with liver cirrhosis and without underlying cardiopulmonary diseases. Treatment of hepatic hydrothorax remains a challenge at present. Methods: Herein we share our experiences in the treatment of 12 patients with hepatic hydrothorax by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Repair of the diaphragmatic defects, or pleurodesis by focal pleurectomy, talc spray, mechanical abrasion, electro-cauterization or injection was administered intraoperatively, and tetracycline <b>intrapleural</b> injection was <b>used</b> postoperatively for patients with prolonged (> 7 d) high-output (> 300 ml/d) pleural effusion. Results: Out of the 12 patients, 8 (67 %) had uneventful postoperative course and did not require tube for drainage more than 3 months after discharge. In 4 (33 %) patients the pleural effusion still recurred after discharge due to end-stage cirrhosis with massive ascites. Conclusion: We conclude that the repair of the diaphragmatic defect and pleurodesis through VATS could be an alternative of transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic shunt (TIPS) or a bridge to liver transplantation for patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax. Pleurodesis with electrocauterization can be an alternative therapy if talc is unavailable...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Significant {{morbidity}} and mortality result from the ineffective evacuation of empyema. Failure of conventional first line treatment with closed intercostal tube drainage and antibiotic therapy may result in fibrin deposition and loculated empyema. Enzymatic debridement <b>using</b> <b>intrapleural</b> instillation of streptokinase is a non-invasive therapeutic option which may obviate the need for surgical intervention. METHODS [...] Eleven adults with multiloculated post-pneumonic empyemas who had failed {{to respond satisfactorily to}} intercostal tube drainage and antibiotic therapy were treated with intrapleural streptokinase between November 1992 and January 1994. A small catheter was inserted under ultrasound guidance into a loculation within the pleural space. Aliquots of 250, 000 units of streptokinase in 100 ml normal saline were instilled into the pleural cavity and the tube clamped for four hours. Response was assessed by clinical outcome, measurement of drain output after unclamping, and subsequent pleural ultrasound, chest radiography, or both. RESULTS [...] Streptokinase enhanced drainage in all patients. Complete resolution of the empyema with re-expansion of the underlying lung was effected in eight patients, all of whom remain well. Further resolution of minimal pleural thickening was shown on subsequent chest radiographs. Two patients with considerably thickened visceral pleura following empyema drainage underwent successful decortication. The other, with myocarditis and a pyopneumothorax, underwent surgery for non-resolution of the pneumothorax but died perioperatively from cardiac failure. The number of streptokinase instillations per patient ranged from two to six (median three), and the volume of empyema fluid drained per patient ranged from 100 ml to 4870 ml (median 900 ml). Streptokinase was well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSIONS [...] Intrapleural streptokinase is an effective adjunct in the management of complicated empyema and may reduce the need for surgery...|$|R
