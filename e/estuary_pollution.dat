40|$|The Princeton Ocean Model is used {{to study}} the {{circulation}} in the Pear River Estuary (PRE) and the adjacent coastal waters {{in the winter and}} summer seasons. Wong et al. [2003] compares the simulation results with the in situ measurements collected during the Pearl River <b>Estuary</b> <b>Pollution</b> Project (PREPP). In this paper, sensitivity experiments are carried out to examine the plume and the associated frontal dynamics in response to seasonal discharges and monsoon winds. During the winter, convergence between the seaward spreading plume water and the saline coastal water sets up a salinity front that aligns from the northeast to the southwest inside the PRE. During the summer the plume water fills the PRE at the surface and spreads eastward in the coastal waters in response to the prevailing southwesterly monsoon. The overall alignment of the plume is from the northwest to the southeast. The subsurface front is similar to that in the winter and summer except that the summer front is closer to the mouth and the winter front closer {{to the head of the}} estuary. Inside the PRE, bottom flows are always toward the head of the estuary, attributed to the density gradient associated with the plume front. In contrast, bottom flows in the shelf change from offshore in winter to onshore in summer, reflecting respectively the wintertime downwelling and summertime upwelling. Wind also plays an essential role in controlling the plume at the surface. An easterly wind drives the plume westward regardless winter or summer. The eastward spreading of the plume during the summer can be attributed to the southerly component of the wind. On the other hand, the surface area of the plume is positively proportional to the amount of discharge...|$|E

The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust provided HK$ 18 (or US$ 2. 3) million for a three-year period (January 1999 to December 2001, later extended to June 2002). PREPP was also a Chief Executive's Community Project. Some additional co-funding was also obtained. It {{was carried out by}} a team of HKUST staff in collaboration with several institutes in Mainland China, primarily from Guangdong Province. Overall, the workload was shared approximately equally between HKUST and Mainland China staff. Dramatic economic and population growth in recent years in the Pearl River Region have resulted in significant increases in the river transport of substances such as sediment, nutrients, pesticides, petro-products and heavy metals to the South China Sea. However, {{it is difficult to determine}} whether these loadings have resulted in the deterioration of, or will significantly threaten, water quality or ecological and human health in part or all of the PRE, even though Hong Kong has been exposed to a rising number of marine environmental threats, such as the increased frequency of harmful algal blooms. The objective of PREPP was to build upon the existing knowledge, using a combination of carefully designed field studies, laboratory experiments and model studies to gain a much better understanding of the status, as well as the influence of the riverine loadings on the estuarine environment and ecosystem of the estuary. The resulting increased database and new scientific findings will provide a new level of understanding and an increased predictive capability regarding pollutants in the estuary. The goal of PREPP was that this information should serve as part of the scientific basis for the HKSAR and Guangdong Province to refine their pollution monitoring and control strategies...|$|E

40|$|Environmental Context. Dating estuary sediments {{provides}} {{insights into}} the materials entering the estuary and can pinpoint when the contamination occurred. Heavy metal contamination is a known health risk but attributing it to a source can be contentious. For a sample sourced downstream of a city and a mining region, lead- 210 dating and stable lead isotope analyses uncovered the sources of lead inputs. These methods quantified the extent that upstream mining activities and, for the first time, the extent that non-mining inputs (vehicles, industry) contributed to the <b>estuary's</b> <b>pollution.</b> Abstract. 210 Pb dating and heavy metal analyses (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) have been combined to establish an historical profile of pollutant levels in sediments in the Tamar Estuary (Tasmania, Australia) over the past century. Heavy metal profiles through the core show a strong correlation with mining activities and industrialization during the past century, reflecting catchment disturbance in one of Australia's earliest settled areas. A source apportionment of Pb in the sediment core using stable Pb isotope ratios (204 Pb, 206 Pb, 207 Pb, 208 Pb) shows that mine pollution has been contributing 10 - 25 mg kg- 1 to Tamar Estuary sediments {{since the start of}} mining in the early 1890 s, whilst non-mining inputs were not significant until post- 1930 and became increasingly significant post-World War II. Since the 1950 s- 1960 s, non-mining anthropogenic Pb inputs have become as significant as Pb from mining activities, although there does appear to be a decline in non-mining inputs during the past 20 years, which is consistent with findings elsewhere where reductions in atmospheric Pb levels have been observed and are attributed to the phasing-out of leaded gasoline. The source apportionment does, however, suggest that Pb from mine pollution at Storys and Aberfoyle Creeks continues to impact upon upper Tamar Estuary sediment quality...|$|R
30|$|Both IF and h-index {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the articles in a journal. There was a high concentration of electrochemical technology for water and wastewater treatment research publications in these top journals. Table  2 shows the top 20 most productive journals, accounting for appropriately 38  % of the total articles. Journal of the Electrochemical Society with the highest h-index of 90, published the most articles with 1540 articles (5.8  %), followed by Electrochimica Acta (1334; 5.1  %), Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry (801; 3.0  %), and Journal of Power Sources (554; 2.1  %).The percentage of the top productive journal was not high, which indicates the breadth of article distribution as well as the broad interest in electrochemical technology for water and wastewater treatment research from various research angles. This phenomenon also appears in other environment related research areas, such as Water research (4.2  %) in drinking water (Fu et al. 2013), Water research (2.2  %) in nitrate removal research (Huang et al. 2012), and Marine Pollution Bulletin (8.4  %) in <b>estuary</b> <b>pollution</b> research (Sun et al. 2012 a). Journal of the Electrochemical Society, which remained one of the most-highly cited journals in electrochemistry since 1902, ranked on top in the category of Materials Science, Coatings and Films (17) with an impact factor of 2.588. It is worth mentioning that International Journal of Electrochemical Science from Serbia with a high IF (3.729) in 2011 and the least h-index (13) in 2012 according to JCR, which published tenth most articles with 116 (1.5  %), was suppressed by JCR 2012 because of anomalous citation. The relationship between h-index, IF and the rank order of the 20 most productive journals revealed extremely different trend. For example, Journal of Applied Electrochemistry ranked 8 th in the top 20 of most productive journals, while IF (1.836) and h-index (39) ranked 20 th and 15 th, respectively; on the contrary, Journal of the American Chemical Society ranked 18 th in top 20 of most productive journals, when IF (10.677) and h-index (66) ranked 1 st and 3 rd. This result might attribute to the large number of subject categories in our current research. Among the top 20 journals, ten journals are from USA, four from Netherlands, three from the UK (England), two from Switzerland, one from Germany and Serbia, which revealed the dominated status of developed countries in journal country.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the impacts}} of coastal {{settlements}} to <b>estuaries,</b> nutrient <b>pollution</b> is often singled out as {{a leading cause of}} modification to the ecological communities of soft sediments. Through sampling of 48 sites, distributed among 16 estuaries of New South Wales, Australia, we tested the hypotheses that (1) anthropogenic nutrient loads would be a better predictor of macrofaunal communities than estuarine geomorphology or local sediment characteristics; and (2) local environmental context, as determined largely by sediment characteristics, would modify the relationship between nutrient loading and community composition. Contrary to the hypothesis, multivariate multiple regression analyses revealed that sediment grain size was the best predictor of macrofaunal assemblage composition. When samples were stratified according to median grain size, relationships between faunal communities and nitrogen loading and latitude emerged, but only among estuaries with sandier sediments. In these estuaries, capitellid and nereid polychaetes and chironomid larvae were the taxa that showed the strongest correlations with nutrient loading. Overall, this study failed to provide evidence of a differential relationship between diffuse nutrient enrichment and benthic macrofauna across a gradient of 7 ° of latitude and 4 °C temperature. Nevertheless, as human population growth continues to place increasing pressure on southeast Australian estuaries, manipulative field studies examining when and where nutrient loading will lead to significant changes in estuarine community structure are needed. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{probable}} pollution {{distribution and}} flushing times have been {{calculated for the}} Columbia River Estuary, a coastal plain <b>estuary.</b> The <b>pollution</b> distribution {{was determined by the}} fresh water fraction and by the diffusion equation. The flushing times were calculated by the modified tidal prism method and by the fraction of fresh water, These methods are explained and discussed in the study. The widely varying river flow and resulting salt water intrusion were considered, as well as the varying semi-diurnal tidal range. These changing factors cause a complex variation in estuarine classification from well-mixed to stratified. The data used was taken principally from the U. S. Corps of Engineers current measurement program of 1959. The data show a stronger flow {{on the north side of}} the estuary during flood tide and a stronger flow on the south side during ebb tide. Due to this fact, the estuary was also treated as two separate channels in calculating the pollution distribution. The results of the various calculations for combinations of conditions are given in this study. A comparison of the different methods is also summarized. The estuary has been found to have a relatively short flushing time, even under low river flow conditions. The variation in strength of flow from the north side to the south side has been shown to produce pollution distributions not normally expected in an estuary...|$|R

It is our conjecture that major infrastructure changes and pollution abatement have yielded a more favorable marine environment for dolphins, resulting in an estimated 6 % annual increase in sightings, from a near absence of sightings in the 1980 s.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the response of pelagic zooplankton to different levels of abiotic multi-stressors in the North Atlantic coast, taking advantage of the comparison of the communities of two adjacent estuaries with different levels of historical <b>pollution</b> (<b>estuaries</b> of Minho and Lima Rivers). The zooplankton community structure, composition and temporal variation were comparatively investigated for 15 months, using different net meshes. Several abiotic factors were measured in situ and water samples were simultaneously collected for determination of nutrients and chlorophyll a. The overall results revealed a diverse community represented by species that have been found in subtropical and temperate zones. Although the highest diversity was observed in the Lima estuary, supported by higher contributions of marine taxa, the total zooplankton biomass was found to be significantly higher in the Minho estuary. The salinity gradient differences between estuaries, associated to significant differences in water nutrients levels, were found to be the main forcing factors affecting micro and mesozooplankton. Considering the importance of the impacts resulting from abiotic variation on the basis of aquatic food webs, the present investigation represented a case-study, based in two contrasting estuaries, one strongly influenced by freshwater discharges (Minho estuary) and the other with higher salinity levels (Lima estuary), contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the effects of multi-stressors on pelagic zooplankton communities, providing useful information for studies related with climate change impacts, biogeography, conservation and providing data contributing to the improvement of pelagic fisheries management models...|$|R

The analysis of low molecular weight compounds, naturally occuring in waters (amino acids, sugars and organic acids) have been carried out in order to get information about the composition of natural waters and relating with biological activity. Organotin compounds were analysed in sediments collected in Tejo estuary.

Using Hydrobia ulvae as a bioindicator, the current work addresses the most reliable methods to reduce the influence of critical variables, such as the animals’ size, on imposex levels assessment for TBT pollution monitoring and presents its temporal trends from 1998 to 2007 in Ria de Aveiro (NW Portugal) {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} recent legislation applied to reduce TBT environmental levels. H. ulvae imposex levels did not decrease in this estuarine system during the last decade despite the implementation of the EU Regulation No. 782 / 2003. Instead, there was a global significant increase in the percentage of females affected by imposex and a slight increase of the vas deferens sequence index (VDSI), contrasting with what has been described for other bioindicators in the same study area. These results show that different biology/ecology traits determine distinct routes of TBT uptake and/or bioaccumulation, pointing the importance of choosing the bioindicator depending on the compartment that is being monitored (sediment vs. water). Sediment ingestion as feeding habit is discussed and pointed as a reason to choose H. ulvae as a bioindicator of TBT pollution persistence in sediment. It is therefore predicted that the response of different prosobranch species around the world may diverge according to the compartment that is being monitored and that female masculinisation may not be completely eradicated in the near future due to TBT persistence in sediments...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate aluminium, iron, copper and zinc metal pollution in the Diep River and bioaccumulation of these metals in the leaves and stems of the submerged macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum L. Furthermore, the effects of bioaccumulated metals on membrane integrity and chlorophyll content of these plants were investigated. Site 1 was situated in the upper reaches of the river adjacent to agricultural land, while site 2 was in an urban area, where industrial activities predominate. C. demersum (from an uncontaminated source) were introduced into the river at the two sites and compared with one another on a fortnightly basis over a 12 week period. Plants at site 2 were also compared to existing plants that were naturally growing at the site. Comparisons were also made between leaves and stems of the plants, to establish the organ of preference regarding metal accumulation and storage. Samples were digested with nitric acid and an ICP-MS was used to analyse metal concentrations in the water, sediment and plants.

A Sampling programme of 6 days which covered both wet and dry weather as well as the spring and neap tidal periods was carried out. Salinity, nutrients and COD were measured at the flood and ebb tides. According to the salinity measurements, in the dry period, the estuary is fully mixed. Stratified conditions occur when the fresh water flow rate increases. Chl a measurements were used to assess the trophic state of the estuary and fresh water feeders. The estuary is eutrophicated both in the wet and dry periods and some locations are even hypertrophic. Out of the fresh water feeders, Hamilton canal is mesotrophic and has faced the threat of eutrophication. According to the literature, limiting potential of the tropical estuaries has been found to shift from N to P with higher fresh water flow rates and results of this study agree well with the above finding.

At each estuary and time (July 2012, November 2012, February 2013, and June 2013), the fish larvae of two size classes (class 0 : 0 – 10 mm; class 1 : 10 – 15 mm), particulate organic matter (POM), and pelagic zooplankton were collected. The stable isotope mixing model SIAR revealed that, despite temporal differences in the relative proportion of prey items ingested, in both estuaries P. microps larvae feed on both planktonic-hyperbenthic food sources, predating mainly on copepods (from 34 % to 60 %), Mysidacea (from 16 % to 28 %), and brachyuran zoea (from 14 % to 29 %). Fish larvae size classes {{did not differ significantly}} for δ 15 N, and exhibited a very narrow range of the δ 13 C signature. Enriched δ 15 N values of all biota in the Lima estuary throughout the study period, with a marked nitrogen enrichment in colder months, are indicative of higher anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (e. g. sewage and industrial discharges, agriculture) into this system. The δ 15 N values of fish larvae and other planktonic groups can be a sensitive bioindicator, because they are highly correlated with the nitrogen content of water (ammonium), indicating that this element has transferred through the planktonic food web. Enriched carbon isotope ratios were observed in warmer months, in both estuaries, and the heavier δ 13 C values in Lima are best explained by differences in the degree of marine influence.

40|$|The {{speciation}} and particle-water {{interactions of}} Ni were investigated in three <b>estuaries</b> with contrasting <b>pollution</b> levels, hydrodynamics and geochemical characteristics. Samples {{of water and}} sediments were collected seasonally from the Tamar, Tweed and Mersey Estuaries. The chemical speciation of dissolved Ni was determined by adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (ACSV), and the sorptive behaviour of Ni was studied under simulated estuarine conditions using " Ni coupled to liquid scintillation counting. A relatively high particle reactivity was observed only in the Tamar Estuary, where ACSV-non labile Ni was removed in the low salinity region, followed by addition of ACSV-labile Ni in the mid-estuarine region. The largely conservative behaviour of dissolved Ni in the Tweed Estuary was attributed to the combination of rapid flushing and low suspended particles concentration. In the Mersey Estuary, dissolved Ni (and Co, Zn, Cd and Pb) often showed positive deviations from conservative behaviour, which were attributed to anthropogenic and/or geochemical inputs. The fraction of ACSV-non labile Ni behaved differently in the three estuaries, with a sharp decrease from 90 to 30 % from freshwater to seawater in the Tamar, scatter between 30 and 70 % in the Tweed, and relatively constant values of 50 - 70 % in the Mersey. These differences are interpreted {{within the context of}} different hydrodynamics and geochemistry of the three estuaries. Speciation modelling showed that between 30 and 70 % of dissolved Ni in the Tweed, and between 50 and 70 % in the Mersey, was bound to a class of strong ligands (log K'NIL = 19. 0 ± 0. 4 and 18. 7 ± 0. 5, respectively), which were saturated by the ambient concentrations of Ni throughout the estuaries, suggesting that the ligands are highly specific towards Ni. Irradiation of riverwater samples with UV light (believed to remove dissolved organic matter) significantly enhanced Ni uptake onto estuarine suspended particulate matter, with an increase in the 63 Ni distribution coefficients (Kds) of up to 10 fold. Conversely, the addition of synthetic humic acids to UV-treated riverwater decreased significantly the 63 Ni Kds. Complexation of Ni by dissolved natural ligands also affected the progression of sorptive reactions, with a system response time (i. e. the time required to achieve 63 % of the sorptive equilibrium) between 1. 6 and 8. 9 hours. The results from this study suggest that the low particle reactivity generally exhibited by Ni during estuarine mixing is due to its ability to complex strongly with dissolved natural ligands (truly dissolved organic or colloidal organic/inorganic), and therefore resist adsorption onto particles...|$|R

Salinity shows a gradient from over 19. 0 promille Cl in the offshore waters to below 0. 3 promille Cl in the freshwater tidal area. Sediments mostly consist of medium, fine and very fine sands, but coarse sands, muds, and peat banks also occur. Current velocity is in general below 1. 5 m/sec., whereas water temperatures range between about 1 and 22 °C {{in the course of the}} year. Oxygen saturation is low in the rivers (0 - 70 %) and shows in the brackish water areas a gradient to values over 100 % reached in the marine parts of the <b>estuaries.</b> Water <b>pollution</b> shows the reverse pattern, but turbidity is highest in the brackish parts of the rivers. The larger part of the shores of the estuaries is sheltered against wave-action, but the beaches along the North Sea may be considered as semi-exposed. The influence of ice is most severe in the freshwater tidal area. Food is abundant in the estuaries, but less in the offshore parts of the North Sea. Taxonomical remarks have been made on, among others, Polinices polianus, Venus gallina striatula, Eteone foliosa, Nereis virens, Nephtys caeca, Aricidea minuta, Spio martinensis, Streblospio shrubsolii, Tharyx marioni, and Ophelia borealis. For 2 coelenterates, 19 gastropods, 44 lamellibranchs, 1 echiurid, 76 polychaetes, 4 archiannelids, 6 leeches, 15 decapod crustaceans, 2 mysids, 8 cumaceans, 1 tanaid, 9 isopods, 31 amphipods, 8 echinoderms, and 1 species of Branchiostoma the distribution is compared with the environmental data mentioned above or earlier papers treating this have been enumerated. For many species this comparison was carried out by means of a maximum-likelihood method. The following general trends in the distribution of the species studied over the estuarine area were observed. The biological limit of the estuarine environment at the seaward side could be placed where the level sea-bottom changes into a topography of tidal channels and shallows. At the landward side no clear-cut limit could be demonstrated. The brackish-water minimum in the species distribution demonstrated first by Remane (1934) could be confirmed for the estuaries of the Delta area. It appears that nearly all species occurring in the brackish water area also live or may live in either the more marine parts of the estuaries or in fresh water. Hence, nearly all may probably be considered as euryhaline marine or freshwater species. The fauna investigated could be divided in a relatively stenotherm component occurring only offshore and a relatively eurytherm component occurring offshore as well as in the estuaries. Below low water level no species could be demonstrated to be restricted by hydrostatic pressure to a certain depth range. Only three species could be shown to be restricted to the intertidal zone. Several species proved to be restricted to a certain sediment range. Of the species occurring in the brackish water area most appeared to prefer muddy sediments. Therefore, species considered as brackish-water species probably often are really euryhaline inhabitants of mud-bottoms. No species could be shown to be governed directly in its distribution by the exposure to wave-action, but many proved to be so indirectly by the nature of the sediment. Some species probably were inhibited in their occurrence by a high turbidity. Pollution and low values for the oxygen saturation could be shown to be inhibiting for several species in the freshwater tidal area, but for only very few in the brackish tidal area. Shortage of food probably is the reason for the absence from the offshore waters of some species common in the seaward parts of the estuaries. It proved to be impossible to apply any biological brackish water subdivision to the estuaries of the Delta area. The subdivisions proposed earlier could be correlated to hydrographical irregularities of the estuaries. The species characteristic for the brackish water stretch of the estuaries of the Delta area are demonstrated to occur in nearly all estuaries and brackish waters along the Atlantic coasts of Europe. Some species also occur in the western part of the Mediterranean. This European estuarine brackish-water fauna, however, is nearly completely different with regard to species composition from similar brackish water faunas in South Africa, S. E. Asia, New Zealand, and N. Siberia, and along the Pacific as well as along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of N. America. Hence, a similarity of brackish-water faunas all over the world does not exist. The species diversity proved to be lowest in the brackish parts of the estuaries and in the intertidal zone of the freshwater tidal area. Especially intertidal sand-bottoms show a gradient from a high number of species in the beaches along the North Sea to nearly no species in the sand flats of the freshwater tidal area; intertidal mud bottoms and subtidal sand bottoms show a comparable pattern. Because the brackish water areas lodge a relatively high number of species introduced from other parts of the world, they are supposed to be undersaturated with regard to the number of species occurring. Omnivores are relatively abundant,in the brackish parts of the estuaries, so the few species occurring apparently occupy wide niches. The percentage of species with pelagic larvae decreases strongly from the sea to the river, whereas the number of species with a non-pelagic development shows the reverse pattern. Pollution, turbidity, size of brackish waters and the critical salinity hypothesis of Khlebovich are ruled out as an explanation for the species minimum in brackish waters. Instability of temperature and salinity partially explain this phenomenon, but a satisfactory explanation for the exceptions only is provided by the time-stability hypothesis of Sanders. It is shown that the history of the N. W. European estuaries during the Pleistocene glaciations sufficiently explains the poverty of brackish water species in these estuaries. Also for other brackish water faunas, geological history probably forms a reasonable explanation for their poverty...|$|R
