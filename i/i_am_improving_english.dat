This work was designed {{in order to create}} a booklet based on the use of songs to help university students <b>improve</b> their <b>English.</b> Therefore, three methods are considered to develop this process. The first one is the Bibliographic method in order to develop the Theoretical Framework, which contains information about this research work from books, articles, and websites. The second and third ones are the qualitative and quantitative methods, which are useful to describe and analyze information from interviews applied to an expert, and a survey to university students used at the beginning and at the end of the application of our project. Finally, to complement our research, we created a booklet that includessix nursery rhymes and six songs along with their lyrics, some activities, and the steps to follow in order to use this booklet accurately.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research are {{to determine the effects}} of teaching methods (STAD and jigsaw) and learning styles (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) on students’ English achievement. This research is an experimental study conducted at Junior High School Pasangkayu in 2014 with 213 sample which is selected stratified-randomly (n = 68). The results of the research are as follow: (1) English achievement of students taught with STAD is better than those of taught with jigsaw; (2) there is no significant difference in  English achievement among visual, auditory, and kinesthetic students; (3) there is any significant effect of interaction among teaching method and learning styles on students’ learning English achievement. The research also find out that for visual students, studying English achievement of students taught with STAD is better than that of students taught with jigsaw; for auditory students, learning English achievement  of students taught with jigsaw is better than that of students taught with STAD; and for kinesthetic students, English achievement of students taught with STAD is better than that of students taught with jigsaw.

40|$|Since 1974, {{umbilical}} cord blood (CB) {{has been shown}} to contain haematopoietic stem cells similar to stem cells from the bone marrow. In 1988, E. Gluckman and her colleagues performed - successfully - the first familial CB transplantation and cured a 5 years old child suffering from Fanconi's anemia. Rapidly, CB banks were organised throughout in the world and thanks to this novel source of haematopoietic stem cells, we can now find a donor for 75 % of the patients requiring a "bone marrow" transplantation. The major benefit of CB as a source of hematopoietic stem cells is its easy access. CB also allows a more significant degree of HLA incompatibility and thus offers an opportunity of transplantation to ethnic minorities for whom no HLA identical donors are available. However, several {{studies have shown that the}} number of cells harvested in a CB was closely correlated with the engraftment post transplantation and today, a minimum of 3. 7 x 10 (7) mononucleated cells/kg is recommended. This required amount of cells is not always reached due to the small volume often harvested from a CB. Therefore, to apply CB transplantations to adults, different approaches are currently being investigated :coinfusion of haploidentical cells, mesenchymal cells, a second CB, or the addition of CB expanded ex-vivo. Among these approaches, double CB transplantation seems nowadays the most promising alternative and ongoing studies should soon inform us whether the duration of aplasia will <b>be</b> <b>improved.</b> <b>English</b> AbstractJournal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

Based on the qualitative data analysis, the researcher concluded that the students had gotten better in writing performance and understanding the materials. In quantitative data analysis, it could be seen that the mean values of the students’ writing scores in the pre-test, post-test 1, and post-test 2 were 51. 46, 58. 63, and 77. 54 respectively, which showed substantial improvements in the students’ writing skills before, during, and after the implementation of cooperative learning.
