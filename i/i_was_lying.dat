5|$|The {{world record}} jump was very smooth. It felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> {{on my stomach}} on a glass coffee table, {{watching}} a movie projected on a screen underneath the table. Although the flight was very smooth, {{it seemed like the}} movie projector was running the film faster than intended.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose {{and we had a}} camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
25|$|As {{this student}} fell behind the car, I saw another student go down, {{next to the}} curb, {{on the far side}} of the automobile, maybe 25 or 30 yards from where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying.</b> It was maybe 25, 30, 35 seconds of {{sporadic}} firing.|$|E

25|$|I was {{initiated}} into a college secret society—a {{couple of hours}} of grotesque and good-humored rodomontade and horseplay, in which I cooperated as {{in a kind of}} pleasant nightmare, confident, even when branded with a red-hot iron or doused head-over heels in boiling oil, that it would come out all right. The neophyte is effectively blindfolded during the proceedings, and at last, still sightless, I was led down flights of steps into a silent crypt, and helped into a coffin, where I was to stay until the Resurrection...Thus it was that just as my father passed from this earth, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> in a coffin during my initiation into Delta Kappa Epsilon.|$|E

I want to be on this.’ I came up to him, and I was like, ‘Man, are you working on this record? Are you working on this beat?’ He goes, ‘Yeah … do you got an idea for it?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, I might. I didn’t. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> like a motherfucker. I was like, ‘Yeah, man, I want to get on this joint.” ...|$|E
500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When I was a kid, I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother. Follow the Leader marked the first album where the majority of the lyrics did not have origins relating to early occurrences, with songs like [...] "Justin" [...] and [...] "Pretty" [...] written about incidents occurring during adulthood.|$|E

2500|$|A true {{indication}} of how successful the Beatles became thanks to [...] "From Me to You" [...] (though it would soon be overshadowed by [...] "She Loves You" [...] and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand") was expressed by McCartney: [...] "The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> in bed one morning, and I heard a milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1993 {{in their}} New York home, Gordon beat Jackson {{repeatedly}} {{with a heavy}} brass dining room chair, leaving Jackson with black eyes, swollen lip and chin [...] "the size of a clenched fist", cuts requiring 12 mouth stitches and contusions on her face, arms, legs and back. Jackson lost consciousness during the beating, leading Gordon to believe she was dead. She recalled, [...] "He called his friends and said, 'She's dead. I killed her,' because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> in a puddle of blood and I was out." [...] Gordon was arrested but then released, claiming he beat Jackson in self-defense.|$|E

2500|$|Mauer {{finished}} the 2006 regular {{season with a}} [...]347 batting average, edging the New York Yankees' Derek Jeter and Robinson Canó to win the American League batting title and become the first-ever American League catcher to win the crown and the first catcher to claim the title since Ernie Lombardi in 1942 with the Boston Braves. [...] His [...]347 average was {{the highest in the}} Major Leagues, a feat not achieved by the previous three catchers to win NL batting titles. He was the youngest player to win a batting title since Alex Rodriguez in 1996. After going 2-for-4 in the last game of the 2006 regular season, Mauer confessed to reporters, [...] "When I told you I wasn’t thinking about the batting title? [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying.</b> [...] I’ve never been that nervous in my life. [...] I haven’t felt anything like that since Opening Day as a rookie." [...] Mauer won his first Silver Slugger Award in 2006, along with teammate Justin Morneau.|$|E
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and I jumped up and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on his childhood, Fritzl {{initially}} {{described his}} mother as [...] "the best {{woman in the}} world" [...] and [...] "as strict as it was necessary". Later, he expressed a negative opinion {{of his mother and}} claimed that [...] "she used to beat me, hit me until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lying</b> {{in a pool of blood}} on the floor. It left me feeling totally humiliated and weak. My mother was a servant and she used to work hard all her life, I never had a kiss from her, I was never cuddled although I wanted it – I wanted her to be good to me." [...] He also claimed that she called him [...] "a Satan, a criminal, a no-good", that he [...] "had a horrible fear of her". In 1959, after Fritzl had married and bought his house, his mother moved in with them. Over time, their roles reversed, and his mother came to fear him. Eventually, he also admitted he had later locked his mother in the attic and bricked up her window after telling neighbors that she had died, and kept her locked up until her death in 1980. It is unknown how long Fritzl kept his mother locked up in his attic, but newspapers have speculated that it may have been up to 20 years.|$|E
