5|$|Admission {{continues}} to be via the <b>Eleven</b> Plus examination; The Judd School complies with the Co-ordinated Admission Scheme which {{is administered by the}} Kent Local Authority. All pupils must have gained a selective place through the <b>Eleven</b> Plus and placed The Judd School as a preference on their application form. Because the school is usually over-subscribed, priority is given to students in Local Authority Care in the first instance. Students are then ranked according to their aggregate scores in the <b>Eleven</b> Plus, and the distance from a students home to the school (as the crow flies) is used as a tiebreaker.|$|E

With the advent of international cricket in the 1870s, especially following the hugely successful inaugural Australian tour in 1878, the travelling <b>elevens</b> faded away.|$|R

5|$|The Jain texts {{state that}} Mahavira's first disciples were <b>eleven</b> Brahmins who are {{traditionally}} called the <b>eleven</b> Ganadharas. Gautama was their chief.

Mahavira's disciples {{are said to}} be led by Gautama after him, who later is said to have made Sudharman his successor. These <b>eleven</b> Brahmin–Ganadharas, as the early followers, were responsible for remembering and verbally transmitting the teachings of the Mahavira after his death, which {{came to be known as}} Gani-Pidaga or Jain Agamas.|$|E

25|$|For {{the next}} ten years, until Fred Grace's early death, the Grace {{brothers}} ran the USEE as its match organisers, for which they received payment, but they played for expenses only. Although the Graces were an expensive acquisition, they were cricket's main attraction and were guaranteed to draw large crowds wherever the USEE played. As a result, the USEE continued to prosper while the trend among its rival <b>elevens</b> was to fade from the scene. The USEE {{was the last of}} the major travelling <b>elevens</b> to fold, having seen a decline in public interest through its last three or four seasons. The travelling <b>elevens</b> lost out in the cricket market to county cricket which burgeoned during the 1870s, ironically because of the Graces' county Gloucestershire. In addition, the public quickly warmed to international cricket which emerged {{at the end of the}} 1870s. The travelling <b>elevens,</b> which played largely meaningless matches against weak and unbalanced opposition, could not compete with the quality of top-class matches played by the county clubs against each other or a touring Australian team.|$|R

He quickly reached the school cricket first <b>eleven,</b> where he outperformed the other players and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents' team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against very weak bowling. These achievements brought him some local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and he preferred to be out playing cricket.|$|E
