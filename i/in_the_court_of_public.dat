500|$|With nothing {{concrete}} {{to support}} his suspicions, Flood reluctantly released Mary Celeste from the court's jurisdiction on February 25. Two weeks later, with a locally raised crew headed by Captain George Blatchford from Massachusetts, she left Gibraltar for Genoa. The question of the salvage payment was decided on April 8, when Cochrane announced the award: £1,700, or about one-fifth of {{the total value of}} ship and cargo. This was far lower than the general expectation—one authority thought that the award should have been twice or even three times that amount, given the level of hazard in bringing the derelict into port. Cochrane's final words were harshly critical of Morehouse for his decision, earlier in the hearing, to send Dei Gratia under Deveau to deliver its cargo of petroleum—although Morehouse had remained in Gibraltar at the disposal of the court. Cochrane's tone carried an implication of wrongdoing, which, says Hicks, ensured that Morehouse and his crew [...] "...would be under suspicion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> opinion forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Public opinion {{regarding}} {{the case and}} lawsuit have been mixed.

[...] In 2000, Acevedo accused Romero Barcelo of receiving 175,000 dollars of illegal contributions to fund his campaign bid for Resident Commissioner.

2500|$|Two notable {{people who}} had {{previously}} defended Cosby, and believed in his innocence, changed their minds. American actress and talk show host Whoopi Goldberg and Joseph C. Phillips (a Cosby Show regular for three years) each made public statements on July 15, 2015. Goldberg said, [...] "If {{this is to be}} tried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> opinion, I got to say all of the information that's out there kind of points to guilt." [...] In an interview Goldberg had a message for Cosby: [...] "It looks bad, Bill. Either speak up or shut up." [...] Goldberg had received threats for staunchly standing by Cosby. Goldberg, {{in the form of a}} question, referred to Cosby as a [...] "serial rapist" [...] and questioned why he was still on the streets. Phillips was more direct in a separate comment from Goldberg, saying [...] "Of course Bill Cosby is guilty!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain {{appointed}} a new High Commissioner for South Africa in May 1897. [...] Sir Alfred Milner was {{sent out to}} South Africa with firm instructions to refrain from further unilateral action against the Transvaal. [...] Milner was a dedicated proponent of British Imperialism and of the ‘forward’ policy; viewing it {{as the only way}} to preserve what he saw as Britain’s waning regional influence. [...] February 1898 saw Kruger re-elected for his fourth term, with a substantial majority over his reformist rivals. [...] Milner took this as a sign that {{there was no time to}} lose; if there was any further waiting the result would be Afrikaner dominance to the exclusion of Britain, orchestrated from a powerful Transvaal. [...] Milner returned to London in November 1898 for consultations with Chamberlain. [...] Having observed the situation for the past eighteen months, he was now sure of his strategy. [...] Milner proposed that the British government should work up a crisis, giving them a legitimate pretext to intervene, a pretext that would place Britain in the right and the Transvaal in the wrong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> opinion. [...] Chamberlain re-iterated his instruction to Milner that the British government could not be seen to be coercing Kruger; any intervention must be as a result of the Transvaal putting itself in the wrong. [...] Milner returned to South Africa a satisfied man; while the British government would not act, Chamberlain had not tied the hands of officials in South Africa. [...] Milner was determined to be the one to force this pretext.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the early}} stages I am persuaded there was no malice. He talked but for the {{pleasure}} of airing himself. He was essentially glib, as becomes the young advocate, and essentially careless of the truth, which is the mark of the young ass; and so he talked at random. There was no particular bias, but that one which is indigenous and universal, to flatter himself and to please and interest the present friend. And by thus milling air out of his mouth, he had presently built up a presentation of Archie which was known and talked of in all corners of the county. Wherever there was a residential house and a walled garden, wherever there was a dwarfish castle and a park, wherever a quadruple cottage by the ruins of a peel-tower showed an old family going down, and wherever a handsome villa with a carriage approach and a shrubbery marked the coming up of a new one--probably on the wheels of machinery--Archie began to be regarded in the light of a dark, perhaps a vicious mystery, and the future developments of his career to be looked for with uneasiness and confidential whispering. He had done something disgraceful, my dear. What, was not precisely known, and that good kind young man, Mr. Innes, did his best to make light of it. But there it was. And Mr. Innes was very anxious about him now; he was really uneasy, my dear; he was positively wrecking his own prospects because he dared not leave him alone. How wholly we all lie at the mercy of a single prater, not needfully with any malign purpose! And if a man but talks of himself in the right spirit, refers to his virtuous actions by the way, and never applies to them the name of virtue, how easily his evidence is accepted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>court</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> opinion! ...|$|E
