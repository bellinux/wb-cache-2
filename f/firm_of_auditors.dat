40|$|This study {{reflects}} on the role, compromise and problems of the external auditor in the corporate governance with particular reference to the UK. The external auditor is an independent person or <b>firm</b> <b>of</b> <b>auditors</b> appointed by the shareholders to investigate the financial statements prepared by the management and report his findings to the shareholders. This study identifies the various instruments used by government and accountancy bodies to regulate {{the role of the}} auditor. The statutory role of the external auditors is to issue audit report of his opinion on true and fair view of the financial statements. The study indicates that the role of the external auditor is greatly facilitated by efficient and effective internal control system and with the cooperation of the audit committee. However, the study provides striking evidence that {{in the course of the}} audit role, some auditors compromise their professional integrity for economic gain. The big four firms provide a better picture of the professional compromise. Alongside this, it identifies corporate accounting scandal linked to the professional misconduct of the auditors. Furthermore, the problems frustrating the effective role of the auditor within the framework of the corporate governance were identified in the study as auditor’s independence, morality, public expectation and audit market cartel. In conclusion, the study shows that the role of the external auditor is inevitable for good corporate governance.

40|$|The {{determinants}} <b>of</b> <b>firms</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>auditor</b> {{have received}} considerable attention in recent years. Theories relating to "agency costs" and "product differentiation" have been extensively examined. With {{respect to the}} former Francis and Wilson (1988, p. 668) observe: [...] . only a weak association has been demonstrated to exist between agency cost proxies and audit firm choice with little interstudy consistency. The {{evidence in support of}} the latter (specifically, a "Big 8 " fee premium) seems stronger. Interestingly, the demand for quality differentiated audits is often explained in terms of agency/contracting costs, and most recently, also in terms of industry specialisation (Craswell et. al., 1995). While "economic" determinants <b>of</b> <b>auditor</b> choice have been closely examined, little {{attention has been paid to}} "non-economic" factors. Yet, if the popular press and the recent debate over corporate governance are any guide, cultural and environmental factors also seem likely to play a role. One of the few such studies is Davidson, Stening and Wan (1984). Davidson et. al. (1984) examine the effect of interlocking directorates on Australian companies choice <b>of</b> <b>auditor.</b> Two companies were deemed to be interlocked when they had at least one director in common. They conclude (p. 316) : [...] . links between companies audited by the same public accounting firms [...] can be explained to a considerable extent by the links provided by those companies having common directors. In this paper we investigate the impact of interlocking directorates and, specifically, the cross-chairpersonship of the Board of Directors on Hong Kong companies choice <b>of</b> <b>auditor.</b> Section 2 briefly reviews the evidence on "family" control of Hong Kong listed corporations. Section 3 examines the relationship between cross-chairs and auditor choice, while section 4 contains our conclusions. In brief, there is (at least over the time period of this study) a significant association between cross-chairs and auditor choice even after controlling for the industry expertise <b>of</b> the <b>auditors.</b> There is also little evidence that cross-chaired companies rely more heavily on alternative governance mechanisms to address any potential threats to the "independence" <b>of</b> their chosen <b>auditors...</b>|$|R
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between auditing services provided to 213 listed firms over a period from 1996 to 2000 by reputable (or tier 1) and non-reputable (non-tier 1) audit firms and the initial returns at listing. We use market adjusted initial return to reflect the <b>firm’s</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>auditor</b> during the initial public offering (IPO’s). The findings {{show that there is}} an inclination for listed firms to engage tier 1 audit firms, probably due to management’s intention <b>of</b> signal the <b>firm’s</b> favorable private information and credibility and integrity of reported financial information and ultimately increasing their chances of getting listed. The findings alos show that there is {{no significant difference in the}} initial returns <b>of</b> IPO’s <b>firms</b> irrespective <b>of</b> the reputation <b>of</b> <b>auditors.</b> However, there is a significant difference in the initial return of main and second board firms at listing whether firms are either audited by Tier 1 or non-Tier 1 audit firms. Firms that had upward switch showed higher returns, inconsistent with the auditor reputation hypothesis. This results, however, could be biased by the large number <b>of</b> new <b>firms</b> that did not switch auditors at listing, probably due to lack of time to make changes before listing, and/or have engaged tier 1 auditors at incorporation in anticipation of listing. However, the findings showed significant higher returns for second board firms relative to main board firms. These results do not support the widely held view that firms that seek listing do switch auditors prior to their listing for positive market signalling.

However, the findings also show that greater age at qualification decreases the probability of progressing to partnership.

It also investigates whether being audited by a big auditor would lead to lower agency costs and lower cost of equity. The study focuses on emerging common-law South Africa and code-law Brazil, and seeks to identify whether there are material differences given their dissimilar institutional characteristics. The study reports that even though firms may be audited by high quality auditors, their institutional differences influence significantly firms' earnings conservatism, agency costs and cost <b>of</b> equity. Client <b>firms</b> <b>of</b> big <b>auditors</b> in both common-law South Africa and code-law Brazil exhibit lower discretionary accruals. The study has found evidence of more conservative earnings for South Africa but insufficient levels for Brazil. For common-law South Africa, the presence of effective corporate governance mechanisms reduces agency costs. For code-law Brazil, the corporate governance mechanisms generally display an insignificant impact on reducing agency costs. For common-law South Africa, firm-level performance, growth and market determinants tend to lead to a lower cost of equity. For code-law Brazil, it is found that significant discretionary accruals, market beta and analyst forecast dispersion would result in higher uncertainty and would consequently raise the cost of equity.

40|$|Purpose – IFAC, a Swiss-registered {{non-governmental}} organization, {{is emerging}} as an important international (auditing) standard setter amongst a powerful group of regulators, including the World Bank, the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the European Commission (EC). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to focus on the changing governance and accountability structures within IFAC, the way such changes are shaping, or re-shaping, its “public interest” commitments and the resulting strategic implications for processes <b>of</b> <b>auditor</b> regulation and public oversight in the global financial arena. Design/methodology/approach – The material and analysis presented in the paper derives from an extensive review of official reports, consultation documents and related responses, a range of other information available on IFAC's web site (www. ifac. org) or those of other key regulatory players in the global financial arena. Findings – The paper analyzes how IFAC is succeeding as an international standard setter with an established place in the global financial infrastructure. From analysis of the recent establishment of a Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB) and the changing nature of representation on IFAC's Public Interest Activity Committees (PIACs), the paper reveals a growing reliance on governance by experts together with a growth in influence of the large, multinational accounting <b>firms.</b> Governance <b>of</b> <b>auditors</b> has become a matter of global importance and governance structures are being reconfigured. Practical implications – By highlighting the changes that have taken place within IFAC's governance system, the paper establishes the importance for public policy of further study and debate concerning the nature and practical operation of such a system, particularly given IFAC's position within a complex but developing global governance arena. Originality/value – IFAC is becoming an integral player in global financial governance processes and yet has not been subject to any substantial academic accounting research. This paper seeks to rectify this by focusing on the structures and processes underpinning both the development of IFAC's International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and its own global strategy for advancement.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} informational role of audit client (i. e. firm) reputation in the auditor switching and retention decision. I perform an experimental examination of an analytical model, prescribing the optimal choices made by firms in the decision to retain or switch auditors without considering firm reputation. Using an experimental markets approach, I provide evidence of the market reaction to a firm's switch/retention decision under two alternative treatments. In the first (baseline) treatment, an explicit test of the analytical model, firms do not incur reputation effects when making the decision to switch or retain auditors. In the second treatment, firms consider market perceptions <b>of</b> opportunistic <b>auditor</b> switching and retention and the potential effects on the firm's reputation. The choice <b>of</b> <b>auditor</b> switching and retention is a significant component <b>of</b> the <b>firm's</b> corporate governance structure. I precisely measures reputation formation and its impact on this specific governance decision by the inclusion <b>of</b> prior period <b>auditor</b> switch/retention decisions made by firms in reputation treatment conditions. Prior archival research has demonstrated a link between auditor quality and earnings quality. These studies suggest that the retention <b>of</b> a high-quality <b>auditor,</b> or dismissal <b>of</b> a poor-quality <b>auditor,</b> can signal high quality earnings to the market. The converse is also suggested; retention <b>of</b> a poor-quality <b>auditor,</b> or dismissal <b>of</b> a high-quality <b>auditor,</b> can signal poor earnings quality. The decision to retain or switch auditors is made annually by firms who have superior information over their auditors and investors. In the short run, the decision to retain or switch auditors offers a temporary signal which the market may not clearly price. However, including the <b>firm's</b> track record <b>of</b> <b>auditor</b> switching and retention decisions among <b>auditors</b> <b>of</b> differing quality allows {{for the development of a}} positive or negative reputation on this portion of corporate governance.

40|$|Research Question/Issue From {{an agency}} perspective, we {{investigate}} whether family ownership and control configurations are systematically {{associated with a}} <b>firm's</b> choice <b>of</b> <b>auditor.</b> Our analysis focuses on three different characteristics of family ownership and control: family ownership (cash flow rights), disparity between cash flow and voting rights held by family owners (cash–vote divergence), and the family identities of CEOs. Research Findings/Insights Our findings suggest that different family ownership and control configurations lead to different agency effects. The alignment effect prevails in family firms with greater family ownership, founder CEOs, and professional CEOs, whereas the entrenchment effect prevails when there is greater cash–vote divergence. Despite the presence of two distinct types of agency effects, regardless of differences in family ownership and control configurations, none <b>of</b> these <b>firms</b> are inclined to appoint higher-quality auditors. Theoretical/Academic Implications This study advances {{our understanding of the}} varied agency effects arising from family ownership, cash–vote divergence, and the family identities of CEOs, as well as the impact of family ownership and control features on auditor choice. Our empirical evidence provides a unique insight, showing that higher-quality auditors do not tend to be appointed in firms where family alignment with outside investors is relatively strong, as this lowers demand for such auditors. In addition, although family entrenchment may create greater outside investor demand for higher-quality auditors, such demand is difficult to realize. Practitioner/Policy Implications Auditors are an important external governance mechanism.

40|$|OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY: The broad aim of {{this study}} is to find out whether and how auditor gender affects audit quality. More specifically, this study {{examines}} the association between the gender <b>of</b> <b>firm's</b> audit engagement partner and the magnitude of reported accruals. As accruals are a common tool for firm managers to exercise discretion in accounting decisions, it is of importance to assess whether gender-based differences exist in the audit judgments. In addition, further tests are employed to assess whether auditor experience has influence on the auditor gender differences and whether auditor experience affects the magnitude of client firms' accruals. DATA AND METHOD: The data used in the empirical part of this research is collected from several sources. Information concerning the audit engagement partners is hand-collected from the financial statements of the sample companies and the auditor authorization dates from the lists maintained by the Finnish Auditing Board. Financial data for the companies is retrieved from Orbis database. The sample consists of 2508 firm-year observations and covers a 5 -year time period between the years 2008 and 2012. The sample is chosen based on the Talouselämä 500 -list denoting that the firms examined in this study represent the 500 biggest corporations in Finland. The analyses of this study are conducted by means of multiple linear regressions. FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: The key finding of this study is that the auditor gender significantly affects audit quality. More precisely, the empirical analyses demonstrate that the client <b>firms</b> <b>of</b> female <b>auditors</b> report the higher magnitude of income decreasing accruals indicating that female auditors are more conservative than their male colleagues.
