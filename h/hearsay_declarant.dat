5000|$|From 1964 to 1983, a constitutionally {{adequate}} affidavit comprised exclusively or {{primarily of}} hearsay information {{had to have}} contained information suggesting to the examining magistrate that (1) the <b>hearsay</b> <b>declarant</b> supplying {{the information to the}} police was a credible person, and (2) that the <b>hearsay</b> <b>declarant</b> had a strong basis of knowledge for the alleged facts. [...] Since 1983, a constitutionally sufficient affidavit must support a conclusion by a reviewing magistrate that the [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] suggest that there is a fair probability that the facts relied on by the police to find probable cause to arrest are in fact valid; the magistrate will balance “the relative weights of all the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant's tip.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{hearsay rule}} is an {{analytic}} {{rule of evidence}} that defines hearsay and provides for both exceptions and exemptions from that rule. There is no all-encompassing definition of hearsay in the United States. However, most evidentiary codes defining hearsay adopt verbatim the rule as {{laid out in the}} Federal Rules of Evidence, which generally defines hearsay as an out-of-court statement introduced to prove {{the truth of the matter}} asserted. [...] "Out-of-court" [...] is shorthand for any statement other than one made under oath and in front of the factfinder (the jury, or the judge in a bench trial) during the same proceeding in which it is being offered in evidence. [...] "Matter asserted" [...] means the matter asserted in the statement offered into evidence, not the matter [...] "asserted" [...] by the party offering the evidence. Evidence typically is introduced to support not just one proposition but a series of propositions, linked together in an inferential chain. If any one of the propositions in the inferential chain is [...] "the truth of the matter asserted" [...] in the out-of-court statement, the evidence falls within the traditional definition of <b>hearsay.</b> The <b>declarant</b> is the person that makes the out-of-court statement—not the person bringing the action (lawsuit).|$|R
