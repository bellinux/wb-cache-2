During this period he developed {{a keen interest in}} politics and was determined to enter politics himself. While a strong Liberal, he was internally critical of what he saw as unconvincing and inconsistent economic Liberal Party policies.

25|$|Despite {{plentiful}} resources, {{the country}} lacks sustainable pragmatic policies to combat poverty. Hania Sholkamy, an <b>economist</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Social Research Center at the American University in Cairo, disclosed {{that although the}} government had subsidized 270 million loaves of bread/day at 19 Piasters/piece, 29 {{percent of the children}} in Egypt remained malnourished. Although these policies were adopted in an attempt to reduce economic burdens on the poor, they benefited the rich more which caused more problems to the poor and increased the burdens of the government. In fact, 83 percent of food subsidy, 76 percent of electricity subsidy, 87 percent of petroleum subsidy and 76 percent of the social safety net subsidy went to the non-poor instead of the poor.|$|E

40|$|Present {{social studies}} in Japan lack an {{economic}} point of view.

In this paper, I propose a plan for elementary school social studies centered around a core of economics. Now this core consists of the factors of production, money and the circulation, and public economy. 今日、社会科教育についての理論的実践的文献は数多いが、経済学や経済の観点から提出されたものはきわめて少ない。他の社会諸科学に比べて経済学が学界でしめている位置からすれば、この沈黙の謎はきわめて不可思議である。経済と社会科教育はあたかも相容れないかの如くの現状に対して、本稿では小学校の社会科教育に焦点をあてて、この問題点の解明と展望に追っていきたい...|$|R

Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a [...] "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, [...] "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E
