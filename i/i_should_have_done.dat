500|$|I'm {{trying to}} {{understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself.|$|E
500|$|After some {{errors in}} her {{pronunciation}} of Sanskrit shloka [...] "Yoga Taravali" [...] during the song [...] "Shanti/Ashtangi", the BBC arranged for Madonna to take telephonic lessons {{to learn the}} basic correct pronunciation of Sanskrit words from eminent scholar Dr B P T Vagish Shastri. She then made the necessary pronunciation corrections on the album. In an interview with MTV, Madonna recalled the recording of the album, and said her business partner Guy Oseary was a helpful friend, and that after she and Orbit played him the tracks, he, to their dismay, said nothing and left the studio. [...] "He really hates those icy strings. Right when I think the track's done, he sort of pushes us another step further. 'Maybe we should try this', or 'I really don't want to hear that'. And then of course, later on, it creeps in my brain, and I'm like, 'maybe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> a background vocal on that'. And then she comes in and happily does it, right?", Madonna said. Orbit also recalled during an interview with Q magazine that Madonna recorded [...] "Swim" [...] the day her friend and fashion designer Gianni Versace was killed in Miami, Florida. He also commented that this is probably why the track has an emotional impact.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. Maybe <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it already in the past in GP2, but it felt pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] Lord Arranmore answered. [...] "That little affair is {{not worth}} mentioning. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{probably}} <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, your {{generosity}} may naturally {{make you}} say that. But I am the culprit. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> either <b>have</b> <b>done</b> more or nothing at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If you {{had told}} me to watch anything, Stephen, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> religiously <b>done</b> it,' she capriciously went on, {{as soon as she}} heard him behind her.|$|R
500|$|Only days later, Carey began posting {{irregular}} voice {{notes and}} messages on her official website: [...] "I'm {{trying to understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't take care of myself." [...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
500|$|... "When I Was Your Man" [...] {{was written}} by Andrew Wyatt, Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine, while {{production}} was handled by the latter three production-team The Smeezingtons. Having chord progressions Am-C-Dm-G-G7-C (verse) and F-G-C (chorus), the song is written in the key of C Major, with Mars' vocals range from the low note of G3 to the high note of C5. The pop piano ballad finds Mars singing about a pre-fame heartbreak as he regrets letting his woman get away. It starts with a rolling piano riff; unto a nearly scat [...] "vocal cadence": [...] "Same bed but it feels {{just a little bit}} bigger now / Our song on the radio but it don’t sound the same", as he laments the [...] "single state" [...] he created for himself. Next, he sings of his failings; to do right by his woman, [...] "I shoulda bought you flowers / And held your hand / Shoulda gave you all my hours / When I had the chance". Its title phrase re-emerges in the final chorus, juxtaposed by Bruno from all the things he [...] "shoulda" [...] done, into things he hopes his ex’s new man will do; concluding: [...] "Do all of the things <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> / When I was your man". In an interview to Rolling Stone, Mars revealed, while reluctant, that he wrote the song for his girlfriend, model Jessica Caban, when he was worried about losing her. In contrast with the song, Mars and Caban stayed together; remaining a couple as of 2014. Mars also said, in the interview, that he finds it difficult to perform the song; saying: [...] "You're bringing up all these old emotions again," [...] and that: [...] "It's just like bleeding!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on August 8, 2006. Cassie made television appearances on MTV's Total Request Live and BET's 106 & Park to support the album on its release week. Her first televised performances were described as [...] "rocky" [...] and [...] "less-than-stellar," [...] but Diddy {{said that it was}} due to her inexperience, continuing that he would be [...] "with her through her development," [...] and has no [...] "question on her ability [...]" [...] Cassie later added: [...] "I don’t think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> those shows. But I didn't know I had a choice. I would sit in rehearsals and sing full songs a cappella. I wasn't Beyoncé, but I wasn't fucking up. Then I got out there and was like, 'Oh my God, millions of people are watching me right now. I have stage fright.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will forget}} it, dear, {{and he is}} still wrong. If you had been Lance Courthorne <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> this," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't that I don't {{like the}} man," [...] he said, {{in a rather}} small voice. [...] "But I knew if he went on <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To {{tell the}} truth, my friend, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> very well here unless I {{had been able}} to top-dress the English acres with a little Australian gold.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In October 2008, The Times {{reported}} that Lewis had {{turned down a}} seven-figure sum from Mohamed Al Fayed to open a Harrods sale. Lewis commented that she turned down the deal {{on the grounds that}} Harrods is the only UK department store that continues to stock clothing made from animal fur: [...] "It wasn't a million pounds that I was offered, as the papers reported, but even if it had been, I still would have turned it down". [...] "I got a lot of flak for that. There were people who said <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it and given the money to charity, but that would have been such a contradiction." [...] She announced in October 2008 that she was in the [...] "bargaining period" [...] of launching her own ethical line of accessories through Topshop and that she was in the late stages of releasing her own perfume in Europe. Her perfume, Leona Lewis, was launched by LR in July 2009. In 2010, she set up a fashion company with her then-boyfriend, Lou Al-Chamaa, called LOA Clothing Ltd, which was dissolved in 2012.|$|E

60|$|DAISY. [With {{a little}} sigh.] Yes, I don't know what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> without her sometimes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your rebuke is just, yet it savours of ingratitude. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so, but I was {{completely}} taken aback. Do {{you know that}} your face is dirty?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do not let us hurry, sir. Monsieur Rupert {{has taken}} the matter in his hands. It is as well that he should kill this fellow as that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will {{be better}} than going without my cup of tea, Mr. Saul, which <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> if <b>I</b> stayed any longer with Mrs. Tubb. And I have got an umbrella." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{say whether}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so--do!' she exclaimed in an irritated tone; chafing her hands together, and frowning.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{doubt whether}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> right in striving to prevent him,' said James. 'Who can {{appreciate}} the moral effect of heroism?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{generally}} {{all that is}} required,' said Mr. Kendal. I don't know what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> if poor Lucy had been there.' ...|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. I cant tell you. I dont {{understand}} it myself. The prayer meeting set me free, somehow. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{it if it}} were not for the prayer meeting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{how very}} kind you are!" [...] Bertram exclaimed, {{looking down at}} her gratefully. [...] "I'm sure I don't know what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> ever <b>have</b> <b>done</b> in this crisis without you." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2016, {{when asked}} {{if there were any}} sequels that he wished he could revisit, Hopkins said, [...] "I made the mistake of doing two more Lecter movies and <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> only <b>done</b> one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything," [...] he confessed. [...] "I don't {{know what}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> without her. She {{has been the}} most {{wonderful}} friend any one could have." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} you killed Oliver Hilditch," [...] Francis repeated. [...] "If I had been Margaret's father, I think that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the same." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, my goodness! If {{anybody else}} had caught you I don't know what <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> I don't {{see how you}} could be so venturesome!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you accept}} them from me?" [...] he demanded; [...] "accept the manly, the {{professional}} sacrifice, see me throw up my work, my prospects--of course <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> that--and simply become your appendage?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> {{some things}} that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> and am ready to come clean and face the consequences," [...] Greg Solano, sheriff of Sante Fe county, said in a statement.|$|R
6000|$|... “Then I don’t {{see why you}} <b>should</b> <b>have</b> {{expected}} me to resemble him,” said Tony plaintively. “As everybody knows <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> such a thing! Will {{you tell us about}} the engagement?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have helped}} me to do a full half field more than <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> But {{the hardest part of}} the day is to come, brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I didn't--I'm sorry, sir," [...] said Esmond. [...] "Of course, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so. One {{could almost}} have fancied {{that they were}} here frequently." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor did I;--but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so had not Captain Aylmer {{been before}} me. And {{now tell me}} whether I could ask her to come here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Slowly Coblich {{turned toward}} the door. [...] "You are right," [...] he said, [...] "but may God have mercy on my soul. I never thought that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> it with my own hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{need not}} suppose," [...] Sabatini replied. [...] "It {{is not worth}} while. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{probably}} <b>have</b> <b>done</b> what the impulse of the moment demanded. So far, however, I have found most people reasonable." ...|$|R
