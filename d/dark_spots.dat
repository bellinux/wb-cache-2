5|$|Neptune's <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> {{are thought}} {{to occur in the}} {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they {{are thought to}} be vortex structures. Often associated with <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible as a dark feature. <b>Dark</b> <b>spots</b> may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals are}} highly {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> but ignore stationary ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat camouflage. Moving objects with disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, especially if other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Similar solar-heating-driven jets of gaseous {{carbon dioxide}} are {{believed}} to erupt from the south polar cap of Mars each spring. Although these eruptions {{have not yet been}} directly observed, they leave evidence in the form of <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> and lighter fans atop the dry ice, representing sand and dust carried aloft by the eruptions, and a spider-like pattern of grooves created below the ice by the out-rushing gas.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot,</b> an anti-cyclonic storm system {{spanning}} 13,000×6,600km, {{was discovered}} by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope {{did not see the}} Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.|$|R
5|$|The protoplasmodium, a microscopic, {{undifferentiated}} granular {{mass with}} a slime sheath, is transparent and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately {{one and a}} half times the diameter of mature sporangia. It acquires <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> as it matures and the centre of the protoplasm later becomes dark. Then, the transparent and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the capillitium and peridium and finally the spores are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts roughly one day.|$|E
5|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the female}} {{tends to be}} duller than the male, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts and less bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be safely sexed on plumage alone. The {{juvenile}} is paler in color than the adult male and has <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> on its breast, and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, {{but they tend to}} be duller, and a small percentage retains a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.|$|E
5|$|When {{cephalopod}} molluscs like squid and cuttlefish {{find themselves}} against a light background, they contract {{many of their}} chromatophores, concentrating the pigment into a smaller area, resulting in a pattern of tiny, dense, but widely spaced dots, appearing light. When they enter a darker environment, they allow their chromatophores to expand, creating a pattern of larger <b>dark</b> <b>spots,</b> and making their bodies appear dark. Amphibians such as frogs have three kinds of star-shaped chromatophore cells in separate layers of their skin. The top layer contains 'xanthophores' with orange, red, or yellow pigments; the middle layer contains 'iridophores' with a silvery light-reflecting pigment; while the bottom layer contains 'melanophores' with dark melanin.|$|E
50|$|Vucub-Came Macula is the fourth-largest <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> on Pluto. Its {{surface is}} covered with tholins which give Vucub-Came its brown color. The <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> is {{surrounded}} with tall uplands. Extensive fault systems in this area have formed deep canyons running roughly north-south.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the shell is white with <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> and bars. It shows a white callus, through which the <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> appear. These take occasionally the form of irregular ghostly bars (which gave rise to its synonymous name Acmaea spectrum - spectrum = ghost).|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 16 mm. The forewings are white {{with a small}} <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> at the costa and at the inner margin, {{as well as a}} <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> halfway between these two. The hindwings are uniform white. Adults are on wing from spring to fall.|$|R
5|$|Dorsally, {{the color}} pattern {{consists}} of a deep yellow, tan, or brown ground color, with three series of dark brown spots that run {{the length of the}} body. Each of these spots has a black ring around it, the outer border of which is intensified with a rim of white or yellow. The dorsal spots, which usually number 23–30, may grow together, while the side spots may break apart. The head has a pair of distinct dark patches, one on each temple, together with a pinkish, salmon, or brownish V or X marking that forms an apex towards the snout. Behind the eye is a dark streak, outlined in white, pink, or buff. The venter is white, whitish, yellowish, or pinkish, often with an irregular scattering of <b>dark</b> <b>spots.</b>|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{tectonics}} on Enceladus is also {{derived from}} grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges. These bands, first discovered by Voyager 2, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. Grooved terrains {{such as the}} Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features. In other areas, these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running {{the length of the}} feature. Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts.|$|E
5|$|Lions are muscular, deep-chested felids with short, rounded heads, reduced {{necks and}} round ears. Of the living, non-hybrid felids, the lion {{is second only}} to the tiger in length and weight. Its skull is very {{similar to that of the}} tiger, {{although}} the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than that of a tiger. However, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. Lion colouration varies from light buff to silverly gray, to yellowish red and dark brown. The underparts are generally lighter and cubs are born with <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> on their body. The spots fade as lions reach adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts.|$|E
50|$|Head is {{generally}} longer than body depth. Dorsal fin is {{very long and}} reaches almost to the tail. Both sexes have a small <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> at base of caudal fin and a dark blotch just above pectoral fin. Also, many <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> on the body form 3 or 4 longitudinal stripes.|$|R
50|$|The {{shielded}} thick-toed gecko {{is a light}} olive brown colour with <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> {{that cover}} the back; a line of these <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> runs down the spine. It has a dark line that runs from the snout through the eye; this line is bordered on either side by pale lines.|$|R
5000|$|The body of {{the fish}} is a uniform brown or brown with indistinct <b>darker</b> <b>spots</b> on the body and fins. [...] Juveniles may also display large <b>dark</b> brown <b>spots</b> on the sides.|$|R
5|$|Nereid is {{the third-largest}} moon of Neptune. It has a {{prograde}} but very eccentric orbit and {{is believed to}} be a former regular satellite that was scattered to its current orbit through gravitational interactions during Triton's capture. Water ice has been spectroscopically detected on its surface. Early measurements of Nereid showed large, irregular variations in its visible magnitude, which were speculated to be caused by forced precession or chaotic rotation combined with an elongated shape and bright or <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> on the surface. This was disproved in 2016, when observations from the Kepler space telescope showed only minor variations. Thermal modeling based on infrared observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes suggest that Nereid is only moderately elongated which disfavours forced precession of the rotation. The thermal model also indicates that the surface roughness of Nereid is very high, likely similar to the Saturnian moon Hyperion.|$|E
5|$|The Noronha skink {{is covered}} with light and <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> above, but there is {{substantial}} variation in the precise colors. There are no longitudinal stripes. The scales on the underparts are yellowish or grayish. The eyelids are white to yellow. It has a small head with small nostrils, which are placed far to the front {{at the sides of}} the head. The mouth contains small and conical teeth and a thin but well-developed tongue. The eyes are small and placed laterally and contain dark, rounded irises. There are three to five well-developed auricular lobules (small projections) in front of the ears; these lobules are absent in true Mabuya. The hindlimbs are longer and stronger than the forelimbs, which are small. The tail is longer than the body and is muscular but very brittle. It is nearly cylindrical in form and tapers towards the end.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{positioned}} well {{back on the}} body, closer to the pelvic than the pectoral fins. The second dorsal and anal fins are large, about half to three-quarters {{as high as the}} first dorsal fin. The broad, triangular pectoral fins originate at or slightly before the level of the fifth gill slit. There is no ridge {{between the first and second}} dorsal fins. The lower lobe of the caudal fin is half the length of the upper, which has a strong notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are small and overlapping, usually with 7 horizontal ridges, giving the skin a smooth feel. The coloration is grayish to brownish above and white below, with a pattern of scattered small, <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> unique to each individual. The tips of the first dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe, and sometimes also the second dorsal fin and lower caudal fin lobe, are bright white.|$|E
50|$|The Small <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot,</b> {{sometimes}} {{also called}} <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> 2 or The Wizard's Eye, was a southern cyclonic storm {{on the planet}} Neptune. It was the second most intensive storm on the planet in 1989, when Voyager 2 flew by the planet. When the Hubble Space Telescope observed Neptune in 1994, the storm had disappeared.|$|R
5000|$|The Wizard's Eye (sometimes called Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot</b> 2) {{is another}} cyclone on Neptune. It is about one-third the {{diameter}} of the Great <b>Dark</b> <b>Spot.</b> It received the name [...] "Wizard's Eye" [...] because it looks like an eye. This appearance is caused by a white cloud {{in the middle of the}} Wizard's Eye.|$|R

5|$|The {{two species}} of manta differ in color patterns, dermal denticles, and dentition. M. birostris has more angular {{shoulder}} markings, larger ventral <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> on the abdominal region, charcoal-colored ventral outlines on the pectoral fins and a dark colored mouth. The shoulder markings of M. alfredi are more rounded, while its ventral spots are located near the posterior end and between the gill slits, and the mouth is white or pale colored. The denticles have multiple cusps and overlap in M. birostris, while those of M. alfredi are evenly spaced and lack cusps. Both species have small square shaped teeth on the lower jaw but M. birostris also has enlarged teeth on the upper jaw. Unlike M. alfredi, M. birostris has a caudal spine near its dorsal fin.|$|E
5|$|The {{color pattern}} varies geographically. The head has two well-marked dark bands: {{one on the}} crown and the other between the eyes. On {{the sides of the}} head, there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is {{yellowish}} white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground-color varies from straw yellow, to light brown, to orange or reddish brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18–22 backwardly-directed, dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail. Usually these bands are roughly chevron-shaped, but may be more U-shaped in some areas. They also form 2–6 light and dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered <b>dark</b> <b>spots.</b> Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to reddish ventral plates toward the lateral edges.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} {{tiger shark}} can {{typically}} range from blue to light green with a white or light-yellow underbelly. The advantage {{of this is that}} when it is hunting for its prey, when prey looks at the shark from above, the shark will be camouflaged since the water below is darker. And when prey is below the shark and looks up, of course because of the sun, it is lighter so that the light underbelly will also camouflage the shark. This is known as countershading. <b>Dark</b> <b>spots</b> and stripes are most visible in young sharks and fade as the shark matures. Its head is somewhat wedge-shaped, which makes it easy to turn quickly to one side. They have small pits on the snout which hold electroreceptors called the ampullae of Lorenzini, which enable them to detect electric fields, including the weak electrical impulses generated by prey, which helps them to hunt. Tiger sharks also have a sensory organ called a lateral line which extends on their flanks down most of the length of their sides. The primary role of this structure is to detect minute vibrations in the water. These adaptations allow the tiger shark to hunt in darkness and detect hidden prey.|$|E
50|$|The fish is {{generally}} an olive color, {{with a dark}} horizontal stripe {{through the center of}} the body. There is also a <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> on the dorsal fin and females also have a <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> on their anal fin. Like most poeciliids, males' anal fins are modified into a gonopodium that is used for impregnating females during mating.|$|R
40|$|Organic Light Emitting Devices(OLEDs) {{have several}} {{advantages}} over traditional semiconductor {{devices such as}} {{the possibility of being}} printable, the potential for low cost fabrication, and the potential ease of integration onto a flexible substrate. However, mass commercialization for OLEDs faces several hurdles including that of ambient stability. Due to issues such as low work function of the cathode in the OLEDs, exposure to oxygen or humidity leads to <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> formation which detrimentally affects device performance. Protection of OLEDs from ambient conditions places high importance on strict encapsulation techniques. Rigid encapsulation techniques which provide high impermeability to ambient conditions are not easily applicable for flexible OLEDs. Flex-integrable thin film encapsulations do not possess the high integrity of rigid encapsulation structures. If the demand for strict thin film encapsulation could be eased via stronger inherent resistance to <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> growth, it can be most beneficial for the future of OLEDs, especially in the flexible arena. 	To ease the need for stringent encapsulation, alternate non-encapsulation related approaches for <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> suppression are investigated. These include heating the substrate to an elevated temperature during cathode deposition and the use of cathode-organic interfacial layers in the OLED. Observations from microscopy, electrical measurements, surface morphology measurements, and adhesion tests are analyzed. Conclusions on the suppression of <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> growth are discussed. The role of interfacial adhesion in <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> suppression is investigated. Ambient stability of OLEDs is shown to be related to stronger interfacial adhesion between the cathode and the organic layers. 	A few thin-film encapsulation structures for OLEDs using materials like titanium (Ti) and MoO 3 are also discussed along with the results. 	Though <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> eradication via encapsulation may still prove challenging, <b>dark</b> <b>spot</b> suppression via cathode-organic interfacial adhesion strengthening can be shown to be a promising tentative solution to improve OLED lifetime yield...|$|R

5|$|Though the {{majority}} of specimens are almost or even totally black, (with the exception of head and facial markings), the color pattern may consist of a brown, gray, tan, yellowish-olive, or blackish ground color, which is overlaid {{with a series of}} 10–17 dark brown to almost black crossbands. These crossbands, which usually have black edges, are sometimes broken along the dorsal midline to form a series of staggered halfbands {{on either side of the}} body. These crossbands are visibly lighter in the center, almost matching the ground color, often contain irregular dark markings, and extend well down onto the ventral scales. The dorsal banding pattern fades with age, so older individuals are an almost uniform olive-brown, grayish-brown, or black. The belly is white, yellowish-white, or tan, marked with <b>dark</b> <b>spots,</b> and becomes darker posteriorly. The amount of dark pigment on the belly varies from virtually none to almost completely black. The head is a more or less uniform brown color, especially in A. p. piscivorus. Subadult specimens may exhibit the same kind of dark, parietal spots characteristic of A. contortrix, but sometimes these are still visible in adults. Eastern populations have a broad, dark, postocular stripe, bordered with pale pigment above and below, that is faint or absent in western populations. The underside of the head is generally whitish, cream, or tan.|$|E
25|$|The {{wingspan}} of Boisduval's tree nymph is 40–45mm. The {{upper surface}} of {{the wings of the}} male are uniform dark brown, with small <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> near the fringe of the hindwings. The female has an overall lighter brown colour on the upper surface, and orange-brown markings near the tips of the forewings. The <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> near the fringe of the hindwings are more pronounced in females. The under{{surface of the}} hindwings of both sexes are variegated grey and brown, and have an arc of seven <b>dark</b> <b>spots</b> encircled firstly by a greyish ring, and then an orange-brown ring. The undersurface of the forewing is orange brown with a row of four black spots near the tip. The female forewing also has two dark brown bands.|$|E
