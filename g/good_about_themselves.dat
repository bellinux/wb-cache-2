5|$|In 2002 the {{researchers}} Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones explored Casler's first explanation, arguing {{that people have}} a basic desire to feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> and behave according to that desire. These automatic positive associations would influence feelings about almost anything associated with the self. Given the mere ownership effect, which states that people like things more if they own them, {{the researchers}} theorised that people would develop an affection for objects and concepts {{that are associated with}} the self, such as their name. They called this unconscious power implicit egotism. Uri Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices. Low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity would show an effect. Raymond Smeets theorised that if implicit egotism stems from a positive evaluation of the self, then people with low self-esteem would not gravitate towards choices associated with the self, but possibly away from them. A lab experiment confirmed this.|$|E

According to Richard Harris, a {{psychology}} professor at Kansas State University, who studied why people like to cite films in social situations, using film quotations in everyday conversation is similar to telling a joke and a way to form solidarity with others. [...] "People are doing it to feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves,</b> to make others laugh, to make themselves laugh", he said.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Susan became {{involved}} with Tom Scully (Andrew Larkins), a Priest. Susan and Tom caused a scandal when they began a relationship. Television critic Andrew Mercado said that 2004 went down as [...] "a watershed year for controversy" [...] after Susan had sex with Tom. Woodburne told Jackie Brygel from TV Week {{that it was a}} [...] "very hot affair". Tom left the priesthood for Susan and she confessed her love for him. However, the relationship soon ended. Woodburne commented [...] "It becomes apparent to both of them that it is just not meant to be. They both reach a period in their life when they are feeling low and lonely and aren't feeling very <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves.</b> They just realise that there is no future." [...] Tom returned in 2007 and he became Principal of Erinsborough High. He told Susan that he never stopped loving her and wanted her back. However, by then she was back with Karl.|$|E

25|$|A mild form of {{hallucination}} {{is known}} as a disturbance, and can occur in most of the senses above. These may be things like seeing movement in peripheral vision, or hearing faint noises and/or voices. Auditory hallucinations are very common in schizophrenia. They may be benevolent (telling the subject <b>good</b> things <b>about</b> <b>themselves)</b> or malicious, cursing the subject, etc. Auditory hallucinations of the malicious type are frequently heard, for example people talking about the subject behind his/her back. Like auditory hallucinations, the source of the visual counterpart can also be behind the subject's back. Their visual counterpart is the feeling of being looked or stared at, usually with malicious intent. Frequently, auditory hallucinations and their visual counterpart are experienced by the subject together.|$|R

2500|$|Besides {{the above}} {{distinction}} on resilience, {{research has also}} been devoted to discovering the individual differences in resilience. Self-esteem, ego-control, and ego-resiliency are related to behavioral adaptation. For example, maltreated children who feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> may process risk situations differently by attributing different reasons to the environments they experience and, thereby, avoid producing negative internalized self-perceptions. Ego-control is [...] "the threshold or operating characteristics of an individual {{with regard to the}} expression or containment" [...] of their impulses, feelings, and desires. Ego-resilience refers to [...] "dynamic capacity, to modify his or her model level of ego-control, in either direction, {{as a function of the}} demand characteristics of the environmental context" ...|$|E
2500|$|Studies {{have also}} been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by {{the needs of others}} has {{conversely}} negative effects on health and happiness. For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant). Additionally, while generous acts make people feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves,</b> it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that [...] "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.". Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others, doing good and subsequently feeling good as [...] "the helper's high".|$|E
40|$|Abstract Young {{adults in}} the United States, Croatia, and China {{described}} personal episodes of times when they felt especially <b>good</b> or bad <b>about</b> <b>themselves.</b> These self-esteem memories were either recent (episodes {{that occurred during the}} previous 4 weeks) or remote (episodes that occurred between the ages of 10 and 15). Systematic content differences between memories of positive and negative self-worth were apparent primarily for remote rather than for recent memories. Across cultures, long-lasting positive memories frequently represented achievement themes, whereas negative memories frequently represented social themes. Links between achievement success and positive self-regard, and between social distress and negative self-regard, are explained using theories of self-esteem and autobiographical memory...|$|R

Some of them are enacted by law regulations. It is worth noting that public companies have special information duties. They have to announce every crucial information about company. Their financial statements are the object of thorough scrutiny made by auditors. Even though, there are many known cases that public companies use information announcing duties to convey only <b>good</b> news <b>about</b> <b>themselves.</b> Their aim is to bring about positive investor reactions and feelings. Many companies believe that creating shareholder value means increasing stock price. This way of thinking mixed with investors behavior proved to lead nowhere. Companies focused on shareholders value concentrated their efforts on short-term results even with harm to their future prospects. Gaining increase of stock prices doesnâ€™t mean increase of shareholder wealth. Because this increase in stock price might be easily corrected to their real (intrinsic) value...|$|R
40|$|One {{important}} {{means by}} which a society maintains and reproduces its dominant ideology is through cultural seductions. By creating in its viewers/readers a <b>good</b> feeling <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> and the world they live in, popular culture entices individuals into approving of, supporting and embracing the dominant social, political and economic orders of our world. What Louis Althusser calls ideological "interpellation," therefore, is frequently a form of seduction involving the use of sweeteners that render certain values, beliefs and social positions enticing and attractive. Among such seducers are money, women (sexual pleasure), fear, an illusion {{of power and the}} semblance of dissent/rebelliousness, many of which are, or are generated by the representation of, the cultural and political "others" of the West. At the same time, the reproduction and maintenance of the dominant orders in the West, to which these "others" make no insignificant contributions, ultimately reinforce their subordinate and underprivileged statuses. Driving such illusion-based ideological seductions are capitalism and its colossal culture industry [...] a symbol of the postmodern convergence of the cultural, ideological and the economic [...] whose insatiable desire for profit casts the "others" of the West into the vicious circle of mis-representation and domination...|$|R
2500|$|Germany's Left Party {{brought up}} the {{discussion}} about affirmative action. According to Stefan Zillich, quotas should be [...] "a possibility" [...] to help working class children who did not {{do well in school}} gain access to a Gymnasium. Headmasters of Gymnasien have objected, saying that this type of policy would [...] "be a disservice" [...] to poor children, {{that they would not be}} able to academically keep up with their classmates and that they would not feel welcome at a Gymnasium. Wolfgang Harnischfeger, headmaster of a well known Berlin Gymnasium, stated: [...] "It can be noticed in children as young as kindergarten-age, that children take after their parents. They emulate their language, their way of dressing, their way of spending their freetime. Children from NeukÃ¶lln (a poor neighbourhood) would not feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> if they had to attend that type of school that mainly serves pupils from social classes different from their own. They will not be able to integrate. Every field-day, every school party will show that very soon." [...] He also said that [...] "this kind of policy would weaken the Gymnasium" [...] and that this would be dangerous, because [...] "German society could not afford to do without the truly educated adults the Gymnasium produces". Stefan Zillich has answered to this, saying that [...] "German society can not afford having only so few adults who were truly educated". While affirmative action laws were not passed (status: January 2010) sought after schools have been guaranteed the right to employ their own quotas since the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} provide a {{rationale}} for further researching the everyday events that keep teachers motivated or that discourage them. We put forward the idea that routine Affect Triggering Incidents (ATIs) are an important area for researchers to investigate {{in terms of how}} they impact teacher motivation and resilience. Two groups of participants in separate consecutive studies kept weekly diaries of incidents that made them feel <b>good</b> or bad <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> in their work as teachers (Study 1) and added weekly inventories of their commitment to teaching as well as measures of self-efficacy and self-esteem (Study 2). An analysis of the ATIs in these diaries revealed that student engagement and student achievement are major factors in incidents triggering regular positive feelings while studentsâ€™ behaviour and perceived difficulties around home influences are major factors in regular dissatisfaction. These everyday ATIs are important {{in the sense that they}} correlate significantly with measures of commitment to teaching, especially in the case of positive ATIs...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objectives : The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship between employees' psychological empowerment with their mental health in headquarters staff of Tabriz University of medical sciences. Study population consisted of all the employees working in headquarters section with a total number of 215 in 2014. Material and Methods : For sampling, stratified sampling method was used. Sample size was estimated 170 participants according to (Krejcie & Morgan) table which consisted of 80 female and 90 male. The research method is descriptive â€“correlation. For data collecting, standard psychological capability questionnaire (PEQ) and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Results : Data analysis showed that there is a meaningful relationship between three items of psychological capability (competence-reliance-the right of choice) and mental health, while there is no meaningful relationship between the sense of being effective and mental health. Also, according to the multiple regression, competence, reliance and the right of choice items have a meaningful effect on mental health and based on standardized coefficient (beta coefficient), the right of choice, competence and reliance have the most effects on the employeesâ€™ mental health respectively. Conclusion : Mental health depends on thinking, feeling and behavior of individuals. In general, people who are mentally healthy, have a positive attitude on life and are prepared to face challenges in life, have <b>good</b> feeling <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> and others and are responsible towards their relationship and in the workplace. In this study, employees' psychological empowerment of headquarters staff of Tabriz University of medical sciences may predict their mental health...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between firms' incentives to learn, communicate {{and to develop}} their product innovation is studied for different settings. Firms learn about their costs of development by investing in research. After learning, firms decide what information to reveal, {{and how much to}} invest in development. Two effects of information revelation are central to the analysis. First, a firm's revelation has a strategic effect. It provides its rival with information about the firm's relative cost efficiency in development. When a firm {{is expected to be a}} more efficient investor in development, this discourages its rival's development investments. This effect therefore gives firms an incentive to bias their revelation towards revealing only <b>good</b> news <b>about</b> <b>themselves.</b> The second effect is an informational effect, and conflicts with the strategic effect. When costs of development investments are positively correlated, each firm learns about its own cost of investment from his rival's revelation. This gives firms an incentive to only reveal bad news to their rival. Bad news makes rivals pessimistic about their development costs, and discourages development investments. The {{interaction between}} these two conflicting effects determines firms' incentives to acquire, reveal and further build upon information. In this paper the firms' costs of development are perfectly correlated, and therefore the informational effect generically dominates. When firms share revenues this effect is countervailed by free-rider incentives. The relative strength of the two effects determines firm's incentives to invest and reveal information. The verifiability of firms' private information is crucial in determining how much information can and will be revealed between firms. Unverifiable information can never be revealed credibly, while verifiable information results in unravelling for extreme revenue shares only. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the studies presented in this dissertation are threefold. First, {{on the basis of}} the self-motives framework, we aimed to identify new antecedents of feedback-seeking behavior. Second, we took a closer look at unresolved issues from previous feedback research by considering the explanatory role of self-motives. Third, we aimed to investigate how self-motives research might contribute to understanding the troubling relationship between feedback and performance. The first chapter of this dissertation presents an overview of past feedback-seeking research by systematically reviewing 49 studies that examined feedback-seeking behavior. In the second chapter, I examined how feedback-seeking across performance dimensions can be influenced by changing the feedback-seekerâ€™s lay beliefs. An experiment showed that people sought more feedback about important dimensions as opposed to unimportant dimensions and sought more feedback about non-modifiable dimensions as opposed to modifiable dimensions. In the third chapter, I took a closer look at the relationship between uncertainty and feedback-seeking. Results of two studies showed that the relationship between uncertainty and feedback-seeking is less simple than previously thought. People sought more indirect feedback at high and low levels of uncertainty as opposed to moderate levels of uncertainty. In the fourth chapter, I investigated whether employees are merely interested in hearing <b>good</b> news <b>about</b> <b>themselves</b> or are more interested in feedback that confirms their self-concept. Results across two studies showed that people mainly reacted favorably to positive feedback. It seems that feedback reactions are dominated by self-enhancement strivings and that self-verification strivings are less prominent. In the fifth chapter I investigated the impact of requiring individuals to elaborate on feedback messages on task performance. Results of two studies showed that mean performance on a web-based in basket improved more when participants elaborated on feedback as compared to when feedback was not elaborated upon. These findings point to the importance of effortful cognitive processing of feedback in organizations. In the final chapter, the empirical findings of this dissertation are briefly summarized. The contributions, opportunities, and limitations of this dissertation are delineated from a theoretical, methodological, and practical perspective...|$|R

This research is purposed to identifying the self personal adjustment and social, also other obstacles that faced by the blind students in doing their self adjustment itself. In this research, the researcher uses the descriptive qualitative method that resulted descriptive data in written words or in spoken and observe of their behavior. The subjects of this research are the blind students that are still studying at the university. The technique of collecting the data is interview and observation. In analyzing the data, the researcher uses the descriptive qualitative. And for the accuracy the data is using the triangulation source.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the culture-specific roles of emotion, relationship quality, and self-esteem in determining life satisfaction. It was hypothesized that maintaining good interpersonal relationships would make individuals in collectivistic cultures not only feel <b>good</b> <b>about</b> their lives but also feel better <b>about</b> <b>themselves.</b> Furthermore, two emotion vari-ablesâ€”emotional expression and emotion differentiationâ€”were proposed as possible determinants of relationship quality. It was hypothesized that emotional expressiveness would be more impor-tant for maintaining good interpersonal relationships in indi-vidualistic societies but emotion differentiation would be more important in collectivistic cultures. These hypotheses were tested with Euro-American, Asian American, Korean, and Chinese groups using multigroup analyses in a structural equation model. Results supported all proposed hypotheses and indicated that emotion differentiation contributes to maintaining good interpersonal relationships in collectivistic cultures, which contributes to self-esteem and satisfaction with life...|$|R
