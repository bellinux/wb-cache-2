The {{case for a}} policy of <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rates is developed {{in terms of a}} conventional 1 S-LM model. However, among other things, the model ignores some central aspects of modern credit markets. In particular <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rates may give rise to nonp erf arming bank loans, thus seriously jeopardizing the effectiveness of the policy.

5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|A {{descriptive}} Takagi-Sugeno {{fuzzy rule}} based system suffers under {{the curse of}} dimensionality since the number of rules is equal to a fuzzy system with a fully filled up decision table. By defining <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> areas as areas where the input space is covered with many membership functions to achieve an acceptable error, the consequence is an often inappropriate fine grid of membership functions in orthogonal arranged low interest areas and an exponential increased number of rules. A possible solution is that the fine grid of membership functions, originated by the projection of a <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> area on the concerning single input variables, is only used if all elements of the input vector are situated in a <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> area. To guarantee the interpretability of a descriptive fuzzy rule based system the additional membership functions caused by <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> areas should fit in the coarser grid by retaining the interpretability of all linguistic variables.

40|$|There {{has been}} a lively debate whether <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rates were {{effective}} in stabilizing the exchange rate {{in the wake of}} the Asian currency crisis. Many economists insist that <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rates not only failed to stabilize the Korean won, but also exacerbated the crisis itself. This paper tries to shed light on this problem by providing empirical evidence from the <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rate period. (1997. 12. 3 ? 1998. 4. 8) If possible channels whereby interest rates may affect exchange rates are examined, the <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rate policy scores well. It accommodated net capital inflow by satisfying the interest rate parity condition. Also it helped rebuild credibility of the policy stance. While the negative impact of <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rates on the private sector cannot be denied, the role of credit crunch needs to be recognized together. Next, the dynamic interaction between interest rates and exchange rates is analyzed using a vector error correction model composed of interest rate differential, spot and forward exchange rates, and country risk premium. The estimation result shows that a 10 % point rise in domestic interest rate appreciates the Korean won by 25 %. In addition, the country risk premium considerably falls down. In sum, it may be concluded that the <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> rate policy was effective in achieving its goal of stabilizing exchange rates...|$|R

5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E
5|$|Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage {{condition}} representing an {{equilibrium state}} under which investors will be indifferent to interest rates available on bank deposits in two countries. The {{fact that this}} condition does not always hold allows for potential opportunities to earn riskless profits from covered interest arbitrage. Two assumptions central to interest rate parity are capital mobility and perfect substitutability of domestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the interest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic assets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign currency assets. Investors then cannot earn arbitrage profits by borrowing {{in a country with}} a lower interest rate, exchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> rate, due to gains or losses from exchanging back to their domestic currency at maturity. Interest rate parity takes on two distinctive forms: uncovered interest rate parity refers to the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk (unanticipated changes in exchange rates) is uninhibited, whereas covered interest rate parity refers to the condition in which a forward contract has been used to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Each form of the parity condition demonstrates a unique relationship with implications for the forecasting of future exchange rates: the forward exchange rate and the future spot exchange rate.|$|E

The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E
