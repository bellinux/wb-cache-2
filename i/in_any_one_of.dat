25|$|Because the {{operating}} system and applications all share a single memory space, {{it is possible for}} a bug <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them to corrupt the entire operating system, and crash the machine. This is not particularly annoying under a single-application model, in which case the application crashes anyway. But under MultiFinder, any crash will crash all the other running programs as well. The multitasking of multiple applications potentially increases the chances of a crash, making the system potentially more fragile.|$|E

25|$|The {{hydrolysis}} of GM2-ganglioside requires three proteins. Two of {{them are}} subunits of hexosaminidasenbsp&A; the third is a small glycolipid transport protein, the GM2 activator protein (GM2A), which acts as a substrate-specific cofactor for the enzyme. Deficiency <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these proteins leads to ganglioside storage, primarily in the lysosomes of neurons. Tay–Sachs disease (along with AB-variant GM2-gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) occurs because a mutation inherited from both parents deactivates or inhibits this process. Most Tay–Sachs mutations probably do not directly affect protein functional elements (e.g., the active site). Instead, they cause incorrect folding (disrupting function) or disable intracellular transport.|$|E

The director also is in charge of making sure the leadership <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the FBI field offices is manned with qualified agents. Before the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act was passed {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks, the FBI director would directly brief the President of the United States on any issues that arise from within the FBI. Since then, the director now reports to the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), who in turn reports to the President.|$|E
25|$|Usher {{syndrome}} type I can {{be caused}} by mutations <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> several different genes: CDH23, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C, and USH1G. These genes function in the development and maintenance of inner ear structures such as hair cells (stereocilia), which transmit sound and motion signals to the brain. Alterations in these genes can cause an inability to maintain balance (vestibular dysfunction) and hearing loss. The genes also {{play a role in the}} development and stability of the retina by influencing the structure and function of both the rod photoreceptor cells and supporting cells called the retinal pigmented epithelium. Mutations that affect the normal function of these genes can result in retinitis pigmentosa and resultant vision loss.|$|E

25|$|Stomatal {{patterning}} {{is controlled}} by the interaction of many signal transduction components such as EPF (Epidermal Patterning Factor), ERL (ERecta Like) and YODA (a putative MAP kinase kinase kinase). Mutations <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the genes which encode these factors may alter the development of stomata in the epidermis. For example, a mutation in one gene causes more stomata that are clustered together, hence is called Too Many Mouths (TMM). Whereas, disruption of the SPCH (SPeecCHless) gene prevents stomatal development all together. Activation of stomatal production can occur by the activation of EPF1, which activates TMM/ERL, which together activate YODA. YODA inhibits SPCH, causing SPCH activity to decrease, allowing for asymmetrical cell division that initiates stomata formation. Stomatal development is also coordinated by the cellular peptide signal called stomagen, which signals the inhibition of the SPCH, resulting in increased number of stomata.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{minichromosome}} maintenance protein complex helicase activity, the complex also has associated ATPase activity. A mutation <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the six Mcm proteins reduces the conserved ATP binding sites, {{which indicates that}} ATP hydrolysis is a coordinated event involving all six subunits of the Mcm complex. Studies have shown that within the Mcm protein complex are specific catalytic pairs of Mcm proteins that function together to coordinate ATP hydrolysis. For example, Mcm3 but not Mcm6 can activate Mcm6 activity. These {{studies suggest that the}} structure for the Mcm complex is a hexamer with Mcm3 next to Mcm7, Mcm2 next to Mcm6, and Mcm4 next to Mcm5. Both members of the catalytic pair contribute to the conformation that allows ATP binding and hydrolysis and the mixture of active and inactive subunits create a coordinated ATPase activity that allows the Mcm protein complex to complete ATP binding and hydrolysis as a whole.|$|E
