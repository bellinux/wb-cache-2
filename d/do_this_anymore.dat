Before the 2001 training camp, he worked out and lived for a time with Fred Roll, his former strength and conditioning coach at the University of Kansas, and subsequently returned to Green Bay for training camp in July at a perceptibly more svelte 339 pounds — and once again equipped with his former quickness. He was re-signed by the Packers on March 23, 2001, after which Brown announced, “If I didn’t think I could <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>anymore,</b> I wouldn't be here".|$|E

Without {{letting go of the}} opponent's waist, the wrestler raises him up again and drops him. Depending on the wrestler, he may continue to repeat the process at his own discretion and may pin the opponent after the last one.

500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic as I {{have been in the past}} about <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>anymore</b> [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently." ...|$|R

If the Tour de France was decided on time instead of points, Christophe would have led the race until the final stage, where he accepted his loss and allowed a group including Defraye to ride away.|$|E

Tempest explained: [...] "We’re not <b>doing</b> that <b>anymore,</b> <b>this</b> is what we are. We are expressing ourselves exactly the way we want. This is it.

5000|$|In {{his review}} of the song, Bill Janovitz says, [...] "In the mid-70s, a 42nd Street movie theater {{would have been a}} place of {{questionable}} repute and not a very romantic rendezvous. The lyric is unexpectedly complex; the point of view, Jagger as narrator, speaks to the mistress apologetically and with a guilty conscience... In one line on the bridge, Jagger manages to convey empathy, culpability, and frustration: I cant go on like this/Can you? Can you? On paper it seems clear, the narrator is asking out of the relationship (paraphrasing): I cant do this, can you? But the way Jagger sings it, it sounds like hes asking, You cant <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>anymore,</b> can you? Hes conveying a different meaning altogether, almost as if he is playing both parts in one line." ...|$|E
