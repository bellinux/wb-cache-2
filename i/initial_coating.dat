40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} imposed displacement and <b>initial</b> <b>coating</b> thickness on fretting wear behaviour of a thermally sprayed coating. <b>Initial</b> <b>coating</b> thickness and imposed displacement between two mating components are important parameters affecting durability of a thermally sprayed coating under fretting conditions. Nevertheless, the effects of imposed displacement and coating thickness at flat-and-rounded frictional contacts of aerospace dovetail connections are not sufficiently investigated. In this paper, fretting wear experiments with a double-layer thermally sprayed coating are performed under different displacement and coating thickness conditions. The effects of the parameters are then identified by directly comparing the ratio of maximum tangential force to normal force. Experimental {{results show that the}} ratio evolutions are similar on the ratio versus accumulated reciprocal sliding distance chart within the displacement range of 0. 4 - 0. 6. mm. In addition, it is demonstrated that durability of the coating is increased with increasing the initial thickness of the coating. Finally, the effect of the <b>initial</b> <b>coating</b> thickness is described with exponential evolution law of fretting damage. © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

In general, laser treated alloys showed good adherence and considerable penetration into the base material, which varied with laser treatment conditions and <b>initial</b> <b>coating</b> thicknesses. Under conditions studied, laser treated alloys presented a dendritic structure. The degree of dilution increased as both laser scanning rate and <b>initial</b> <b>coating</b> thickness decreased.
