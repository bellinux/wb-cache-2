5|$|Brothers Tan Kioe Lie and Tan Kioe Gie are {{preparing}} to leave their Cicuruk home to find work: Kioe Lie will go to Bandung, while Kioe Gie will go to Batavia (now Jakarta) and become a letter-setter. As they are packing, Kioe Lie's fiancée Gouw Hap Nio visits. She leaves some snacks with their father, the poor farmer Tan Lauw Pe, before going home, promising {{to take care of}} Pe while his sons are away. The brothers finish packing, say goodbye to their father, and head <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> station.|$|E
5|$|Back in Oslo, {{his colleagues}} throw him a {{farewell}} party, but Odda timid manis {{uncomfortable with the}} attention. As the party moves to a co-worker's apartment, he ends up getting accidentally locked out. He climbs up a scaffold, {{trying to reach the}} apartment window, and ends up in a young boy's room. The boy asks him to stay and wait for him to fall asleep, but Odd falls asleep first. He oversleeps in the unfamiliar room and arrives too late <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> he was to drive on his final working day. He is left standing on the platform without any fixed points in his life, with nothing but a life of emptiness stretching out before him.|$|E
5|$|Later, Morales and Ramsey {{receive a}} report about a stolen car {{that matches the}} one from the Turner and Cook murders. While {{investigating}} a sand pit, they encounter the Phantom. Morales shoots at him but misses, causing him to run into the woods. The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train, but is shot in the leg. While the officers are waiting <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> to pass, the Phantom escapes. They continue their search, but never find him. Years later during the Christmas season of 1976, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen on someone standing in line.|$|E

5000|$|General fast trains ( [...] , {{which can}} be {{shortened}} to , [...] ) are slower passenger trains that stop at around half of the stations along the way, resulting in a longer travel time than <b>the</b> fast <b>trains.</b> <b>The</b> top speed is 120 km/h. Route numbers are always four numeric digits—a numeric prefix from 1-5 followed by a 3-digit route number. Numbers 1001-1998 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> running through three or more railway bureaus, 2001-3998 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> running through two railway bureaus, and 4001-5998 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>trains</b> that run in only one railway bureau.|$|R
5|$|On 5 February 2015, Network Rail's tracklaying machine {{reached the}} end of the line at Tweedbank station where a large crowd had gathered. As there was not enough track <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> to {{complete}} tracklaying into the second platform, it had to return the next day. The formal completion took place on 12 February when Keith Brown clipped the final length of rail into place. During the period of construction, more than 1,000 rails were laid across 90,000 sleepers. With the infrastructure complete, attention was turned to the installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising the stations. A GSM-R system controlled from the IECC next to Edinburgh Waverley was in place by April 2015.|$|E
5|$|Part Three {{starts with}} the prefectural tournament still in progress. After another win by Seishu, Akane is hospitalized due to an {{unspecified}} illness. Initially, Akaishi's play is affected by worrying about Akane's condition. Ko continues to perform well and promises Akane {{to go on a}} date with her if Seishu reaches Koshien. However, Akane's illness is more severe than expected, and she is scheduled for surgery {{on the morning of the}} prefectural final against Ryuō. Before the game begins, Ko tells Aoba he loves her more than anyone, but in such a way she thinks he is lying until after Seishu wins in extra innings, clinching a Koshien berth. In the final chapter, the morning before traveling to Koshien, Akaishi visits Akane recovering in the hospital and Ko and Aoba head <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> station holding hands.|$|E
5|$|Spielberg used doves for the seagulls that Henry scares into {{striking}} the German plane because the real gulls {{used in the}} first take did not fly. In December 1988, Lucasfilm ordered 1,000 disease-free gray rats for the catacombs scenes from the company that supplied the snakes and bugs for the previous films. Within five months, 5,000 rats had been bred for the sequence; 1,000 mechanical rats stood in for those that were set on fire. Several thousand snakes of five breeds—including a boa constrictor—were used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> scene, in addition to rubber ones onto which Phoenix could fall. The snakes would slither from their crates, requiring the crew to dig through sawdust after filming to find and return them. Two lions were used, which became nervous because of the rocking motion and flickering lights.|$|E

5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able to jump out of the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E
5|$|While Scully {{consoles}} Patti, {{whose husband}} just died in Scully's arms, Doggett {{reports that he}} cannot find the Shadow Man's body. Scully, fearful {{that he is a}} Super Soldier pursuing Mulder, chases after the train with Doggett and Reyes. An employee who works <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> gets a call on his radio, saying that someone jumped off a train and into a rock quarry. Doggett and Reyes chase after someone they believe to be Mulder, while Scully goes deeper into the quarry. There, she is attacked by the Shadow Man. Suddenly, the Shadow Man is destroyed by the magnetite being mined from the quarry.|$|E
5|$|Sunday, August 24, 1924, was a {{warm summer}} day in Brooklyn, and Helen Palsgraf, a 40-year-old janitor and housekeeper, was taking her two daughters, Elizabeth and Lillian, aged 15 and 12, to Rockaway Beach. Having paid the {{necessary}} fare, {{they were on the}} platform at the East New York station of the LIRR on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, when a train, not theirs, pulled in. As it began to move again, two men raced <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train,</b> and one made it without incident, as the doors had not closed. The other, a man carrying a package, leapt aboard, {{with the help of a}} platform guard pushing him from behind as a member of the train's crew pulled him into the car. But in the process, the man lost the package, which dropped and exploded, for it apparently contained fireworks. Either the force of the explosion or the panicking of those on the platform caused a tall, coin-operated scale to topple onto Helen Palsgraf. No one was hurt enough to spend the night in the hospital, though several people, Palsgraf among them, were listed as injured.|$|E

25|$|Later on 25 June, an English Electric {{unit was}} listed on TradeMe, {{with a start}} price of $29,990. Initially {{thought to be a}} hoax, the train was 'bought' by a four-year-old who clicked on the 'Buy Now' <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train.</b> The train was later sold for $30,000 on 2 July 2012 at 1:42pm when the auction closed. At the time no numbers had been given <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> sold as GWRC had nine two-car sets {{awaiting}} sale or scrap. The set purchased was eventually revealed as motor car DM 562 and trailer D 2149, which arrived in Nelson on 21 August 2012, after being transported by road from the Wellington railway yards onto the Interislander ferry the following day.|$|E

25|$|A direct {{train service}} to the main railway station, Gara de Nord, runs from the Airport railway station, about 900 meters from the airport.

The next phase of the expansion aims to locate the train station in the airport itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason that}} the train stopped in North Platte was because the town was a {{designated}} tender point for steam trains. Stopping the train allowed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> crews to relubricate the wheels, top off the water levels in the tanks, and other things for maintenance of the locomotive. This practice continued until the Union Pacific Railroad switched to diesel locomotives.|$|E
25|$|A {{train is}} a {{connected}} series of rail vehicles that move along the track. Propulsion <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>train</b> {{is provided by}} a separate locomotive or from individual motors in self-propelled multiple units. Most trains carry a revenue load, although non-revenue cars exist for the railway's own use, such as for maintenance-of-way purposes. The engine driver (engineer in North America) controls the locomotive or other power cars, although people movers and some rapid transits are under automatic control.|$|E
