The company {{appears to be}} falling apart until a mystery company puts up some money to keep it going. Gordon discovers to his surprise that it was Wayne who was behind the rescue. Although {{the father and son}} have been on opposing sides for some time, Gordon remarks that it appears that Wayne might have changed for the better. As he settles into life with new wife Beryl and her son, Robert in Melbourne, Gordon finds himself content with life.|$|E
500|$|The diaries {{of writers}} and journalists such as William Camden, Celia Fiennes, Daniel Defoe, John Byng and William Cobbett {{illustrate}} {{the decline of}} Ely after the 14th century plague and the 16th century reformation {{which led to the}} dissolution of the monastery in 1539. In the 1607 edition of Britannia, chorographic surveyor William Camden records that [...] "as for Ely it selfe, it is no small Citie, or greatly to be counted off either for beauty or frequency and resort, as having an unwholsome aire by reason of the fens round about". In 1698, Celia Fiennes was writing [...] "the Bishop [...] does not Care to stay long in this place not being for his health… they have lost their Charter… and its a shame [...] does not see it better ordered and ye buildings and streetes put in a better Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but ye takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle wch is of vast advantage". Daniel Defoe, when writing in the Eastern Counties section of A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1722), went [...] "to Ely, whose cathedral, standing in a level flat country, is seen far and wide… that some of it is so antient, totters so much with every gust of wind, looks so like a decay, and seems so near it, that when ever it does fall, all that 'tis likely will be thought strange in it, will be, that it did not fall a hundred years sooner". On his way to a Midlands tour, John Byng visited Ely on 5July 1790 staying at the Lamb Inn. In his diary he writes that [...] "the town [...] is mean, to the extreme… those withdrawn, their dependancies must decay". Recording in his Rural Rides on 25March 1830, William Cobbett reports that [...] "Ely is what one may call a miserable little town: very prettily situated, but poor and mean. <b>Everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the decline, as, indeed, is the case everywhere, where the clergy are the masters".|$|E

60|$|All this greatly charmed Euphemia. It was so cute, so complete. There were no {{interviews}} with disagreeable trades-people, {{none of the}} ordinary annoyances of housekeeping. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done with a bell, a speaking-tube or a crank.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a funny thing," [...] he said. [...] "Like {{waking up}} after you've been asleep. <b>Everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> getting clearer. The dog's name was Marie. My wife's dog, you know. And {{she had a}} mole on her chin." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, Lewis {{continued}} {{to feel the}} pain of inadequacy. She recalls, [...] "On T.V., all of the commercials were white. In the magazines you saw white. All the models <b>were</b> white. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saying 'white is right'." ...|$|R

60|$|Owen {{stopped and}} looked round. A cab was {{standing}} across the road. He signalled to it. He felt incapable of walking home.

I should play others like it. <b>Everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{slipping}} away from me. I can smell the supper cooking in my little kitchen at Clematis Villa. Delicious! My God, I can't bear it any longer! Here goes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Christmas, indeed. I can't {{see that}} it is {{anything}} for us to rejoice over. Other people may be glad enough, but what with winter coming on I'd sooner it was spring than Christmas.

Hang the luck, but <b>everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going wrong." [...] And Ben grated his teeth, in a mood hard to explain.|$|E
60|$|That, however, {{which made}} the deepest {{impression}} on me during this visit was {{the manner in which}} the work of training the young <b>is</b> conducted. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done with an amount of wisdom and vigour which cannot fail to tell most beneficially and extensively on future generations.|$|R

6000|$|Men {{living in}} {{expensive}} tenements suffer from chronic sore throat, and {{will tell you}} cheerily that [...] "we've got typhoid in Calcutta now." [...] Is the pest ever out of it? <b>Everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built {{with a view to}} its comfort. It can lodge comfortably on roofs, climb along from the gutter-pipe to piazza, or rise from sink to verandah and thence to the topmost story. But Calcutta says that all is sound and produces figures to prove it; at the same time admitting that healthy cut flesh will not readily heal. Further evidence may be dispensed with.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{something}} bigger coming," [...] he said. [...] "Here <b>everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going on much the same, but over there you feel it. Something growing silently {{out of all}} this blood and mud. I find myself wondering what the men are staring at, but when I look there's nothing {{as far as my}} field- glasses will reach but waste and desolation. And it isn't only on the faces of our own men. It's {{in the eyes of the}} prisoners too. As if they saw something. A funny ending to the war, if the people began to think." ...|$|E

60|$|At {{this present}} writing, snow is {{falling in the}} street, and the weather is very cold, but not so cold as it was yesterday. I dined with Lord Normanby on Sunday last. <b>Everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> queer and uncomfortable in the {{diplomatic}} way, and he is rather bothered and worried, to my thinking. I found young Sheridan (Mrs. Norton's brother) the attaché. I know him very well, {{and he is a}} good man for my sight-seeing purposes. There are to be no theatricals unless the times should so adjust themselves as to admit of their being French, to which the Markis seems to incline, as a bit of conciliation and a popular move.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} say I'm not." [...] Then Lady Laura {{explained}} to her father, probably for {{the third or fourth}} time, exactly what was their guest's position. [...] "Oh, a scrutiny. We didn't use to have any scrutinies at Loughton, did we? Ah, me; well, <b>everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going to the dogs. I'm told they're attacking the Church now." [...] Lady Laura glanced at Phineas; but neither of them said a word. [...] "I don't quite understand it; but they tell me that the Tories are going to disestablish the Church. I'm very glad I'm out of it all. Things have come to such a pass that I don't see how a gentleman is to hold office now-a-days. Have you seen Chiltern lately?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{was only}} towards {{the summer of}} 1819 that Shelley read the Endymion. He wrote of it thus {{in a letter to}} his publisher, Mr. Ollier, September 6, 1819. 'I have read ... Keats's poem.... Much praise is due to me for having read it, the author's {{intention}} appearing to be that no person should possibly get to the end of it. Yet it is full of some of the highest and the finest gleams of poetry: indeed, <b>everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> viewed by the mind of a poet which is described in it. I think, if he had printed about fifty pages of fragments from it, I should have been led to admire Keats as a poet more than I ought--of which there is now no danger.' Shelley regarded the Hymn to Pan, in the first Book of Endymion, as affording 'the surest promise of ultimate excellence.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Lyrics {{and music}} {{were written by}} David Jost, Madeline Juno and Dave Roth. [...] "Error" [...] is {{described}} as pop music. In the song, Madeline Juno deals with her heartache.

50|$|The media <b>was</b> abound and <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> turning around. A new {{single and}} album were {{scheduled}} for release the next month along with TV appearances {{on some of the}} biggest music shows in the country. However, the single would be cancelled. The album, Maxiumum Trance containing trance remixes of old material would be released as scheduled. Their new television appearances were cancelled as well.|$|R
60|$|Not {{without much}} {{difficulty}} did the three youths {{manage to get}} the ropes disentangled from the rear wheels and the back axle. It was found {{that one of the}} hooks had gone into a tire, causing a blow-out that, in the general excitement, nobody had noticed. But otherwise <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> all right, apart, of course, from the broken brake rod, and the boys were thankful.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have for}} days been {{watching}} {{for a chance}} of speaking to you alone! Always so many people about you. My heart is so full, so hot every word goes into it, deep deep. The old life seems a dream. <b>Everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> new. When a month ago I followed {{you out of the}} Said Goro, you said that if I wanted to know the meaning and power of this teaching, I must pray! And I tried to pray, and it becomes easier as every day I pray as I go about, and in the morning and evening; and I don't know how to pray as I ought, but my heart is light, and I know it's all true, and my mind is made up, and I have been wanting to tell you, and so is Sogoivnowut, and we four talk together, and all want to be baptized.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was Challoner's {{passenger}} when he {{was killed}} at Sheerness. That was a queer unexpected experience, you may have supposed it an agony of terror, but indeed there was no fear in it at all. At any rate, I do not remember a moment of fear; it has gone clean out of my memory if ever it was there. We were swimming high and fast, three thousand feet or so, in a clear, sweet air over the town of Sheerness. The river, with a string of battleships, was far away to the west of us, and the endless grey-blue flats of the Thames to the north. The sun was low behind a bank of cloud. I was watching a motor-car, which seemed to be crawling slowly enough, though, no doubt, it was making a respectable pace, between two hedges down below. It is extraordinary how slowly <b>everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> going when one sees it from such an height.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{when you}} come in sight of Moffitt--my, oh, my! Well, you come in smell of it about as soon. That gas out there ain't odorless, like the Pittsburg gas, and so it's {{perfectly}} safe; but the smell isn't bad--about as bad as the finest kind of benzine. Well, the first thing that strikes you {{when you come}} to Moffitt is the notion {{that there has been a}} good warm, growing rain, and the town's come up overnight. That's in the suburbs, the annexes, and additions. But it ain't shabby--no shanty-farm business; nice brick and frame houses, some of 'em Queen Anne style, and all of 'em looking as if they had come to stay. And when you drive up from the depot you think everybody's moving. <b>Everything</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> piled into the street; old houses made over, and new ones going up everywhere. You know the kind of street Main Street always used to be in our section--half plank-road and turnpike, and the rest mud-hole, and a lot of stores and doggeries strung along with false fronts a story higher than the back, and here and there a decent building with the gable end to the public; and a court-house and jail and two taverns and three or four churches. Well, they're all there in Moffitt yet, but architecture has struck it hard, and they've got a lot of new buildings that needn't be ashamed of themselves anywhere; the new court-house is as big as St. Peter's, and the Grand Opera-house is in the highest style of the art. You can't buy a lot on that street for much less than you can buy a lot in New York--or you couldn't when the boom was on; I saw the place just when the boom was in its prime. I went out there to work the newspapers in the syndicate business, and I got one of their men to write me a real bright, snappy account of the gas; and they just took me in their arms and showed me everything. Well, it was wonderful, and it was beautiful, too! To see a whole community stirred up like that was--just like a big boy, all hope and high spirits, and no discount on the remotest future; nothing but perpetual boom to the end of time--I tell you it warmed your blood. Why, there were some things about it that made you think what a nice kind of world this would be if people ever took hold together, instead of each fellow fighting it out on his own hook, and devil take the hindmost. They made up their minds at Moffitt that if they wanted their town to grow they'd got to keep their gas public property. So they extended their corporation line so as to take in pretty much the whole gas region round there; and then the city took possession of every well that was put down, and held it for the common good. Anybody that's a mind to come to Moffitt and start any kind of manufacture can have all the gas he wants free; and for fifteen dollars a year you can have all the gas you want to heat and light your private house. The people hold on to it for themselves, and, as I say, it's a grand sight to see a whole community hanging together and working for the good of all, instead of splitting up into as many different cut-throats as there are able-bodied citizens. See that fellow?" [...] Fulkerson broke off, and indicated with a twirl of his head a short, dark, foreign-looking man going out of the door. [...] "They say that fellow's a Socialist. I think it's a shame they're allowed to come here. If they don't like the way we manage our affairs let 'em stay at home," [...] Fulkerson continued. [...] "They do a lot of mischief, shooting off their mouths round here. I believe in free speech and all that; but I'd like to see these fellows shut up in jail and left to jaw one another to death. We don't want any of their poison." ...|$|E
