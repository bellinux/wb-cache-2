30|$|These {{findings}} are consistent with <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> study conducted by Bardovi-Harlig et al. (2008) who found that knowledge of formulaic sequences, regardless of language-cultural background, plays a significant role in determining the proficiency level of language learners. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> of <b>the</b> current study are also in line with <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> study conducted by Qi and Ding (2011) who found that more proficient language learners possess a higher inventory of formulaic sequence knowledge. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> current study further support <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> study conducted by Rafieyan (2018) who found a strong positive relationship between language learners’ knowledge of formulaic sequences and their level of language proficiency. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> study, however, do not support <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> obtained in <b>the</b> studies conducted by Staples et al. (2013) and Serrano et al. (2015) who found a lack of correlation between knowledge of formulaic sequences and language proficiency.|$|R
