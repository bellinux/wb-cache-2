40|$|Revised 5 / 10 / 2 M. "The <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> attacks {{all species}} of elm, {{especially}} Siberian elm (commonly called Chinese elm) and American elm. The insect feeds on the leaves, causing the leaves {{to dry up}} and die. This foliage feeding by itself generally will not kill the tree. But it will weaken the tree {{and make it more}} susceptible to branch dieback and attack from other insects and diseases, such as Dutch elm disease. This serious disease of American elm is not transmitted by the <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> but is carried by the elm bark beetle, which does attack weakened trees. The <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> also may become a household nuisance by migrating into homes and buildings during the fall months...|$|R

50|$|Cedar elm is {{susceptible}} to Dutch elm disease (DED), though less so than American elm, and moderately damaged by the <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> Xanthogaleruca luteola. The tree also suffers from a vascular wilt, the symptoms often confused with those of DED.|$|R
40|$|History, identification, and {{indoor and}} outdoor control of the <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> are discussed. The <b>elm</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> is an <b>imported</b> pest, first found in the United States in 1834. Common {{throughout}} Nebraska, it is almost exclusively a pest of elms, including the American, Siberian and other varieties. Japanese Zelkova is also readily attacked. Adults (beetles) vary in color from yellow to olive green, and have a black stripe near the outside of each wing cover. They can be confused with other beetles of similar appearance (western corn rootworm, striped cucumber beetle), but they are distinctive in that they occur {{early in the season}} and have three dark spots on the body segment behind the head...|$|R
50|$|Further disease-resistance {{trials were}} {{conducted}} by both the USDA and the United States National Arboretum which confirmed the clone had a fair level of resistance to Dutch elm disease. 'Delaware' is susceptible to Elm Yellows, but resistant to the <b>Elm</b> <b>Leaf</b> <b>Beetle</b> Xanthogaleruca luteola.|$|R
