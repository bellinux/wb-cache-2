25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of The Shield in June 2014, Reigns (now a singles wrestler) was quickly inserted into world title contention that month and he headlined the next two pay-per-view events. The first when, two weeks after Rollins' betrayal, Reigns won a battle royal on the June 16 episode of Raw to gain {{a spot in the}} vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship ladder match on June 17 at Money in the Bank, but failed to win the title during the main event match. The second was July 20's Battleground, where Reigns again unsuccessfully challenged for the world title, this time in a fatal four-way main event match (also involving Kane, Randy Orton and defending champion John Cena). The following night on Raw, Reigns started a feud with Randy Orton, which led to a match between the two on August 17 at SummerSlam, where Reigns defeated Orton. Meanwhile, Reigns' former teammates Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins had been feuding over Rollins' betrayal, with Rollins beating Ambrose in five matches and ultimately injuring Ambrose in the storyline. This led to a feud between Rollins and Reigns, where a singles match was set up for Night of Champions on September 21, even though six days before the pay-per-view event he cleanly defeated Rollins in a singles match on Raw. Then Reigns developed a legitimate <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> which required surgery a day or two prior to Night of Champions and, as a result, Rollins was declared the winner via forfeit, while Reigns was ruled out of action indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the predictive effect of IMA in <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernias.</b> Methods. Three groups () of rats were operated. Group I aimed to mimic incarceration, group II aimed the strangulation, and group III was the sham group. IMA and LDH measurements were made. Results. IMA levels {{were significantly higher}} in strangulation mimicking group and IMA levels were normal at postoperative 6 th hour in incarceration mimicking group. LDH levels were significantly higher in both incarceration and strangulation mimicking groups. Conclusion. IMA {{seems to be an}} effective marker in <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernias</b> to predict necrosis. But we need further studies to generalise this hypothesis...|$|R

50|$|Biomeshes are {{increasingly}} popular since their first use in 1999 and their subsequent introduction {{on the market}} in 2003. Their use is an instance of regenerative medicine. Unlike synthetic non-absorbable meshes, they are absorbable, and can be used for repair in an infected environment, such as an <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia.</b> Moreover, they seem to improve comfort and presumably, they reduce the risk of inguinodynia.They have been tested after mesh-related inguinodynia. Some meshes have a price comparable to the high end of synthetic meshes, the cheapest ($500) being Surgisis-Biodesign, manufactured by Cook Group, made from the extra cellular matrix of pig small intestinal submucosa. Currently, there exists one synthetic totally absorbable mesh, Tigr Matrix, manufactured by Novus Scientific, on the US market (510(k) Food and Drug Administration clearance) since 2010 and on the EU market since 2011. It only has one 3-year pre-clinical evidence on sheep.|$|E

50|$|On the June 17 {{episode of}} Main Event, Rollins, acting {{on behalf of}} The Authority, entered himself into the {{traditional}} Money in the Bank ladder match for a WWE World Heavyweight Championship contract at Money in the Bank, which he won after Kane knocked out Ambrose and held the ladder in place for Rollins to climb. Rollins defeated Ambrose twice, the first being at Battleground in July via forfeit (after their match was called off by Triple H since Ambrose attacked Rollins backstage) and the second in August at SummerSlam in a lumberjack match. On the August 24 episode of Raw, Rollins defeated Ambrose in a Falls Count Anywhere match and injured him (in the storyline) after executing a Curb Stomp through cinder blocks. In September, a match between Rollins and Roman Reigns was set up for Night of Champions, but six days before the pay-per-view event, Reigns cleanly defeated Rollins in a singles match on Raw. However, Reigns developed a legitimate <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> which required surgery a day or two prior to Night of Champions and therefore Rollins was declared the winner via forfeit, but he was then attacked by a returning Ambrose. On the September 29 episode of Raw, Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury aligned themselves with The Authority and started acting as bodyguards to Rollins. At Hell in a Cell on October 26, Rollins defeated Ambrose in the Hell in a Cell main event match after Bray Wyatt interfered and attacked Ambrose. At Survivor Series on November 23, Rollins captained Team Authority in a five-on-five elimination tag team match against Team Cena, in which Rollins was the sole survivor and was eliminated by Dolph Ziggler. Rollins continued his feud with Cena in December at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs on December 14, which led to a tables match won by Cena.|$|E

30|$|<b>Incarcerated</b> {{obturator}} <b>hernia</b> is {{a relatively}} rare cause of small bowel obstruction and rather difficult to diagnose preoperatively with physical examinations and plain X-rays. Delayed recognition has been related to increased morbidity and mortality [1 – 3]. However, the application of CT scan for acute abdomen has {{made it easier to}} visualize an <b>incarcerated</b> obturator <b>hernia</b> in the pelvis [4 – 8]. On the other hand, the application of ultrasound for acute abdomen has been widely discussed in recent years. However, very few reports were published for demonstrating the usefulness of ultrasound for the diagnosis of <b>incarcerated</b> obturator <b>hernia</b> [9 – 13]. In this report, we retrospectively evaluated the significance of ultrasound for the recognition of <b>incarcerated</b> obturator <b>hernia</b> and demonstrate some of the potential pitfalls of ultrasound in this application.|$|R
5000|$|Reigns, while {{actually}} debuting on WWEs main roster as {{a villain}} in November 2012, would never {{actually have a}} villain single run due debuting as part of The Shield. By late 2013, Reigns would be getting the biggest push between the three members of The Shield (Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins), as he got to win as sole survivor his Survivor Series 5-on-5 elimination match and the most elimination at 4, being {{the only member of}} The Shield to defeat CM Punk and breaking another record at the Royal Rumble for the most elimination in a single Royal Rumble match at 12, also eliminating both Ambrose and Rollins from the match and ending up being the runner-up (Reigns would get cheered over eventual winner Batista, as fans wanted fan favorite and popoular Daniel Bryan to win instead of Batista), being eventually billed as the leader of The Shield during their feud with Evolution (Batista, Randy Orton and Triple H) between April and May 2014. After The Shield broke up in June 2014, the heroic Ambrose and the now villain Rollins would change their ring attire and theme music (unlike Reigns, who retained much of The Shields aesthetic including ring attire, a remixed version of the groups theme music and ring entrance), eventually evolving their characters during their high acclaimed feud that won the Pro Wrestling Illustrated (PWI) award for the [...] "Best Feud". While Ambrose was being voted by PWIs reader as the [...] "Most Popular Wrestler of the Year" [...] in 2014 and 2015 and Rollins as both the [...] "Wrestler of the Year" [...] and the [...] "Most Hated Wrestler of the Year" [...] in 2015, Reigns had finished in second place for the WON [...] "Most Overrated" [...] award in both 2014 and 2015. When breaking up The Shield, WWE thought Reigns was the most popular between the three and thus pushed Reigns in the main event, immediately going after the world title. However, as soon as his singles career on WWEs main roster started, Reigns positive reactions started to diminish, culminating in Orton getting cheered over him during their match at SummerSlam. After suffering a legit <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> in September 2014, Reigns positive crowd reactions following his return in December further diminished, culminating in Reigns [...] "getting booed out of the building" [...] after winning the 2015 Royal Rumble.|$|E
40|$|AbstractVarious {{post-operative}} complications {{are reported}} with hip arthroplasty. Acute abdominal complications are rare; however, they {{are associated with}} adverse outcomes and increased mortality. In the present study, we report a life-threatening case of <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> following hip hemiarthroplasty. We report a rare case of immediately inguinal <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> following cemented Austin Moore hemiarthroplasty for femoral neck fracture in an eighty-three years old man. Three recommendations for this critical complication following hip arthroplasty are as follows. First, a pre-operative evaluation must include a history {{on the development of}} hernia and a detailed physical examination.

40|$|Background : Incarceration and {{strangulation}} are {{the most}} feared complications of inguinal <b>hernia.</b> Till date, <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernias</b> have traditionally been treated by conventional open repair. Reports are now available for the feasibility of laparoscopic repair of <b>incarcerated</b> inguinal <b>hernia.</b> Here, we described our experience with the transperitoneal approach for <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernias.</b> Materials and Methods : Between January 2008 and May 2008, four patients were presented {{with a history of}} irreducible hernia, abdominal distention and vomiting. All the patients had right-sided inguinal hernia. Reductions of the hernia contents were not possible in any patient. The patients were treated on emergency basis with laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair. Retrospective analyses of all the patients were done. Results: Reduction of the bowel was achieved in all but one patient, who required the division of the internal ring on lateral side. Transperitoneal mesh repair was performed. No major complications were encountered. One patient developed seroma formation that was treated conservatively. Conclusion: Laparoscopic transperitoneal approach has the advantage of observation of the hernia content {{for a longer period of}} time. The division of the internal ring can be done under direct vision. Other intra-abdominal pathology and opposite side hernia can be diagnosed and treated at the same time...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first case {{reported}} in the literature of small bowel obstruction due to internal <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> throught a diagnosed bilateral broad ligament defect, and treated by laparoscopy. A 36 -year-old white woman, gravida 0, para 0, was admitted to our hospital with intestinal obstruction symptoms. A laparoscopic approach was performed with 3 trocars and internal <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> due to a defect in the right broad ligament was found. There was a similar defect in the left broad ligament. The small bowel, once reduced,appeared viable. Closure of both defects was carried out by laparoscopy with 2 - 0 monofilament absorbable running suture. The patient’s postoperative course was unremarkable and she was dicharged from the hospital 4 days after the surgical procedure. The classification of defect was a bilateral fenestrae type I defect.

40|$|Incarcerated {{inguinal}} hernia is often encountered by surgeons in daily practice. Although rare, hernial reduction en masse {{is a potential}} complication of manual reduction of an <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia.</b> Manual reduction was performed {{in a case of}} Zollinger classification type VII (combined type) hernia in which the indirect hernia portion included an incarcerated small intestine. This procedure caused hernial reduction en masse, but this went unnoticed, and the remaining portion of the direct hernia in the inguinal region was treated surgically by the anterior approach. Because the incarcerated small bowel that had been reduced en masse was not completely obstructed, the patient’s general condition was not greatly affected, {{and he was able to}} resume eating. Twenty days after surgery, he developed sudden abdominal pain as a result of gastrointestinal perforation. When performing manual reduction of an <b>incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> in cases after self-reduction over a long period, the clinician should always be aware of the possibility of reduction en masse...|$|E
30|$|Complications of {{thoracic}} hernias include trauma, obstruction, incarceration and strangulation.

40|$|An {{appropriate}} {{approach to}} surgical patients in emergency situations needs meticulous consideration, {{especially those with}} <b>incarcerated</b> inguinal <b>hernias,</b> since delay or inappropriate treatment may lead to severe complications or even death. According to this fact, medical records of patients with <b>incarcerated</b> inguinal <b>hernias</b> referred to emergency department of Sina hospital were surveyed during a 40 year period by a retrospective study. Routine criteria indicating strangulation in <b>incarcerated</b> inguinal <b>hernia</b> were compared between a group of patients with intestinal necrosis and those without this complication. Among 87 patients with relatively complete records which were all operated (immediately or with some delay), 13 patients had intestinal necrosis for whom intestinal resection was performed.

40|$|Background: Intestinal {{obstruction}} is {{a common}} cause of abdominal surgery in pediatric age group. A delay in {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this disease can lead to serious complications. This study has been conducted to evaluate different causes of intestinal obstruction. Methods: 231 children were operated on intestinal obstruction. Prior to surgery all patients underwent a labarotory examination consisting of CBC, abdominal X–ray and, if necessary, gastrointestinal (GI) study with contrast media or CT-Scan and sonography. Final diagnosis was reached by surgical findings. Results: 231 children were operated due to intestinal obstruction. Among these, 128 cases, (55. 4 %) were male and 103 cases (44. 6 %) were female. The causes of intestinal obstruction were: <b>Incarcerated</b> <b>hernia</b> in 41 cases (17. 7 %), GI atresia in 38 cases (16. 4 %), malrotation in 32 cases (13. 8 %), anorectal malformation in 29 cases (12. 5 %) and benign or malignant masses inside or outside GI tract in 28 cases (12. 1 %).
