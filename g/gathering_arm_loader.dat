40|$|A {{mining machine}} has been {{designed}} and fabricated to mine coal from room and pillar operations combining high pressure waterjet cutting and mechanical fragmentation. Waterjets are used to slot the coal face with an advancing plow wedge then breaking out larger coal pieces. The machine has the following advantages:. simply built around a disassembled longwall chock and <b>gathering</b> <b>arm</b> <b>loader</b> apron;. few moving parts which are simply and inexpensively maintained;. provides immediate roof support in the face working area;. coal produced is larger, with resulting lower preparation cost;. no dust is generated;. risk of spark generation is virtually eliminated. ISTORICAL BACKGROUND The World's energy demand grows annually, and with a diminishing supply base {{it is important that}} each fuel resource be fully utilized. For centuries coal has played an important part in fueling the development of civilization, and as the oil reserves of the world rapidly diminish (U. S. production [...] ...|$|E

40|$|There is {{a demand}} in mining for more {{investments}} in continuous loading methods {{in order to}} achieve higher productivity and lower costs. The creation of a better environment is another major goal which could be attained by using remote or automatic control of the continuously working machines. The loading and transportation of ore {{is an important part of}} underground mining. After blasting the ore must usually be moved to a chute connected with the main level where it is transported by train or truck to crusher and hoist. This thesis deals with the first link in this chain, i. e. loading and transportation of ore from the face to the chute in hard rock conditions (in Sweden). The blasted ore is relatively coarse and hard to handle in a continuous process. The development so far has there-fore been directed towards the later steps of the process where the ore has been crushed to a more convenient size. Today there are many applications of this, e. g. conveying and hoisting of crushed ore. At present there is no continuous technique for loading and transportation of ore from the face. This thesis presents a new technique for continuous loading and transportation of ore from the face underground, which has technical, economical and environmental potential in the future mine using remote or automatic control. The new technique consists of a developed digging <b>arm</b> <b>loader</b> together with a belt conveyor. The technique has been chosen comprehensively using systematics for evaluation, model tests with theory formation, specification of technical and environmental demands and projection of the new technique in a production system including a technical and economical systems analysis. The thesis shows that the system digging <b>arm</b> <b>loader</b> - belt conveyor has good possibilities to meet the technical and environmental demands. Economically the continuous system is better than the LHD in sublevel caving but not as good as the LHD used in the "continuous" lay-out. The digging <b>arm</b> <b>loader</b> - belt conveyor system has a good potential for future remote or automatic control. Godkänd; 1982; 20070502 (ysko...|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} skid-steer <b>loader</b> <b>arms</b> {{were designed}} using a hinge {{at the rear}} of the machine to pivot the <b>loader</b> <b>arm</b> up into the air in an arc that swings up over the top of the operator. This design tends to limit the usable height to how long the <b>loader</b> <b>arm</b> is and the height of that pivot point. In the raised position the front of the <b>loader</b> <b>arm</b> moves towards the rear of the machine, requiring the operator to move extremely close to or press up against the side of a tall container or other transport vehicle to get the bucket close enough to dump accurately. At the highest arm positions the bucket may overflow the rear of the bucket and spill directly onto the top of the machine's cab.|$|R

This allows the <b>loader</b> <b>arm</b> to have much greater operating height while retaining a compact design, and allows the vertical movement to be less of an arc and more straight-up vertical, to keep the bucket forward of the operator's cab, allowing safe dumping into tall containers or vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 104 - 105) The partisan {{movement in}} the Soviet Union during World War II began almost immediately after the German invasion because the occupiers treated the Soviet citizens brutally. The citizens responded by <b>gathering</b> <b>arms</b> and banding together to try and defeat their enemy. In the beginning they operated on their own initiative and carried out missions in the German rear. They gathered intelligence information about supply routes and schedules, and they attacked German supply convoys, trains, and German police stations. They also killed Nazi collaborators. Additionally, Stalin ordered Russian army soldiers who had been cut off from their military units to form partisan units. Then, to increase partisan successes {{and to keep the}} partisans from turning against the Soviet Union, Party members and military personnel who had been trained in sabotage and espionage activities were sent to partisan units. By 1943, the partisans were organized under Soviet leadership and operating like a branch of the military. To keep them adequately supplied for the war, artillery was flown to partisan guarded airstrips. The partisans prevented supplies and manpower from reaching the Germans, supplied the Soviet military with essential intelligence information about German planned operations, partnered with the Soviet military on some of their offensive operations and retook areas that were being controlled by German administrators. Approximately 500, 000 people worked as partisans during the war in the Soviet Union, and approximately the same number of Germans and their allies died in partisan controlled areas in the Soviet Union during WWII...|$|R
