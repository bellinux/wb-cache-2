30|$|In {{practical}} applications of liquid crystals [LCs], {{the study of}} the LC alignment near the surface including in-plane and out-of-plane directions is crucial. Various alignment techniques have been introduced to create physical/chemical anisotropy {{on the surface of the}} alignment layer [1 – 11]. The most representative skill used in industry is the rubbing method which has high productivity. However, since rubbing is a contact method, it often produces a <b>fine</b> <b>scratch</b> on the alignment layer during the process, and it results in several disadvantages, such as the rubbing mura at a dark level of liquid crystal displays [LCDs].|$|E

5000|$|A finer or softer {{abrasive}} {{will tend}} to leave much <b>finer</b> <b>scratch</b> marks which may even be invisible {{to the naked eye}} (a [...] "grainless finish"); a softer abrasive may not even significantly abrade a certain object.

A graminivorous diet with a high amount of abrasive items is in agreement with the broad teeth of Malpaisomys, considered as adapted to grass consumption.

40|$|Specimens {{having an}} initial {{diameter}} of 0. 125 inch were cut from commercially pure sintered and swaged tungsten rods. The effect of various surface treatments on the ductility of tungsten was {{evaluated by the}} use of a bend test. The criterion used to determine the relative ductilities was the final bend angle of the specimens. Results showed that the bend ductility of the tungsten specimens increased with increasing depths of the surface removed by electropolishing. When specimens electropolished to a depth sufficient to produce a marked increase in the ductility over that of the as-received surface condition were subsequently scratched with emery paper, the ductility achieved by electropolishing was greatly reduced. Removal of similar depths of the surface by grinding as were removed by electropolishing did not produce any appreciable increase in the ductility of the specimens. The ductility of specimens tested in the as-received surface condition and those having an electropolished surface exhibited a great sensitivity to deflection rate, the electropolished specimens being more ductile over the range of deflection rates tested.

Burials at CNS date to the Early Colonial Period (A. D. 1533 - 1620), while burials at CSMME date to the Mid- to Late-Colonial Period (A. D. 1625 - 1760). Dental microwear and stable isotope investigations reveal a highly correlated dietary profile across both sites, which suggests consistent subsistence practices across the Colonial Period, insofar as can be measured using these techniques. However, there is significant differences between CNS and CSMME in dental microwear features indicating the foods consumed by all members at each site—since sex and age are not significantly different between the two sites—is perhaps attributable {{to the influence of}} Spanish colonial rule to the degree to which these dental microwear features capture larger patterns in these two populations.

50|$|Isotopic {{analyses}} of South American gomphotheres suggest a wide diet for Notiomastodon platensis, {{except for the}} fossils unearthed at the localities in Santiago del Estero and La Carolina in Ecuador. Isotope analyses suggested an exclusive C4 diet, whereas every other South American locality indicates an exclusive C3 or mixed C3 and C4 diet. The results also support the latitudinal gradient of C3 and C4 grasses. The stereomicrowear analyses for N. platensis exhibited average scratch and pit values, which place it within the extant mixed-feeder morphospace and the higher frequency of <b>fine</b> <b>scratches</b> indicated the ingestion of C3 grasses. Alternatively, the presence of coarse and hypercoarse scratches along with gouges and large pits suggests the ingestion of foliage and lignified portions. The plant microfossil analysis recovered fragments of conifer tracheid and vessel elements with a ray of parenchyma cells, which corroborates the consumption of wood plants, pollen grains, spores, and fibers. The Aguas de Araxa gomphotheres were feeding generalists and consumed wood elements, leaves, and C3 grasses.

40|$|An initial {{review of}} the subject emphasises the need for {{improved}} fuel efficiency in vehicles and the possible role of aluminium in reducing weight. The problems of formability generally in manufacture and of aluminium in particular {{are discussed in the}} light of published data. A range of thirteen commercially available sheet aluminium alloys have been compared with respect to mechanical properties as these affect forming processes and behaviour in service. Four alloys were selected for detailed comparison. The formability and strength of these were investigated in terms of underlying mechanisms of deformation as well as the microstructural characteristics of the alloys including texture, particle dispersion, grain size and composition. In overall terms, good combinations of strength and ductility are achievable with alloys of the 2 xxx and 6 xxx series. Some specific alloys are notably better than others. The strength of formed components is affected by paint baking {{in the final stages of}} manufacture. Generally, alloys of the 6 xxx family are strengthened while 2 xxx and 5 xxx become weaker. Some anomalous behaviour exists, however. Work hardening of these alloys appears to show rather abrupt decreases over certain strain ranges which is probably responsible for the relatively low strains at which both diffuse and local necking occur. Using data obtained from extended range tensile tests, the strain distribution in more complex shapes can be successfully modelled using finite element methods. Sheet failure during forming occurs by abrupt shear fracture in many instances. This condition is favoured by states of biaxial tension, surface defects in the form of <b>fine</b> <b>scratches</b> and certain types of crystallographic texture. The measured limit strains of the materials can be understood on the basis of attainment of a critical shear stress for fracture...|$|R

40|$|Diplodocoid sauropods {{were among}} the most {{successful}} and largest herbivores of the Mesozoic. Here, the systematics and paleoecology of these animals are examined in five parts: a reassessment of the relationships of Australodocus, a phylogenetic analysis of the clade Diplodocoidea, an investigation of feeding behavior in diplodocoid sauropods, an examination of ontogenetic variation in the skull of Diplodocus, and a study of the evolution of tooth shape and replacement rate in Sauropodomorpha. 	Australodocus, previously considered to be a diplodocid, is re-evaluated. Characters previously considered synapomorphies with Diplodocidae are revealed to be either misinterpreted or more widely distributed within Neosauropoda. Six unambiguous synapomorphies, including pneumatization of the centrum and neural arch, suggest titanosauriform affinities for the taxon instead. 	A phylogenetic analysis confirms the assessment from the previous chapter, and also identifies several key relationships for the understanding of diplodocoid evolution. The first of these is the resolution of the plesiomorphic taxon Suuwassea as a basal dicraeosaurid. Also presented is a fully-resolved Rebbachisauridae, with two sub-clades recovered (Limaysaurinae, Nigersaurinae). 	This hypothesis of relatedness was used as a backbone to examine the evolution of feeding strategies in the clade. Some taxa (Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Nigersaurus) were discovered to have squarer snouts and microwear features more consistent with ground-height nonselective browsing (e. g. subparallel <b>fine</b> <b>scratches</b> and small, round pits) than others (Dicraeosaurus, Suuwassea, Tornieria). The microwear features present on the round-snouted taxa—coarser scratches with no preferred directional orientation and large gouges— suggest selective mid-height browsing behavior instead. 	Ontogenetic shape variation in {{at least one of the}} ground-height nonselective browsers (Diplodocus) suggests the possibility of ontogenetic variation in feeding strategy as well, where subadults may have fed selectively. 	 	Although Diplodocoidea is diagnosed in part by narrow-crowned teeth, the inference of at least two distinct feeding strategies for this clade suggests that it is unlikely that the development of narrow crowns in this clade was an adaptation for a particular feeding mode. Histological and proportional data suggest instead that the development of narrow crowns in this clade (and elsewhere) was an adaptation for rapid tooth replacement...|$|R
30|$|Properties, such as surface {{roughness}} and wettability, and characteristics, which {{refer to the}} anatomic structure {{and how it is}} affected by machining, of planed and sanded surfaces differ largely. Microscopical surface analyses show that crushed or damaged cells are more common in abrasive-planed material than in knife-planed wood [18, 19]. More specifically, sanded wood is characterized by a layer of crushed cells at the surface and subsurface, lumens clogged by <b>fine</b> dust, <b>scratches,</b> and packets of micro-fibrils torn out from cell walls [20]. Generally, planed surfaces show less crushed and damaged cells compared to sanded surfaces [21]. However, lower roughness values in sanded surfaces of aspen [22] and paper birch [23] woods compared with that of planed surfaces were observed. According to Richter et al. [24] and Hernández and Cool [23], sanding produces homogeneous surfaces that could reduce the influence of the anatomical structure on the roughness profile.|$|R
50|$|Diplodocoidea is a {{superfamily}} of sauropod dinosaurs, {{which included}} {{some of the}} longest animals of all time, including slender giants like Supersaurus, Diplodocus, Apatosaurus, and Amphicoelias. Most had very long necks and long, whip-like tails; however, one family (the dicraeosaurids) are the only known sauropods to have re-evolved a short neck, presumably an adaptation for feeding low to the ground. This adaptation {{was taken to the}} extreme in the highly specialized sauropod Brachytrachelopan. A study of snout shape and dental microwear in diplodocoids showed that the square snouts, large proportion of pits, and <b>fine</b> subparallel <b>scratches</b> in Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Nigersaurus, and Rebbachisaurus suggest ground-height nonselective browsing; the narrow snouts of Dicraeosaurus, Suuwassea, and Tornieria and the coarse scratches and gouges on the teeth of Dicraeosaurus suggest mid-height selective browsing in those taxa. This taxon is also noteworthy because diplodocoid sauropods had the highest tooth replacement rates of any vertebrates, as exemplified by Nigersaurus, which had new teeth erupting every 30 days.|$|R
