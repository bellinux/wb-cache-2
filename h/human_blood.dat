5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink <b>human</b> <b>blood,</b> most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a normal life and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
40|$|Molecular biology {{studies have}} shown that <b>human</b> {{peripheral}} <b>blood</b> lymphocytes express a dopamine D 5 receptor, whereas no information is available on dopamine D receptor, the other dopamine D 1 -like receptor subtype. Radioligand binding assay investigations with the nonsubtype selective dopamine D 1 -like receptor antagonist [3 H]SCH 23390 as radioligand have suggested the presence of a dopamine D 5 receptor in <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes. However, so far no evidence was provided as whether or not <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes express a dopamine D 1 receptor. In this study, we have investigated dopamine D 1 and D 5 receptor mRNA and the influence of antibodies against dopamine D 1 and D 5 receptors on [3 H]SCH 23390 binding to intact <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes. The two receptors were also analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Dopamine D 5 receptor, but not D 1 mRNA, was detected in <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes. Anti-dopamine D 5 receptor antibodies, but not anti-dopamine D 1 receptor antibodies, significantly decreased [3 H]SCH 23390 binding to <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes. A dark-brown immunoreactivity was visualized in cytospin centrifuged <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes exposed to anti-dopamine D 5, but not to anti-dopamine D 1 receptor antibodies. These data collectively indicate that dopamine D 5 receptor is the only dopamine D 1 -like receptor subtype expressed by <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes...|$|R

5|$|Monocytes {{develop in}} the bone marrow and reach {{maturity}} in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant cytoplasm that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present antigens to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to tissues and organs {{and in doing so}} transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive. There are about 500 million monocytes in one litre of <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b>|$|E

5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre virus, has never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of dopamine D 4 receptor {{was investigated in}} <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes with a radioligand binding assay technique, using [3 H]clozapine as radioligand. [3 H]Clozapine was specifically bound to <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes. The binding was time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and of high affinity, with a dissociation constant (K(d)) value of 0. 34 +/- 0. 02 nM and a maximum density of binding sites (B(max)) value of 27 +/- 1. 4 fmol/ 10 (6) cells. The pharmacological profile of [3 H]clozapine binding to <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes {{was similar to that}} found in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the D 4 clone (D 4. 2 variant). The above results are consistent with molecular biology studies demonstrating the {{expression of}} a dopamine D 4 receptor in immune cells and in <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes. The availability of a rapid and sensitive radioligand binding assay technique for the dopamine D 4 receptor in <b>human</b> peripheral <b>blood</b> lymphocytes may contribute to better define the role of this dopamine receptor subtype in neurological and psychiatric disorders...|$|R

5|$|Seaborg {{remained}} at the University of California, Berkeley, for post-doctoral research. He followed Frederick Soddy's work investigating isotopes {{and contributed to the}} discovery of more than 100 isotopes of elements. Using one of Lawrence's advanced cyclotrons, John Livingood, Fred Fairbrother, and Seaborg created a new isotope of iron, iron-59 (Fe-59) in 1937. Iron-59 was useful in the studies of the hemoglobin in <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> In 1938, Livingood and Seaborg collaborated (as they did for five years) to create an important isotope of iodine, iodine-131 (I-131), which is still used to treat thyroid disease. (Many years later, it was credited with prolonging the life of Seaborg's mother.) As a result of these and other contributions, Seaborg is regarded as a pioneer in nuclear medicine and is one of its most prolific discoverers of isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal gland}} {{produces}} aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, {{which is important}} in the regulation of salt ("mineral") balance and blood volume. In the kidneys, aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts by increasing the reabsorption of sodium and the excretion of both potassium and hydrogen ions. Aldosterone is responsible for the reabsorption of about 2% of filtered sodium in the kidneys, which is nearly equal to the entire sodium content in <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> under normal glomerular filtration rates. Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Angiotensin II and extracellular potassium are the two main regulators of aldosterone production. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Therefore, the effects of aldosterone in sodium retention are important for the regulation of blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about whether my vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E

5|$|Twenty {{isotopes}} {{of sodium}} are known, but only 23Na is stable. 23Na is {{created in the}} carbon-burning process in stars by fusing two carbon atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star {{of at least three}} solar masses. Two radioactive, cosmogenic isotopes are the byproduct of cosmic ray spallation: 22Na has a half-life of 2.6 years and 24Na, a half-life of 15 hours; all other isotopes have a half-life of less than one minute. Two nuclear isomers have been discovered, the longer-lived one being 24mNa with a half-life of around 20.2 milliseconds. Acute neutron radiation, as from a nuclear criticality accident, converts some of the stable 23Na in <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> to 24Na; the neutron radiation dosage of a victim can be calculated by measuring the concentration of 24Na relative to 23Na.|$|E

By the events of The Last Dark, Fumito—operating through his covert group Tower and its puppet corporation Seventh Heaven—has gained control of Tokyo's government and implemented the Youth Ordinance Bill, a law which enforces curfews for minors and regulates the use of the internet.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} few decades of the 20th century, most field naturalists {{continued}} to believe that alternative mechanisms of evolution such as Lamarckism and orthogenesis provided the best explanation for the complexity they observed in the living world. But as the field of genetics continued to develop, those views became less tenable. Theodosius Dobzhansky, a postdoctoral worker in Thomas Hunt Morgan's lab, had {{been influenced by the}} work on genetic diversity by Russian geneticists such as Sergei Chetverikov. He helped to bridge the divide between the foundations of microevolution developed by the population geneticists and the patterns of macroevolution observed by field biologists, with his 1937 book Genetics and the Origin of Species. Dobzhansky examined the genetic diversity of wild populations and showed that, contrary to the assumptions of the population geneticists, these populations had large amounts of genetic diversity, with marked differences between sub-populations. The book also took the highly mathematical work of the population geneticists and put it into a more accessible form. In Britain, E. B. Ford, the pioneer of ecological genetics, continued throughout the 1930s and 1940s to demonstrate the power of selection due to ecological factors including the ability to maintain genetic diversity through genetic polymorphisms such as <b>human</b> <b>blood</b> types. Ford's work would contribute to a shift in emphasis {{during the course of the}} modern synthesis towards natural selection over genetic drift.|$|E
5|$|Pafase, {{also known}} as rPAF-AH, was {{developed}} to treat severe sepsis. Pafase is the recombinant form of platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH, {{also known as}} lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2), an enzyme made naturally by macrophages and found in <b>human</b> <b>blood.</b> PAF-AH inactivates platelet-activating factor, a phospholipid that {{plays a role in}} the inflammation seen in sepsis. The enzyme was discovered in the mid-1980s by graduate student Diana Stafforini and researchers Steve Prescott, Guy Zimmerman, and Tom McIntyre at the University of Utah. The gene that codes for Pafase was discovered by Icos. Early trials for sepsis showed that the drug reduced the death rate after 28days and patients were less likely to develop severe respiratory problems. Icos also tested Pafase for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In phaseII trials for ARDS, Pafase reduced the death rate after 28days and reduced the chance that the lungs of the patient would fail. However, Icos halted development in December2002 when interim data from phaseIII trials for sepsis showed that the drug did not help patients survive. Scientists at Northwestern University later studied Pafase for necrotizing enterocolitis, and there is ongoing research on the enzyme for atherosclerosis at the University of Utah.|$|E
