50|$|Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act {{establishes}} <b>emergency</b> <b>release,</b> inventory, {{and release}} reporting requirements.

Other sections require facilities to report spills of listed substances above a threshold reporting quantity (reportable quantities), and the quantities of chemicals stored above a specified threshold planning quantity.|$|R

5000|$|The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, or EPCRA {{was passed}} by Congress in 1986 to help {{communities}} plan for emergencies that involve hazardous substance spills or releases.

[...] The provisions of the EPCRA include emergency planning (Sections 301-303), and <b>emergency</b> <b>release</b> notification (Section 304).|$|R
5000|$|In {{keeping with}} Devo's love of facetious [...] "truths", several {{possible}} {{origins of the}} domes exist. One such story holds that the design came from a Little Lulu comic book.

Yet another says that they were based off garage door <b>emergency</b> <b>release</b> rope handles (like the 35227A model sold at Sears stores).|$|R
