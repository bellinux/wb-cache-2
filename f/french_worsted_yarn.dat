50|$|The Jules Desurmont Worsted Company Mill is a {{historic}} mill at 84 Fairmount Street in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. The mill complex consists of three brick buildings, erected 1907-10 by Jules Desurmont, {{the owner of a}} textile firm in Tourcoing, a city in northern France, who had been drawn to Woonsocket by the promotional activities of Aram Pothier. The mill produced <b>French</b> <b>worsted</b> wool <b>yarn</b> until 1952, and was used for many years thereafter by smaller textile and industrial concerns.|$|R
50|$|Cheviot fabric may be {{produced}} either from woollen or <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> {{according to the}} character, texture, and feel desired in the finished fabric. Some qualities are produced from crossbred <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> adapted for furnishing crispness.|$|R
50|$|The <b>French</b> <b>Worsted</b> Company Mill Historic District {{encompassed}} {{a historic}} mill complex in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. Bounded by Hamlet Avenue, Davison Avenue, and Manville Road, {{a complex of}} sixteen brick buildings was built between 1906 and the late 1920s. The complex was home to the <b>French</b> <b>Worsted</b> Company, a manufacturer established with funds from French investors brought over by Aram Pothier, the Quebec-born mayor of Woonsocket. The company engaged {{in the manufacture of}} fine <b>worsted</b> wool <b>yarns.</b> The company survived the Great Depression and competition from Southern mills, but finally failed in 1969. The buildings were then converted to a variety of light manufacturing interests.|$|R
2500|$|In {{support of}} the flannel emphasis, in 1865 Coldharbour Mill moved over to {{producing}} <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> rather than woollen yarn. This necessitated {{the need for more}} power to drive new combing machines. (<b>Worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> is made from sheep with long hair fleeces and the wool has to be combed to ensure that all the fibres are parallel.) ...|$|R
50|$|The S numbers {{originated}} in England, where the worsted spinning process was invented and {{arose from the}} <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> count system for stating the fineness of <b>yarn.</b> The <b>worsted</b> count (also known as the Bradford count) {{was the number of}} 560 yard m lengths (hanks) of <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> that 1 lb of wool yields. The finer the wool, the more yarn and the higher the count.|$|R
50|$|Long draw {{spinning}} is {{most often}} contrasted to the short draw technique used to spin <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
50|$|The short draw {{technique}} can be {{done from}} carded rolags, as well, {{but this does not}} produce a strictly <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn.</b> Yarns spun from a rolag will not have all the fibers parallel to the yarn though, with the short draw technique, many will be. Drum carded fiber, however, does have the fibers all parallel to each other, and thus can be used to create a strictly <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 18th and early 19th centuries, Westford {{primarily}} produced granite, apples, and <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn.</b> The Abbot <b>Worsted</b> Company {{was said to}} be the first company in the nation to use camel hair for <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns.</b> [...] Citizens from Westford also had some notable involvement in the Revolutionary War. [...] Westford Minutemen were alerted by efforts of Samuel Prescott who alerted Acton, to the southeast towards Stow.|$|R
50|$|Cheviot suitings for {{sportswear}} {{are made}} from harder spun <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns,</b> and some are also made from botany worsted.|$|R

50|$|Roving {{and wool}} top {{are often used}} to spin <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn.</b> Many hand spinners buy their fibre in roving or top form. Top and roving are ropelike in appearance, in {{that they can be}} thick and long. While some mills put a slight twist in the rovings they make, it is not enough twist to be a yarn. The fibres in top and rovings all lie {{parallel}} to one another along the length, which makes top ideal for spinning <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Part of {{the mill}} complex is still open today - the Coldharbour Mill museum in Uffculme, which {{supplier}} <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> for the weaving looms of Wellington.|$|R
40|$|Staple fibre yarns vary quite {{markedly}} in {{linear density}} (tex) along their length {{and the degree}} to which twist redistributes from thick to thin places will affect the strength, torque and extension behaviour of the yarn. Theory suggests that twist along <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> should vary as 1 /(tex) 2 if fibres were locked in the structure, whereas themean torque of <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> reported in the literature implies that twist should be proportional to 1 /tex. This article examines twist distribution in ring-spun marl yarns, down to 5 mm resolution, as a function of linear density measured using a high-resolution capacitive sensor. It is found for moderate twist-level <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> that twist is approximately proportional to 1 /(tex) 1. 6. The results and theory provide a guide as to the effect the observed large variations in linear density will have on yarn properties such as tenacity and torque. <br /...|$|R
50|$|The Bradford system (also {{known as}} the English <b>Worsted</b> <b>Yarn</b> Count System or {{spinning}} count or Bradford count) {{is a way to}} assess the quality of wool.|$|R
50|$|Most handspinners make a {{blend of}} a woolen and <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn,</b> using {{techniques}} from both categories, and thus ending up with a mix, named a semi-worsted yarn.|$|R
50|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> is straight, parallel fibres. Originally, long, fine staple wool was spun to create worsted yarn; today, other long fibres are also used.|$|R
50|$|Worsted count (or {{spinning}} count) is {{an indirect}} {{measure of the}} fineness of the fiber in a <b>worsted</b> wool <b>yarn</b> expressed {{as the number of}} 560-yard (512 m) lengths (hanks) of <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> that a pound (0.45 kg) of wool yields. The finer the wool, the more yarn and the higher the count. It has been largely replaced by direct measures.|$|R
50|$|Combing {{is another}} method to align the fibres {{parallel}} to the yarn, and thus is good for spinning a <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn,</b> whereas the rolag from handcards produces a woolen yarn.|$|R
50|$|Until {{recent times}} Milnsbridge was mostly centred on the woollen and <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> textile industry, with mills {{situated}} along the riverside. These formerly {{relied on the}} river and the canal.|$|R

25|$|However, the French Revolution and the {{invasion}} of Flanders in 1793 caused very serious difficulties for Exeter cloth merchants, and in 1794 the Weres were forced to cancel major <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> orders.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century, the term mockado ends {{was used for}} a wool <b>yarn,</b> {{probably}} a <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> similar to crewel yarn of that period, likely used for embroidery and making braids and fringes.|$|R

50|$|After {{the start}} of the Industrial Revolution woollen and <b>worsted</b> <b>yarns</b> were spun and woollen and worsted cloth woven inthe mills and {{factories}} that were built in the valley. Rope and twine were also manufactured.|$|R

50|$|Flannel is a soft woven fabric, {{of various}} fineness. Flannel was {{originally}} made from carded wool or <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn,</b> {{but is now}} often made from either wool, cotton, or synthetic fiber. Vegetable flannel is made from Scots pine fibre.|$|R
50|$|Worsted cloth, archaically {{also known}} as stuff, is {{lightweight}} and has a coarse texture. The weave is usually twill or plain. Twilled fabrics such as whipcord, gabardine and serge are often made from <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn.</b> <b>Worsted</b> fabric made from wool has a natural recovery, meaning that it is resilient and quickly returns to its natural shape, but non-glossy worsted will shine with use or abrasion.|$|R
30|$|Norwich’s {{manufacturers}} used smooth, strong, silky <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> spun from long-staple {{combed wool}} in {{the counties of}} East Anglia and, from the early eighteenth century, southern Ireland. Fabrics woven with worsted and worsted mixed with other yarns such as silk were known as ‘Norwich stuffs’ [1].|$|R
50|$|Lister {{invented the}} Lister nip comb which {{separated}} and straightened raw wool, {{which has to}} be done before it can be spun into <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn,</b> and in the nineteenth century it was a hot, dirty and tiring job. By inventing the nip comb, Lister revolutionised the industry.|$|R
50|$|The {{spinning}} wheel collects the yarn on a bobbin.A woollen yarn is lightly spun {{so it is}} airey, and is a good insulator and suitable for knitting, while a <b>worsted</b> <b>yarn</b> is spun tight to exclude air, and has greater strength and is suited to weaving..|$|R
