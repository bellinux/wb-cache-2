50|$|The aim of Tissue Processing is {{to remove}} water from tissues and replace with a medium that solidifies to allow thin {{sections}} to be cut. Biological tissue must be supported in a hard matrix to allow sufficiently thin sections to be cut, typically 5 μm (micrometres; 1000 micrometres = 1 mm) thick for light microscopy and 80-100 nm (nanometre; 1,000,000 nanometres = 1 mm) thick for electron microscopy. For light microscopy, paraffin wax is most frequently used. Since it is immiscible with water, the main constituent of biological tissue, water must first be removed {{in the process of}} dehydration. Samples are transferred through baths of progressively more concentrated ethanol to remove the water. This is followed by a hydrophobic clearing agent (such as xylene) to remove the alcohol, and finally molten paraffin wax, the infiltration agent, which replaces the xylene. Paraffin wax does not provide a sufficiently hard matrix for cutting very thin sections for electron microscopy. Instead, resins are used. Epoxy resins are the most commonly employed <b>embedding</b> <b>media,</b> but acrylic resins are also used, particularly where immunohistochemistry is required. Thicker sections (0.35μm to 5μm) of resin-embedded tissue can also be cut for light microscopy. Again, the immiscibility of most epoxy and acrylic resins with water necessitates the use of dehydration, usually with ethanol.|$|E

40|$|Many of the {{difficulties}} of staining plastic embedded tissues for light and electron microscopy derive from physical exclusion of hydrophilic staining reagents by hydrophobic <b>embedding</b> <b>media.</b> Structures which stain most intensely with hydrophilic reagents usually contain less hydrophobic plastic than do non-staining structures. Such incomplete infiltration is apparently caused by exclusion of viscous, hydrophobic monomers by physically dense and/or well hydrated tissue elements. In keeping with this, generalized staining of tissues embedded in hydrophobic media does occur when hydrophobic reagents are used. Staining of plastic-free structures with single hydrophilic reagents or with sequences of such reagents, is, however, largely rate-controlled.

40|$|Abstract. Raman {{spectroscopy}} provides {{valuable information}} on the physicochemical properties of hard tissues. While the technique can analyze tissues in their native state, analysis of fixed, embedded, and sectioned specimens may be necessary on certain occasions. The {{information on the}} effects of fixatives and <b>embedding</b> <b>media</b> on Raman spectral properties is limited. We examined the effect of ethanol and glycerol as fixatives and a variety of <b>embedding</b> <b>media</b> (Araldite, Eponate, Technovit, glycol methacrylate, polymethyl methacry-late, and LR white) on Raman spectral properties (mineralization, crystallinity, and carbonation) mea-sured from the cortical bone of mouse humeri. Humeri were fixed in ethanol or glycerol, followed by embedding in one of the media. Nonfixed, freeze-dried, and fixed but not embedded sections were also examined. Perio-steal, endosteal, and midosteal regions of the intracor-tical envelope were analyzed. Raman spectra of fixative solutions and <b>embedding</b> <b>media</b> were also recorded separately in order to examine the specifics of overlap between spectra. We found significant effects of fixation, embedding, and anatomical location on Raman spectral properties. The interference of ethanol with tissue seemed to be relatively less pronounced than that of glycerol. However, there was no single combination of fixation and embedding that left Raman spectral parameters unaltered. We conclude that careful selec-tion of a fixation and embedding combination should be made based on the parameter of interest and the type of tissue. It may be necessary to process multiple samples from the tissue, each using a combination appropriate for the Raman parameter in question...|$|E

Amodernstereologicalmethod, the oocyte packing density (OPD) theory, was used supported by initial studies on ovarian tissue sampling and measurement design. Examples of differences in the volume fraction of oocyte stages, free space and connective tissue were found between the <b>embedding</b> <b>media.</b> Mean oocyte diameters were smaller in paraf fi nthaninresin with differences ranging between 0. 5 % in primary growth and 24. 3 % in hydration (HYD) stage oocytes.

Inordertoassess the effect of oocyte shrinkage on the OPD result, and thereby on relative batch fecundity (F r), oocyte diameters corrected and uncorrected for shrinkage, were used for estimations.

Sections containing predominantly Schwann's cell cytoplasm and nucleus, afferent fiber axoplasm and myelin sheath of chick cochleae were reacted with anti-S- 100 IgG, an antibody to a calcium binding protein of neuronal tissues, then labeled with anti-IgG-gold conjugate. This investigation was conducted because previously published procedures, unmodified, did not yield acceptable results. Preparation of all specimens was identical. Only the medium (PolyBed 812, Araldite or Spurr epoxies; and LR White, LR Gold or Lowicryl plastics) was changed. The medium was made the changing variable because antigens available in post-embedding immuno-electron microscopy are decreased by heat, either used and/or released during polymerization of the embedding medium. The results indicate that: (a) none of the <b>embedding</b> <b>media</b> above provided optimal signal-to-noise ratio for all parts of the nerve stained in the same section; (b) aggregation of gold particles over cells was highest in <b>embedding</b> <b>media</b> with high background labeling over areas devoid of tissue (noise); (c) aggregation occurred randomly throughout both cellular and acellular regions; and (d) particles aggregated less and were distributed more evenly in tissues from media yielding good ultrastructural integrity...|$|E

However, there were,significant differences (p less than 0. 05) by ANOVA, in the nuclear labeling of specific cell types. With the exception of the less-differentiated A+A' cells, more BrdU label was consistently detected in paraffin than in plastic-embedded sections. In general, more nuclei were labeled with 3 H-thymidine than with BrdU in both types of <b>embedding</b> <b>media</b> (Fig 2.).
