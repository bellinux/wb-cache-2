5|$|Port Austin is the {{location}} of the historical northern terminus of US25. Through town, M-25 turns north along Lake Street and runs concurrently with the northern end of M-53. The highway turns westward on Port Austin Road along the lake where M-53 terminates; this is also the point where the M-25 signage changes from northbound to westbound. West of town, M-25 turns south along the Saginaw Bay and meets Port Crescent State Park. From here south west, M-25 <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> bay and its miles of beaches. North of Caseville is the Albert E. Sleeper State Park. Through Caseville, M-25 uses Main Street and passes the city beach off State Street. McKinley is home to the Scenic Golf & Country Club and Wild Fowl Bay. M-25 follows the shore of Wild Fowl Bay, a smaller bay off Saginaw Bay, to the city of Bay Port and the western terminus of M-142 on Fairhaven a smaller community south of Bay Port. From here south, the road is called Unionville Road and turns inland to Sebewaing.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E

25|$|In Custer County, Highway 44 meets up with SH-73. The two routes form a brief concurrency, {{splitting}} {{up when they}} reach Foss State Park. SH-44 <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> east side of Foss Lake, then runs across its dam. Four miles (6.4km) north of where it exits the park, SH-44 ends in Butler at State Highway 33.|$|E
25|$|The {{deforestation}} of the Lacandon in Mexico {{has been}} dramatically high, with the rate increasing {{over the past}} decades. It is estimated that only 10% of virgin rainforest still exists with the rest having been strip-mined, logged and more. Most of what is left <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> Guatemalan border. Of the remaining forest, about 5% is still lost per year in spite of conservation efforts.|$|E

25|$|South of King Street, the Creek {{is visible}} on the west side, {{as far south as}} the rail lines. Past the CPR rail lines, the Creek diverges west into Rosedale Park, while the {{expressway}} <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> east side of the valley. On {{the east side of the}} valley at this point is Red Hill and the Red Hill residential area is isolated from the expressway by a noise barrier.|$|E
25|$|The entire Northeast Corridor {{has just}} 11 grade crossings, all in southeastern New London County, Connecticut. The {{remaining}} grade crossings are along {{a part of}} the line that <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> shore of Fishers Island Sound. Without these crossings many waterfront communities and businesses would be inaccessible from land. Except for three grade crossings near New London Union Station, all have four-quadrant gates with induction loop sensors, which allow vehicles stopped on the tracks to be detected in time for an oncoming train to stop.|$|E
25|$|South of Timaru, {{the road}} again passes through gentle hill country, staying close to the coast but largely {{out of sight of}} it. The road veers inland briefly, {{bypassing}} Waimate as it reaches the plains around the mouth of the Waitaki River, which it crosses to enter Otago. It passes through Oamaru, from where it turns inland briefly, crossing undulating hill country before again reaching the coast at Moeraki. From here {{the road again}} <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> coast along Katiki Beach, remaining closer to the ocean than at any point since Kaikoura. The highway turns inland at Shag Point, passing through Palmerston and Waikouaiti.|$|E

25|$|The TCA Ground is {{a picturesque}} {{ground with a}} village feel and white picket {{boundary}} which could easily belong in the English countryside, except for the typical Australian Eucalypt bushland which <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> boundary line. Due to its elevated position on the Domain the ground has commanding views over the River Derwent and city, {{as well as being}} dominated by views of Mount Wellington. This elevated position also exposes the ground to strong sea breezes which can provide excellent assistance for bowlers. During a match between the touring South African team and a Combined XI in December 1963, South African captain Trevor Goddard appealed to the umpires about the strength of the wind, which led to play being suspended.|$|E
25|$|In {{the north}} the {{escarpment}} meets the coastline, {{and north of}} this the coastal road Lawrence Hargrave Drive <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> cliffline. The unstable geology of the escarpment resulted in rockfalls, forcing {{the closure of the}} road. Subsequently, part of Lawrence Hargrave Drive was replaced in 2005 by the Sea Cliff Bridge just off the coast, crossing the submerged rock shelf. The bridge carries both vehicular and pedestrian traffic. The Illawarra railway line must go through several tunnels to reach the Sydney metropolitan area. The Southern Freeway and Princes Highway provide alternative inland routes, descending the escarpment further south at Bulli Pass or at Mount Ousley, entering just north of Wollongong's city centre.|$|E
25|$|I-40 remains {{relatively}} {{steady as}} it continues across the Cumberland Plateau and {{passes through the}} northern part of Crossville. East of Crossville, the Crab Orchard Mountains (the southern fringe of the Cumberland Mountains) come into view as the road descends several hundred feet. At mile 329, the Interstate enters Crab Orchard Gap and proceeds through a narrow valley once prone to rockslides. At mile 340, the Interstate enters the Eastern Time Zone, and shortly thereafter the road begins its descent of the Cumberland Plateau into the Tennessee Valley. I-40 <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> slopes of the plateau's Walden Ridge escarpment for several miles— with dramatic views of the Tennessee Valley below to the south— before reaching the base of the plateau at mile 347 between Harriman and Rockwood.|$|E

500|$|The John Kieran Nature Trail ( [...] , easy), which {{connects to}} the Putnam Trail, opened in 1987 and is named after local writer and naturalist John Kieran. The path {{features}} 13 stone pillars, each made of a different variety of stone, that were tested for the Grand Central Terminal's facade. The variety eventually chosen was Indiana limestone because it was cheap. The trail <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> edge of the Van Cortlandt Lake and Tibbetts Brook marsh.|$|E
500|$|Approaching {{the city}} of Glenwood Springs, the highway enters Glenwood Canyon. Both {{the federal and state}} {{departments}} of transportation have praised the engineering achievement required to build the freeway through the narrow gorge while preserving the natural beauty of the canyon. A [...] section of roadway features the No Name Tunnel, Hanging Lake Tunnel, Reverse Curve Tunnel, 40 bridges and viaducts, and miles of retaining walls. Through {{a significant portion of the}} canyon, the eastbound lanes extend cantilevered over the Colorado River and the westbound lanes are suspended on a viaduct several feet above the canyon floor. Along this run, the freeway <b>hugs</b> <b>the</b> north bank of the Colorado River, while the main line of the former Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (now part of Union Pacific) occupies the south bank.|$|E
500|$|Ruth's {{housekeeping}} {{is sometimes}} interrupted by Timmy's adventures. She helps him rescue a child {{trapped in a}} culvert rapidly filling with flood water, assists him in his 4-H projects, pitches a tent for their overnight accommodation at a Coon Dog Race, and flies into the Canadian wilderness when Timmy and Lassie are swept away in a hot air balloon. Marital affection between Ruth and her husband is only represented through brief kisses and <b>hugs.</b> <b>The</b> role ends when Ruth and Paul emigrate to Australia where Paul will teach agriculture, leaving Lassie with neighbor Cully Wilson. Timmy was reclaimed by the County and eventually adopted by a family named McCullough and began using his middle name, Steven. Ruth and Timmy (Steven) are reunited 25 years later in the seventh episode of the first season of the syndicated television show The New Lassie, entitled [...] "Roots".|$|E
