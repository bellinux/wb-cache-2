Halsall said the use of fecal matter as a character, and especially its tendency to smear parts of itself around as it moved, directly confronts the viewer with [...] "the inherent <b>dirtiness</b> of the human body, no matter how much we try to aestheticize it, Mr. Hankey's stains systematically mess up the cleanliness of the social order.

500|$|Part II, which {{consists}} of eleven conversational letters, covers {{the first part of}} Shelley's trip to Europe in 1842, specifically her journey from Antwerp to Prague; the names of her travelling companions are disguised in the text and she rarely alludes to them. She discusses art, sometimes spending several pages describing individual works of art; the benefits and drawbacks of travel by railway versus carriage; the German character and habits of the German people; the history associated with the sights she sees; the scenery and the weather; and her problems as a traveller, for example, her inability to speak German, the <b>dirtiness</b> of the inns, and exorbitant pricing for tourists. Shelley begins this section by musing on the benefits of travel: ...|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 22:15, Hipper, {{with his}} flag now in Moltke, ordered his battlecruisers {{to increase speed}} to 20knots, and {{to fall into the}} rear of the main German line. Neither Derfflinger, due to battle damage, nor Von der Tann, due to the <b>dirtiness</b> of her boiler fires, could steam at more than 18knots. Derfflinger and Von der Tann took up positions astern of the IISquadron, and were later joined by the old pre-dreadnoughts [...] and [...] at 00:05. At 03:37, the British destroyer Moresby fired a torpedo {{at the rear of the}} German line; this passed closely across Von der Tanns bow, and forced the ship to turn sharply to starboard to avoid being hit. Close to the end of the battle, at 03:55, Hipper transmitted a report to Admiral Scheer, informing him of the tremendous damage his ships had suffered. By that time, Derfflinger and Von der Tann each had only two guns in operation, Moltke was flooded with 1,000tons of water, and Seydlitz was severely damaged. Hipper reported: [...] "I Scouting Group was therefore no longer of any value for a serious engagement, and was consequently directed to return to harbor by the Commander-in-Chief, while he himself determined to await developments off Horns Reef with the battlefleet." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A– rating. Juliette Harrisson of Den of Geek named [...] "John Doe" [...] the best stand-alone episode of season nine {{and called it}} [...] "a refreshing change of pace". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two praised Gilligan's script and Patrick's performance, noting that the former [...] "writes the script with a <b>dirtiness</b> that gives it real power" [...] and the latter's acting was [...] "extraordinary". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'John Doe' shows that there's still a fresh take to be had on The X-Files after all". Meghan Deans of Tor.com applauded the episode and called it [...] "a clear bright spot in a dark and dismal season, both in its script and in its shooting." [...] She felt that the focus on Doggett was effectively done, and the script focused on [...] "strong character arcs", which worked towards its advantage. In the end, she concluded that the episode was [...] "part of the X-Files, more so than would an alien or a mutant" [...] because it focused {{on the idea that}} [...] "pain makes you, more pain makes you better, and living within that pain keeps you alive." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the central premise, the cinematography and Patrick's performance, calling [...] "John Doe" [...] a [...] "stylishly produced entry".|$|E
2500|$|Helen Vendler expands on {{the idea}} of [...] "sluttish time" [...] by {{examining}} how the speaker bestows grandeur on entities when they are connected to the beloved but mocks them and associates them with <b>dirtiness</b> when they're connected with something the speaker hates. [...] She begins by addressing the [...] "grand marble" [...] and [...] "gilded" [...] statues and monuments; these are called this way when the speaker compares them to the verse immortalizing the beloved. [...] However, when compared to [...] "sluttish time" [...] they are [...] "unswept stone besmeared". [...] The same technique occurs in the second quatrain. [...] Battle occurs between mortal monuments of princes, conflict is crude and vulgar, [...] "wasteful war" [...] overturns unelaborated statues and [...] "broils" [...] root out masonry. [...] Later in quatrain war becomes [...] "war's quick fire" [...] and [...] "broils" [...] become [...] "Mars his sword". [...] The war is suddenly grand and the foes are emboldened. [...] The blatant contempt with which the speaker regards anything not {{having to do with the}} young man, or anything that works against the young man's immortality, raises the adoration of the young man by contrast alone.|$|E

6000|$|... “When (1) the inconstancy of the {{employment}} {{is combined with}} (2) the hardship, disagreeableness, and <b>dirtiness</b> of the work, it sometimes raises the wages {{of the most common}} labor above those of the most skillful artificers. A collier working by the piece is supposed, at Newcastle, to earn commonly about double, and in many parts of Scotland about three times, the wages of common labor. His high wages arise altogether from the hardship, disagreeableness, and <b>dirtiness</b> of his work. His employment may, upon most occasions, be as constant as he pleases. The coal-heavers in London exercise a trade which in hardship, <b>dirtiness,</b> and disagreeableness almost equals that of colliers; and from the unavoidable irregularity in the arrivals of coal-ships, {{the employment}} of the greater part of them is necessarily very inconstant. If colliers, therefore, commonly earn double and triple the wages of common labor, it ought not to seem unreasonable that coal-heavers should sometimes earn four or five times those wages. In the inquiry made into their condition a few years ago, it was found that, at the rate at which they were then paid, they could earn about four times the wages of common labor in London.” ...|$|E

60|$|Here {{they found}} an immense {{assemblage}} of men, and women, and children, whose appearance denoted <b>dirtiness,</b> laziness, and poverty. They were almost {{all in a}} state bordering on nudity, {{but a few of}} them wore miscellaneous portions of European apparel. The hair of the men was long, except on the forehead, where it was cut square, just above the eyebrows. The children wore no clothes at all. The infants were carried on stiff cradles, similar to those used by North American Indians. They all resided in tents, made of brushwood and sticks, and hundreds of mangy, half-starved curs dwelt along with them.|$|E

[...] One admitted that it was nothing but laziness that had prevented him from learning, whereupon another opined that <b>dirtiness</b> {{had something to do with}} it too.

6000|$|The [...] "Coal-Coffin," [...] albeit an {{unseaworthy}} vessel, is {{a picturesque}} object. Its dirty sails {{are of a}} fine rich colour, because of their very <b>dirtiness.</b> Its weather-worn and filthy spars, and hull and rigging, possess a harmony of tone {{which can only be}} acquired by age. Its cordage being rotten and very limp, hangs, on that account, all the more gracefully in waving lines of beauty and elegant festoons; the reef points hang quite straight, and patter softly on the sails--in short, the tout ensemble of the little craft is eminently picturesque-- draped, as it were, with the mellowness of antiquity; and the whole-- hull, spars, sails, cordage, and reef points,--clearly and sharply reflected in the depths below.|$|E
60|$|Seated on the stool, and {{bending over}} the fire,--was an old woman, so wild and shrivelled in her {{appearance}} that {{a much less}} superstitious urchin than Jacky might have believed {{her to be a}} witch. Her clothing may be described as a bundle of rags, {{with the exception of a}} shepherd's-plaid on her shoulders, the spotless purity of which contrasted strangely with the <b>dirtiness</b> of every thing else around. The old creature was moaning and moping over the fire, and drawing the plaid close round her as if she were cold, although the weather was extremely warm. At first she took no notice whatever of the entrance of her visitors, but kept muttering to herself in the Gaelic tongue.|$|E

60|$|At Burlington I made an {{acquaintance}} with many principal {{people of the}} province. Several {{of them had been}} appointed by the Assembly a committee to attend the press, and take care that no more bills were printed than the law directed. They were therefore, by turns, constantly with us, and generally he who attended brought with him a friend or two for company. My mind having been much more improved by reading than Keimer's, I suppose it was for that reason my conversation seemed to be more valued. They had me to their houses, introduced me to their friends, and showed me much civility; while he, though the master, was a little neglected. In truth, he was an odd fish; ignorant of common life, fond of rudely opposing received opinions, slovenly to extreme <b>dirtiness,</b> enthusiastic in some points of religion, and a little knavish withal.|$|E
6000|$|... (1.) “The {{wages of}} labor {{vary with the}} ease or hardship, the {{cleanliness}} or <b>dirtiness,</b> the honorableness or dishonorableness of the employment. A journeyman blacksmith, though an artificer, seldom earns so much in twelve hours as a collier, who is only a laborer, does in eight. His work is not quite so dirty, is less dangerous, and is carried on in daylight and above ground. Honor makes {{a great part of}} the reward of all honorable professions. In point of pecuniary gain, all things considered,” their recompense is, in his opinion, below the average. “Disgrace has the contrary effect. The trade of a butcher is a brutal and an odious business; but it is in most places more profitable than the greater part of common trades. The most detestable of all employments, that of the public executioner, is, in proportion to the quantity of work done, better paid than any common trade whatever.” ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Britling did his utmost not {{to believe}} these things. They contradicted his {{habitual}} world. They produced horrible strains in his mind. They might, he hoped, be misreported so as to seem more violent or less justifiable than they were. They might be the acts of stray criminals, and quite disconnected from the normal operations of the war. Here and there some weak-minded officer may have sought to make himself terrible.... And as for the bombardment of cathedrals and the crime of Louvain, well, Mr. Britling was prepared to argue that Gothic architecture is not sacrosanct if military necessity cuts through it.... It was only after the war {{had been going on}} some months that Mr. Britling's fluttering, unwilling mind was pinned down by official reports and a cloud of witnesses to a definite belief in the grim reality of systematic rape and murder, destruction, <b>dirtiness</b> and abominable compulsions that blackened the first rush of the Prussians into Belgium and Champagne....|$|E
60|$|God {{was coming}} {{into the life of}} all mankind in the {{likeness}} of a captain and a king; all the governments of men, all the leagues of men, their debts and claims and possessions, must give way to the world republic under God the king. For five troubled years he had been staring religion in the face, and now he saw that it must mean this--or be no more than fetishism, Obi, Orphic mysteries or ceremonies of Demeter, a legacy of mental <b>dirtiness,</b> a residue of self-mutilation and superstitious sacrifices from the cunning, fear-haunted, ape-dog phase of human development. But it did mean this. And every one who apprehended as much was called by that very apprehension to the service of God's kingdom. To live and serve God's kingdom on earth, to help to bring it about, to propagate the idea of it, to establish the method of it, to incorporate all that one made and all that one did into its growing reality, was the only possible life that could be lived, once that God was known.|$|E
60|$|When the Ave-Bell is heard, the Hearer must {{down on his}} Knees {{upon the}} very Spot; nor is he allowed the small Indulgence of deferring a little, till he can recover a clean Place; <b>Dirtiness</b> excuses not, nor will dirty Actions by any means exempt. This is so notorious, that even at the Play-house, {{in the middle of}} a Scene, on the first sound of the Bell, the Actors drop their Discourse, the Auditors {{supersede}} the indulging of their unsanctified Ears, and all on their Hearts, quite a different way, to what they just before had been employ'd in. In short, tho' they pretend in all this to an extraordinary Measure of Zeal and real Devotion; no Man, that lives among them any time, can be a Proselyte to them without immolating his Senses and his Reason: Yet I must confess, while I have seen them thus deludeing themselves with Ave Marias, I you'd not refrain throwing up my Eyes to the only proper Object of Adoration, in commiseration of such Delusions.|$|E
60|$|The {{chief is}} a fine, stately, {{well-developed}} specimen of African manhood. He is clothed in black tights manufactured in nature's loom, {{in addition to}} which he wears round his loins a small scrap of artificial cotton cloth. If an enthusiastic member of the Royal Academy were {{in search of a}} model which should combine the strength of Hercules with the grace of Apollo, he could not find a better than the man before us, for, you will observe, the more objectionable points about our ideal of the negro are not very prominent in him. His lips are not thicker than the lips of many a roast-beef-loving John Bull. His nose is not flat, and his heels do not protrude unnecessarily. True, his hair is woolly, but that is scarcely a blemish. It might almost be regarded as the crisp and curly hair that surrounds a manly skull. His skin is black--no doubt about that, but then it is intensely black and glossy, suggestive of black satin, and having no savour of that <b>dirtiness</b> which is inseparably connected with whitey-brown. Tribes in Africa differ materially in many respects, physically and mentally, just as do the various tribes of Europe.|$|E
60|$|All Hong-Kong {{is built}} on the sea face; the rest is fog. One muddy road runs for ever {{in front of a}} line of houses which are partly Chowringhee and partly Rotherhithe. You live in the houses, and when wearied of this, walk across the road and drop into the sea, {{if you can find a}} square foot of {{unencumbered}} water. So vast is the accumulation of country shipping, and such is its <b>dirtiness</b> as it rubs against the bund, that the superior inhabitants are compelled to hang their boats from davits above the common craft, who are greatly disturbed by a multitude of steam-launches. These ply for amusement and the pleasure of whistling, and are held in such small esteem that every hotel owns one, and the others are masterless. Beyond the launches lie more steamers than the eye can count, and four out of five of these belong to Us.

I can almost spit into the water; but many mariners stand below and they are a strong breed.|$|E

Then, moistening the clay until it acquires sufficient plasticity, and incidentally splashing your cuffs and coat-sleeves with an agreeably light tinted mud, you set to work. At first people are a little disgusted at the apparent <b>dirtiness</b> of the employment, and also perhaps rather diffident. The eldest lady says weakly deprecatory things, and the feeblest male is jocular after his wont. But it is remarkable how soon the charm of this delightful occupation seizes hold of you. For really the sensations of moulding this plastic matter into shape are wonderfully and quite unaccountably pleasing. It is ever so much easier than drawing things--"anyone can do it," [...] as the advertisement people say--and the work {{is so much more}} substantial in its effects. Technical questions arise.

6000|$|In {{the last}} two or three hundred years there has been a very {{considerable}} disentanglement of the idea of God from the complex of sexual thought and feeling. But in the early days of religion the two things were inseparably bound together; the fury of the Hebrew prophets, for example, is continually proclaiming the extraordinary [...] "wrath" [...] of their God at this or that little <b>dirtiness</b> or irregularity or breach of the sexual tabus. The ceremony of circumcision is clearly indicative of the original nature of the Semitic deity who developed into the Trinitarian God. So far as Christianity dropped this rite, so far Christianity disavowed the old associations. But to this day the representative Christian churches still make marriage into a mystical sacrament, and, with some exceptions, the Roman communion exacts the sacrifice of celibacy from its priesthood, regardless of the mischievousness and maliciousness that so often ensue. Nearly every Christian church inflicts as much discredit and injustice as it can contrive upon the illegitimate child. They do not treat illegitimate children as unfortunate children, but as children with a mystical and an incurable taint of SIN. Kindly easy-going Christians may resent this statement because it does not tally with their own attitudes, but let them consult their orthodox authorities.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{cold and}} gloomy Christmas Eve. The mass of cloud {{overhead}} was almost impervious to such daylight as still lingered on; the snow lay several inches deep upon the ground, and the slanting downfall which still went on threatened to considerably increase its thickness before the morning. The Prospect Hotel, a building standing near the wild north coast of Lower Wessex, looked so lonely and so useless {{at such a time}} as this that a passing wayfarer would have been led to forget summer possibilities, and to wonder at the commercial courage which could invest capital, {{on the basis of the}} popular taste for the picturesque, in a country subject to such dreary phases. That the district was alive with visitors in August seemed but a dim tradition in weather so totally opposed to all that tempts mankind from home. However, there the hotel stood immovable; and the cliffs, creeks, and headlands which were the primary attractions of the spot, rising in full view on the opposite side of the valley, were now but stern angular outlines, while the townlet in front was tinged over with a grimy <b>dirtiness</b> rather than the pearly gray that in summer lent such beauty to its appearance.|$|E
