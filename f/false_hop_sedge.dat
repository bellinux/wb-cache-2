50|$|Host plants used by larva are {{restricted}} to various sedges of the genera Carex and Rhynchospora. These include hairy sedge Carex lacustris in the north (particularly in shaded wetlands, including coastal swamps and ditches), shoreline sedge Carex hyalinolepis in the south (Mississippi River basin), <b>false</b> <b>hop</b> <b>sedge</b> Carex lupuliformis, Carex walteriana, Walter's sedge (Carex striata) in the southeast, narrowfruit horned beaksedge (Ryncospora inundata), and millet beaksedge (Rynchospora miliacea) in Florida.|$|E
5000|$|Carex lupuliformis, {{common name}} <b>false</b> <b>hop</b> <b>sedge,</b> is a {{perennial}} sedge of sporadic distribution {{found in the}} floodplain forests and ephemeral woodland ponds {{of central and eastern}} North America. The species typically produces four to seven leaves with sheaths of distal leaves of 3 to 21 cm whose ligules are rounded to triangular. Carex lupuliformis blooms between early June and early October, typically with [...] "two to six proximal female spikes, distal spikes usually crowded, ascending, densely flowered, usually cylindric, much longer than broad; one to two terminal male spikes." [...] Fruiting occurs between late July through early October. Fruit is described as [...] "perigynia ascending to spreading, inflated, strongly veined, sessile, lance-ovoid, shiny, glabrous; beak conical; achenes stipitate, broadly diamond-shaped, scarely if at all longer than wide, concave faces, angles thickened, prominently knobbed with hard, nipplelike points." ...|$|E
40|$|With {{a growing}} number of species at risk of extinction, reintroductions have become an {{important}} component of several recovery schemes. In 2005, a recovery program including reintroduction and reinforcement efforts as well as monitoring activities was implemented in Qu√©bec for the endangered <b>false</b> <b>hop</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex lupuliformis). Between 2005 and 2010, a total of 600 plants were reintroduced in different habitats (dry and wet) on five distinct sites (swamps). Our objective was to determine which environmental variables (soil moisture, light availability, competition, aphid infestation) influenced the survival and vigour (height, number of shoots, number of fruiting shoots) of the transplanted individuals. We also compared the survival, growth and fecundity of transplanted and wild individuals. Discriminant analyses and ANOVAs indicated that exotic aphid infestation, excessive soil moisture and low light availability were the main causes of premature transplant death. Soil moisture (when not excessive, as shown by the survival analyses), light availability and competition volume positively influenced transplant vigour. Although only 4 % of original transplants remain alive after a decade, at least one new population has established and total population has increased six-fold, when wild individuals and transplants still alive in 2015 are included in the calculations. Furthermore, at least 33 % of transplants produced seeds at least once. Overall, transplants were less vigorous than wild individuals, but were found to live on average just as long, suggesting that the biological success of our reintroduction program is promising. Further studies of <b>false</b> <b>hop</b> <b>sedge</b> should include an examination of seed viability, to evaluate whether the small, newly-created populations experienced reduced germination...|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} rich in wetland plants with large areas of reed and willow and {{uncommon}} species such as eight-stamened waterwort, flowering rush, marsh fern and <b>hop</b> <b>sedge.</b> Among the insects are hairy dragonfly, variable damselfly and various water beetles. Mammals include otter and water vole.|$|R
50|$|Carex pseudocyperus is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the sedge family known by the common name cyperus <b>sedge</b> or <b>hop</b> <b>sedge.</b> It grows in marshes, swamps, and the margins of ponds, rivers and canals. The stems can be up to 90 cm with one male spike and 3--5 pendulous female spikes, and bright yellow-green leaves to 1.2 m.|$|R

50|$|In nutrient-poor to {{moderately}} nutrient-rich, acidic waterbodies, floating mats {{form out of}} peat mosses, (feathery bogmoss Sphagnum cuspidatum, {{species of}} the complex Sphagnum recurvum s.l.) or brown mosses (Scorpidium scorpioides). Furthermore, floating mats are colonised by characteristic species of the small sedges such as the bog sedge (Carex limosa), (Carex rostrata), beak sedge (Rhynchospora ssp.), Rannoch-rush (Scheuchzeria palustris) and marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris). The edges of nutrient-rich waterbodies are colonised by reeds (Phragmites australis), bulrushes (Typha ssp.), <b>hop</b> <b>sedge</b> (Carex pseudocyperus) and cowbane (Circuta virosa). Floating mats are habitats for shelly amoeba such as Amphitrema sp. and lake fly larvae.|$|R
40|$|In {{wireless}} mobile ad hoc networks, packet {{delivery is}} achieved through two closely related network-layer operations: ad hoc routing and packet forwarding. As a result any security solution should encompass {{the protection of}} both. Protecting the network layer operations such as routing the control messages and data packet forwarding, from malicious attacks is an important and challenging issue in both wired and wireless mobile networks and the issue becomes even more challenging {{in the case of}} wireless mobile ad hoc network. Malicious nodes may disrupt routing algorithms by transmitting a <b>false</b> <b>hop</b> count; by dropping data packets and by routing the packets through unintended routes and so on. The work presented in this thesis attempts to improve the performance of wireless mobile ad hoc networks by protecting the network layer. Five studies are presented.

40|$|Black hole {{attack is}} an attack where a node that {{responds}} to RREQ from the source node by replying a fake freshness information and <b>false</b> <b>hop</b> count. The black hole nodes {{do not respond to}} distributed co-operation in routing protocol to absorb all the packets, as a result, the network performance will drop. Most previous works are focused on anomaly detection through dynamic trusted of the neighbouring nodes. We find out that the internal comparisons take a long time. This loss can be shortened by changing the routing mechanism. We propose an enhancement of AODV protocol, named EAODV, that is able to prevent black hole attacks. The EAODV can find a shortest path of routing discovery using A* heuristic search algorithm. Values of hop count and estimate time to reach the destination node are used as input in the heuristic equation and one-way hash function is used to make a secure value and then to casting it to all neighbouring nodes. Experiments were conducted in NS 2 to simulate EAODV in different running time with and without black hole nodes. The EAODV performance results are indicated better in terms Packet loss and Average End-to-End delay...|$|R
60|$|So {{it was a}} {{premature}} sentiment {{on the part of}} Miss Theo--that little tender flutter of the bosom which we have acknowledged she felt on first beholding the Virginian, so handsome, pale, and bleeding. This was not the great passion which she knew her heart could feel. Like the birds, it had wakened and begun to sing at a <b>false</b> dawn. <b>Hop</b> back to thy perch, and cover thy head with thy wing, thou tremulous little fluttering creature! It is not yet light, and roosting is as yet better than singing. Anon will come morning, and the whole sky will redden, and you shall soar up into it and salute the sun with your music.|$|R
