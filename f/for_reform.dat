5|$|Electoral {{legislation}} remained unchanged. Labor introduced bills <b>for</b> <b>reform,</b> {{but these}} were defeated {{in both houses of}} Parliament. The premier introduced electoral legislation that would have entrenched his government further than under the Playmander. As electoral legislation was part of the South Australian constitution, it required an absolute parliamentary majority (20 seats, under the current system) to be changed. The LCL relied on Stott in the house, so Labor could obstruct changes by keeping members away and forcing a pair.|$|E

5|$|Hayes {{took office}} {{determined}} {{to reform the}} system of civil service appointments, which had been based on the spoils system since Andrew Jackson was president. Instead of giving federal jobs to political supporters, Hayes wished to award them by merit according to an examination that all applicants would take. Immediately, Hayes's call <b>for</b> <b>reform</b> brought him into conflict with the Stalwart, or pro-spoils, branch of the Republican party. Senators of both parties were accustomed to being consulted about political appointments and turned against Hayes. Foremost among his enemies was New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, who fought Hayes's reform efforts at every turn.|$|E

Over the next few years, throughout the 1740s, he and familiar supported plans <b>for</b> <b>reform</b> and strengthening the Commonwealth, however most of them have failed due to liberum veto disrupting the Sejm proceedings.
