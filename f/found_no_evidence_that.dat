5|$|Excavations {{carried out}} at Yangon International Airport (formerly RAF Mingaladon) in early 2013 failed to locate any of the rumoured aircraft, and the team {{reported}} that they <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Spitfires were shipped there in crates or buried. Pat Woodward, who was an RAF pilot operating from Burma {{at the end of}} the war, reported that no such burying took place. In 2016 it was reported that the hunt was continuing.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or even that the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, a {{systematic}} {{review of the}} available systematic reviews confirmed that higher-quality trials tended to have less positive results, and <b>found</b> <b>no</b> convincing <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> any homeopathic preparation exerts clinical effects different from placebo.|$|R
5|$|There {{has been}} an {{emergence}} of studies investigating yoga as a complementary intervention for cancer patients. Yoga is used for treatment of cancer patients to decrease depression, insomnia, pain, and fatigue and to increase anxiety control, {{although there is a}} generally low quality of research and uncertainty for proving this effect. In preliminary research, yoga improved cognitive functioning. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> yoga was effective for metabolic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Pleistocene megafauna, Smilodon became extinct 10,000 years ago in the Quaternary {{extinction}} event. Its extinction has been linked to the decline and extinction of large herbivores, which were replaced by smaller and more agile ones like deer. Hence, Smilodon could have been too specialized at hunting large prey and may have been unable to adapt. A 2012 study of Smilodon tooth wear <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> they were limited by food resources. Other explanations include climate change and competition with humans (who entered the Americas around the time Smilodon disappeared), or a combination of several factors, all of which apply to the general Pleistocene extinction event, rather than specifically to the extinction of the saber-toothed cats.|$|E
5|$|Emotion-oriented {{interventions}} include reminiscence therapy, validation therapy, supportive psychotherapy, sensory integration, {{also called}} snoezelen, and simulated presence therapy. A Cochrane review has <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> this is effective. Supportive psychotherapy has received {{little or no}} formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness. Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times {{with the aid of}} photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for cognition and mood. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is based on attachment theories and involves playing a recording with voices of the closest relatives of the person with Alzheimer's disease. There is partial evidence indicating that SPT may reduce challenging behaviours.|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} the hematocrit from greater flamingo chicks Phoenicopterus roseus over 4 years {{to test whether}} this blood parameter {{was related to the}} nutritional condition of chicks, as there are controversial results on whether hematocrit may be used as an index of body condition. We also tested whether hematocrit increased with chick age, as there would be an age-related increase of oxygen demand due to exercising. We <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> hematocrit was related neither to the nutritional nor to the body condition of chicks. Hematocrit increased with chick age, which {{may be related to the}} increased requirements of chicks for oxygen delivery during development. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> the 1918 virus was imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E
5|$|Police {{seized a}} rifle, a sawed-off shotgun and three pistols {{from the men}} {{at the time of the}} arrest. They were {{detained}} in Bells, Tennessee for a few days before being moved to another facility. During interrogation, the men told authorities of their plan to kill Obama. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives handled the initial federal investigation of the case. The United States Secret Service became involved in the investigation once the assassination plot was discovered. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was also involved in the investigation. Both men were charged with illegal possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to rob a firearms dealer and making threats against a presidential candidate; a superseding indictment additionally charged the pair with civil rights conspiracy and conspiracy, and charged Cowart with destruction of religious property and a related firearms charge. Authorities have <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> anyone besides the two men were involved in the plot, but as of October 2008 authorities were said to be investigating the possibility.|$|E

25|$|The Washington Post <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Cuccinelli {{sought to}} {{personally}} {{intervene in the}} lawsuit. In April 2013, Cuccinelli recused himself from the case, hiring private attorneys to defend the state.

Williams that he had not previously disclosed, including free use of Williams' Smith Mountain Lake vacation lodge in 2010 and 2012. In response, Cuccinelli asked the Commonwealthâs attorney to review his disclosure filings. On July 18, 2013, a state prosecutor announced that he had <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> Cuccinelli had violated the law, saying Cuccinelli {{did not appear to be}} attempting to conceal the relationship with Williams and he did not intentionally mischaracterize any gifts.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{we use a}} low order dynamo model and study under which {{conditions}} can it reproduce solar grand minima. We begin by building the phase space of a proxy for the toroidal component of the solar magnetic field and we develop a model, derived from mean field dynamo theory, that gives the time evolution of the toroidal field. This model {{is characterized by a}} non-linear oscillator whose coefficients retain most of the physics behind dynamo theory. In the derivation of the model we also include stochastic oscillations in the Î± effect. We <b>found</b> <b>no</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>that</b> stochastic fluctuations in a linear Î± effect can trigger grand minima episodes in this model. In contrast, the model used points out that possible mechanism that can trigger grand minima should involve the meridional circulation, magnetic diffusivity or field intensification by buoyancy driven instabilities.
