40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the information content of metadata and <b>full</b> <b>texts</b> in German Medical Science (GMS) articles in English language. The {{object of the}} study is to compare semantic entities that are used to enrich GMS metadata (titles and abstracts) and GMS <b>full</b> <b>texts.</b> The aim {{of the study is}} to test whether using <b>full</b> <b>texts</b> increases the value added information. The comparison and evaluation of semantic entities was done statistically. Measures of descriptive statistics were gathered for this purpose. In addition to the ratio of central tendencies and scatterings, we computed the overlaps and complements of the values. The results show a distinct increase of information when <b>full</b> <b>texts</b> are added. On average, metadata contain 25 different entities and <b>full</b> <b>texts</b> 215. 89 % of the concepts in the metadata are also represented in the <b>full</b> <b>texts.</b> Hence, 11 % of the metadata concepts are found in the metadata only. In summary, the results show that the addition of <b>full</b> <b>texts</b> increases the informational value, e. g. for information retrieval processes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on {{indexing}} performance by a state-of-the-art keyphrase indexer, Maui, when paired with a text extraction procedure called text denoising. Text denoising is a method that extracts the denoised text, comprising the content-rich sentences, from <b>full</b> <b>texts.</b> The performance of the keyphrase indexer is demonstrated on three standard corpora collected from three domains, namely food and agriculture, high energy physics, and biomedical science. Maui is trained using the <b>full</b> <b>texts</b> and denoised texts. The indexer, using its trained models, then extracts keyphrases from test sets comprising <b>full</b> <b>texts,</b> and their denoised and noise parts (i. e., the part of texts that remains after denoising). Experimental findings show that against a gold standard, the denoised-text-trained indexer indexing <b>full</b> <b>texts,</b> performs either better than or as good as its benchmark performance produced by a full-text-trained indexer indexing <b>full</b> <b>texts.</b> Comment: The <b>full</b> paper submitted to 12 th ACM/ IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL 2012...|$|R

5|$|Strauss and Senator Brien McMahon, {{author of}} the 1946 McMahon Act, pushed Eisenhower to revoke Oppenheimer's {{security}} clearance. On December 21, 1953, Strauss told Oppenheimer that his security clearance had been suspended, pending resolution {{of a series of}} charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Oppenheimer chose not to resign and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from Kenneth D. Nichols, General Manager of the AEC. The hearing that followed in April–May 1954, which was initially confidential and not made public, focused on Oppenheimer's past Communist ties and his association during the Manhattan Project with suspected disloyal or Communist scientists. The US Department of Energy made public the <b>full</b> <b>text</b> of the transcript in October 2014.|$|E
