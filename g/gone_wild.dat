5|$|Nick Stuart (April 10, 1904 - April 7, 1973) was an Austro-Hungarian-born American {{actor and}} bandleader. His career spanned five decades, {{during which he}} {{appeared}} in over 50 films, {{more than half of}} them features, as well as film shorts, serials, and even one television appearance. He rose to stardom in such films as Girls <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild</b> and Chasing Through Europe, prior to expanding his business interests by creating a talent agency, and a popular upscale club in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s Nick Prata (as he {{was then}} known) began working in the film industry, doing odd jobs around the set for Fox Film, such as prop boy, script clerk, and {{assistant}} cameraman. While working as an assistant on Raoul Walsh's What Price Glory? in 1926, Prata was given a screen test, after which his name was changed to Nick Stuart. Shortly after, he became Howard Hawks's personal assistant. He appeared in minor roles in two film shorts, before being {{given an opportunity to}} act in a featured role by Hawks, in 1927's, The Cradle Snatchers. After the success of The Cradle Snatchers, Stuart would star in several shorts, many of which again paired him with his Snatchers co-star, Sally Phipps, which included Gentlemen Prefer Scotch, and Cupid and the Clock (based on a short story by O. Henry). The two would star in Stuart's next three films in 1927 and 1928: High School Hero, Why Sailors Go Wrong, and News Parade. Stuart's next role was that of Sandy, starring alongside Victor McLaglen in William K. Howard's The River Pirate in 1928. Stuart and Sue Carol had been linked together romantically since early in 1928, and would co-star in Stuart's next project, Girls <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild.</b>|$|E

Levy followed the camera crew from the Girls <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild</b> video series, {{and argues that}} contemporary America's sexualized culture not only objectifies women, it encourages women to objectify themselves. In today's culture, Levy writes, {{the idea of a}} woman participating in a wet T-shirt contest or being comfortable watching explicit pornography has become a symbol of feminist strength.|$|E

On January 22, 2007, her private life became public on ParisExposed.com, a website with images of personal documents, video and other material allegedly obtained when {{the contents of a}} storage locker rented by Hilton were auctioned in lieu of a $208 payment. The website, which charged for online access to the material, had 1.2million visitors in just over 40 hours.

25|$|Since 2008, Wynn {{has been}} in a dispute with Girls <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild</b> {{producer}} Joe Francis. In 2011, a Nevada district attorney prosecuted Francis for writing a bad check to cover a $2 million gambling debt owed to Wynn, but the judge dismissed the case for falling outside the six-month statute of limitations. Wynn collected the debt in a separate civil case. In response to the collection, Francis stated that Wynn threatened to kill him, prompting Wynn to file suit for defamation against Francis. In February 2012, Clark County, Nevada, judge Mark Denton ruled that Francis damaged the reputation of Wynn and awarded Wynn $7.5 million in damages. In September 2012, after Francis repeated the alleged threat on television and Wynn added a second defamation claim, a jury awarded Wynn $40 million in compensatory and punitive damages, much more than the original $12 million Wynn's party had demanded. The judgement was amended to $19 million, after Wynn failed to prove that Francis could pay the original amount.|$|E

500|$|On February 4, 2012, Joe Francis, {{the creator}} of the Girls <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild</b> video franchisee, {{threatened}} to sue Madonna if she sang the song during her halftime show performance.

[...] The National Football League (NFL) revealed in their magazine that the song would not be performed at the Super Bowl.

500|$|In {{a review}} of the episodes {{featured}} on The Simpsons <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild,</b> PopMatters critic Stephen Haag wrote that [...] "none of these episodes will end up in the Simpsons Hall of Fame", and that [...] "The Mansion Family" [...] is [...] "hardly a classic episode, but Lord knows there are plenty worse from season 11 (paging 'Bart to the Future')." [...] He further commented that [...] "if anything, this episode {{should be included in the}} 'batshit-crazy endings' DVD," [...] referring to the ending scenes with the Chinese pirates. David Packard of DVD Verdict was more positive in his review of The Simpsons <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild,</b> writing that [...] "The Mansion Family" [...] is [...] "another all-around hilarious episode, with a nice swipe at the Grammy Awards, the Simpsons family running amok in the mansion and enjoying all it has to offer, and Burns' various tests at the Mayo Clinic (my favorite gag is when Burns is slid into an MRI machine, only to hear the thing grind to a halt with an error message reading 'Clear body jam in Area 1.')" ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Girl Gone Wild" [...] is a mid-tempo electropop party {{track that}} is {{influenced}} by four-on-the-floor. The song opens with a prayer and features electronic music elements. After the song was released, Joe Francis, the creator of Girls <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild</b> franchise, threatened to sue Madonna for copyright infringement if she sang the song during her performance at Super Bowl XLVI halftime show. Madonna's representatives stated {{that she was not}} aware of either Francis or the lawsuit, and that several songs with the same name had already been released by other artists.|$|E
500|$|These fights {{were usually}} {{close-up}} and personal, {{with a number}} of shots blasted from pistols, often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets <b>gone</b> <b>wild.</b> Much of the time, {{it would be difficult to}} tell who had [...] "won” the gunfight for several minutes, as the black powder smoke from the pistols cleared the air. How famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man. Many well-known gunfighters were so feared by the public because of their reputation that when they were killed, they died as a result of ambush rather than going down in a [...] "blaze of glory". Others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness.|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{felt that}} the film's attempt to appeal to an older, more mature {{audience}} was ultimately a bad idea. Kerry Bennett of Parent Previews warned that it sometimes steered [...] "dangerously off course" [...] due to an excess of sexual content and violence. Referential humor to the marriage of Jennifer Lopez, Manolo Blahnik style silver shoes, and films such as Girls <b>Gone</b> <b>Wild,</b> The Passion of the Christ, Apocalypse Now, and [...] were seen as too mature. Cold Fusion Video judged the Kelly Osbourne cameo as [...] "pointless". Dursin contrasted the two guest appearances {{and found that the}} Tarantino cameo dragged the film down. Critics were split on the merits of ABC's modernized adaptation to rely on plot elements from the original novel instead of the iconic 1939 film.|$|E

500|$|... "Media Blitz" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with several}} commentators particularly praising {{the performance of}} Adam Scott, although some said the subplot with Chris and Ann was less effective. TV Guide writer Damian Holbrook wrote, [...] "Party Down vet absolutely stole the show on Parks and Recreation. ... Scott was a machine of mania, a dork <b>gone</b> <b>wild,</b> who gave the rapidly unraveling Ben {{just the right amount}} of crazy while completely cracking us up." [...] Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] continue a long period of excellent Parks and Recreation episodes, although he said the problems were resolved too quickly at the end of the episode. Sundermann said Scott's slightly over-the-top performance was made especially funny because he is normally such a straight man character. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix praised Scott for his ability to be both a straight man and a more outrageously funny character, as during his meltdowns in media interviews. Sepinwall also complimented Aubrey Plaza's performance and said the overall episode was very funny, but that the main storyline was resolved too quickly.|$|E
