5|$|Gamma, {{the team}} leader and main {{combatant}} of Zombiepowder.s cast, is a 22-year-old powder hunter who desires the zombie powder {{for the sake}} of immortality, and has already obtained one Ring of the Dead at his introduction in the first chapter. Due to numerous past violent crimes, Gamma {{is one of the most}} wanted criminals in the Zombiepowder. universe, with a bounty to match. This high bounty was one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> determined about Gamma's character by Tite Kubo, dating back to a pre-draft rendition of the character who was a sort of samurai. Gamma's personal history is never expounded upon, but it is implied by Balmunk that he was once a mercenary, but reformed and became a powder hunter following the death of a woman.|$|E
5|$|Around 1995, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) {{called a}} bidding {{to sell the}} property. The tender went to a Malaysian firm, the Renong Berhad and ITT-Sheraton combine over Emilio Yap, a Chinese Filipino billionaire tycoon {{and owner of the}} Manila Bulletin, the country's largest {{newspaper}} by circulation. Yap went to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and won by matching Rehong's bid and citing the Constitution's Filipino First policy in the ownership of a 'national patrimony'. Fifty one percent of the ownership was awarded to Yap's Manila Prince Hotel Corporation (MPHC), while new owners joined on April 25, 1997 as 49 percent shareholder. Yap signed a check for ₱673.2 million and the MPHC took over the property on May 7, 1997. One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> Yap did was to pull down the three brass chandeliers in the lobby, upon recommendation of a feng shui expert, and replace them with five.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} {{office for}} the construction was established in 1923 and was until 1935 located at Voss. In that period, construction was led by Peter Bernhard Kristian Lahlum, who was also responsible for the Hardanger Line. After the Hardanger Line was completed, Lahlum retired, and the office was moved to Flåm where responsibility {{was taken over by}} Adolph M. B. Kielland. To start with, there were 120 men working on the construction, although this quickly increased to 220. The numbers fluctuated between that and as low as 80, although hit an all-time high of 280 people in 1937. To house the employees, eight barracks were built. Among the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> built were housing and station buildings, which could then be used by people working on the construction. The local economy was stimulated by farmers being paid for transport. Using horses, they would transport tourists by day and building materials by night. The competition was fierce, resulting in fights for customers, although it calmed down after traffic police were introduced.|$|E

While he has turned away from his past life as a Corwid, his brothers and sisters still consider him as one. Ghat still harbors a sense of admiration for the single-mindedness of Corwids.

25|$|The Shinshū Honbyō, the {{mausoleum}} of Shinran, is {{now owned by}} the Ōtani-ha but is still commonly called Higashi Honganji (東本願寺) by Kyoto visitors and locals. The massive Goei-dō (also known as Mie-dō), or Founder's Hall Gate, is often one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> one sees walking north from JR Kyōto Station. Nearly identical to the Nishi Hongan-ji head temple in layout, it too features an Amida-dō, and a larger Mie-dō. The Mie-dō at Higashi Hongan-ji dates from 1895 and vies {{with a number of}} other structures for the claim of largest wooden building in the world.|$|E
25|$|During the SXSW 2007 demo, Will Wright {{said that}} the {{underwater}} phase {{was on the verge}} of being cut out. However, he has also said that, if cut, underwater civilizations would be one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> to add via an expansion pack. Though the final version of Spore released to stores had indeed proven the underwater phase had been cut, it is still possible for the player's creature to swim above water. If the player swim too far into the sea, then they get eaten by a sea monster, which is probably the present-game Maxis creature, Battered Feesh.|$|E
25|$|One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> Tacitus {{mentions}} in {{his work}} Germania is that the Germanic people treasure their animals above all else. Tacitus also concludes that the Germanic people found cultivation repulsive. Instead, he states, the Germanic people devote themselves to food and sleep and besides that they prefer to remain idle. All of this, to certain extents, applied to Jämtland. When the people of Jämtland settled down they relied mostly on pastoralism (transhumance). Their animals were the source of wealth and they were therefore loved by their owners. This love for the livestock has manifested itself in the dialect, a male nipple is called bokkjen (the buck) and a female nipple is known as geita (the goat).|$|E

25|$|Observers have {{generally}} described Gamergate {{as part of}} a long-running culture war against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games. Vox said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical issues than in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women. Ars Technica quoted early members as saying that they had no interest in videogames and were primarily interested in attacking Quinn. In <b>First</b> <b>Things,</b> Nathaniel Givens described Gamergate as a reaction to the aggressive promotion of a progressive environment in video game culture.|$|E
25|$|Birmingham City Council first {{recognised}} {{the importance}} of tourism in raising {{the profile of the}} Jewellery Quarter in the 1980s. Studies were commissioned on the industry and potential for tourism in the area. These were put together into a strategy which included aims such as improving views in the area, established a museum and a trade centre to rival Germany and Italy. This was accepted, except the trade centre proposal. The <b>first</b> <b>things</b> to be implemented were the refurbishment Vyse Street car park and the improvement in street parking provisions. Former derelict sites were turned into surface car parks. The existing street furniture was improved whilst necessary additions were made. To influence the quality of design for future shops, a shopfront design guide was prepared by the council for the area. There were also plans for an arcade and gateways into the Jewellery Quarter, but these were abandoned in the 1990s {{due to a lack of}} available finances.|$|E
25|$|Mark Tauber, senior {{vice-president}} of HarperOne, {{has stated that}} the Green Bible was developed {{with the intention of}} being “the first ever specialty bible that takes the issues of sustainability, stewardship of the earth, what many in the religious community call ‘creation care’ very seriously”. He went further, exposing on the Green Bible’s purpose: “That the Bible has a profound message of sustainability—some might argue, the original message—is not all that surprising. What is surprising {{is that it is not}} one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> that comes to mind when most folks think about the Bible and its message... this Bible seeks to change that fact. We believe that the unique and specially added features by some of today's most important thinkers, writers and leaders, across the ecumenical spectrum make it a must-have for those who already find motivation, comfort and inspiration in it and for the many more who might see it freshly as a critical resource in their journey to sustain our planet”.|$|E
