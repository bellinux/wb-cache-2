2500|$|<b>Fluorescence</b> <b>{{correlation}}</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (FCS) [...] is {{a correlation}} analysis of fluctuation of the fluorescence intensity. The analysis provides {{parameters of the}} physics under the fluctuations. One of the interesting applications of this is {{an analysis of the}} concentration fluctuations of fluorescent particles (molecules) in solution. In this application, the fluorescence emitted from a very tiny space in solution containing a small number of fluorescent particles (molecules) is observed. The fluorescence intensity is fluctuating due to Brownian motion of the particles. In other words, the number of the particles in the sub-space defined by the optical system is randomly changing around the average number. The analysis gives the average number of fluorescent particles and average diffusion time, when the particle is passing through the space. Eventually, both the concentration and size of the particle (molecule) are determined. Both parameters are important in biochemical research, biophysics, and chemistry.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFluorescence <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (FCS) is now {{a widely}} used {{technique}} to measure small ensembles of labeled biomolecules with single molecule detection sensitivity (e. g., low endogenous concentrations). <b>Fluorescence</b> cross <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (FCCS) is a derivative of this technique that detects the synchronous movement of two biomolecules with different fluorescence labels. Both methods {{can be applied to}} live cells and, therefore, can be used to address a variety of unsolved questions in cell biology. Applications of FCCS with autofluorescent proteins (AFPs) have been hampered so far by cross talk between the detector channels due to the large spectral overlap of the fluorophores. Here we present a new method that combines advantages of these techniques to analyze binding behavior of proteins in live cells. To achieve this, we have used dual color excitation of a common pair of AFPs, ECFP and EYFP, being discriminated in excitation rather than in emission. This is made possible by pulsed excitation and detection on a shorter timescale compared to the average residence time of particles in the FCS volume element. By this technique we were able to eliminate cross talk in the detector channels and obtain an undisturbed cross correlation signal. The setup was tested with ECFP/EYFP lysates as well as chimeras as negative and positive controls and demonstrated to work in live HeLa cells coexpressing the two fusion proteins ECFP-connexin and EYFP-connexin...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} EphA 2 interacts with its glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) -linked ephrin-A 1 ligand in a juxtacrine configuration. The soluble ephrin-A 1 protein, without its GPI membrane linker, fails to activate EphA 2. However, preclustered ephrin-A 1 protein is active in solution and has been frequently used to trigger the EphA 2 receptor. Although this approach has yielded insights into EphA 2 signaling, preclustered ligands bypass natural receptor clustering processes and thus mask any role of clustering as a signal regulatory mechanism. Here, we present EphA 2 -expressing cells with a fusion protein of monomeric ephrin-A 1 (mEA 1) and enhanced monomeric yellow fluorescent protein that is linked to a supported lipid bilayer via a nickel-decahistidine anchor. The mEA 1 is homogeneously dispersed, laterally mobile, and monomeric as measured by <b>fluorescence</b> imaging, <b>correlation</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> and photon counting histogram analysis, respectively.

Dual-color cross-correlation, an extension of this technique, also assesses the concomitant movement of two spectrally distinguishable fluorescent molecules and has therefore proven superior to autocorrelation analysis to study interactions between different molecular species in solution. Here we explore the benefits of cross-correlation analysis when applied to live cells, by demonstrating its potential in analyzing endocytic processes. Bacterial cholera toxin (CTX) was labeled with Cy 2 and Cy 5 dyes on different subunits of the same holotoxin. Along the endocytic pathway, positive cross-correlation between the A and B subunits was first preserved, later followed by a loss in cross-correlation upon their separation in the Golgi. Furthermore, endocytosis of a mixture of only Cy 2 - and only Cy 5 -labeled holotoxins also gave rise to cross-correlation. Our results suggest that cross-correlation {{may be used to}} recognize whether different cargoes use the same endocytic pathway. Additionally, we show that cross-correlation is applicable to two-dimensional membrane diffusion. CTX bound to GM 1 -containing artificial giant unilamellar vesicles was diffusible, whereas CTX bound to the plasma membrane was immobile on the FCS time-scale, possibly because of raft-association of GM 1...|$|R

However, all studies so far analyzed the stoichiometry of the CNTF receptor complex in vitro {{and not in the}} context of living cells.

In addition, we measured Förster-type fluorescence resonance energy transfer between two differently labeled CNTFs within a receptor complex indicating a distance of 5 – 7  nm between the two. These findings are not consistent with a tetrameric structure of the CNTFR complex suggesting that either hexamers and or even higher-order structures (e. g. an octamer containing two tetramers) are formed...|$|R
