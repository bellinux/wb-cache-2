5000|$|Coordination (the more correct term is progression) {{refers to}} {{the timing of the}} signals so that a [...] "platoon" [...] of cars {{traveling}} on a street arrives at a succession of green lights and proceeds through multiple intersections without stopping. A well coordinated signal system can enhance traffic flow, reduce delay and minimize pollution. However, it is not always possible to retain progression throughout a network of signals. It is also difficult to maintain signal progression on a two-way street. An early traffic engineer Henry Barnes, who served as Commissioner of Traffic in many cities including Baltimore, Maryland and New York City, developed coordinated traffic signal timings, so that large amounts of traffic could be accommodated on major traffic arterials. [...] Traffic signal timing is a very complex topic. For example timing a 'WALK' signal for a wide pedestrian crossing and slower pedestrians (for example the elderly) could result in very long waits for vehicles, and thus increases the likelihood of cars running the light, which could potentially cause accidents. Therefore, optimizing the safety of intersections involves multiple factors like street width, lane width, number of intersecting streets, availability of electricity for a signal, number of cars per unit of time and even/uneven nature of <b>flow,</b> <b>number</b> and type of pedestrians, and many other factors.|$|E

The effects of scale-up and pseudoplasticity on the turbulent flow were studied. Reynolds numbers of 6. 0 9 ̆ 5 10 ? up to 3. 3 9 ̆ 5 10 ?were reached. Measurements of the local instantaneous velocity components were conducted in a plane midway between two baffles, resulting in the calculation of non-dimensional mean and root mean square proflles of all three velocity components.

40|$|The orthokinetic {{coalescence}} efficiency, of two Newtonian droplets {{submerged in}} a Newtonian fluid in simple shear flow, was theoretically investigated. The investigation considered three drainage models: immobile, partially mobile and mobile interfaces. The coalescence efficiency was also determined by solving the trajectory equations {{of the simple}} shear flow. The analysis showed that a critical approach angle, αcrit exists, below which the colliding droplets separate. Above this critical angle the collision leads to coalescence. The coalescence efficiency,, is related to αcrit by = cos(αcrit). Dimensional analysis showed that the coalescence efficiency depends on several dimensionless groups namely the <b>flow</b> <b>number,</b> the capillary number, the viscosity ratio and the radii ratio of the colliding droplets. The dependence of the coalescence efflciency on the <b>flow</b> <b>number,</b> the capillary number and the viscosity ratio was studied. It {{was found that the}} coalescence efficiency decreases as the capillary number and the <b>flow</b> <b>number</b> increase. For immobile interfaces the coalescence efficiency is independent of the capillary number until deformation sets in where it drops sharply. It was also found that the coalescence efficiency increases as the viscosity ratio increases. The coalescence efficiency calculated from the trajectory analysis decreases as the <b>flow</b> <b>number</b> increases. The dependence is strong for small values of the <b>flow</b> <b>number</b> and weak for large values. The relative position of one droplet with respect to the other in space strongly influences the coalescence efficiency. The maximum efficiency is achieved when the two droplets are in the same shear plane, i. e., when θ = 90 °. As the angle θ decreases the coalescence effiiency also decreases. Below a certain value of the angle θ the collision is inefficient and no coalescence takes place. The minimum distance between two colliding droplets as a function of θ was determined. The results revealed that the minimum distance is smallest when θ = 90 °. An equation to calculate the average coalescence efficiency is presented...|$|E

The effects of the tangential <b>flow</b> Reynolds <b>number</b> (Re-U), axial <b>flow</b> Reynolds <b>number</b> (Re-W), cavity aspect ratio and shear thinning property of the fluids on tangential and axial velocity distributions and the frictional pressure drop are studied. Where comparison is possible, very good agreement is found between current numerical results and published asymptotic and numerical results. For shear thinning materials in long thin cavities in the tangential flow dominated flow regime, the numerical results show that the frictional pressure drop lies between two extreme conditions, namely the results for duct flow and analytical results from lubrication theory. For shear thinning materials in a lid-driven cavity, the interaction between the tangential flow and axial flow is very complex because the flow is dependent on the <b>flow</b> Reynolds <b>numbers</b> and the ratio of the average axial velocity and the lid velocity. For both Newtonian and shear thinning fluids, the axial velocity peak is shifted and the frictional pressure drop is increased with increasing tangential <b>flow</b> Reynolds <b>number.</b> The results are highly relevant to industrial devices such as screw extruders and scraped surface heat exchangers.
