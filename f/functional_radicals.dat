40|$|Functionalized silica hybrid {{materials}} are extensively studied and applied {{materials in the}} field of science and technology. Functionalization is an approach, which allows for the application of or-ganic components in the improvement of the design, properties and potential application of sili-cate materials. Silica hybrid materials, functionalized via incorporation of organic components (chitosan and methacrylic acid) were synthesized by the sol-gel method. The base silica structure of the hybrids was obtained via hydrolysis and condensation of the silicate precursor, tetraethyl orthosilicate. The investigations of synthesized hybrids are focused on the influence of the nature and quantity of functional organic components on their final structures and properties. The struc-tural characteristics of obtained hybrid materials were investigated using XRD, FTIR, SEM and DTA/TG analysis. The obtained results presented the formation of amorphous porous structure and the organic components are evenly distributed into the silica network.

In addition to polarizing the N-O bond through hydrogen bonding, the rotaxane structure affects the chemistry of the nitrone groups in two significant ways: The intercomponent hydrogen bonding activates the nitrone groups to electrochemical reduction, a one electron reduction of the rotaxane being stablized by a remarkable 400 mV (8. 1 kcal mol- 1) with respect to the same process in the thread; encapsulation, however, protects the same functional groups from chemical reduction with an external reagent (and slows down electron transfer to and from the electroactive groups in cyclicvoltammetry experiments).

40|$|Innovation {{is crucial}} for the {{long-term}} survival and growth of organizations. Many manufacturing companies face intense pressures to innovate and develop new products that meet customer requirements. A central component of success in new product development is {{the maintenance of a}} balance between exploration and exploitation. Exploration can be defined as the pursuit of new knowledge of things that might come to be known, exploitation as the use and development of things already known. Organizations encounter various challenges in balancing and organizing these activities as they entail inherent contradictions that need to be managed. This research provides new insights into the antecedents of exploration and exploitation on the individual, team and organizational level. It demonstrates that organizations pursuing both incremental and radical innovation should structure explorative and exploitative processes differently. Incremental innovation requires a <b>functional</b> structure, whereas <b>radical</b> innovation benefits from a cross-functional structure. Besides structural factors, this research stresses the relevance of cognitive factors in explaining innovation performance. In new product development teams, analytical processing of information has a positive impact on the performance of both explorative and exploitative innovation projects. Intuitive processing, however, only has a positive impact on performance of explorative innovation projects, where creativity and experimenting are important. In exploitative projects, where focus lies on efficiency and standardization, intuitive processing has a negative impact on project performance. Exploration and exploitation thus demand different organizational structures, but also different thinking styles. This research also shows how thinking styles of CEOs and investing in exploration and exploitation are linked. Finally, relationships between cognitive and structural factors and how they affect the evolution of exploration and exploitation within a firm are explored in a longitudinal study...|$|R
40|$|Background: Oncologic and <b>functional</b> {{outcomes}} after <b>radical</b> prostatectomy (RP) {{can vary}} between surgeons {{to a greater}} extent than is expected by chance. We sought to examine the effects of surgeon variation on functional and oncologic outcomes for patients undergoing RP for prostate cancer in a European center. Methods: The study comprised 1, 280 men who underwent open retropubic RP performed by one of nine surgeons at an academic institution in Sweden between 2001 and 2008. Potency and continence outcomes were measured preoperatively and 18 months postoperatively by patient-administered questionnaires. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value > 0. 2 ng/mL with at least one confirmatory rise. Multivariable random effect models were used to evaluate heterogeneity between surgeons, adjusting for case mix (age, PSA, pathological stage and grade), year of surgery, and surgical experience. Results: Of 679 men potent at baseline, 647 provided data at 18 months with 122 (19 %) reporting potency. We found no evidence for heterogeneity of potency outcomes between surgeons (P = 1). The continence rate for patients at 18 months was 85 %, with 836 of the 979 patients who provided data reporting continence. There was statistically significant heterogeneity between surgeons (P = 0. 001). We did not find evidence of an association between surgeons' adjusted probabilities of functional recovery and 5 -year probability of freedom from BCR. Conclusions: Our data support previous studies regarding a large heterogeneity among surgeons in continence outcomes for patients undergoing RP. This indicates that some patients are receiving sub-optimal care. Quality assurance measures involving performance feedback, should be considered. When surgeons are aware of their outcomes, they can improve them to provide better care to patients...|$|R

Patients and methods: From 1. 1. 2004 to 31. 12. 2014, at the Department of Surgery, University Hospital Martin and Jessenius Medical Faculty of Comenius University in Martin, we operated 411 patients with benign, primary, metastatic tumors of liver, where in 33 patients (8 %) the histology confirmed the primary intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma of liver. In the group, we evaluated the 1 -year and 5 -year survival of the patients according to radical resections, the degree of differentiation of tumor (grading), and according to positivity of lymph node. The results were statistically analyzed by the Student t-test and Kaplan–Meier curves of survival. Results: The average age of the patients was 59. 6 [*]±[*] 11. 4 years, the males represented 46. 2 %, the females represented 53. 8 %. The average age of males was 58 [*]±[*] 13. 2, and females 61 [*]±[*] 9. 8 years. Large anatomic resections of 3 and more segments of liver were performed in 24 patients, anatomic resections and metastasectomies were performed in 6 patients, two patients had radiofrequency ablation of tumor. R 0 resection was achieved in 20 patients, R 1 resection in 8 patients, and R 2 resection in 5 patients. One-year survival in the R 0 group was 65 %, in the R 1 group 62 %, and in the R 2 resections group it was only 20 %; five-year survival after R 0 resections was 52 %, and in R 1 and R 2 it was zero, which proved to be statistically significant. The median of survival in R 0 resections was 12 months (interval 1 – 87 months), in R 1 resections it was 12 months (interval 1 – 36 months), and after R 2 resections it was 7 months (interval 1 – 12 months). One-year and five-year survival, depending on the degree of differentiation, was statistically non-significant; however, the five-year survival of G 1 tumors is on the level of being statistically significant – the 5 -year survival expressed in percentage G 1 /G 2 /G 3 was 50 %/ 12 %/ 0 % respectively. Positive lymph nodes were found in 16 patients (48 %) from the group of 33 patients. The one-year and five-year survival was not statistically significant; however, 5 years of survival was recorded in 30 % patients with negative lymph node and 0 % patients with positivity of lymph node. Conclusion: Resection of tumor is the optional method; it should be attempted to achieve R 0 resection {{and at the same time}} to preserve sufficient volume of residual <b>functional</b> parenchyma. <b>Radical</b> R 0 resection is considered by us as the only possible method of surgical treatment for survival of patients with IHCC...|$|R
40|$|Radical was {{originally}} a word relating to a root or roots which, {{by the early}} modern period, was used particularly in philosophy, astrology and philology. Hence radical moisture (‘humidum radicale’) was understood to be the ‘natural moysture’ or ‘fundamental juyce of the body, whereby the natural heat is nourished and preserved, as the flame in a Lamp is preserved by oyle’. In astrology a radical question was one put forward when ‘the Lord of the ascendent, and Lord of the hour are of one nature and triplicitie’. Similarly, philologists divided the letters that made up Hebrew words into root and <b>functional</b> letters, the <b>radical</b> or radix being the essential and permanent part of the word form. By extension, radical also signified origin and hence fundamental qualities inherent in the nature or essence of a person or thing. As Conal Condren has observed, however, radical only became a political term associated with thorough or far-reaching political and social reform {{towards the end of}} the eighteenth century. Indeed, it was apparently not until autumn 1819 – shortly before Lord Byron thought radical might mean uprooting – that ‘radicalism’ was coined by Jeremy Bentham. Nor was it a univocal word for within a decade radicalism meant not only the political views characteristic of radicals but thoroughness of method as well. Condren’s point was that historians aim to know the past as it really was, whereas anachronism manifestly ‘specifies the past as it really wasn’t’. Accordingly, he stressed that ‘we need to be particularly fastidious about our interpretive vocabulary’. Jonathan Clark goes further, regarding radicalism as an early nineteenth-century neologism applicable to ‘a fusion of universal suffrage, Ricardian economics and programmatic atheism’. As Glen Burgess notes in a recent debate on radicalism and the English Revolution, the work of both Condren and Clark may be characterised as a sceptical or nominalist approach: radicalism did not exist until it was named...|$|R
40|$|Controlled {{polymerisation}} {{techniques have}} increased the level of structural and chemical sophistication possible in modern synthetic polymers. This has led to advanced properties and applications in fields as diverse as energy production, medicine and electronics. This study aims to further extend the scope of two such techniques, ROMP (ring-opening metathesis polymerisation) and ADMET (acyclic diene metathesis), by combining them with thiol-based click chemistries. An arguable limitation of these polymerisations is their lack of commercially available functional substrates. A nucleophilic thiol-Michael reaction was used to conjugate a library of thiols to an exo- 7 -oxanorbornene and an α,ω-diene precursor via their acrylic pendants. This allowed the expedient synthesis of 18 novel ROMP monomers and 9 novel ADMET monomers with different polarities, steric characteristics and chemical groups. Homopolymerisation was carried out with Grubbs’ 1 st or 3 rd generation catalysts, {{and in the case}} of ROMP, proceeded in a controlled manner. Low dispersities, the linear evolution of molecular weight and the successful preparation of AB di-block copolymers indicated pseudo-living polymerisation. Due to the gradual coordination and deactivation of Ru-based catalysts with thio-ether moieties, an additional protective oxidation step was required for slower ADMET polymerisations to reach high conversion. Thiol-based chemistries were also employed for post-polymerisation modification. The unsaturated backbone of a representative poly(exo- 7 -oxanorbornene) was quantitatively modified with 16 <b>functional</b> thiols via <b>radical</b> initiated hydrothiolation without disrupting the well-defined structure of the parent polymer. Monomers bearing latent acrylic ene and trimethylsilane protected alkyne pendants were also synthesised, (co) polymerised and modified with thiol-Michael, thiol-yne, CuAAC and Diels Alder chemistry. Finally, novel organic-inorganic hybrids were prepared via in-situ and simultaneous ROMP and sol-gel processes. Although the hydrophobicity of conventional polynorbornene caused phase separation, well dispersed titania nano-composites were achieved using functional exo- 7 -oxanorbornene thiol-Michael adducts. The combination of thiol-based click chemistry, metathesis polymerisation and sol-gel condensation was shown to be compatible and highly effective for the preparation of polymeric materials with advanced architectures and tailored chemical functionality...|$|R
40|$|In {{spoken word}} production, a {{proximate}} unit {{is the first}} phonological unit at the sublexical level that is selectable for production (O’Seaghdha, Chen, & Chen, 2010). The present study investigated whether the proximate unit in Chinese handwritten word production is the stroke, the radical, or something in between. A written version of the form preparation task was adopted. Chinese participants learned sets of two-character words, later were cued with the first character of each word, and had to write down the second character (the target). Response times were measured from the onset of a cue character to the onset of a written response. In Experiment 1, the target characters within a block shared (homogeneous) or did not share (heterogeneous) the first stroke. In Experiment 2, the first two strokes were shared in the homogeneous blocks. Response times in the homogeneous blocks and in the heterogeneous blocks were comparable in both experiments (Exp. 1 : 687 ms vs. 684 ms, Exp. 2 : 717 vs. 716). In Experiment 3 and 4, the target characters within a block shared or did not share the first radical. Response times in the homogeneous blocks were significantly faster {{than those in the}} heterogeneous blocks (Exp. 3 : 685 vs. 704, Exp. 4 : 594 vs. 650). In Experiment 5 and 6, the shared component was a Gestalt-like form that is more than a stroke, constitutes a portion of the target character, can be a stand-alone character itself, can be a radical of another character but is not a radical of the target character (e. g., 士in聲, 鼓, 穀, 款; called a logographeme). Response times in the homogeneous blocks were significantly faster than those in the heterogeneous blocks (Exp. 5 : 576 vs. 625, Exp. 6 : 586 vs. 620). These results suggest a model of Chinese handwritten character production in which the stroke is not a <b>functional</b> unit, the <b>radical</b> plays the role of a morpheme, and the logographeme is the proximate unit...|$|R
