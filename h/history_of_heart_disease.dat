40|$|Background. People with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> are at {{increased}} risk of future stroke; therefore, identification of risk factors by GPs is critical. Objectives. To compare the following among general practice patients with and without a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> disease: (i) self-reported prevalence rates of lifestyle risk factors; (ii) accuracy of GP detection of patient-reported risk factors and (iii) average proportion of patient-reported risk factors detected by GPs. Methods. Consecutive patients attending a participating general practice clinic were invited to participate in a cross-sectional touchscreen survey assessing lifestyle risk factors in 2010 - 11. The GP of each consenting patient completed a corresponding survey assessing the patient's risk factors. Demographic characteristics of patients and GPs were obtained. Results. Data from 51 GPs and 564 patients were analysed. Patients without a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> reported significantly higher rates of smoking (12 %) and risky alcohol consumption (56 %) than patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (6 % and 36 %, respectively). Low sensitivity of GP detection of risk factors was found for all risk factors for all patients. Patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> have a significantly higher mean proportion of risk factors detected by their GP compared to patients without a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> (P = 0. 00). Conclusion. Given low sensitivity and specificity of GP detection of risk factors among patients, alternate methods of identification are needed. Research is required to determine strategies to facilitate secondary care of patients with a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> stroke or <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> by GPs...|$|R

25|$|Most {{evidence}} suggests that statins are effective in preventing heart disease in those with high cholesterol, but no <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> A 2013 Cochrane review found a decrease in risk of death and other poor outcomes without any evidence of harm. For every 138 people treated for 5 years one fewer dies and for every 49 treated one fewer has an episode of heart disease. A 2011 review reached similar conclusions. And a 2012 review found benefits in both women and men. A 2010 review concluded that treating people with no history of cardiovascular disease reduces cardiovascular events in men but not women, and provides no mortality benefit in either sex. Two other meta analyses published that year, one of which used data obtained exclusively from women, found no mortality benefit in primary prevention.|$|E

40|$|It is {{believed}} that extreme hot and cold weather has {{a negative impact on}} general health conditions. Much research focuses on mortality, but there is relatively little community health research. This study is aimed at identifying high-risk groups who are sensitive to extreme weather conditions, in particular, very hot and cold days, through an analysis of the health-related help-seeking patterns of over 60, 000 Personal Emergency Link (PE-link) users in Hong Kong relative to weather conditions. In the study, 1, 659, 716 PE-link calls to the help center were analyzed. Results showed that females, older elderly, people who did not live alone, non-subsidized (relatively high-income) users, and those without medical <b>histories</b> <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> hypertension, stroke, and diabetes were more sensitive to extreme weather condition. The results suggest that using official government weather forecast reports to predict health-related help-seeking behavior is feasible. An evidence-based strategic plan could be formulated by using a method similar to that used in this study to identify high-risk groups. Preventive measures could be established for protecting the target groups when extreme weather conditions are forecasted. School of Nursin...|$|R
