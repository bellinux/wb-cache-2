40|$|The {{nations of}} the world confront complex {{challenges}} in managing fisheries resources in the 21 st century. While attention focuses on the need for new institutional ideas, designing and implementing effective governance may be imperiled by inadequate investment in the human capital needed to lead, innovate, and manage. Economics, which integrates social, biological, and policy attributes of a fishery, is increasingly recognized as a core discipline, essential to system level decision-making. Building human capital requires leadership and cooperation from the highest levels of national and international authorities. However, management agencies are overwhelmed by challenges that hinder attention to capacity building, and professional organizations rarely focus on rigorous fishery management education. Ideally, an international organization or consortium would be charged with facilitating fishery management training at regional and national scales. Is there a role for IIFET in progressing this goal and assuring the <b>integration</b> of <b>economics</b> in capacity building frameworks?

40|$|There is {{a growing}} demand {{for the use of}} {{renewable}} energy technologies to generate electricity due to concerns over climate change. The oceans provide a huge potential resource of energy. Energy extraction using marine current energy devices (MCEDs) offers a sustainable alternative to conventional sources and a predictable alternative to other renewable energy technologies. A MCED utilises the kinetic energy of the tides as opposed to the potential energy which is utilised by a tidal barrage. Over the past decade MCEDs have become an increasingly popular method of energy extraction. However, marine current energy technology is still not economically viable on a large scale due to its current stage of development. Ireland has an excellent marine current energy resource as it is an island nation and experiences excellent marine current flows. This paper reviews marine current energy devices, including a detailed up-to-date description of the current status of development. Issues such as network <b>integration,</b> <b>economics,</b> and environmental implications are addressed as well as the application and costs of MCEDs in Ireland.
