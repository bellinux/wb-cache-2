5|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{is one such}} operation. In this operation, one or more arteries {{surrounding}} the heart that have become narrowed are bypassed. This is done by taking blood vessels <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> {{another part of the}} body. Commonly harvested veins include the saphenous veins or the internal mammary artery. Because this operation involves the heart tissue, a machine is used so that blood can bypass the heart during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} heavy metals, including toxic ones, from polluted soil. For this reason, consuming mushrooms <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> potentially contaminated sites—such as near roadsides {{subject to}} heavy traffic—is not recommended. In a Turkish study of various edible mushroom species collected from lawns, near roads, {{and the inner}} parts of forests, the fruit bodies of L.sanguifluus were determined to have accumulated high levels of zinc, manganese, nickel, cobalt, cadmium, and lead.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Shogunate's {{efforts to}} protect Japan from Western colonial forces, the defence of Hyogo Port was {{upgraded}} {{with the construction of}} the Wadamisaki Battery, one of six land batteries built around Osaka Bay under the design of Count Katsu Kaishū. It was completed in 1864 after 18 months of construction at a cost of 25,000 ryō. The outer enceinte was built of granite from the Shiwaku Islands and the inner two-storey structure was made of keyaki (Japanese elm) wood <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> the Nunobiki and Tekkai Mountains in Kobe. In 1921 the battery was the first place in Hyogo Prefecture to be designated as a historic site by the prefectural government.|$|E

5|$|Edible {{mushrooms}} are well-known examples of fungi. Many are commercially raised, but others must be <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> the wild. Agaricus bisporus, sold as button mushrooms when small or Portobello mushrooms when larger, is a commonly eaten species, used in salads, soups, {{and many other}} dishes. Many Asian fungi are commercially grown and have increased in popularity in the West. They are often available fresh in grocery stores and markets, including straw mushrooms (Volvariella volvacea), oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus), shiitakes (Lentinula edodes), and enokitake (Flammulina spp.).|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} natural ice {{to reach its}} customers, {{it had to be}} <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> ponds and rivers, then transported and stored at various sites before finally being used in {{domestic}} or commercial applications. Throughout these processes, traders faced the problem of keeping the ice from melting; melted ice represented waste and lost profits. In the 1820s and 1830s only 10 percent of ice harvested was eventually sold to the end user due to wastage en route. By the end of the 19th century, however, the wastage in the ice trade was reduced to between 20 and 50 percent, depending on the efficiency of the company.|$|E
5|$|Most {{research}} has focused on thrips species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, but most of them feed on pollen and the chloroplasts <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> the outer layer of plant epidermal and mesophyll cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and mortality is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.|$|E

5|$|Sea anemones {{and their}} {{attendant}} anemone fish can make attractive aquarium exhibits {{and both are}} often <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> the wild as adults or juveniles. These fishing activities significantly impact the populations of anemones and anemone fish by drastically reducing the densities of each in exploited areas. Besides their collection from the wild for use in reef aquaria, sea anemones are also threatened by alterations to their environment. Those living in shallow water coastal locations are affected directly by pollution and siltation, and indirectly by the effect these have on their photosynthetic symbionts and the prey on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|The {{marshes and}} meres {{surrounding}} the village supported fishing since Saxon times, {{at least until}} significant draining during the 17th century. Eels were plentiful in the waters {{in and around the}} Isle of Ely (Eel–ey). In 1086, Little Thetford was worth 3,250 eels to the nearby abbots. In one year, 1087, it was written that 52,000 eels were caught in and around the city. The islands in this landscape supported pastures; whilst reeds, peat, and rushes were <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> the wetlands. As the land was drained, arable farming became the dominant activity, as it is today.|$|E

In 2011–2012, it contributed 63.22% of the state's GDP, agriculture and allied sectors contributed 15.73%, while manufacturing, construction and utilities contributed 21.05%. Nearly half of Kerala's people depend on agriculture alone for income. Around 600 varieties of rice, which is Kerala's most used staple and cereal crop, are <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> 3105.21km2; a decline from 5883.4km2 in 1990. 688,859tonnes of rice are produced per year.

5|$|Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, {{horses were}} <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> the feral herds {{and used as}} riding and stock horses, {{as well as being}} used for their meat, hair and hides. Originally there were many herds that roamed land owned by the British Crown and the native Māori, but many were {{eradicated}} with the intensification of large scale farming and forestry operations combined with increased mechanization that decreased the need for stock horses. Kaimanawa horses today have the highest amount of genetic similarity with the Thoroughbred and other Thoroughbred cross breeds.|$|E
5|$|Where {{medicinal}} plants are <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> the wild rather than cultivated, they {{are subject to}} both general and specific threats. General threats include climate change and habitat loss to development and agriculture. A specific threat is over-collection to meet rising demand for medicines. A case in point was the pressure on wild populations of the Pacific yew soon after news of taxol's effectiveness became public. The threats could be addressed by cultivation of some {{medicinal plants}}, or by a system of certification to make wild harvesting sustainable.|$|E
5|$|Europeans began {{settling}} the river valleys around the Metacomet Ridge in the mid–17th century. Forests were cut down or burned {{to make room}} for agriculture, resulting in the near complete denuding of the once contiguous forests of southern New England by the 19th century. Steep terrain like the Metacomet Ridge, while not suitable for planting crops, was widely harvested of timber {{as a result of the}} expanding charcoal industry that boomed before the mining of coal from the mid–Appalachian regions replaced it as a source of fuel. In other cases, ridgetop forests burned when lower elevation land was set afire, and some uplands were used for pasturing. Traprock was <b>harvested</b> <b>from</b> talus slopes of the Metacomet Ridge to build house foundations; copper ore was discovered at the base of Peak Mountain in northern Connecticut and was mined by prisoners incarcerated at Old Newgate Prison located there.|$|E

40|$|Energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>from</b> ambient sources has {{attracted}} {{a lot of research}} recently due to the high demand for cheaper and greener energy. Energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>from</b> RF sources involves three major stages, the first stage is the reception of the RF signal using an antenna, secondly the signal is conditioned using the appropriate circuits. Finally the signal is either used directly by a load or is stored in a battery or a capacitor. Several researchers have investigated the possibility of <b>harvesting</b> energy <b>from</b> ambient RF energy sources such as Wi-Fi, GSM, microwaves, CDMA, UHF and even AM signals. But in most of these researches, the harvested energy is too low, especially when the energy harvester is far from the transmitting station. This paper reviews the techniques used in RF energy harvesting and optimization of the harvested energy. The aim is to review past and present developments and approaches employed in <b>harvesting</b> energy <b>from</b> RF sources. The areas that require attention will also be presented. This paper will contribute positively towards research and development in the field of energy <b>harvesting</b> <b>from</b> ambient RF sources such as cell phone radiations, FM and AM radio signals, Wi-Fi signals and cellular networks signals...|$|R
