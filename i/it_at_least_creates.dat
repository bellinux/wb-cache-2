This work describes the strategic territorial Gipuzkoa+ 20 process developed by the Strategic Office of the Provincial Council of Gipuzkoa. The elaboration of a Gipuzkoa 2030 vision and in order to achieve it the proposal of the Gipuzkoa 2020 - 2030 strategy, are the culmination of a long work during three years integrating the short-term and the long-term dynamics. foresight, spatial strategy, action, learning process, expectation...|$|R
40|$|In this work, an {{existing}} generator for layout of Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is improved. The tool is completed with a block decoder, which was missing when the thesis started. A feature of generating schematic files is also added. The schematics {{are important to}} get a better overview, to test parts properly, and enable Layout versus Schematics (LVS) checks. The main focus of this thesis work is to implement and evaluate a new SRAM cell, called Zero Aware Asymmetric SRAM cell. This cell saves major power when zeros are stored. Furthermore the pull-up circuit is modified to be less power consuming. Other parts are also modified to fit the new memory cell. Several minor flaws are corrected in the layout generator. It does still not produce a complete memory without manual interventions, but <b>it</b> does <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>create</b> all parts with one command. Several tests, including Design Rule Checks (DRC) and LVS checks, are carried out both on minor and larger parts. Development of documentation that makes it easier for users and developers to use and understand the tool is initiated...|$|R
