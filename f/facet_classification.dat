40|$|This paper {{looks at}} Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) to {{investigate}} how a <b>faceted</b> <b>classification</b> {{can be expressed}} in RDF and shared on the Semantic Web. Statement of the Problem <b>Faceted</b> <b>classification</b> outlines <b>facets</b> as well as subfacets and facet values. Hierarchical relationships and associative relationships are established in a <b>faceted</b> <b>classification.</b> RDF is used to describe how a specific URI has a relationship to a facet value. Not only does RDF decompose "information into pieces, " but by incorporating facet values RDF also given the URI the hierarchical and associative relationships expressed in the <b>faceted</b> <b>classification.</b> Combining <b>faceted</b> <b>classification</b> and RDF creates more knowledge than if the two stood alone. An application understands the subject-predicate-object relationship in RDF and can display hierarchical and associative relationships based on the object (facet) value.

Canonical keyword-based search methodologies put an undue cognitive load on the user in requiring that the user phrase his/her thoughts into keywords {{to be used as}} input for such approaches. <b>Facet</b> <b>classification</b> has been an active paradigm in recent times in enabling exploration of huge catalogs. But even after a considerable effort has gone into building sophisticated and usable models, cata-log exploration has been a distant dream of the novice user. We present here a novel approach called Ray Exploration Model (REM) for creating such an interface. REM draws the best from and builds upon connected graphs and facet navigation, thus overcoming the inherent limitations in cur-rent interfaces using facet navigation. It conceptualizes the depth of each attribute in the data and breadth across the attributes in an easily navigable sun model with its rays. Together suns and rays form a network using relations be-tween the values of attributes. REM is demonstrated using a prototype to show that it caters to search needs of a user without the limitations of the popular keyword based search approaches.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experiment led at the Library of UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles whose objectives were {{to identify the}} usersâ€™ reading strategies in the hybrid print and electronic environment, to establish {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of eReaders and Netbooks as mobile reading devices for eBooks, and to study the behaviour of students and teachers with these devices. The ULB Library is continuously increasing its collection of eBooks and is therefore willing to know how students and teachers are using them compared to printed books, which reading devices they are using and what their added value is, and what type of licenses and usage should be negotiated to meet the usersâ€™ needs. In order to investigate these issues, the Library led an experiment in 2010, in collaboration with professors of chemistry for BA 3 students. The library bought specific eBooks and uploaded them, together with other electronic resources, onto eReaders and Netbooks which were lent to the participating students and teachers; a survey questionnaire was to be filled in before and after the experiment. The Library faced the publishersâ€™ reluctance to collaborate in this experiment for copyright reasons (problems of file format, protection, type of usage allowed, etc.). Finally, two publishers, De Boeck and Elsevier, agreed to contribute to the experiment. The results of the survey reveal the types of information resources used by students, their reading strategies, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the 3 types of reading support (print, eReader, Netbook) for various uses: quick overview of the content, set the context, handle several books simultaneously, underline text and share comments, search the text, locate, have access to and transport booksâ€¦ The conclusions highlight that eBooks provide many enhanced usage opportunities: search and browse facilities, <b>facet</b> <b>classification,</b> sharing notes, compiling tailor-made textbooks, semantic linking across resourcesâ€¦ Although the eReader offers some interesting functionalities such as touch screen, bookmarks, annotation, text search and highlight, and is transportable, light and affordable, it still needs to be improved as it is not adapted for graphs, tables and diagrams, it is slow to browse, and there are not enough textbooks available for eReaders.

40|$|The contextual {{information}} of Web images is investigated {{to address the}} issue of enriching their index characterizations with semantic descriptors and therefore bridge the semantic gap (i. e. the gap between the low-level content-based description of images and their semantic interpretation). Although we are highly motivated by the availability of rich knowledge on the Web and the relative success achieved by commercial search engines in indexing images using surrounding text-based information in webpages, we are aware that the unpredictable quality of the surrounding text is a major limiting factor. In order to improve its quality, we describe a multifaceted semantic concept-based indexing model which analyzes the semantics of image {{contextual information}} and classifies it into five broad semantic concept classes (or facets) of signal, object, abstract, scene, and relational. This faceted indexing model relates to the usersâ€™ levels of image descriptions and meets user needs for specific/compound queries. We first highlight contextual information which is relevant for the semantic characterization of Web images and study its statistical properties in terms of its location and semantic nature. A user study is conducted to validate the results. The results suggest that there are several locations that consistently contain relevant textual information with respect to the image. The importance of each location is influenced by the type of webpage as the results show the different distribution of relevant contextual information across the locations for different webpage types. The frequently found semantic concept classes are object and abstract. Another important outcome of the user study shows that a webpage is not an atomic unit and can be further partitioned into smaller segments. Segments containing images are of interest and termed as image segments. The study shows that users typically single out textual information which they consider relevant to the image from the textual information bounded within the image segment. Hence, the second contribution is a DOM Tree-based webpage segmentation algorithm to automatically partition webpages into image segments. Its effectiveness is validated using a number of datasets including our resultant human-labeled dataset from the user study and experiments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves better results compared to other existing web image context extractors. The final contribution is a fully automatic <b>facet</b> <b>classification</b> algorithm for our proposed multifaceted semantic concept-based image indexing framework. The classification is performed on image contextual information extracted from any general webpage. Natural language processing techniques are used to break the contextual information into a set of disambiguated indexing terms (i. e. word or non-compositional phrase) and discover the syntactical relations between the terms. Then, a knowledge base is used to classify each term to the corresponding facet(s), thus, giving us the single-facet concepts. The single-facet concepts with identified relationships form the multifaceted concepts. Encouraging results in terms of precision and recall are reported, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed faceted indexing method over baseline methods...|$|E
40|$|Ontology {{has been}} a subject of many studies carried out in {{artificial}} intelligence (AI) and information system communities. Ontology has become {{an important component of}} the semantic web, covering a variety of knowledge domains. Although building domain ontologies still remains a big challenge with regard to its designing and implementation, there are still many areas that need to create ontologies. Information Science (IS) is one of these areas that need a unified ontology model to facilitate information access among the heterogeneous data resources and share a common understanding of the domain knowledge. The objective of this study is to develop a generic model of ontology that serves as a foundation of knowledge modelling for applications and aggregation with other ontologies to facilitate information exchanging between different systems. This model will be a metadata for a knowledge base system to be used in different purposes of interest, such as education applications to support educational needs for teachers and students and information system developers, and enhancing the index tool in libraries to facilitate access to information collections. This thesis describes the process of modelling the domain knowledge of Information Science IS. The building process of the ontology of Information Science (OIS) is preceded by developing taxonomies and thesauruses of IS. This research adopts the Methontology to develop ontology of Information Science OIS. This choice of method relies on the research motivations and aims, with analysis of some development ontology methodologies and IEEE 1074 - 2006 standards for developing software project life cycle processes as criteria. The methodology mainly consisted of; specification, conceptualization, formalization, implementation, maintenance and evaluation. The knowledge model was formalized using ProtÃ©gÃ© to generate the ontology code. During the development process the model has been designed and evaluated. This research presents the following contributions to the present state of the art on ontology construction; - The main achievement of the study is in constructing a new model of Information Science ontology OIS. The OIS ontology is a generic model that contains only the key objects and associated attributes with relationships. The model has defined 706 concepts which will be widely used in Information Science applications. It provides the standard definitions for domain terms used in annotation databases for the domain terms, and avoids the consistency problems caused by various ontologies which will have the potential of development by different groups and institutions in the IS domain area. - It provides a framework for analyzing the IS knowledge to obtain a classification based on <b>facet</b> <b>classification.</b> The ontology modelling approach is based on topdown and bottomâ€“up. The top-down begins with an abstract of the domain view. While the bottom-up method starts with description of the domain to gain a hierarchal taxonomy. - Designing Ontocop system a novel method presented to support the developing process as specific virtual community of IS. The Ontocop consists of a number of experts in the subject area around the world. Their feedback and assessment improve the ontology development during the creating process. The findings of the research revealed that overall feedback from the IS community has been positive and that the model met the ontology quality criteria. It was appropriate to provide consistency and clear understanding of the subject area. OIS ontology unifies information science, which is composed of library science, computer science and archival science, by creating the theoretical base useful for further practical systems. Developing ontology of information science (OIS) is not an easy task, due to the complex nature of the field. It needs to be integrated with other ontologies such as social science, cognitive science, philosophy, law management and mathematics, to provide a basic knowledge for the semantic web and also to leverage information retrieval...|$|E
