50|$|A {{stone and}} muller is a {{hand-operated}} tool used for mixing and <b>grinding</b> <b>paint.</b> The stone and muller was popular with artists and tradesmen {{from the late}} 18th through the 19th century. A stone and muller differs from {{a mortar and pestle}} in that the former consists of two flat stone surfaces which are rubbed together to create a paste, whereas the latter consists of a bowl and stick.|$|R

25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} pigments such as ochres {{and iron}} oxides {{have been used}} as colorants since prehistoric times. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence that early humans used paint for aesthetic purposes such as body decoration. Pigments and <b>paint</b> <b>grinding</b> equipment believed to be between 350,000 and 400,000 years old have been reported in a cave at Twin Rivers, near Lusaka, Zambia.|$|R
50|$|From 1959 through 1964, Golub and {{his wife}} Nancy Spero opted to live in Europe, a move occasioned {{in part by the}} belief that Europe would be more {{receptive}} to their work dealing overtly with issues of power, sexual and political. During this period Golub's work increased in size because of larger available studio space and the inspiration of the French tradition of large-scale history painting. He also switched from using lacquer to acrylics, left more of the surface unpainted, and began to <b>grind</b> the <b>paint</b> directly into the canvas. While in Italy, both Golub and Spero were profoundly influenced by the figurative works of Etruscan and Roman art, whose narratives addressed ancient themes of power and violence.|$|R
50|$|In {{accordance}} with DIN directions, the hardness of Helko edges is between 47-56 HRC (Rockwell) up to 30 millimeters from the cutting edge, while {{the eye is}} generally left unhardened to prevent cracks in the steel. During the manufacturing process, the axe heads are hardened and cooled down in an oil bath prior to being heated to around 400° Celsius. This relieves strain {{on the surface of}} the steel after hardening, and provides the correct level of hardness. Unlike many axes which are cooled in a water bath, Helko tools are cooled in lukewarm oil to avoid small chinks in the material. Afterwards, the tools are sandblasted to remove oil residue from the surface prior to <b>grinding</b> and <b>painting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Various {{surfaces}} can {{be cleaned}} using this process. The oxy-flame {{can work on}} assorted surface qualities and {{remove some of the}} hardest to clean substances such as lubricants and grease. Ceramics, steel constructions, offshore systems and even concrete elements can all be cleaned. Although the function of cleaning can be thoroughly accomplished, the general aesthetic look is damaged due to the burn marks by the oxy-flame. The surface is then ready for further processing such as <b>painting,</b> <b>grinding</b> or any other further operation.|$|R

50|$|Grinding is {{damaging}} to materials {{which are not}} hardened for the specific purpose of the sport, as {{may be found in}} a skate park. The trucks are composed of a hard metal without lubricant or bearings on the grinding surface, so they literally do grind on the objects they slide across. <b>Grinding</b> can strip <b>paint</b> off of steel and wear down the edges of concrete, stone, aluminum, and wood building materials. Affected business owners and government buildings have put up anti-skate devices as a deterrent to grinding. Grinding in public places may be seen as a form of vandalism and may cause skateboarding to be banned by business owners and city ordinances.|$|R

40|$|Antifouling paints {{are a big}} {{enemy to}} the marine ecosystem.  Many tons of copper,  zinc  and  other  harmful  substances  are  released  into  the  environment each year, in Sweden alone.   This study {{concentrates}} on the mechanical antifouling method, using boat washes instead, which is a more sustainable alternative. It comes with reduced fuel consumption, increased speed, and moreover, no need for <b>grinding</b> and <b>painting</b> the hull each year.   As long as paint residues remain on hulls, but the boat washes are used instead of new paint, it is desired to collect what is scraped of the hulls. By collecting paint flakes and particles accumulated in organic material, the environmental impact is reduced further.  The scope of this Master’s thesis is to design a collection device for the portable boat wash Miniwash.   A collection device with a cleaning system was developed using the pump effect from the brushes along with an extra pump to press the contaminated water through a bag filter taking most of the particles. One can expect as much as 70 % of   the   harmful   particles   can   be   taken   care   of,   according   to   the   filter manufacturer, based on given conditions and filter bag pore sizes. By always having a  flow of 8  cubic meters per hour through the cleaning system, it  is assumed  that  not  much  of  the  cleaning  water  will  escape,  not  passing  through The bag filter...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{multidisciplinary}} investigation of pigments and artefacts with traces of colour from the Early- Middle Holocene site of Takarkori, {{located in the}} Tadrart Acacus Mountains (central Sahara, SW Libya). Here, geological, archaeological, taphonomic and chemical studies (Raman, Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray powder diffraction, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) are used to examine a vast range of artefacts (raw materials, <b>grinding</b> stones, <b>painted</b> items, as well as lithic, bone, wooden and ceramic tools) equally distributed from Late Acacus contexts related to hunter-gatherers (ca. 8900 – 7400 uncal years bp) to pastoral groups (ca. 7400 – 4500 uncal years bp). The exploited minerals (goethite, hematite, kaolinite and jarosite, among others) are locally procured and processed using quartzarenite grinding stones of different shapes and sizes. Thermal treatment of the minerals is also suggested by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Raman studies. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses show {{the addition of a}} lipid binder to small lumps of pigments in order to obtain a sticky product. Their fatty acid distribution differs from the residues on grinding stones, pointing to a specific use of these lumps. The grinding stones have also been used to crush and pulverize the pigments and as base for colour preparation. A sample of colour from a fallen painted slab referable to late pastoral phases shows the presence of a binder, chemically identified as casein. Taken together, the evidence collected at Takarkori conveys to suggest an articulated chaîne opératoire, not only directed towards the preparation of pigments for the parietal rock art but also to other non-utilitarian functions, such as body care and ornamentation and decoration of artefacts...|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} two campuses. The main campus, in Sandy Springs, {{consists}} of four buildings on seven acres. The other campus is the Landschool, an 86-acre retreat located near Summerville. The landschool is used as an outdoor classroom and nature lab for Springmont students, who begin visiting it on overnight trips during elementary. On overnight adventures, students participate in team-building and group development activities, while also learning about {{the natural history of}} plant and animal life in the region. The facility is situated {{in the foothills of the}} Appalachian Trail, where students are immersed in experiential learning opportunities. A naturalist provides lessons in edible plants and finding a water source and safe habitat while exploring nature. Students make their own rope from bark, learn to start a fire from flint in the fire pit and <b>grind</b> ochre for <b>painting.</b> These excursions offer students connections to the natural world and to themselves. These outings also offer time for critical analysis, decision making and opportunities for intellectual, creative, social and physical engagement beyond the classroom.|$|R
