50|$|Certain {{types of}} fabrics {{need to be}} re-treated to {{maintain}} water-repellency, as fluoropolymers decompose over time when exposed to water and chemicals. Washing the garment with harsh detergents usually accelerates DWR loss; in addition, soaps often leave a residue which attracts water and dirt. On the other hand, rain water or salt water affects DWRs less significantly. Affected garments can be treated with a 'spray-on' or 'wash-in' treatment to improve water-repellency. In some cases heat treatment can reactivate the <b>factory</b> <b>applied</b> repellent <b>finish</b> and aid in the repelling of water, and other liquids such as oils. On the other hand, some DWR products do not require heat treatment to be activated, and sometimes DWR treatments can be revitalized simply by washing the fabric with a suitable cleaner.|$|R

5000|$|... 1938 - November 1939: The first {{production}} {{batches of}} Spitfires (K9787-K9814) were built with 37.8 in roundels on the fuselage sides-these were centred 39 inches aft {{of the rear}} edge of the cockpit door. 56 in type A1s were on the upper wings. From K9815, the fuselage roundels were moved back, to be centred 53 in aft of the cockpit door and 6 in above the main longeron, and reduced in diameter to 35 type A1. This position for the fuselage roundel was subsequently standard on all Supermarine and Westland built Spitfires and Seafires. The first 180 or so built (K9787-K9960) also had <b>factory</b> <b>applied</b> 50 in type A roundels under the wings. After K9960, there were no <b>factory</b> <b>applied</b> under-wing roundels until December 1940.

This phenomenon occurs because of the high electrical resistivity of these film backings. [...] Protective electric current from the {{cathodic protection}} system is blocked or shielded from reaching the underlying metal by the highly resistive film backing.

Software factories are generally involved with outsourced software creation. Outsourcing and externalization of maintenance services has become a common practice in financial companies for years.

50|$|The o-ring {{chain is}} named for the rubber o-rings built into {{the space between the}} outside link plate and the inside roller link plates. Chain {{manufacturers}} began to include this feature in 1971 after the application was invented by Joseph Montano while working for Whitney Chain of Hartford, Connecticut. O-rings were included as a way to improve lubrication to the links of power transmission chains, a service that is vitally important to extending their working life. These rubber fixtures form a barrier that holds <b>factory</b> <b>applied</b> lubricating grease inside the pin and bushing wear areas. Further, the rubber o-rings prevent dirt and other contaminants from entering the chain linkages, where such particles would otherwise cause significant wear.|$|R

[...] In 1793, briefly, it was owned by a banker called Jean-Baptiste Vandenyver, but he was guillotined a few months later. [...] Control of the island was then disputed, in the broader context of the redrawing of the Paris city limits, between the three municipalities/districts of Sèvres, Issy and Auteuil. In 1794 the island was acquired by the entrepreneurial chemist, Armand Seguin, from whom it takes its name.
