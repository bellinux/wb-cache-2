40|$|Abstract In most {{problem-solving}} activities, {{feedback is}} received {{at the end}} of an action sequence. This creates a credit-assignment problem where the learner must associate the feedback with earlier actions, and the interdependencies of actions require the learner to remember past choices of actions. In two studies, we investigated the nature of explicit and implicit learning processes in the credit-assignment problem using a probabilistic sequential choice task with and without a secondary memory task. We found that when explicit learning was dominant, learning was <b>faster</b> to <b>select</b> the better option in their Wrst choices than in the last choices. When implicit reinforcement learning was dominant, learning was <b>faster</b> to <b>select</b> the better option in their last choices than in their Wrst choices. Consistent with the probabilitylearning and sequence-learning literature, the results show that credit assignment involves two processes: an explicit memory encoding process that requires memory rehearsals and an implicit reinforcement-learning process that propagates credits backwards to previous choices...|$|R

This paper presents a modular multi-hypothesis based map-matching (MHMM) approach providing track-selective localization of the train by fusing the data of a GNSS-receiver with several trainborne positioning sensor data. While previous research mostly focuses on inertial measurement unit (IMU) gyro observations for correctly determining the vehicle’s direction of travel after passing a switch, this contribution analyzes an alternative positioning routine which is based only on the evaluation of additional GNSS measurement data. Considering the GNSS course observation as well as the direction-dependent standard deviation of the GNSS position data, field tests have shown that the MHMM algorithm modified in that way ensures precise and reliable localization of the train in form of <b>fast</b> <b>selecting</b> the correct track after having passed a switch facing...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Subclinical {{hypothyroidism}} (SH) has a prevalence between 4 % and 10. 5 % {{in various}} studies. The burden of SH in India {{is expected to}} increase with increasing iodine sufficiency. Studies have shown conflicting results concerning not only the degree of lipid changes in SH but also the effect of thyroxine substitution therapy. Indian studies on dyslipidemia in SH and the effect of thyroxine on lipid profile are currently lacking. Aims and Objectives: (1) To assess the association of SH and lipid profile. (2) To quantify the effect of thyroxine treatment on lipid profile. Materials and Methods: About 54 patients who were detected to have SH were compared with 56 healthy controls. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T 3, free T 4, anti thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, serum triglycerides were measured in all the patients after an overnight <b>fast.</b> <b>Selected</b> patients were started on thyroxine replacement. Twenty-one patients were followed up after 3 months with a repeat lipid profile. Results: Mean total cholesterol and mean LDL levels were significantly higher in SH compared to controls, but there was no statistically significant difference in the mean HDL, VLDL, and triglyceride levels. There was a significant reduction in mean T. cholesterol, mean LDL, mean VLDL, and mean triglyceride levels after treatment with thyroxine, while {{there was no significant difference}} among the mean HDL levels. Conclusion: Dyslipidemia is more common in SH compared to controls. There is a TSH dependent increase in cholesterol, LDL, VLDL, and triglyceride levels.

40|$|The beam {{switching}} cylindrical array, {{which is a}} unique system, has been designed and developed to cover 3600 in azimuth plane by generating 16 beams with specified elevation coverage. In this design, the concept of fast aperture selection (4 x 4) in microseconds from the total cylindrical array has been realised successfully to meet the requirement of point-to-multipoint communication. The components of the array, viz., radiating elements, powder dividers, switches, etc., are designed in printed circuit type, and hence, objectives of lightweight and ease of reproducibility are achieved. The lightweight of the array makes it accessible for easy mounting at a specified height for achieving longer communication range. Finally, a low-Ioss radome is incorporated to protect the array from environmental conditions. The various paramete"rs, viz., return loss, gain, and switched-beam radiation patterns were measured over a bandwidth of 300 MHz in L- band and typical measured results are presented in this paper. (ii) beam scanning is nearly continuous by using the phase shifters, which makes the antenna system complex arid costlier 3. As the requirement of scanning is to generate a fixed beam in azimuth and also narrow beam in elevation planes, the cylin'drical array with 64 elements arranged in 4 rows and 16 columns (4 x 16) is considered, which provides moderate gain. A software for uniform distribution was developed to stud) ṫhe effect of interelement spacing of cylindrical array, which reveals similar results 4.

40|$|Abstract. In spectrometric problems, {{objects are}} {{characterized}} by highresolution spectra that correspond to hundreds to thousands of variables. In this context, even fast variable selection methods lead to high computational load. However, spectra are generally smooth and can therefore be accurately approximated by splines. In this paper, we propose to use a B-spline expansion as a pre-processing step before variable selection, in which original variables are replaced by coefficients of the B-spline expansions. Using a simple leave-one-out procedure, the optimal number of B-spline coefficients can be found efficiently. As there is generally {{an order of magnitude}} less coefficients than original spectral variables, selecting optimal coefficients is <b>faster</b> than <b>selecting</b> variables. Moreover, a B-spline coefficient depends only on a limited range of original variables: this preserves interpretability of the selected variables. We demonstrate the interest of the proposed method on real-world data. ...|$|R
