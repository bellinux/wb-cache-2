25|$|Batman is a 1960s American {{live action}} {{television}} series, {{based on the}} DC comic book character of the same name. It stars Adam West as Batman and Burt Ward as Robin – two crime-fighting heroes who defend Gotham City {{from a variety of}} arch villains. It is known for its camp style, upbeat theme music, and its intentionally humorous, simplistic morality (aimed at its largely teenage audience). This included championing the importance of using seat belts, <b>doing</b> <b>homework,</b> eating vegetables, and drinking milk. It was described by executive producer William Dozier as the only situation comedy on the air without a laugh track. 120 episodes aired on the ABC network for three seasons from January 12, 1966, to March 14, 1968, twice weekly for the first two and weekly for the third. In 2016, television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked Batman as the 82nd greatest American television show of all time.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} a highly evaluable {{attribute}} is the SAT score. It is widely known in the United States that an SAT score below 800 is very bad while an SAT score above 1500 is exceptionally good.

Compare the SAT score to a poorly evaluable attribute, such {{as the number of}} hours spent <b>doing</b> <b>homework.</b> Most employers would not know what 10,000 hours spent <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> means because they have no idea of the distribution of scores of potential workers in the population on this attribute.|$|E

This is unlike people from older generations who understand, and openly admit, that they are not very good at multitasking, who see multitasking as difficult, and who therefore don't multitask nearly as much as young people.|$|E

50|$|Both {{the quality}} and {{quantity}} of thought records completed during therapy have been found to be predictive of treatment outcomes for patients with depression and/or an anxiety disorder. Furthermore, Rees, McEvoy, & Nathan (2005) found that accuracy ratings of patients' thought records mid-treatment was positively correlated with post-treatment outcomes, and that <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> in CBT was overall preferable to not <b>doing</b> <b>homework</b> in CBT. Completing thought records accurately may also be indicative of overall skill gain in treatment; Neimeyer and Feixas (1990) found that patients with depression who completed thought records accurately were less likely to relapse six months after treatment termination. The researchers hypothesized that this was because the patients who completed thought records accurately had acquired the skills taught in CBT, and that these skills served as valuable coping strategies when the patients were faced with future stressors and needed to act as their own therapists.|$|E
