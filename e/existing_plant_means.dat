40|$|Stress tests {{performed}} in Europe after accident at Fukushima Daiichi also required {{evaluation of the}} consequences of loss of safety functions due to station blackout (SBO). Long-term SBO in a pressurized water reactor (PWR) leads to severe accident sequences, assuming that <b>existing</b> <b>plant</b> <b>means</b> (systems, equipment, and procedures) are used for accident mitigation. Therefore the main objective was to study the accident management strategies for SBO scenarios (with different reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) leaks assumed) to delay the time before core uncovers and significantly heats up. The most important strategies assumed were primary side depressurization and additional makeup water to reactor coolant system (RCS). For simulations of long term SBO scenarios, including early stages of severe accident sequences, the best estimate RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 3 and the verified input model of Krško two-loop PWR were used. The results suggest that for the expected magnitude of RCPs seal leak, the core uncovery during the first seven days could be prevented by using the turbine-driven auxiliary feedwater pump and manually depressurizing the RCS through the secondary side. For larger RCPs seal leaks, in general this is not the case. Nevertheless, the core uncovery can be significantly delayed by increasing RCS depressurization...|$|E

Upgrades to <b>existing</b> wastewater treatment <b>plants</b> <b>mean</b> new reclaimed water resources {{will be available in}} the future. To evaluate the impact of current and potential future uses, a spreadsheet-based model was developed to predict water quantity and quality at several key locations within the basin. The model consists of a flow component and a water quality component. The model was used to screen various water-use scenarios and to formulate feasible alternatives including the sequencing of future water demands...|$|R
40|$|Following a {{successful}} first edition published in 2007, the follow-up 2011 edition of Wastewater Sludge - A Global Overview of the Current Status and Future Prospects will present an updated and expanded perspective on developments {{in relation to}} wastewater sludge around the world. Sludge arising from wastewater treatment represents a serious environmental issue, requiring technological and management solutions to ensure it is processed in a safe and economically efficient manner. Extension of sewers, {{the construction of new}} wastewater treatment facilities and the upgrading of <b>existing</b> wastewater <b>plants</b> <b>means</b> the amount of sludge to be handled continues to increase. Alongside this, aspects relating to energy consumption and sustainable operation need to be considered. Within this general picture, sludge is generated in different technical, economic and social contexts around the world, demanding that different approaches need to be taken. The 2011 edition of this report provides a strategic overview of the wastewater sludge market around the world, based on regional and country contributions. These look at the current situation in terms of sludge generation, legislation, technology applied and management management approaches. These will then look at anticipated developments over the short / medium term, including expected developments in terms of legislation and the technology and management solutions to be implemented. These will be complemented by longer term perspectives also. The report has been prepared for the Market Briefing Series of the International Water Association&# 039;s magazine Water 21, with input from IWA&# 039;s network of wastewater sludge experts around the world. Contributions in the 2011 edition are due to include Western Europe, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, Eastern Europe, Turkey, USA, Canada, Latin America / Caribbean, Colombia, Brazil, East Asia, Korea, Malaysia, South Asia, China, Africa, and Australasia...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{doubts about}} the {{technical}} and economic viability of retrofit to <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> can be identified {{there have also been}} suggestions that CO 2 capture retrofits at appropriate sites could be economically attractive. The potential to extend the life of <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> with paid-off capital could be beneficial and some project developers are exploring retrofit opportunities for CO 2 capture demonstration. This paper (and the accompanying study commissioned by IEAGHG) shows that there is a sound theoretical basis for CCS retrofits to <b>existing</b> power <b>plants</b> to be considered as a complement, and in some cases as an alternative, to new build power plants with CCS. A key recommendation resulting from the technical and economic analysis undertaken is that a general rejection of retrofitting on grounds such as the age or lower efficiency of <b>existing</b> <b>plants</b> is not justified. Instead CCS retrofits need to be assessed on a site-specific basis, which is feasible since only {{a relatively small number of}} plants (order 100 ’s) need to be retrofitted in order to have a significant impact on global CO 2 emissions. Initial site-by-site retrofit potential studies using aerial photographs that have already been undertaken in several countries could be complemented by additional, more detailed, engineering studies and extended as ongoing national reference databases...|$|R
