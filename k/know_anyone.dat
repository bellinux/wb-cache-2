5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E

25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch {{was talking about how}} much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going to}} neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> in boxing who won't miss him. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> in boxing that can take his place.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} Mortal Peril {{is situated}} where the numeral 12 would normally be. Throughout {{the first five}} books the hands change to reflect the varying statuses of the family members, but by the sixth book all nine hands point to mortal peril at all times, except when someone is travelling. Mrs. Weasley takes this to mean that with Voldemort's return, everyone is always in mortal peril, but she cannot verify this as she does not <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> else who has a clock like hers.|$|E

All farm land colonization companies have disbanded because {{there is no longer a}} chance for steady long time employment. Because of present-day conditions, I would not take to organize a colonizing company, nor do I <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> who could afford to do so except the large landowner who wishes to sell and colonize his own property exclusively.|$|E

500|$|Bound {{was shot}} in thirty-eight days in Santa Monica, California. The Wachowskis' {{original}} director of photography resigned {{on the grounds that}} he could not do the film with the limited budget he had available, nor did he <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> he believed could. Subsequently, cinematographer Bill Pope was hired, who knew [...] "a bunch of cheap guys". Pope became heavily involved in creating the visual noir style of the film. He and the Wachowskis drew from their love of comics and were influenced by Frank Miller's neo-noir Sin City series in particular. Pope's sound counterpart was sound director Dane Davis. One of his ideas was to give Corky a cat-like quality by making a [...] "swishing" [...] sound every time she walks past the camera in the scene where she and Violet plan the theft.|$|E
500|$|John Metcalf for The Spectator {{thought the}} book [...] "utterly disgraceful—and highly enjoyable... without [...] no {{forthcoming}} railway journey should be undertaken", although he also considered {{that it was}} [...] "not one of Mr. Fleming's best". Anthony Boucher, writing in The New York Times, was equivocal, saying [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> who writes about gambling more vividly than Fleming and I only wish {{the other parts of}} his books lived up to their gambling sequences". Richard Lister in the New Statesman thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming is splendid; he stops at nothing."

500|$|Despite her obligations, Hańska was a {{beautiful}} unmarried woman of means living in Paris. The writer Jules Amédée Barbey d'Aurevilly described her this way: [...] "Her beauty was imposing and noble, somewhat massive, a little fleshy, but even in stoutness she retained a very lively charm which was spiced with a delightful foreign accent and a striking hint of sensuality." [...] As she began sorting through Balzac's papers, she called on his friend, Champfleury, for assistance. As they worked one evening, he complained of a headache. [...] "I'll make it go away," [...] she said, and began massaging his forehead. As he wrote later: [...] "There are certain magnetic effluvia, in such situations, of which the effect is that the matter does not stop there." [...] Her affair with the man twenty years her junior was brief, but it provided a tremendous release to Hańska, who had spent decades with older men {{in various states of}} ill health. She began partaking of the social life around her. [...] "The night before last I laughed as I have never done before," [...] she wrote in 1851. [...] "Oh, how wonderful it is not to <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> or have to worry about anyone, to have one's independence, liberty on the mountain-tops, and to be in Paris!" ...|$|E
500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have {{to stay home and}} mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who were thought to be easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> in New York, who basically does not have a life. I want someone who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{the laws}} against pimping and {{communicating}} provisions {{were determined to}} be constitutional and were retained. As of 2013, {{the constitutionality of the}} law against brothels was still under review. Falle said that brothels should not be legalized, saying, [...] "I know firsthand and... from the disclosures of the many women that I've been able to counsel over the years that most violence happens behind closed doors." [...] Falle said that if brothels were legalized, the police would have less legal ability to find women and children victimized by human trafficking. Bedford said that legalizing brothels would make prostitution safer for women because it would allow prostitution to take place indoors. Falle responded that most prostitution has already moved indoors, as the internet has made most street solicitation unnecessary, and argues that the move indoors has not made the women safer. She said that when she was in prostitution, she was even a little safer outdoors because of the added visibility to the public. In discussion of the case, Falle said, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> in the prostitution business who hasn’t ended up dead, in jail, or on drugs." [...] She intended to bring a pimp stick to the Supreme Court of Canada in June 2013 as a visual aid in explaining how pimps often abuse the women they prostitute.|$|E

In 1996 and 1997, Legg shared the stage with acclaimed guitar experts Joe Satriani, Eric Johnson and Steve Vai {{as part of the}} G3 tour. Vai called Legg [...] "Uncle Adrian" [...] and Satriani said of Legg's musicianship [...] "He's simply the best acoustic guitar player I've ever heard.

2500|$|Guicciardini served three popes over {{a period}} of twenty years, and perhaps because of his experiences, he was highly {{critical}} of the papacy: [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> who dislikes the ambition, the avarice, and the sensuality of priests more than I do.... Nevertheless, the position I have enjoyed with several popes has forced me to love their greatness for my own self-interest. If it weren't for this consideration, I would have loved Martin Luther as much as I love myself—not to be released from the laws taught by the Christian religion as it is normally interpreted and understood, but to see this band of ruffians reduced within their correct bounds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tony Judt {{described}} to The New York Times {{that he believed}} the real purpose of outspoken denunciations of him and others was to stifle their harsh criticism of Israel and its treatment of the Palestinians. [...] "'The link between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism is newly created,' [...] said, adding that he fears 'the two will have become so conflated {{in the minds of}} the world' that references to antisemitism and the Holocaust will come to be seen as 'just a political defense of Israeli policy'." [...] Judt stated that he [...] " [...] <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> in a respectable range of opinion who thinks Israel shouldn't exist"; The New York Times noted that his advocacy for a binational solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict is seen by many Jews [...] as equivalent to dissolving Israel.|$|E

Norquist was quoted as saying [...] "I think some people had given him up for dead, but he was good old Karl, upbeat and enthusiastic."

2500|$|Clinicians {{have responded}} that they are unwilling to {{consider}} the possibility of leaving potential deadly cancers alone because it is [...] "far-riskier" [...] than the alternative. Eric Winer, director of the breast cancer program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>anyone</b> who offers women the option of doing nothing." [...] Further complicating the issue of early diagnosis {{is the fact that it}} is currently impossible to distinguish malicious cancers from benign ones. Otis Brawley, a top official for the American Cancer Society, says that [...] "even if we overdiagnose 1 in 5, we have numerous studies showing that by treating all these women, we save a bunch of lives". For instance, a 2011 Cochrane review showed a sample of mammogram screening programs resulted in a 15% reduction in mortality rate despite over-diagnosis, indicating that mammography programs save lives regardless of over-diagnosis.|$|E
