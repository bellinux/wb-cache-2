5|$|Renaudin, {{seeing the}} hapless {{condition}} of his ship, ordered his flags hoisted half-mast in surrender and distress around 14:00, but after her surrender no British ship {{managed to get}} men aboard to take possession. This left Vengeurs few remaining unwounded crew to attempt to salvage what they could. Ultimately the ship's pumps became unmanageable, and Vengeur began to sink. Only the timely arrival of boats from the undamaged HMS Alfred and Culloden, {{as well as the}} services of the cutter Rattler, saved any of the Vengeur's crew from drowning, these ships taking off nearly 500 sailors between them. Lieutenant John Winne of Rattler was especially commended for this <b>hazardous</b> <b>work.</b> By 18:15, Vengeur was clearly beyond salvage and only the very worst of the wounded and the dead remained aboard, though some possibly stayed aboard in the hope of being rescued by a French ship rather than a British and avoid captivity.|$|E

In a few cases, however, action steps have been included which may have significant cost implications. The most important of these is the proposed extension of the qualifying age for the Child Support Grant by 2006 from 13 years {{to the end of the}} school year the child turns 15 so as to avoid the current contradiction with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act prohibiting child work below that age, as well as the provisions on compulsory schooling. The programme also proposes a further roll out of the child support grant up to the age of 17 by 2008. This will encourage children to remain in school and so help to avoid children's engagement in <b>hazardous</b> <b>works</b> activities and other WFCL.|$|R
25|$|Over time, {{the cowboys}} of the American West {{developed}} a personal culture of their own, {{a blend of}} frontier and Victorian values that even retained vestiges of chivalry. Such <b>hazardous</b> <b>work</b> in isolated conditions also bred a tradition of self-dependence and individualism, with great value put on personal honesty, exemplified in songs and poetry. The cowboy often worked in an all-male environment, particularly on cattle drives, and in the frontier west, men often significantly outnumbered women.|$|E
25|$|Government and {{corporate}} policies deliberately shift immigrants to secondary sector occupations.

Inherently {{those involved in}} these sectors will have lower wages and more periods of unemployment. In several European countries the immigration system is almost fully designed to try to fill these positions. This is less the case in Canada, but significant recruitment programs for sectors such as agriculture and oil and gas recruit many workers to perilous jobs.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{every country}} in the world has laws {{relating}} to and aimed at preventing child labour. International Labour Organisation has helped set international law, which most countries have signed on and ratified. According to ILO minimum age convention (C138) of 1973, child labour refers to any work performed by children under the age of 12, non-light work done by children aged 12–14, and <b>hazardous</b> <b>work</b> done by children aged 15–17. Light work was defined, under this Convention, as any work that does not harm a child's health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school. This convention has been ratified by 135 countries.|$|E
40|$|Safety is a {{relative}} quantity that {{is a function of}} the situation in which it is measured. This research has been conducted in a well established pharmaceutical company in Bangladesh practicing GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice), which has a tablet manufacturing facility. Tablet manufacturing comprises a number of manufacturing activities and machineries. Each of these activities, requiring amalgamated interaction of man, machine, equipment and environment has the potential of producing unforeseen hazards. Therefore, analysis of risk to assure worker safety is not only necessary here, it is also important to use an appropriate tool that can incorporate all the risk- producing parameters. The research work conducted here using a very effective tool named Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), consisted of observing the works at different sections, breaking them down into sequential steps, noting the surrounding variables of each task, and using these data to perform risk analysis to find out the most <b>hazardous</b> <b>works</b> for the workers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Tall {{buildings}} and hazardous utilities require regular {{inspection and maintenance}} {{to comply with the}} ordinance, and to ensure the integrity and safety. The traditional manual inspection and maintenance on tall building normally requires the installation of expensive scaffoldings or gondolas in which human operators need to work in mid-air and life threatening environment. The prospect of climbing robots is popular because they can take the place of humans to carry out hazardous and maintenance job such as cleaning glass surfaces of skyscrapers, fire rescue, and inspection of pipes and wall, cleaning & inspection of high rise buildings, evaluation and diagnosis of a storage tank in nuclear power plants & petrochemical plants, maintenance of ship, aircraft wing inspection with the consideration of operational efficiency, safety and human health. These types of climbing robots are classified in to different groups based on their locomotion and adhesion mechanism. Due to the ability to relieve human beings from these <b>hazardous</b> <b>works,</b> more & more people are interested in developing various service climbing robots in recent years...|$|R

25|$|In 1999, ILO {{helped lead}} the Worst Forms Convention 182 (C182), which {{has so far been}} signed upon and {{domestically}} ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in <b>hazardous</b> <b>work.</b> Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of international labour standards implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.|$|E
25|$|Small-scale artisanal mining of gold {{is another}} source of {{dangerous}} child labour in poor rural areas {{in certain parts of}} the world. This form of mining uses labour-intensive and low-tech methods. It is informal sector of the economy. Human Rights Watch group estimates that about 12 percent of global gold production comes from artisanal mines. In west Africa, in countries such as Mali - the third largest exporter of gold in Africa - between 20,000 and 40,000 children work in artisanal mining. Locally known as orpaillage, children as young as 6 years old work with their families. These children and families suffer chronic exposure to toxic chemicals including mercury, and do <b>hazardous</b> <b>work</b> such as digging shafts and working underground, pulling up, carrying and crushing the ore. The poor work practices harm the long term health of children, as well as release hundreds of tons of mercury every year into local rivers, ground water and lakes. Gold is important to the economy of Mali and Ghana. For Mali, it is the second largest earner of its export revenue. For many poor families with children, it is the primary and sometimes the only source of income.|$|E

500|$|The Gallipoli {{landings}} {{were strongly}} resisted by Ottoman forces, and reinforcements were required. Thus, in early May the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment was advised {{to prepare for}} embarkation for Gallipoli to join the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade. On 12 May 1915, Hastings arrived at Anzac Cove and the following day his regiment occupied Walker's Ridge. From then on, Hastings displayed strong leadership as the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment anchored the brigade's position in defence of the ANZAC perimeter. On 19 May, the Ottomans launched a major offensive that saw 42,000 Ottomans attack the 17,000 ANZACs holding the beachhead. In response, the 6th Squadron prepared {{to take part in}} a counterattack, but this was subsequently called off. After the Canterbury Mounted Rifle Regiment attacked and seized a new outpost (initially called No. 3 Outpost) on 28 May, the 6th Squadron relieved them and began digging defences. The outpost was then handed over to another squadron who came under a sustained attack throughout 29 May and were forced to withdraw on 30 May, while the Wellington Mounted Rifle Regiment continued the battle without rest for 28 hours. The unit history noted that during this time, Hastings [...] "... performed most useful and <b>hazardous</b> <b>work</b> ..." [...] closely reconnoitring the enemy's position and furnishing [...] "... a most accurate report on the situation, which proved of great value". [...] As the outpost was relinquished around midnight on 30 May the Ottomans aggressively followed up the withdrawing troops until Hastings led an advance along the ridge that enabled heavy fire to be brought down on the enemy's position. Hastings' men then launched a [...] "most effective" [...] attack with bayonets that [...] "... broke the Turkish onrush". The ANZACs subsequently established a new outpost closer to the existing line, No. 3 Outpost, with the position now held by the enemy referred to as the Old No. 3 Outpost.|$|E

The code also included the Gunfighter, who sometimes followed a form of code duello adopted from the Old South, in order to solve disputes and duels. Extrajudicial justice seen during the frontier days such as lynching, vigilantism and gunfighting, in turn popularized by the Western genre, would later be known in modern times as examples of frontier justice, as the West became a thing of imagination by the late 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{objective}} of child trafficking is often forced child labour. Child labour refers specifically to children under a stipulated minimum age, usually 14 at the lowest, {{being required to}} work. UNICEF estimates that, in 2011, 150 million children aged 5–14 in developing countries were involved in child labour. Within this number, the International Labour Organization reports that 60% of child workers work in agriculture. The ILO also estimates that 115 million children are engaged in <b>hazardous</b> <b>work,</b> such as the sex or drug trade. [...] Overall, child labor can take many forms, including domestic servitude, work in agriculture, service, and manufacturing industries. Also, according to several researchers, most children are forced into cheap and controllable labor, and work in homes, farms, factories, restaurants, and much more (Beyrer 16; Gozdziak and MacDonnell 171; Vinkovic 88). Trafficked children may be sexually exploited, used {{in the armed forces}} and drug trades, and in child begging. In terms of global trends, the ILO estimates that in 2004–2008, there was a 3% reduction in the incidence of child labor; this stands in contrast to a previous ILO report which found that in 2000–2004, there was a 10% reduction in child labor. The ILO contends that, globally, child labour is slowly declining, except in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of child workers has remained relatively constant: 1 in 4 children aged 5–17 work in this region. Another major global trend concerns the number of child laborers in the 15-17 age group: in the past five years, a 20% {{increase in the number of}} these child workers has been reported. A surprised example has occurred in the United States as McCabe (2008) indicates that in the 1990s, huge companies such as Gap and Nike were using industries “sweatshops” that use trafficked children to make their desired products (p.81).|$|E

40|$|The {{activities}} {{associated to}} underwater diving are {{of great importance}} in many areas. In {{the second half of}} the last century, diving technologies have greatly progressed, but diving is still characterized by significant risks, especially for professional divers who works at high depth, and limited practicability. The use of robotic systems and automatic procedures would allow, as in other situations where safety is of concern (for example, in case of <b>hazardous</b> <b>works</b> or in relation to hostile environments), a reliable monitoring and assessment of the physiological conditions of human operators during their activities. Moving from currently available technologies in underwater robotics, the ROAD (Robotics for Assisted Diving) project aims to develop an intelligent robotic system which is able to supervise in a semi-automatic way the activities performed by teams of divers. Such system will operate by monitoring a set of physiological and behavioral parameters. The collected data will be processed on-line in order to evaluate the current status and to reconstruct the evolution of the psychophysical conditions of the divers during their undertakings. The project has been founded Italian PRIN (National program of Research interest) involves two groups of experts with competence, respectively, in the physiology of diving and in the robotic technologies.
