5|$|Kijak {{revealed}} that upon thinking of Lynch's use of doppelgängers he {{was reminded of}} an interview where Yoshiki said he has two personalities, his public persona and a man wounded by the tragedies in his life. He made this the subtext of the film to have something deeper than the average rockumentary. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>one</b> of the hardest aspects was editorial, trying to balance all the characters, albums and drama with Yoshiki's life and work.|$|E
5|$|Case No. 5 were {{light bulbs}} that {{represented}} {{the state of}} the art of filament lamps from 1900 to 1913. They show electric lights using certain gases within the sealed bulb. They were directing a path of technology into 'cold light.' One of these was a long tube instead of a globe. It had a stop cock in the center and a glass bulb at each end. Hammer explained how this one came about. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>one</b> day in 1902 he visited Pierre Curie, the husband of Madam Curie. Professor Curie drew a diagram on the blackboard and suggested that Hammer make a lamp like that with sulfide of zinc inside. Curie explained to Hammer what radium gaseous could do in this configuration. It would stimulate luminescence that would produce light without a hot filament involved.|$|E
5|$|Raghip's {{parents had}} moved from Cyprus to England in 1956. Raghip left school at age 15, illiterate, {{and by the time}} of the murder had two convictions, one for {{stealing}} cars and one for burglary. He had a common-law wife, Sharon Daly, with whom he had a two-year-old boy, and he worked occasionally as a mechanic. He had little connection with Broadwater Farm, though he lived in nearby Wood Green and had gone to the Farm with two friends to watch the riot, <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>One</b> of those friends, John Broomfield, gave an interview to the Daily Mirror on 23 October, boasting about his involvement. When Broomfield was arrested, he implicated Raghip. Broomfield was later convicted of an unrelated murder.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} several {{references to}} The Beatles and McCartney's solo career. For instance, McCartney tells Lisa that playing his 1970 song [...] "Maybe I'm Amazed" [...] backwards will reveal [...] "a {{recipe for a}} really rippin' lentil soup". A {{modified version of the}} song plays in the final scene, then over the closing credits of the episode; when played backwards, McCartney can be heard reciting the recipe in the song. Mirkin had McCartney record the recipe, which was later added in reverse over the original song. McCartney thought it was [...] "very funny" [...] that the staff wanted to [...] "send up the whole cult thing" [...] of backmasking on the Beatles' songs. [...] "A secret lentil soup recipe seemed a nice parody of that", <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>One</b> of the backwards snippets says, [...] "Oh, and by the way, I'm alive", a reference to the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] urban legend.|$|E
500|$|Mark Bingham {{called his}} mother at 09:37:03 from row25. He {{reported}} that the plane had been hijacked by three men {{who claimed to have}} a bomb. Jeremy Glick called his wife at 09:37:41 from row27 and told her the flight was hijacked by three dark-skinned men who looked [...] "Iranian", wearing [...] and wielding knives. Glick remained connected {{until the end of the}} flight. He {{reported that the}} passengers voted whether to [...] "rush" [...] the hijackers. The United air traffic control coordinator for West Coast flights, Alessandro [...] "Sandy" [...] Rogers, alerted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Herndon Command Center in Herndon, Virginia, that Flight93 was not responding and was off course. A minute later, the transponder was turned off, but the Cleveland controller continued to monitor the flight on primary radar. The Herndon Center relayed information on Flight93 to FAA headquarters. Joseph DeLuca called his father at 09:43:03 from row26 to inform him the flight had been hijacked. Todd Beamer attempted to call his wife from row32 at 09:43:48, but was routed to GTE phone operator Lisa D. Jefferson. Beamer told the operator that the flight was hijacked and that two people who he thought were the pilots were on the floor dead or dying. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>one</b> of the hijackers had a red belt with what looked to be a bomb strapped to his waist. When the hijackers veered the plane sharply south, Beamer briefly panicked, exclaiming, [...] "We're going down! We're going down!" [...] Meanwhile, Dahl continued to struggle in the cockpit, refusing to allow a hijacker to engage the autopilot and thereby set its coordinates for their target, Washington, D.C. The hijackers were heard to say [...] "Inform them, and tell him to talk to the pilot; bring the pilot back", possibly referring to Homer (CVR transcripts). A United employee in San Francisco, California, sent an ACARS message to the flight at 09:46, [...] "Heard report of incident. Plz confirm all is normal." [...] Linda Gronlund called her sister, Elsa Strong, at 09:46:05 and left her a message saying there were [...] "men with a bomb." ...|$|E

2500|$|Romney has {{supported}} abstinence-only sex education in public schools. In his {{run for the}} Senate in 1994, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>one</b> of the programs that should be taught in schools was [...] "the importance of getting married before having children." [...] In the May 2007 South Carolina debate, Romney said he has always [...] "fought for abstinence education." ...|$|E
2500|$|Allen Keller, the {{director}} of the Bellevue Hospital/New York University Program for Survivors of Torture, has treated [...] "a number of people" [...] who had been subjected to forms of near-asphyxiation, including waterboarding. In an interview for The New Yorker, he argued that [...] "it was indeed torture. 'Some victims were still traumatized years later', <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>One</b> patient couldn't take showers, and panicked when it rained. 'The fear of being killed is a terrifying experience', he said". Keller also gave a full description in 2007 in testimony before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the practice: ...|$|E

2500|$|He credits {{a number}} of economists for his {{understanding}} of economics. [...] <b>He</b> <b>said,</b> <b>One</b> person {{who has had a}} great impact on me intellectually was my adviser at Harvard, Jeffrey Sachs. For me he’s the model of a great intellectual. He is both a rigorous academic and very human, involved in big picture issues such as poverty, AIDS, and Africa. He’s someone with a great mind that is also very engaged with the world. Another intellectual hero is Larry Summers, the former President of Harvard, an amazing intellectual and academic, who is very deeply involved with the policy world. I worked for him for many years in the US Treasury during the Clinton Administration.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Day You Come" [...] was {{the first}} single off Internationalist to be released, and thus gave an {{impression}} of what the album was set to contain. [...] Lead singer Bernard Fanning said this impression was inaccurate, describing the song as being [...] "not very up-tempo" [...] compared {{to the rest of}} the album. [...] <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>one</b> of the reasons the next single released was [...] "Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray" [...] was that it was the complete opposite; a much more [...] "thrashy" [...] single than [...] "The Day You Come". Guitarist Ian Haug agreed, adding that the band had not intended for [...] "The Day You Come" [...] to be the first single off the album, but was released because the band couldn't decide on any other songs to release.|$|E
2500|$|On September 12, 2002, Barron hosted {{an event}} at New York City Hall honoring Zimbabwean {{president}} Robert Mugabe, whom Barron praised as the liberator of Black Africans in then-Rhodesia. In 2008, he again voiced support for Mugabe, who had allegedly committed crimes and atrocities in Zimbabwe. Specifically, Barron said, [...] "In the year 2000, when <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>one</b> farm, one farmer, he was vilified", arguing that Mugabe was popular internationally only while his government [...] "didn't take {{the land from}} the whites”. He added that in South Africa, whites “still own 80 to 90 percent of the land," [...] which is why international powers support South African leaders such Nelson Mandela. Barron stated he had seen no evidence which tied the Mugabe government to any attacks on supporters of the [...] Zimbabwe opposition.|$|E

2500|$|After Ament's {{death in}} January 1909, Judson Smith's successor, Dr. James Levi Barton (1855–1936) {{wrote in an}} {{obituary}} published in The Congregationalist: The cruel and baseless attack made upon him [...] in this country by Mark Twain, in 1901, left a deep wound in his heart, {{in spite of the}} fact that it was clearly shown that his acts had been above criticism. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>one</b> night, as we were sitting in a Chinese inn upon our way to Shansi, [...] "I presume there are many in the United States who regard me as little better than a thief and a robber." [...] I tried to assure him that no missionary was more honored than he, none more absolutely trusted, as it had been proven that the charges had no foundation in fact. He replied, [...] "That is true, but do the people believe the proof, and will the truth ever catch up with the charge?' ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the War of 1812, Miller raised a company of local men and traveled to Burlington, Vermont. He transferred to the 30th Infantry Regiment in the regular army of the United States with the rank of lieutenant. Miller spent most of the war working as a recruiter and on February 1, 1814, he was promoted to captain. He saw his first action at the Battle of Plattsburgh, where vastly outnumbered American forces overcame the British. [...] "The fort I was in was exposed to every shot. Bombs, rockets, and shrapnel shells fell as thick as hailstones", <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> <b>One</b> of these many shots had exploded two feet from him, wounding three of his men and killing another, but Miller survived without a scratch. Miller came to view the outcome of this battle as miraculous, and therefore at odds with his deistic view of a distant God far removed from human affairs. He later wrote, [...] "It seemed to me that the Supreme Being must have watched over the interests of this country in an especial manner, and delivered us from the hands of our enemies... So surprising a result, against such odds, did seem to me like the work of a mightier power than man." ...|$|E
