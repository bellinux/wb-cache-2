His post was that of Summi (Archi)Episcopi Scotorum, called in the contemporary Scottish vernacular [...] "Ardepscop Alban", that is, [...] "High Bishop of Scotland". He was hence the structural leader of the Scottish church. Along with Bishop John of Glasgow, Robert became the chief reforming cleric in the reforming reign of King David I of Scotland. He {{is one of the}} most frequent witnesses to the charters of King David. Unlike most other incumbents Scottish bishoprics, most of them very new, Robert was a foreigner drawn from the non-Gaelic world, in the words of Oram, [...] "part of 'colonial' establishment which was emerging in the early twelfth century". In this context, the difference between [...] "reform" [...] and religious and cultural [...] "colonialism" [...] is merely one of perspective. However, Robert's episcopate in no way led to the destruction of the native clerical order at Cell Rígmonaid. In fact, many of the native Gaelic clergy were absorbed into the <b>incoming</b> <b>orders,</b> and those who were not, continued to receive the patronage of the bishop. In one case, the clergy of the Céli Dé abbey of St. Serfs at Loch Leven were given a large collection of books by the bishop.|$|E

40|$|Dealers {{learn about}} asset values as they set prices and absorb {{portfolio}} flows. These flows causes inventory imbalances. Previous work argues that dealers deviate from their estimates of asset values to induce flows that unwind inventory imbalances. This study models dealer price-setting using multiple instruments to smooth inventory imbalances and update priors about asset values. This approach shows that canonical models in which price-setting {{is the only}} instrument for inventory control, and <b>incoming</b> <b>order</b> flow is {{the only source of}} asymmetric information, are misspecified. Thus, estimates of canonical models reject predicted asymmetric information and inventory effects because of omitted and extraneous variables. These estimations miss information from sources other than <b>incoming</b> <b>order</b> flow, and they overemphasize price shading in managing inventories. Estimates of the model presented support heretofore elusive inventory and asymmetric information effects. Price shading is found to have smaller role in inventory management and information effects are shown to be stronger than previously estimated...|$|R

50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} the effect of feedback delays is the Beer Distribution Game (or Beer Game). There is a time delay built into the game between placing an order by a role and reception of the ordered cases of beer. If a role runs out of beer (i.e., unable to satisfy a customer’s current demand for beer cases), there is a fine of $1 per case. This might lead people to overstock beer to satisfy any future unanticipated demands. Results, contrary to economic theory which predicts a long term stable equilibrium, show people ordering too much. This happens because the time delay between placing an order and receiving inventory makes people think that the inventory is running out as new orders come in, so they react and place larger orders. Once they build up the inventory and realize the <b>incoming</b> <b>orders</b> they drastically cut future orders which leads the beer industry experience oscillating patterns of over-ordering and under-ordering, that is, costly cycles of boom and bust.|$|E

They believe flash trading is a form of trading in which certain market participants are allowed to see <b>incoming</b> <b>orders</b> to buy or sell securities very slightly earlier than the general market participants in exchange for a fee.

This study models price setting in markets such as foreign exchange, U. S. treasury bonds, European sovereign bonds, and the London Stock Exchange, where market makers have multiple instruments to smooth inventory imbalances and update priors about asset values. Estimating a dealer pricing model with multiple instruments for inventory control and information-gathering yields support for what at times have been elusive inventory and asymmetric information effects. The model presented yields direct {{measures of the}} structural-liquidity cost parameters faced by market makers, akin to Kyle's Lambda. For example, the estimates presented suggest that a $ 10 million incoming purchase pushes price up by roughly one basis point, and dealers expect to immediately lay off one-third of every <b>incoming</b> <b>order.</b> Compared with estimates of price setting in single dealer markets, price shading is {{found to have a}} smaller role in inventory management and information effects are shown to be stronger. Hence, estimating traditional microstructure models (based on only one market maker per asset) on data from asset markets where market makers have multiple instruments misses information from sources other than <b>incoming</b> <b>order</b> flows, and overemphasizes price shading in managing inventories. ...|$|R

The company’s purpose is to produce customized products. The strive for the company should be to optimize the processes and different activities from supplier to customer. One of the necessary activities in the chain from production to customer is inventory and warehouse management {{and it should be}} in the company’s interest to do things right, to have high efficiency and not waste its resources. Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner Piteå, the company which this study has been made at, is one of Europe’s biggest kraftliner mill and producer of kraftliner, a base paper made from fresh fiber. Today the company has many inventories in its supply chain from suppliers to customers; among others at the harbor Haraholmen in Piteå, Sweden. The aim of this study has been to focus on the two warehouses in the harbor. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate current inventory layout and try to make it more efficient by studying the two inventories’ in- and outflow. Further, the manual handling of <b>incoming</b> <b>orders</b> was examined in order to suggest improvements. To fulfill the purpose of the study, interviews and observations were made at the harbor Haraholmen and at Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner Piteå. Also an automatized summary over <b>incoming</b> <b>orders</b> was programmed. Problems were identified from an analysis of the current situation. These problems were factors that contributed to the aim of this study. Some of these problems were the manual creation of a map of the warehouses and the summary of <b>incoming</b> <b>orders,</b> which contribute to inefficiency. As changes in order are incoming continuously, the map of the inventory has to be modified, which causes more work for the employees than necessary. Something else that was discovered was the fact that one of the two warehouses is smaller than the other. As the company today uses one warehouse per week, the risk of lack of space increases in the smaller one. Furthermore, it is important that the products are placed together in the warehouses based on their destination, diameters, and width. This is something that needs to be improved in order to make the loading and storekeeping more efficient. The recommendations, which have been developed during the study, are that Smurfit Kappa Kraftliner Piteå should place the articles more gathered, stack them higher, and use both inventories at the same time. This will eliminate the risk of the smaller inventory’s lack of space. Finally an automatized summary of <b>incoming</b> <b>orders</b> has been programmed to ease and make the employees’ work more effective with the map of the warehouses.
