5000|$|Confucius later said, [...] "From {{the time}} that I got You, bad words no more came to my ears."

40|$|The {{pathogens}} {{found to}} be most frequently linked to food handler transmission have been Norovirus, Salmonella and Hepatitis A virus (HAV). • To constitute a risk, the infected food handler is generally symptomatic – most often with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, food handlers in the pre- or post-symptomatic phases of illness have also been implicated in causing foodborne outbreaks. • The most frequently associated symptoms are vomiting and/or diarrhoea – underscoring the importance of symptom reporting and exclusion from food <b>handling</b> <b>duties</b> while symptomatic. • By far the most common mode of pathogen transmission to food by the infected food handler is via faecally contaminated hands. Poor hand hygiene is the contributing factor. • Other reported modes of transmission include infected skin lesions (usually on hands), naso-pharyngeal secretions (Staph, Strep), aerosolisation of vomitus (Norovirus) and fomites (Norovirus, HAV). • There is overwhelming evidence that food handlers whose work involves touching unwrapped foods to be consumed raw or without further cooking {{or other forms of}} treatment (HIGH-RISK FOOD HANDLERS) are those most commonly implicated in foodborne outbreaks. The unhygienic handling of such foods constitutes a particularly grave risk. • Infected food handlers can potentially infect food in any setting, but have been demonstrably implicated at points of the food chain near to the consume...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Dairy {{farming is}} a {{physically}} demanding occupation, however, {{little is known}} about the physical demands of dairy farming tasks, other than milking. The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of musculoskeletal discomfort experienced by dairy farmers in relation to their work. Methods/Participants: A total of 433 dairy farmers from two Australian states (NSW and Victoria) were invited to participate in a mail-out survey (21 % response rate, N = 90), which covered musculoskeletal discomfort, physical workload, task frequency and muscular recovery time. Results: Farmers perceived that routine tasks performed repetitively caused more musculoskeletal discomfort than heavier tasks performed on a non-routine or seasonal basis. Males were more likely to perform heavier manual <b>handling</b> <b>duties</b> and tasks involving the use of machinery, whereas females performed more routine administration work. Both men and women were exposed to similar physical demands from the performance of a number of commonly reported and strenuous tasks. Reduced income, lack of stafﬁng, deregulation, and insufﬁcient recovery time were key factors identiﬁed by farmers to directly or indirectly limit the reduction of musculoskeletal discomfort at work. Conclusion: Dairy farming is a diversiﬁed occupation that requires physical demands from both male and female workers. Further research is needed to investigate speciﬁc task demands and identify possible risk factors that may contribute to the future development of musculoskeletal disorders...|$|E
