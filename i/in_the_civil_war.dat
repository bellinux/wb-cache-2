5|$|More {{than half}} of the state's households, based on an average family size of four persons, contributed a family member to fight in the war, making the effects of the {{conflict}} widely felt throughout the state. More Hoosiers died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> than in any other conflict. Although twice as many Hoosiers served in World War II, almost twice as many died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War.</b> After the war, veterans programs were initiated to help wounded soldiers with housing, food, and other basic needs. In addition, orphanages and asylums were established to assist women and children.|$|E

5|$|In {{his history}} of Taunton, H. J. Wickenden {{suggests}} that {{over half of the}} town was burned or destroyed during the three sieges, while Diane Purkiss claims that it was as high as two thirds of the town. Several compensation payouts were made to the town and some of its residents, funded by fines against those who had fought for the Royalists, such as Sir William Portman, who had been the Member of Parliament for Taunton at the outbreak of the war and was fined £7,000. Although the Parliamentarians destroyed many of the castles that had featured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War,</b> Taunton Castle was considered a Parliamentarian stronghold, and remained intact. In 1647, only two {{years after the end of}} the sieges, the castle was sold as part of the estate of Taunton Manor. In 1660, shortly after taking the throne, Charles II stripped Taunton of its town charter for its part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War,</b> and had the castle's outer walls removed.|$|E

On September 19, the 3rd Kentucky marched on Lexington to forestall a peace conference scheduled there on September 21 and to arrest the state's junior Senator, John C. Breckinridge. A delay allowed Breckinridge to escape before the arrest was made, and he enlisted in the Confederate Army shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{growing up}} in a slaveholding area, Daniel was an {{abolitionist}} and joined with the majority at the convention in voting to outlaw slavery and disenfranchise those who had fought for the Confederacy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War.</b> In 1866, Daniel argued in court that state laws enforcing racial distinctions were no longer valid after the passage of the recent federal Civil Rights Act. The court ruled in his favor, holding that the law could not treat black and white apprentices differently. Later that year, Daniel ran unsuccessfully for a judgeship on the state equity court.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation.

Tubman did not receive a pension for her service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>War</b> until 1899.

5|$|During {{the closing}} stages of World War I, German-trained Finnish Jäger troops {{played a key}} role in the Finnish Civil War, while the German Baltic Sea Division also intervened late <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>war.</b> Jäger troops were volunteers from German-influenced circles, such as {{university}} students.
