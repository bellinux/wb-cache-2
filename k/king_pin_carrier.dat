50|$|Dual-pivot {{steering}} geometry (also known as virtual pivot) is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the steering {{of a car}} designed to reduce or eliminate scrub radius by moving the pivot point of the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> outboard, {{in order to improve}} steering precision and straight line stability.|$|R
50|$|Longboard {{specific}} {{trucks are}} {{a more recent}} development. A longboard truck has the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees) to the deck, giving {{a greater degree of}} turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.|$|R

50|$|In 1990 Abdul-Shaheed {{was convicted}} of being a drug <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> and sentenced to over 19 years in Federal prison under the 848 statute. The crown he had worn was never found, though federal agents have {{photographs}} of Abdul-Shaheed wearing it. Shortly after Shaheed’s arrest, several Jamaican drug dealers from Brooklyn Jamaican Posse moved into the Atlantic City projects to take over his territory.|$|R
50|$|Meents was {{the first}} person to attempt the monster truck backflip. He landed a perfect backflip at his shop in Paxton, IL, but the rear <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> broke off. Other than that, it was perfect. When he {{attempted}} it in public at the Monster Jam World Finals in 2009, he over-rotated and landed exactly on the tailgate, then rolled over backwards onto the roof.|$|R

The front set of drivers with their low-pressure cylinders {{are linked to the}} rear sets with <b>king</b> <b>pins,</b> the rivetted boiler lies on it with its slide plates (Gleitplatten) Leaf springs at the sides hold the driving gear in a central position. Both driving sets have an inside frame.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{they are}} largely obsolete, kingpin {{suspensions}} {{have the advantage}} of being able to carry much heavier weights, which is why they are still featured on some heavy trucks. Dana produced the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> version of the D60 axle until 1991. (The functionally analogous, similar looking and very robust joint between the chassis and boom on a backhoe is however referred to as a king post.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{front axle}} is rigid type, with forged beam and {{drop in the}} middle. The <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> are with slide bearing bushings. The axles were {{produced}} by Kirkstall. The suspension consists of 2½" [...] wide and 1 200 mm long half-elliptic leaf springs, with additional auxiliary springs on the rear axle, and telescopic hydraulic double-acting shock absorbers. The wheel size is 7.50 - 16".|$|R

2500|$|Front pin first:In this {{variant of}} the game, pins are counted only if the front pin is knocked over first. If the front pin is missed, any pins that are knocked over are not reset. In Devon Summer League, this rule is played frequently. In Bristol, this is {{the form of the}} game played and [...] "all in" [...] {{skittles}} tends to be looked down upon as involving less skill. In Worcestershire this type of game is also known as <b>king</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Murray and {{his brother}} Ray Murray were put out of {{contention}} {{when one of the}} [...] "Grey Ghost"'s stub axle and its <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> broke, but he was able {{to get back on the}} road with a loss of only 70 points thanks to fellow-competitor Robert Whan, who allowed Murray to cannibalize his own car, which had crashed into a tree.He lost 69 further points when he took a wrong turn after Mt Isa, and ended up at the Mary Kathleen uranium fields.|$|R
5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical <b>king</b> <b>pin,</b> {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> angle remains a fundamental design parameter. King pin angle, virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> inclination (KPI), or steering axis inclination, SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. Kingpin inclination is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the straight ahead position is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the kingpin inclination is to set the scrub radius of the steered wheel. This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero. Zero scrub radius is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply dished wheel so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less dished wheel, which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero scrub radius is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero scrub radius isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Drivers {{generally}} found handling on Seddon RUs vague, {{and steering}} imprecise. Geoffrey Hillditch refers to 'a most peculiar feeling' when driving one. Steering bushes, axle thrust pads and <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> were less durable {{than they should}} have been, adding to steering troubles, whilst unbalanced front wheels could cause the steering wheel to wobble. Weight was biased too much toward the rear and this exacerbated handling problems. The polyurethane bushes wore 'alarmingly' and were replaced by traditional (regularly) greased chromium-plated brass units. Springs were not substantial enough.|$|R
50|$|In the Marvel 1602 universe, Wilson Fisk is {{a pirate}} {{captain of the}} HMS Vanessa, known as the <b>King's</b> <b>Pin,</b> who attacks the ship taking Peter Parquarh and Sir Norman Osborne back to England. However, {{although}} his attack injures Osborne, {{he is able to}} take the ship when Peter deflects the cannonballs by using his webbing to throw them back at the Vanessa. Fisk is thrown into the sea when he confronts the captain directly, even rejecting Fisk's 'offer' to explain how he got his name.|$|R
50|$|Today's fifth wheels {{allow the}} {{trailers}} to {{slide into the}} fifth wheel and lock into it, and are a very reliable unit when maintained and serviced properly. The engagement of the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> into the fifth-wheel locking mechanism is {{the only means of}} connection between tractor and trailer; no other device or safety mechanism is used. Couplers and pintle hooks use safety chains {{in the event of a}} trailer separation while going down the road. Trailer-to-trailer connection can also be made by using fifth wheels.|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} the optical properties of mixed valent vanadium oxide nanoscrolls and their metal exchanged derivatives {{in order to}} investigate the charge dynamics in these compounds. In contrast {{to the prediction of}} a metallic state for the metal exchanged derivatives within a rigid band model, we find that the injected charges in Mn$^{ 2 +}$ exchanged vanadium oxide nanoscrolls are pinned. A low-energy electronic excitation associated with the <b>pinned</b> <b>carriers</b> appears in the far infrared and persists at low temperature, suggesting that the nanoscrolls are weak metals in their bulk form, dominated by inhomogeneous charge disproportionation and Madelung energy effects.

50|$|In early 2012, the White House sanctioned {{suspected}} Albanian mafia <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> Naser Kelmendi {{for drug}} trafficking. US President Barack Obama notified Congress {{saying he had}} sanctioned Kelmendi under the Kingpin Act, implemented by the US Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). Kalmendi is suspected of leading {{one of the strongest}} ethnic Albanian criminal families in the Balkans, according to the Treasury Department. He has long been suspected of running a large organization that traffics heroin, cocaine and acetic anhydride, a raw material used in the production of heroin, to Europe through the Balkans.|$|R
50|$|This {{ability to}} {{fine-tune}} ball-jointed suspension allows manufacturers {{to make the}} automobile more stable and easier to steer, compared to the older kingpin style suspension. It may also be quieter and more comfortable, because lateral and fore and aft compliance in the suspension can be introduced in controlled amounts at the control arm inner pivots without compromising {{the integrity of the}} steering axis pivots, which are now ball joints instead of a <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> and trunnions. The smoother ride may also increase tire tread life, since the ball-joint suspension allows better control of suspension geometry and so can provide better tire-to-road contact.|$|R
5000|$|Pala had trade links Tamil Nadu, {{and even}} {{countries}} in the Middle East. A jungle route to Gudalloor in Tamil Nadu, through the dense forests in the High Ranges, {{is believed to have}} brought a significant number of Vellalas and Chettiars during the Middle Ages.

5000|$|One main {{criticism}} of these drug laws were {{that they put}} young minority males and females behind bars for carrying small amounts of drugs on them.
