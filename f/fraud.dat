Theoretical part focuses on characteristics of the system of accounting <b>frauds</b> in Russia from the perspective of government regulations, indicates historical assumptions and current tendencies and presents classification of accounting <b>frauds</b> based on several parameters.

5|$|Alastair Hudson {{has also}} argued that the <b>fraud</b> {{argument}} is significantly flawed. The theory suggests that liability for the property comes about from fraud; in fact, liability comes about {{as soon as the}} trustee accepts the property to hold on trust, and so the <b>fraud</b> theory is not necessary to bind the trustee's hands.|$|E
5|$|Allegations of <b>fraud</b> and {{corruption}} were again raised in 2004 by former chief auditor Jules Muis.

40|$|RFID {{authentication}} protocols {{are susceptible}} to different types of relay attacks such as mafia and distance <b>frauds.</b> A countermeasure against these types of attacks are the well-known distance-bounding protocols. These protocols are usually designed to resist to {{only one of these}} <b>frauds,</b> though, behave poorly when both are considered. In this paper (i) we extend the analysis of mafia and distance <b>frauds</b> in recently released protocols. (ii) We introduce the concept of distance-bounding protocols based on graphs while previous proposals rely on linear registers or binary trees. (iii) We propose an instance of the graph-based protocol that resists to both mafia and distance <b>frauds</b> without sacrificing memory. To the best of our knowledge, this protocol achieves the best trade-off between these two <b>frauds...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{rising tide}} of {{corporate}} scandals and audit failures has shocked the public, {{and the integrity of}} auditors is being increasingly questioned. It is crucial for auditors and regulators to understand the main causes of audit failure and devise preventive measures accordingly. This study analyzes enforcement actions issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission against auditors in respect of fraudulent financial reporting committed by listed companies in China. We find that auditors {{are more likely to be}} sanctioned by the regulators for failing to detect and report material misstatement <b>frauds</b> rather than disclosure <b>frauds.</b> Further analysis of the material misstatements indicates that auditors are more likely to be sanctioned for failing to detect and report revenue-related <b>frauds</b> rather than assets-related <b>frauds.</b> In sum, our results suggest that regulators believe auditors have the responsibility to detect and report <b>frauds</b> that are egregious, transaction-based, and related to accounting earnings. The results contribute to our knowledge of auditors' responsibilities for detecting <b>frauds</b> as perceived by regulators. © Springer 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

5|$|In January 2000, Baird {{unveiled}} {{a series of}} initiatives designed to reduce <b>fraud</b> and misuse in the welfare system. This was highlighted by {{the establishment of a}} welfare <b>fraud</b> hotline and a complementary conditionality three months later, in which anyone convicted of welfare <b>fraud</b> would run the risk of being given a lifetime ban from the program. The investigations Baird initiated during the fiscal year of 2000 uncovered $58.2 million in social assistance that people were not entitled to receive, and $16.6 million in avoided future costs, but critics of this approach, including opposition members, poverty advocates, and scholars, suggested that the Harris government was overstating the extent of <b>fraud</b> in order to undermine public confidence in welfare programs. In mid-year, Baird announced that workfare placements had reached departmental quotas for most of the province.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance <b>fraud</b> statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance <b>fraud</b> claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the <b>fraud.</b> Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|Lay and Skilling went {{on trial}} for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank <b>fraud,</b> making false statements to banks and auditors, securities <b>fraud,</b> wire <b>fraud,</b> money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities <b>fraud</b> and wire <b>fraud</b> and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Contactless {{technologies}} such as RFID, NFC, and sensor net-works are vulnerable to mafia and distance <b>frauds.</b> Both <b>frauds</b> aim at passing an authentication protocol by cheating on the actual distance be-tween the prover and the verifier. To cope these security issues, distance-bounding protocols have been designed. However, none of the current proposals simultaneously resists to these two <b>frauds</b> without requiring additional memory and computation. The situation is even worse con-sidering that just a few distance-bounding protocols are {{able to deal with}} the inherent background noise on the communication channels. This ar-ticle introduces a noise-resilient distance-bounding protocol that resists to both mafia and distance <b>frauds.</b> The security of the protocol is ana-lyzed with respect to these two <b>frauds</b> in both scenarios, namely noisy and noiseless channels. Analytical expressions for the adversary’s suc-cess probabilities are provided, and are illustrated by experimental re-sults. The analysis, performed in an already existing framework for fair-ness reasons, demonstrates the undeniable advantage of the introduced lightweight design over the previous proposals...|$|R

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis I {{outline the}} topical issue of insurance <b>frauds.</b> The first part provides {{the definition of}} these <b>frauds,</b> what are their causes, consequences and in which insurance sector they occur the most.

I list the possibilities of distributing insurance <b>frauds</b> according to different points of view. I also analyze possible ways to prevent and combat this issue.

My work ends with an interview with Mr. John Mergel from Colonnade Insurance, who gave me more information about this issue and explained how these <b>frauds</b> are solved in real life.
