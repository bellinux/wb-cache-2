50|$|The <b>ear</b> <b>clamp</b> is used {{wherever}} exist {{problems with}} normal tweezers or fine instruments to grasp small objects. It opens {{only a small}} part of the mouth. So you can even grasp objects in small tubes and position them precisely. Ideal during soldering, when it is difficult to position accurately small components. In veterinary medicine the Hartmann, Ear Polypus Forcep is used to remove awns or epilate hairs of dogs ears. The design reduces the natural tremor (shaking).|$|E
50|$|A {{stepless}} type of <b>ear</b> <b>clamp</b> {{was invented}} by Hans Oetiker in Horgen, Switzerland, which eliminates steps or gaps on the inner circumference of the clamp. This is said to provide uniform compression and a 360° seal.Such stepless clamps are claimed to be well suited to applications involving thin-walled hoses, supposedly with higher retained loads. This suggests they should be considered for difficult to seal applications such as molded plastics or other less malleable materials, commonly used in the automotive industry.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ear</b> <b>Clamps</b> {{consist of}} a band (usually {{stainless}} steel) into which one or more “ears” or closing elements have been formed. The clamp is placed over {{the end of the}} hose or tube to be connected and when each ear is closed {{at the base of the}} ear with a special pincer tool, it permanently deforms, pulling the band, and causing the band to tighten around the hose. The size of clamp should be chosen such that the ear(s) are almost completely closed on installation.|$|R
50|$|The {{procedure}} is done similarly to other piercings of the cartilage of the <b>ear.</b> <b>Clamps</b> {{may be used}} but it is usually done freehand. Once the area is cleaned, the piercer and the client will agree on placement, although because of its location {{it can be difficult}} to see exactly where the entrance and exit holes will be. Generally the piercer will advise the client on the best location. The entrance and exit holes are marked, and a hollow needle is pushed through. Many professional piercers will use either a 14g or 16g needle by default, although it is possible to use even larger gauges. The jewelry is then inserted, and the piercing complete.|$|R
5000|$|Vic did {{not appear}} on the front cover of any albums or {{compilations}} from 1991 to 2000. However, when Megadeth tried to bring back a more 'classic' vibe to their material, he returned for the 2001 album The World Needs a Hero, the 2004 album The System Has Failed, {{as well as the}} 2007 studio album United Abominations in a human form. He is identified by his visor, metal caps on his <b>ears,</b> and <b>clamps</b> on his mouth. Only Vic's face is shown in the mushroom cloud on the 2005 compilation Greatest Hits: Back to the Start. Vic was once again absent from the cover of Endgame, instead found in the album's booklet much like the inside cover of Youthanasia and Countdown To Extinction. His portrait image can also be found by joining the spine labels of the 7 albums Mustaine re-released in 2004. Vic was mentioned in the band's 2010 video [...] "The Right to Go Insane" [...] and featured on the cover art for the [...] "Sudden Death" [...] single. On Th1rt3en is shown with his back turned. Vic can be seen very faintly on the Super Collider album artwork as a reflection {{in the center of the}} particle collider, it is revealed inside the cover and on the back that Vic is the Super Collider. On Dystopia, a robot version of Vic Rattlehead is seen.|$|R
40|$|The {{skin of the}} rabbit's ear is {{considerably}} more resistant than the abdominal skin to the phenomenon of local skin reactivity to bacterial filtrates. Ten times the provocative dose is required if it is given into the vein of the prepared ear and thirty times the provocative dose if it is given into the vein of the non-prepared ear. The state of reactivity cannot be elicited by a preparatory intravenous injection of bacterial filtrates alone into <b>clamped</b> and non-clamped <b>ears.</b> The state also fails to appear in combination with cold, xylol, ethyl urethane, pilocarpine hydrochloride, atropine, calcium gluconate, guinea pig liver extract, histamine dihydrochloride, adrenalin chloride, and pituitrin. Preparatory intravenous injections of toxins are capable of eliciting the state of reactivity in the rabbit's ear when they are accompanied by thermal hyperemia (i. e., exposure to 45 °, 50 °, and 55 °C.). It is also possible to induce the state of reactivity when a mixture of the preparatory factors with testicular extract is given into the veins of <b>clamped</b> <b>ears.</b> The incubation period required may be less than 2 hours. In {{the light of the}} above experiments, there are discussed various observations concerning the elicitation of the phenomena of organ reactivity by means of live bacterial cultures and the filtrates thereof...|$|R
