5|$|The UCF College of Medicine was {{established}} in 2006 by the Florida Legislature and the Florida Board of Governors to increase opportunities for medical education in Florida. The College of Medicine welcomed its charter class of 41 students on August 3, 2009, and <b>eventually</b> <b>will</b> produce about 120 medical graduates a year. With more than 4,300 applications for 41 available positions, UCF broke the state university record for most applications, and for 2009 {{it was the most}} selective medical school in the country. For the class of 2014, there were 3,761 applicants and only 60 were accepted. This initial class had the highest average MCAT score, 32.2, and GPA, 3.8, of any incoming class of medical students in the state. The inaugural class had a median age of 28, with 25% of the class composed of out-of-state students. The charter class completed their first year of courses on the UCF main campus, while the Lake Nona Medical City was completed. Every member of the inaugural class received a full scholarship, including tuition and basic living expenses, for their entire four years at the university, valued at over $160,000.|$|E
5|$|Back at the TARDIS, Jack begins {{integrating}} the extrapolator into the TARDIS {{to speed up}} the engine recharge. Rose and Mickey hang out together, and he admits to her that he is dating someone else because she is not there for him, and he begs her to promise him that she <b>eventually</b> <b>will</b> come back to him in the end, but before she can answer him, loud sounds like thunder start to reverberate through the area. Cardiff is soon struck by a large earthquake that seems to be coming from the Rift. The Doctor, Margaret, Rose and Jack regroup and find that the extrapolator was a trap meant to redirect the energy from the TARDIS into the Rift, rupturing it. Jack and the Doctor are unable to stop the energy transfer, and Margaret takes Rose hostage and demands the extrapolator. The heart of the TARDIS opens on the console, bathing Margaret in light. While she is captivated by the light, Jack and the Doctor close the rift and disable the extrapolator. As the console closes, they find that Margaret's human suit is empty except for a Slitheen egg. The Doctor surmises that the TARDIS sensed that Margaret wanted a second chance at life and gave it to her. The TARDIS crew decides to return the egg to Raxacoricofallapatorius so Margaret can be raised in a different family. Rose realises Mickey has left without saying goodbye, and runs out to look for him in the nearby area, but he is gone. Rose returns to the TARDIS, clearly distraught, and the Doctor offers to wait a little longer so she can search for Mickey, but she declines, saying that he deserves better.|$|E

25|$|Flies {{searching for}} an {{egg-laying}} site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the vent pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the vent pipe. Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see {{is at the top}} of the vent pipe. Since the vent pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and <b>eventually</b> <b>will</b> die and fall back into the pit.|$|E
25|$|Swartswood State Park {{is located}} in the Kittatinny Valley which is a segment of the Great Appalachian Valley that {{stretches}} from Quebec to Alabama. The valley and surrounding area is part of New Jersey's Ridge and Valley physiographic province. The surficial geology of the valley, namely its soils and parent materials, were created from materials left behind by the retreat of the Wisconsin glaciation after the last glacial maximum. The topography of the valley, and the lake itself, were formed by the damming or obstruction of a river valley with extra-morainic stratified drift and till deposits. As a glacial lake, Swartswood Lake <b>eventually</b> <b>will</b> atrophy into a bog, a natural progression that is estimated to occur in 100,000 years.|$|E
500|$|A large {{proportion}} of the character's scenes take place on the set of Walford's launderette, where Pauline works as an assistant for almost the entire duration of her time in EastEnders. Here, Pauline is frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Dot Cotton. The two characters share one of the soap's most enduring screen friendships and their scenes together are often used to provide humour. Particular emphasis is placed on their differences, which lead to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 sees them [...] "buried alive" [...] underneath a collapsed fairground ride, {{in the midst of a}} cake-selling war. However, Pauline and Dot are most frequently shown gossiping, reminiscing about the past, or sharing their woes in the launderette.

500|$|Throughout {{her time}} in EastEnders, many of Dot's scenes have been set in Walford's launderette, where the {{character}} has worked as an assistant for almost the entire duration of {{her time in}} EastEnders. Here, Dot was frequently featured with another long-running protagonist, fellow launderette colleague, Pauline Fowler, played by Wendy Richard from 1985–2006. Author Christine Geraghty has discussed the working environment the women inhabited, indicating that because {{the owner of the}} launderette is barely present, the [...] "working relationship hinges on the friendships (or otherwise) of the women who work in it". As with Ethel, Dot and Pauline's friendship was often used for comedic purposes; emphasis was placed on their differences, leading to numerous petty squabbles and in 2004 saw them [...] "buried alive" [...] underneath a collapsed fairground ride, {{in the midst of a}} cake-selling war.

[...] On the episode marking the screen death of Pauline on 25 December 2006, Dot remarks to Pauline, “You’re the only real friend I’ve got", in a scene that Tim Teeman of The Times has described as [...] "one of the most moving scenes in a soap [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Phagocytosis {{is common}} and {{probably}} appeared early in evolution, [...] evolving first in unicellular eukaryotes. Amoebae are unicellular protists that {{separated from the}} tree leading to metazoa shortly after the divergence of plants, and they share many specific functions with mammalian phagocytic cells. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum, for example, is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria. Like animal phagocytes, it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through Toll-like receptors, and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages. [...] Dictyostelium discoideum is social; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating pseudoplasmodium or slug. This multicellular organism <b>eventually</b> <b>will</b> produce a fruiting body with spores that are resistant to environmental dangers. Before the formation of fruiting bodies, the cells will migrate as a slug-like organism for several days. During this time, exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens {{has the potential to}} compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production. Some of the amoebae engulf bacteria and absorb toxins while circulating within the slug, and these amoebae eventually die. They are genetically identical to the other amoebae in the slug; their self-sacrifice to protect the other amoebae from bacteria is similar to the self-sacrifice of phagocytes seen in the immune system of higher vertebrates. This ancient immune function in social amoebae suggests an evolutionarily conserved cellular foraging mechanism that might have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of amoebae into higher forms. However, a common ancestry with mammalian phagocytes has not been proven. Phagocytes occur throughout the animal kingdom, from marine sponges to insects and lower and higher vertebrates. The ability of amoebae to distinguish between self and non-self is a pivotal one, and is the root of the immune system of many species of amoeba.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{feature of}} {{transhumanism}} and philosophical posthumanism {{is the future}} vision of a new intelligent species, into which humanity will evolve and <b>eventually</b> <b>will</b> supplement or supersede it.

2500|$|An {{attempt to}} change the rules was made by Condoleezza Rice and Tzipi Livni when they brought forth the concept of a shelf agreement.

In theory this would allow negotiations until a [...] "shelf agreement" [...] defining peace would be obtained. Such an agreement would not entail implementation. It would just describe what peace is. It would stay on the shelf but <b>eventually</b> <b>will</b> guide the implementation. The difficulty with this notion is that it creates a dis-incentive for Israel to reach such an agreement. The lack of clarity about what happens after agreement is reached will result in insurmountable pressures on Abbas to demand immediate implementation. However, from the Israeli point of view, the Palestinians are not ready to create a stable state, such an implementation process will almost guarantee instability in the Palestinian areas with a possible Hamas takeover as happened in Gaza.|$|E
2500|$|The 196 OHV {{requires}} more periodic maintenance than newer-model engines. The head bolts must be re-torqued (retightening process) regularly.

The head expands and contracts by as much as 0.020" [...] in height during normal operation, this loosens the bolts over time and <b>eventually</b> <b>will</b> cause the seal between head and block to fail. This maintenance is also imperative to prevent the engine from overheating (the first sign of a blown head gasket) and warping or cracking the head. The cast-iron liners in the aluminum block version can also shift if the head bolts are not properly torqued and the engine is allowed to overheat. Good replacement heads and aluminum blocks for these engines are now difficult to find.|$|E
