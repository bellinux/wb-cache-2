Moss asserted that the No Doubt lead vocalist was the [...] "most captivating thing onstage" [...] with her [...] "confident strut and dead-on vocals". Jon Pareles of The New York Times admired the [...] "glamour and groove" [...] antics of the show and how Stefani [...] "flaunt the perks of stardom". He praised her music, describing the album as [...] "a smart , with honed rhythm tracks that flit from funk to pop, electronics to rock", although calling most tracks [...] "superficial", being about [...] "style", [...] "success", [...] "shopping" [...] and [...] "sex".|$|E

Their relationship deteriorates after Kirsty miscarries their unborn baby. Kirsty is left distraught and feels she has to move with her life without Miles. However, Kirsty does not tell Miles she is leaving and leaves him a goodbye letter. Speaking of the scenes, Hayes said [...] "I don't agree with what she did or <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it but Kirsty in her warped, grieving mind thinks it's best for everybody." [...] She felt that Kirsty's actions were [...] "horrible and selfish." [...] She also described her as [...] "emotionally detached" [...] and Miles {{would have tried to}} talk her out of leaving if he had been made aware of her departure. Viewers were not shown the full content of the goodbye letter. Hayes said it was good because she wrote a private goodbye letter to Quong Tart, and noted the personal element was best left between the two. After Miles chances of a family are again ruined, Miles loses control. He starts drinking and on one occasion he tries to kiss Leah. Producers decided to introduce a character named Rabbit (Mitzi Ruhlmann), who [...] "brings a little fun back into Miles' life." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the remix of [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] {{was directed by}} Carey's husband, Nick Cannon. Minaj spoke about filming a video with Carey and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not believe that the}} video would ever be released: [...] "I didn’t even tell anyone I shot a video with Mariah, because I didn’t even believe. In the back of my mind, I felt like, ’This video is not gonna come out. There’s no way I’m gonna do a video with Mariah Carey before I even put out my album.’ Then, when it came out, I think it was the #1 video on YouTube in one day, something crazy like that." [...] It premiered simultaneously with the video for [...] "Angels Cry" [...] with Ne-Yo on Vevo on January 28, 2010. Carey and Minaj play different characters, include Barbie dolls who escape from their boxes, sexy nurses in matching outfits, two women in a nail salon and two divas shopping. Carey's doll box has [...] "She sings" [...] written on the front, while Minaj's say [...] "She raps". Cannon makes a cameo appearance in the video, which Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy thought was a reference to the 2002 film, Drumline. According to Anna Pickard of The Guardian, the escape from their packaging demonstrates a theme of being independent women and {{that they will not be}} restrained by men. Minaj spoke about the video in an interview for MTV News: [...] "A lot of times, more famous artists or more confident artists take from a younger artist but they’ll never include you in that. I feel like she liked the whole doll thing and she wanted to do it with me. But she said that: She said, ’Everybody’s gonna say 'she’s doing Nicki.' But I told her, she’s always had a doll persona, like all that ’doll baby’ [...] So it goes perfect with Barbie and we had fun. That’s all that matters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Daniel Welsh from HuffPost was {{positive}} {{in his review}} of the track. He called it [...] "one {{of the more important}} moments of Joanne, and a welcome relief." [...] Welsh further described [...] "John Wayne" [...] as a stand-out of the album and complimented Gaga's tongue-in-cheek references in the lyrics. Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic believed that the song was an indication of the musical direction the parent album could have gone into, with Gaga's fascination of the Western genre. [...] "When she screams 'go FASTER!' in the song's intro, it's one of the album's few examples of Gaga doing what Gaga got famous for, glorifying the extreme," [...] he added. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine thought that Gaga exudes [...] "swagger" [...] on the song with her [...] "fetishizing" [...] of blue-collar men as [...] "red-state treasure", like <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> on the song [...] "Teeth" [...] from The Fame Monster (2009).|$|E
2500|$|Sir James's {{reputation}} {{remains high}} {{due to his}} work as a surgeon and medical research and work, but he also had an apparent interest in criminal matters. [...] In 1886, he followed the Pimlico Mystery, the poisoning trial of Adelaide Bartlett for the murder of her husband Edwin. [...] After a spirited defence by Sir Edward Clarke, Bartlett was acquitted. [...] The key problem of the trial was that Edwin was poisoned by liquid chloroform, which was found in his stomach, but liquid chloroform burns the throat if swallowed, and the drinker would be screaming. [...] Edwin Bartlett never screamed the night he died. [...] As a result, an alternative theory of suicide was considered and helped get the acquittal, but it left the public unsatisfied. [...] Paget, upon hearing the result, made the comment for which he is best remembered: [...] "Now that she has been acquitted for murder and cannot be tried again, she should tell us in the interest of science <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> it!" ...|$|E
