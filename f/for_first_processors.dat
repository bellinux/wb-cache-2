40|$|We present exact {{approaches}} to the General Offset Assignment problem arising in the address code generation phase of compilers <b>for</b> application-specific <b>processors.</b> <b>First,</b> integer programming models for architecture-dependent and theoretically motivated special cases of the problem are established. Then, these models are extended to provide the first widely applicable formulations for the most general problem setting, supporting processors with several address registers and complex addressing capabilities. Existing heuristics are similarly extended and practical applicability of the proposed methods is demonstrated by experimental evaluation using an established and large-scale benchmark set. The experiments also allow us to study the impact of exploiting more complex memory addressing capabilities on the address computation costs of real-world programs. Further, we show how to integrate operand reordering techniques based on commutative instructions into existing solution approaches...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} Processing Element (PE) scalability in twiddle factor generators <b>for</b> FFT <b>processors.</b> <b>First</b> the twiddle factor indexing scheme for Constant Geometry FFT is analyzed and a CORDIC-based novel algorithm is deduced. It uses single-step rotations {{and does not}} need any CORDIC gain correction. Then, two architectures implementing the algorithm are presented {{with the goal of}} scalability. The first (shared core) is characterized by both low register count and variable throughput, while the second (pipelined) achieves the maximum throughput during the whole computation. Our hybrid models use both one ROM and multiplier-based CORDIC modules. The designs are then evaluated in terms of register usage and output error, showing scalability of register bits {{as a function of the}} number of PEs if compared to other architectures. Architectures were coded in VHDL and synthesized on a Xilinx Virtex- 5 330 T FPGA...|$|R
