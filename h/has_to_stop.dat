A light novel titled Kakashi Hiden: Lightning in the Icy Sky, written by Akira Higashiyama and illustrated by Kishimoto, focuses on the early days of Kakashi's appointment as the Sixth Hokage, in which he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> a terror plan conducted by a pair of Kirigakure ninja, who plan to take control of a newly unveiled airborne ship to stage a jailbreak of a notorious criminal, in the process learning about the pair's tragic reason for doing so.|$|E

25|$|The Web of Caves, {{which is}} in black and white, sees Walliams and Putner as aliens (somewhat similar in {{appearance}} to Movellans) trying to persuade the Doctor (Gatiss) to defeat their schemes. The Walliams alien appears alone at first and outlines his scheme to hollow out {{the core of the}} Earth {{and replace it with a}} motor; the Doctor dismisses this plan, in a rather bored fashion, as having been done, and the alien suggests he will come back the next day with a new plan. The next day he returns, accompanied by the Putner alien, and proposes to drain the world's oceans into its core thus boiling them away; again the Doctor points out that it has been done, but decides he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them. The two aliens and the Doctor agree on a time for their battle and the Doctor leaves in the TARDIS, only to have it rematerialise in the same spot, leaving the Doctor visibly annoyed. He disappears back into the TARDIS, only to have the Walliams alien obliviously comment on how nice the Doctor is.|$|E
25|$|Access to Interstate 215 from SR-71 is {{provided}} by Winchester Street, which connects to Exit 9 a short distance to the east. Wheeler Farm appears east of SR-71 as the Jordan and Salt Lake Canal passes under the road and continues east in a pipe just north of Winchester Street. The route intersects the eastern segment of Vine Street (former State Route 173) just as it passes over Little Cottonwood Creek, which is in a concrete trench; the western segment of Vine Street meets SR-71 at an unsignalized intersection a short distance further north. After passing a retail area and {{the entrance to a}} golf course, the road meets the north (non-state-maintained) segment of 900 East, the northern terminus of SR-152 (Van Winkle Expressway), and Murray-Holladay Road (former State Route 174) at a six-way intersection south of Big Cottonwood Creek. The complexity of this six-way intersection has been moderated by effectively dividing it into two three-way and one four-way intersection in close proximity: SR-71, in particular, turns west at the four-way intersection (from which 900 East continues north and SR-152 continues east) and then immediately intersects Murray-Holladay Road at a signalized three-way intersection (though northwest-bound traffic on SR-71 never <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop,</b> due to a channelized free right turn arrangement). Beyond this intersection, SR-71 (which now has four lanes in each direction, having absorbed much of SR-152's traffic) crosses Big Cottonwood Creek and forms the border between Murray and Millcreek Township for a short distance as it curves north again to become 700 East and intersect SR-266 (4500 South).|$|E

500|$|The {{design for}} Marceline {{was created by}} Ward, with small changes and {{additions}} added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for Adventure Time. Visually, Marceline has long, dark hair. She rarely walks on the ground, generally preferring to float when she travels, moves, and sleeps. Marceline, unlike {{many of the other}} characters, wears varying outfits in most of her appearances. According to Ward, her clothing changes from episode to episode because [...] "girls own more than one outfit". Olson was impressed by her character's fashion design stating, [...] "she has really cool style [...] I love what they come up with [...] every episode." [...] Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode, she is [...] "totally surprised" [...] by the costuming for Marceline. While she says her lines, she is able to view the animatics for the episode and sometimes <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> to admire the unique designs. Marceline's physical size and shape slightly changes depending on who is drawing her. Rynda later called this [...] "one of the coolest parts" [...] about the character's animation {{due to the fact that}} [...] "every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw." ...|$|E
500|$|Spider-Man 2 {{opened in}} US theaters on June 30, 2004. This entry focuses on Peter Parker's struggles, {{as he tries}} to manage both his {{personal}} life and his duties as Spider-Man. He also <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the film's main villain, Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina), a man who becomes insane after an experiment of his goes haywire. Spider-Man 2 [...] was less successful in its first week of release, taking first place at the box office with around $88 million at 4,152 locations. Nonetheless, the sequel set several box office records at the time and broke the record for best opening day title ever, previously held by the preceding Spider-Man film. It eventually made more than $783 million worldwide but still stands as the lowest-grossing in the trilogy. However, it also stands as the best received film in the franchise. Movie critics believed the second installment had better humor and action sequences than its predecessor and that it was [...] "unusually good" [...] for its genre. A writer for website IGN said this film had [...] "a better flowing storyline, more emotional depth, and a less ridiculous looking supervillain, Spider-Man 2 elevated the series to just about everything that comic fans love about the character." [...] The website also ranked Spider-Man 2 as being the third best superhero film of all-time on their 2005 list. Time magazine also named the sequel the third best superhero movie on their top-ten list published in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Non-English {{versions}} of the game omit the section {{at the beginning of}} CD2, where Guybrush's crew sings the song [...] "A Pirate I Was Meant To Be". In this section, the player as Guybrush <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the crew's singing - however, at each attempt, they just start a new stanza rhyming to the player's line, until he says a line ending with the word [...] "orange" [...] making the song unable to continue. As the whole section relies on English language rhyming, it was removed from international {{versions of}} the game.|$|E
2500|$|The {{stations}} can leverage {{the existing}} ubiquitous electrical grid and home recharging is an option. For example, polls {{have shown that}} more than half of homeowners in the United States have access to a plug to charge their cars. Also most driving is local over short distances which reduces the need for charging mid-trip. In the USA, for example, 78% of commutes are less than [...] round-trip. Nevertheless, longer drives between cities and towns require a network of public charging stations or another method to extend the range of electric vehicles beyond the normal daily commute. One challenge in such infrastructure is the level of demand: an isolated station along a busy highway may see hundreds of customers per hour if every passing electric vehicle <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> there to complete the trip. In the first half of the 20th century, internal combustion vehicles faced a similar infrastructure problem.|$|E

2500|$|Bart vs. the Space Mutants is a 2D side-scrolling platformer. In the single-player game, Bart Simpson is {{the only}} one who knows of the aliens' secret plan (his X-ray {{sunglasses}} allow him to identify aliens in human form) and he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> them from collecting the items they need to build their [...] "ultimate weapon" [...] to take over the world. There are a total of five levels, in which Bart must collect or destroy a certain number of these items (purple objects in the first level, hats in the second, balloons in the third, exit signs in the fourth, and nuclear rods in the fifth). If Bart loses a life he says [...] "Eat my shorts!" [...] Another objective of Bart vs. the Space Mutants is to help Bart convince the other members of the Simpson family about the aliens' existence so that they will help him during the levels.|$|E

The trade ministers also said that tightening intra-BRICS trade would help {{as an antidote to}} the European sovereign debt crisis. The trade ministers also called for collective action to fight the European and United States economic downturns. At the BRICS Business Forum, India's Commerce and Industry Minister Anand Sharma said that the [...] "adversity of financial crisis is being faced by all. There is a need to work together to overcome this problem." [...] His Chinese counterpart Chen Deming added that both economic problems were affecting all states and decreased Chinese exports: [...] "I am sure they will recover. There is a need to prevent the EU crisis quickly before it gets worse. There has been a decline in demand in the European markets. Despite this we have to sustain a high level of growth." [...] Russian Minister for Economic Development and Trade Elvira Nabioullina added that [...] "the world <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> accumulating risks. There is a need to work closer." ...|$|E
2500|$|The idyllic life of Duncan and Tessa is {{shattered}} {{by the arrival of}} a message from one of Mac's teachers, the priest Darius, in [...] "Band Of Brothers" [...] Darius' most powerful enemy, Grayson, was coming to Seacouver, to eliminate a mortal peacemaker and disciple of Darius, Viktor Paulus. Grayson was a lieutenant of Darius when they led an army across Europe in the 5th century but turned against him when Darius killed the then-oldest living Immortal at the gates of Paris and became a man of peace. [...] Determined to protect Tessa and Richie but uncertain of his ability to handle Grayson, he sends them to Darius for protection, then sets out to face Grayson. Grayson, a fellow Scot, offers MacLeod a position at his right hand, but Duncan refuses. Grayson takes MacLeod to the limit before the younger Highlander prevails. MacLeod follows his friends to Paris, where he and Tessa decide to stay, living on Duncan's barge; Tessa takes up a post as a curator, Duncan takes up the role of a kept man and Richie that of a fish out of water, in his role as a kept man, Duncan does the shopping, but as he is returning to the barge one morning, he sees a clown dressed as a mime kill an elderly man ("For Evil's Sake"). Helping the police, he tells them that he can identify the man. The police inspector, LeBrun, is convinced he has seen Duncan before. Later, mysterious men with guns stake out the barge and, when Duncan fells one, he finds that he is a policeman. LeBrun has remembered Duncan - {{when he was a young}} gendarme, they were chasing the assassin Kuyler and he saw Duncan then. LeBrun's assistant is in Kuyler's pay, but Duncan silences the mime forever and LeBrun arrests his assistant. Duncan hasn't finished with LeBrun, for when his old enemy Xavier St Cloud crosses his path again, Duncan throws one of Xavier's gas grenades into a cement mixer and LeBrun fishes it out ("For Tomorrow We Die"). Convinced MacLeod is the gas poisoner, LeBrun tries to run him in whilst Duncan <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> Xavier from gassing an exhibition Tessa is organising. Frustrated, Xavier comes for Duncan, but Duncan cuts off Xavier's hand and he disappears into the Seine. The series also introduced two old Immortal lovers of Duncanâ€™s to test Tessa's restraint. Grace Chandel, on the run both from the police, who want to arrest her for killing her husband, and the Immortal ex-lover who was the real killer, the possessive Carlo Sendaro ("Saving Grace") was welcomed by Tessa, when Duncan and Darius help her escape, Duncan making sure that Carlo will not trouble her again. The same was not true of Amanda, described by Duncan as [...] "a bad habit". In [...] "The Lady & The Tiger" [...] we met the unprincipled cat-burglar with a passion for circuses, robbery, and 400-year-old Scotsmen, here trying to set up MacLeod so that the Immortal thief she had double crossed, Zachary Blaine, would not take her head. In the end, she takes Zachary's, but not before Duncan has done all the hard work. Which pretty much set the pattern for all of the Amanda stories to come.|$|E
