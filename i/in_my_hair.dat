500|$|Stratus is {{the host}} and subject of the show Stratusphere, which debuted in 2008 on the Travel + Escape {{television}} channel. The show follows Stratus as she visits different locations {{around the world to}} participate in local sports and adventure. Bill Harris wrote that, [...] "Every week, Stratus embarks on a trip in search of exotic locations and daring physical challenges. In the first episode, for example, Stratus is in Kochi, India, where she learns the ancient martial art of kalarippayattu, progressing from fighting with sticks to fighting with metal swords. Through the 10-episode run of Stratusphere, Stratus does everything from reindeer racing in Norway to bungee jumping in Bali. Her athleticism obviously sets Stratusphere apart from most travel shows." [...] Stratus also guest-starred in the Canadian show Da Kink <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Hair</b> new season, which started on February 12, 2009. In 2009, Stratus became a spokesperson for sports betting website, Sports Interaction.|$|E
500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E
500|$|Auditions {{were held}} {{for the role of}} Becky which {{required}} the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy. Actress Katherine Kelly commented: [...] "I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible, with no make-up. But that morning I'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous. So I sat on the Tube putting grease <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> and wiping my make-up off with everyone looking at me. By the time I got there I looked a right state!". Kelly was initially only cast for a three-month period when she began filming in 2006, but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character. On 17 June 2008, after further impressing the producers, Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months. In February 2009, Kelly again had her contract extended, securing her role in the soap until August 2011. However, in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18-month contract by new producer Phil Collinson, a contract which was described as [...] "unprecedented" [...] at the time.|$|E
6000|$|On {{mountain}} soil I first drew life: [...] The mists of the Taglay have shed [...] Nightly their dews upon my head, [...] And, I believe, the winged strife [...] And tumult of the headlong air [...] Have nestled <b>in</b> <b>my</b> very <b>hair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “I am not {{surprised}} at that,” Stephen {{said with a}} smile. “In the first place, I should imagine that my face is the colour of mahogany from wind and sun; <b>in</b> the second, <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> has not been cut for six months; and lastly, this suit of clothes, though excellent in its way, is scarcely <b>in</b> accordance with <b>my</b> rank.” ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{looked in}} the dirty gilt-edged glass, [...] And, oh Salome; there I was-- [...] Positively jewelled, half a vampire, [...] With the soul <b>in</b> <b>my</b> eyes hanging dizzily [...] Like the {{gatherer}} of proverbial samphire [...] Over the brink of the crag of sense, [...] Looking down from perilous eminence [...] Into a gulf of windy night. [...] And there's straw <b>in</b> <b>my</b> tempestuous <b>hair,</b> [...] And I'm not a poet: but never despair! [...] I'll madly live the poems I shall never write.|$|R
2500|$|Berryman's major poetic {{breakthrough}} {{came after}} {{he began to}} publish {{the first volume of}} The Dream Songs, 77 Dream Songs, in 1964. The dream song form consisted of short, eighteen-line lyric poems in three stanzas. The poems are written in free verse although some stanzas contain irregular rhyme. 77 Dream Songs (and its sequel His Toy, His Dream, His Rest) centers on a character named [...] "Henry" [...] who bears a striking resemblance to John Berryman. However, Berryman was careful about making sure that his readers realized that [...] "Henry" [...] was not his equivalent, but rather a fictional version of himself (or a literary alter ego). In an interview, Berryman stated, [...] "Henry does resemble me, and I resemble Henry; {{but on the other hand}} I am not Henry. You know, I pay income tax; Henry pays no income tax. And bats come over and they stall <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> — and fuck them, I'm not Henry; Henry doesn't have any bats." ...|$|E
2500|$|McDaniel died {{of breast}} cancer at age 57 on October 26, 1952, in the {{hospital}} {{on the grounds of the}} Motion Picture House in Woodland Hills, California. She was survived by her brother Sam McDaniel. Thousands of mourners turned out to celebrate her life and achievements. In her will, McDaniel wrote, [...] "I desire a white casket and a white shroud; white gardenias <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> and in my hands, together with a white gardenia blanket and a pillow of red roses. I also wish to be buried in the Hollywood Cemetery"; Hollywood Cemetery, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, is the resting place of movie stars such as Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino. Its owner at the time, Jules Roth, refused to allow her to be buried there, because, at the time of McDaniel's death, the cemetery practiced racial segregation and would not accept the remains of black people for burial. Her second choice was Rosedale Cemetery (now known as Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery), where she lies today.|$|E
60|$|She bent her fresh young {{face down}} to mine, {{her fingers were}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you hear}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> voice--I don't {{know that it}} is so, but I hope it is--if you hear <b>in</b> <b>my</b> voice any {{resemblance}} to a voice that once was sweet music in your ears, weep for it, weep for it! If you touch, <b>in</b> touching <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> anything that recalls a beloved head that lay on your breast when you were young and free, weep for it, weep for it! If, when I hint to you of a Home that is before us, where I will be true to you with all my duty and with all my faithful service, I bring back the remembrance of a Home long desolate, while your poor heart pined away, weep for it, weep for it!" ...|$|R
60|$|I love bright, pure colours, and, my {{sweeping}} and dusting and bedmaking over, and my external {{mourning for}} my father at an end, a remarkably festive figure would confront me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cheval glass of an afternoon. The hours I spent <b>in</b> dressing <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> and matching this bit of colour with that. I would talk to myself in the glass, too, for company's sake, and make believe I was a dozen different characters. I was young. I pined for life and companionship, and having only my own--for Mrs Bowater was rather a faithful feature of the landscape than a fellow being--I made as much, and as many, of myself as possible.|$|R
60|$|When I go free, I think 'twill be A {{night of}} stars and snow, And the wild fires of frost shall light My {{footsteps}} as I go; Nobody--nobody will be there With groping touch, or sight, To see me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bush of <b>hair</b> Dance burning through the night.|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS [yelling] Oh very well, very well: I'll wipe them <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> in future.|$|E
60|$|At this {{he laughed}} {{out with a}} great guffaw, and said there must be hay-seed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye, old," [...] {{he assured}} her bitterly. [...] "Look at the grey <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> the {{wrinkles}} in my face. I am no likely lover for you, child. You'll need a lusty, comely young gallant." ...|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know what}} I am. I have a bulldog {{kind of a}} face, {{but the rest of}} me is terrier. I have a long tail which sticks {{straight}} up <b>in</b> the air. <b>My</b> <b>hair</b> is wiry. <b>My</b> eyes are brown. I am jet black, with a white chest. I once overheard Fred saying that I was a Gorgonzola cheese-hound, and I have generally found Fred reliable in his statements.|$|R
6000|$|When I go free, [...] I think 'twill be [...] A {{night of}} stars and snow, [...] And the wild fires of frost shall light [...] My {{footsteps}} as I go; [...] Nobody--nobody will be there [...] With groping touch, or sight, [...] To see me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> bush of <b>hair</b> [...] Dance burning through the night.|$|R
6000|$|I {{have not}} always been as now: [...] The fevered diadem on my brow [...] I claimed and won usurpingly-- [...] Hath not the same fierce heirdom given [...] Rome to the Cæsar--this to me? [...] The {{heritage}} of a kingly mind, [...] And a proud spirit which hath striven [...] Triumphantly with human kind. [...] On mountain soil I first drew life: [...] The mists of the Taglay have shed [...] Nightly their dews upon my head, [...] And, I believe, the winged strife [...] And tumult of the headlong air [...] Have nestled <b>in</b> <b>my</b> very <b>hair.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Now {{my little}} heart goes a-beating like a drum, [...] With {{the breath of}} Bogie <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> [...] And all round the candle the crooked shadows come, [...] And go marching along up the stair.|$|E
60|$|My dress, like hers, was {{of white}} silk, with a skirt of lovely Brussels lace, a present from Mr. Harmer, over it. This was {{slightly}} looped up with blue forget-me-nots, and I had a wreath {{of the same}} flowers <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The Bishop's {{eyes with}} water fill, Quite overjoyed {{to find them}} still Obedient to his {{sovereign}} will, And said, [...] "Good Rum-ti-Foo! Half-way I'll meet you, I declare: I'll dress myself in cowries rare, And fasten feathers <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> And dance the 'Cutch-chi-boo!'" [...] {11} ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'"So I have," [...] said he, and it {{was awful}} to hear the tones that he said it in. He had a very dark, fearsome face, and a gleam in his eyes that comes back to me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dreams. His <b>hair</b> and {{whiskers}} were shot with gray, {{and his face was}} all crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.|$|R
60|$|Presently, however, by a cursed {{spite of}} fate, {{one of these}} gusts--a very little one--came from some quarter behind us, for I felt it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> back <b>hair,</b> that was as damp {{as the rest of}} me. Just then I was glancing to my right, where {{it seemed to me that}} out of the corner of my eye I had caught sight of {{something}} passing among the stones at a distance of a hundred yards or so, possibly the shadow of a cloud or another elephant. At the time I did not ascertain which it was, since a faint rattle from Jana's trunk reconcentrated all my faculties on him in a painfully vivid fashion.|$|R
60|$|I came to {{a sitting}} posture in an instant, with <b>my</b> kidneys <b>in</b> <b>my</b> throat and <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> on end.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you think}} that, mistress, then let us die at once {{rather than be}} rent limb from limb to give {{pleasure}} to a stinking mob. See, I have poison hidden here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair.</b> Let us drink of it and be done: it is swift and painless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like to be}} gaudy. I {{should like}} to be encrusted with jewels. I want to wear bracelets to my elbow and diamond {{spangles}} on my arms; and jewelled belts, and jewels <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> and on my neck. I should like to flash {{from head to foot}} with exotic stones." ...|$|E
6000|$|If I put roses <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> [...] They bloom {{as if in}} mockery; [...] Nature denies her sympathy, [...] Because I am not fair; [...] Alas! I have a warm, true heart, [...] But when I show it people stare; [...] I must forever dwell apart, [...] Because I am not fair.|$|E
60|$|So passed {{more than}} another year; every day a year in its number of my mixed {{impressions}} of grave pleasure and acute pain; and then these two, being of age and free to act legally for themselves, came before me hand <b>in</b> hand (<b>my</b> <b>hair</b> being now quite white), and entreated me that I would unite them together. 'And indeed, dear tutor,' said Adelina, 'it is but consistent in you that you should do this thing for us, seeing that we should never have spoken together that first time but for you, and that but for you we could never have met so often afterwards.' The whole of which was literally true; for I had availed myself of my many business attendances on, and conferences with, my lady, to take Mr. Granville to the house, and leave him in the outer room with Adelina.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{explained}} Anne, [...] "I've {{learned a}} new and valuable lesson today. Ever since I came to Green Gables I've been making mistakes, and each mistake has helped to cure me of some great shortcoming. The affair of the amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong to me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run away with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness <b>in</b> cooking. Dyeing <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> cured me of vanity. I never think about <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> and nose now--at least, very seldom. And today's mistake is going to cure me of being too romantic. I {{have come to the}} conclusion that it is no use trying to be romantic in Avonlea. It was probably easy enough in towered Camelot hundreds of years ago, but romance is not appreciated now. I feel quite sure that you will soon see a great improvement in me in this respect, Marilla." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{lady who}} wrote {{me up at}} 11.30 {{reported}} that <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> was turning grey, {{and that there was}} [...] "a peculiar languor" [...] <b>in</b> <b>my</b> manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "There ain't no roses <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> but there's a barker in my shirt, an' {{another at}} me side. Here's one of 'em. They got kisses beat a city block. How's the door o' this thing fastened?" [...] The speaker was {{quite close to}} the window now, his face but {{a few inches from}} Bridge's.|$|E
6000|$|And the Water-midden gazed sorrowfully {{into his}} face. [...] "That is all I ask, Mulla-mulgar," [...] she {{repeated}} softly--"that {{you will not}} forget me. I fear the Wonderstone. All day it has been crickling and burning <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair.</b> All that I ask, I ask only of you." [...] So Nod stooped once more over that gold and beauty, and he promised the Water-midden.|$|E
6000|$|And {{wrapping}} my face <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>hair,</b> I murmured, [...] "In old age they ceased"; [...] And {{my tears}} were larger than berries, and I murmured, [...] "Where white clouds lie spread [...] "On Crevroe or broad Knockfefin, {{with many of}} old they feast [...] "On the floors of the gods." [...] He cried, [...] "No, the gods [...] a long time are dead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God help me! I'm talking polities at {{this time}} of night! It's your fault, Duncan. What do you mean by casting <b>my</b> station <b>in</b> <b>my</b> teeth, because I can't put my night-cap on comfortably till you have brushed <b>my</b> <b>hair?</b> I have a good mind to get up and brush yours. There! there! I'm uneasy about my niece--nervous irritability, my good fellow, that's all. Let's hear {{what you have to say}} about Miss Lundie. And go on with <b>my</b> <b>hair.</b> And don't be a humbug." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1529 Wolsey was {{stripped}} of his government office and property, including his magnificently expanded residence of Hampton Court, which Henry took to replace the Palace of Westminster as his own main London residence. However, Wolsey was permitted to remain Archbishop of York. He travelled to Yorkshire {{for the first time}} in his career, but at Cawood in North Yorkshire, he was accused of treason and ordered to London by Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. In great distress, he set out for the capital with his personal chaplain, Edmund Bonner. He fell ill on the journey, and died at Leicester on 29 November 1530, around the age of 57. Just before his death he reputedly spoke these words: I see the matter against me how it is framed. But if I had served God as diligently as I have done the King, he would not have given me over <b>in</b> <b>my</b> grey <b>hairs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As a {{freshman}} at Laconia High in 1953, she ignored the no-girls-rule and tried out for the boys' ski team. [...] "I hid <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> under <b>my</b> hat and asked my friends to call me Tommy," [...] she said. [...] "I made the team and everything went great until I competed in a downhill race at New Hampton School. I crashed {{in front of a}} gate-keeper, my hat flew off and <b>my</b> <b>hair</b> came down. It's {{one of the few times}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life that I was at a loss for words." ...|$|R
