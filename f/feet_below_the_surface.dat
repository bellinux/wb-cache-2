25|$|On July 18, 2001, a 60-car CSXT freight derailed in the Howard Street Tunnel, {{sparking}} a {{fire that}} burned for six days and blocked traffic for much longer. The Howard Street Tunnel fire {{called attention to the}} Belt Line, both as a risk to the surrounding structures and as a link in rail traffic. CSXT has implemented various improvements to increase the integrity of the link, but is limited by the shallow depth of the bore (only three <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> at the south end) and the instability of the surrounding soil.|$|E

25|$|Ancient surface copper {{workings}} {{were known}} at Kansanshi (near Solwezi), Bwana Mkubwa and Luanshya, all on what later {{became known as}} the Copperbelt, and BSAC exploration in the 1890s indicated there were significant deposits in the area. However, they could not be commercially exploited until a railway had been built. A railway bridge across the Zambezi was constructed in 1903 and the line was continued northward, reaching Broken Hill in 1906, where the lead and zinc vanadium mine was opened, and reaching the Belgian Congo border in 1909. At that time, mining had started in Katanga, where rich copper oxide ores occurred near the surface. In Northern Rhodesia, the surface ores were of poorer quality, and copper was only worked intermittently at Bwana Mkubwa, until in 1924 rich copper sulphide ores were discovered about 100 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|The western {{portion of}} the World Trade Center site was {{originally}} under the Hudson River, with the shoreline {{in the vicinity of}} Greenwich Street. It was on this shoreline close to the intersection of Greenwich and the former Dey Street that Dutch explorer Adriaen Block's ship, the Tyger, burned to the waterline in November 1613, stranding Block and his crew and forcing them to overwinter on the island. They built the first European settlement in Manhattan. The remains of the ship were buried under landfill when the shoreline was extended starting in 1797, and were discovered during excavation work in 1916. The remains of a second ship from the eighteenth century were discovered in 2010 during excavation work at the site. The ship, believed to be a Hudson River sloop, was found just south of where the Twin Towers used to stand, about 20 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

25|$|On December 14, 2015 at {{approximately}} 15:45 the Spence suffered a sudden 25 degree list to starboard while in towing the Guantanamo Bay Express barge from a shipyard in Cartahena, Columbia {{where it had}} recently been overhauled and repaired to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba to resume its normal resupply mission. The crew, unable to correct the list and fearing that the vessel would sink, abandoned ship by coming alongside the barge and jumping over to its deck. At around 17:30 the tug, still tethered to the barge with three 1,600 ft. tow lines, sank below the surface. An hour or two later, the crew heard three sharp bangs which {{are assumed to be}} the tow lines breaking as the tug sank beyond the length of the tow lines on its way to settling to the bottom 11,500 <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface.</b> The crew were rescued by the coast guard cutter Decisive early in the morning of December 15.|$|E

500|$|The Valdez Marine Terminal, the {{southern}} end of the pipeline, was planned for a site across the Port Valdez fjord from Valdez proper. Initial studies predicted bedrock would be six <b>feet</b> <b>below</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the ground, but when excavation began, it was discovered that bedrock actually was sixty feet down, requiring the removal of [...] of overburden. The terminal itself was designed to be built with four tanker berths and space for a fifth, should it become necessary. Holding tanks were planned that had a capacity equal to that of the pipeline, allowing the whole pipeline to be emptied if required. As required by the Pipeline Authorization Act, a ballast-water filtration system had to be designed as well. This system removes oil from tankers' ballast water so it is not released into Prince William Sound—something fishermen feared when the pipeline was proposed.|$|E
