25|$|Although several non-English {{keyboard}} layouts were available, the <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> layout {{was never}} ported to the Lisa, though such porting had {{been available for}} the Apple III, IIe, and IIc, and later for the Macintosh. Keyboard-mapping on the Lisa was complex and required building a new OS/kernel. All kernels contain images for all layouts, so due to serious memory constraints, keyboard layouts were stored as differences from a set of standard layouts, thus only a few bytes are needed to accommodate most additional layouts. A notable exception is the Dvorak layout that moves just about every key and thus requires hundreds of extra bytes of precious kernel storage {{regardless of whether it}} was needed.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{official}} Bulgarian {{keyboard layout}} for both typewriters and computer keyboards {{is described in}} BDS (Bulgarian State/National Standard) 5237:1978. It superseded the old standard, BDS5237:1968, on 1 January 1978. Like the <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard,</b> it {{has been designed to}} optimize typing speed and efficiency, placing the most common letters in the Bulgarian language — О, Н, Т and А — under the strongest fingers. [...] In addition to the standard 30 letters of the Bulgarian alphabet, the layout includes the non-Bulgarian Cyrillic symbols Э and ы and the Roman numerals I and V (the X is supposed to be represented by the Cyrillic capital Х, which is acceptable in typewriters but problematic in computers).|$|E
2500|$|One {{can also}} [...] that will, once installed, {{function}} {{in the same way}} as other languages' keyboards. When installed, this gives users two different methods of typing. The first, Esperanto maintains a QWERTY layout, but switches the letters that are not used in Esperanto (q, w, y, and x) for diacritical letters and makes a u into a ŭ if it follows an a or an e. The second method, Esperanto-sc, is more familiar to QWERTY users and allows the user to type in most Latin-scripted languages and Esperanto simultaneously. It treats the keys that take diacritics (a, s, e, c, g, h, u, and j) as dead keys, if a combining character is pressed afterwards—usually the semicolon ( [...] ;). Both methods are also available using the less common <b>Dvorak</b> <b>Keyboard.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard</b> is {{available}} {{out of the}} box on most operating systems, making switching through software very easy. [...] "Hardwired" [...] <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboards</b> are also available, though only from specialized hardware companies.|$|R

5000|$|On a <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard,</b> {{the longest}} [...] "left-handed" [...] words are epopoeia, jipijapa, peekapoo, and quiaquia. Other such long words are papaya, , opaque, and upkeep. Kikuyu is typed entirely with the index finger, {{and so the}} longest one-fingered word on the <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard.</b> There are no vowels on the {{right-hand}} side, and so the longest [...] "right-handed" [...] word is crwth.|$|E
5000|$|Variations {{in the use}} of left- and {{right-hand}} <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> layouts {{also provide}} an additional subset of encodings. The left and right variants are slightly better because the number keys are changed as well as the character keys [...] - [...] in this respect, the left-hand Dvorak encoding changes the most keys. Notably, the a and m keys never change in the default <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> layout.|$|E

Apple's iOS 8.0 and later has {{the option to}} install onscreen keyboards from the App Store, which includes several free and paid Dvorak layouts. iOS 4.0 and later supports external <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboards.</b> Google's Android OS touchscreen <b>keyboard</b> can use <b>Dvorak</b> and other nonstandard layouts natively as of version 4.1.|$|R
5000|$|Dvorak {{encoding}} can be typed real-time {{by anyone}} proficient with the <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> layout, allowing for very fast encoding by hand.|$|E
50|$|Typing a {{sequence}} of symbols using a <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> {{as if it were}} a QWERTY keyboard results in what is known as a Dvorak encoded string.|$|E
50|$|Dvorak {{encoding}} {{is a type}} of encoding {{based on}} the differences in layout of a QWERTY keyboard and a <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard.</b> There are two main variations: One is achieved by typing in the Dvorak layout on a QWERTY keyboard, and the other is similarly achieved by typing in the QWERTY layout on a <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard.</b> This effectively makes Dvorak encoding into a monoalphabetic substitution cipher like ROT13 and the Caesar Cipher, since each one character translates to one other character in a consistent pattern.|$|E

5000|$|August Dvorak (May 5, 1894 [...] - [...] October 10, 1975) was an American {{educational}} {{psychologist and}} {{professor of education at}} the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. [...] He and his brother-in-law, William Dealey, are best known for creating the <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard</b> layout in the 1930s as a replacement for the QWERTY keyboard layout. In the 1940s, <b>Dvorak</b> designed <b>keyboard</b> layouts for people with the use of one hand.|$|R

50|$|John Charles Dvorak {{was born}} in 1952 in Los Angeles, California. The nephew of {{sociologist}} and creator of the <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard,</b> August Dvorak, {{he graduated from the}} University of California, Berkeley with a degree in history, with a minor in chemistry.|$|E
5000|$|Letters {{should be}} typed by {{alternating}} between hands (which makes typing more rhythmic, increases speed, reduces error, and reduces fatigue). On a <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard,</b> vowels {{are all on}} the left home row, the most used symbols are on the left, while the most used consonants are on the right.|$|E
50|$|The {{left hand}} is {{responsible}} for consonants, the right hand is for vowels. As a result, almost alternating left and right keying is possible like in <b>Dvorak</b> simplified <b>keyboard.</b>|$|R
25|$|Letter {{frequencies}} had {{a strong}} effect {{on the design of}} some keyboard layouts. The most frequent letters are on the bottom row of the Blickensderfer typewriter, and the home row of the <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard.</b>|$|R
50|$|The idea of one-hand typing is {{to touch}} type using only one hand (e.g. the left one), or mainly one hand. Its history and {{application}} {{are closely related}} to keyboard research on QWERTY and <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Dvorak {{encoding}} is {{an unavoidable}} consequence of typing on a non-Dvorak keyboard using the Dvorak layout, for instance when using a software driver {{to compensate for}} the lack of rerouting of signals in the keyboard. This is the most common practice because it doesn't require a purchase of a special <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard.</b>|$|E
50|$|During May 2004 Microsoft {{published}} an improved {{version of its}} Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC version 1.3 - current version is 1.4) that allows anyone to easily create any keyboard pattern desired, thus allowing the creation and installation of any international <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> pattern such as Dvorak Type II (for German), Svorak (for Swedish) etc.|$|E
50|$|Modern U.S. <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> {{patterns}} {{almost always}} place semicolon and colon {{together on a}} single key, and slash and question mark together on a single key. Thus, if the keycaps of a modern keyboard are rearranged so that the unshifted symbol characters match the classic Dvorak pattern then, sensibly, {{the result is the}} ANSI pattern.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard</b> (DSK) layout, {{also known}} as the American Simplified Keyboard (ASK) layout, is the best-known {{alternative}} to QWERTY. It was named after its inventor, August Dvorak. There are also numerous adaptations for languages other than English, and single-handed variants. Dvorak's original layout had the numerals rearranged, but the present-day layout has them in numerical order. The <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard</b> has numerous properties designed to increase typing speed, decrease errors, and increase comfort. Research has found a modest 4% average advantage to the end user in typing speed. The most prominent property involves concentrating the most used English letters in the home row where the fingers rest, thus having 70% of typing done in the home row (compared to 32% in QWERTY).|$|R
5000|$|The {{combinations}} always {{assume the}} QWERTY keyboard layout; for example, on a <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard,</b> the combination {{to shut the}} system down uses the [...] key instead of [...] Furthermore, some keyboards may not provide a separate [...] key. In this case, a separate [...] key should be present.|$|R
5000|$|AZERTY {{users will}} use the [...] "ZQSD" [...] {{combination}} instead of [...] "WASD", since those are the keys in place of WASD on a QWERTY keyboard. Depending on the configuration, [...] "QAOP" [...] may either still work or be vertically inverted. On the <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard,</b> [...] "WASD" [...] is [...] ",AOE".|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} non {{standard}} Brazilian <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> designs currently in development. The simpler design (also called BRDK) {{is just a}} Dvorak pattern plus some keys from the Brazilian ABNT2 keyboard pattern. Another design, however, was specifically designed for Brazilian Portuguese, {{by means of a}} study that optimized typing statistics, like frequent letters, trigraphs and words.|$|E
50|$|An {{informative}} annex “Allocation guidelines” {{provides a}} basic pattern for arrangements of Latin letters, {{which in fact}} specifies a foundation {{for the kinds of}} keyboard layouts known as QWERTY, QWERTZ, or AZERTY. As this annex is not normative, it does not prevent other arrangements like the <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> or the Turkish F-keyboard being compliant to the ISO/IEC 9995 standard series.|$|E
50|$|The typing loads between hands differs {{for each}} of the {{keyboard}} layouts. On QWERTY keyboards, 56% of the typing strokes are done by the left hand. As the right hand is dominant for the majority of people, the <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboard</b> puts the more often used keys on the right hand side, thereby having 56% of the typing strokes done by the right hand.|$|E
5000|$|Indicative of his varied {{interests}} and expertise, Culkin published many articles and wrote several books. He analyzed how a story might be told in print, film, and television, {{in a book}} called [...] "Trilogy." [...] Other topics for his articles included theology, the Chicago Cubs, Trachtenberg system of math, the <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard,</b> {{and how to make}} the calendar more accurate.|$|R
50|$|Several {{alternatives}} to QWERTY {{have been developed}} over the years, claimed by their designers and users to be more efficient, intuitive, and ergonomic. Nevertheless, none have seen widespread adoption, {{partly due to the}} sheer dominance of available keyboards and training. Although some studies have suggested that some of these may allow for faster typing speeds, many other studies have failed to do so, and many of the studies claiming improved typing speeds were severely methodologically flawed or deliberately biased, such as the studies administered by Dvorak himself before and after World War II. Economists Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis have noted that rigorous studies are inconclusive as to whether they actually offer any real benefits, and some studies on keyboard layout have suggested that, for a skilled typist, layout is largely irrelevant - even randomized and alphabetical keyboards allow for similar typing speeds to QWERTY and <b>Dvorak</b> <b>keyboards,</b> and that switching costs always outweigh the benefits of further training on whichever keyboard you already use.|$|R
25|$|As the letter-keys were {{attached}} to levers that needed to move freely, inventor Christopher Sholes developed the QWERTY layout to {{reduce the likelihood of}} jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the <b>Dvorak</b> Simplified <b>Keyboard</b> are not in widespread use.|$|R
