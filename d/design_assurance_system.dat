40|$|AbstractIn the {{circumstance}} of rapid progress of Chinese aviation industry and ambitious development of aeronautical manufacturing projects, the current airworthiness certification system of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), {{which includes the}} legislation frame, airworthiness regulations and organization chart, is introduced. Now the CAAC airworthiness certification system still faces {{the challenges of the}} industry progress. The vision of CAAC airworthiness certification system and the key elements of the system improvement are discussed. The main concern is how can the industry's resources be used for the airworthiness authority to fully take authority's responsibilities during certification. The traditional way to use industry's resources is implementing delegation system. With delegation system, the authority can directly use industry's resources. Considering that the delegation system depends on the individual decision-making, different behaviors of individuals as a designee and in organization are studied from the viewpoint of the organizational behavior. Requiring design organization to implement the <b>design</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>system</b> (DAS) is selected as another option, and the idea of organization certification is presented. After carefully comparing the advantages and disadvantages between product certification and organization certification, and also between designee system and design organization respectively, the methodology of using designee system and requiring design organization to implement the <b>design</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>system</b> (DAS), as the way of transferring from the solely aviation product certification to the certification of product and organization, is proposed. And the core requirements of DAS are concluded. Following the vision, key elements, and clear development methodology of CAAC airworthiness certification system, detailed actions to achieve the final goal are presented as well...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo assure {{customer}} satisfaction, {{the aerospace}} design organization must establish its own {{quality management system}} to demonstrate that its capabilities to produce, and continually improve, safe, reliable products meet or exceed customer. At the same time, the design organization must establish the <b>design</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>system</b> for obtaining the design organization approval (DOA). Both of these documented systems should be prepared for new design organizations, such as Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC). After presenting these two systems in detail, the relationship between them are analyzed and concluded. This article suggests that the new design organization could optimizer their own structure for making some saving costs during requesting the certifications of DOA and AS 9100...|$|E
40|$|Quality {{assurance}} and accreditation {{in higher}} education are a priority aim in the convergence process to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Although the majority of European universities are working around these issues, there exist diverse tensions between the national legislation, accreditation and quality assurance, both in internal and external contexts.

40|$|In <b>designing</b> high <b>assurance</b> <b>systems,</b> the {{dependability}} {{goals are}} achieved through {{the adoption of}} several fault tolerance techniques. Unfortunately, their combined effect on the system cannot be, in the general case, derived by straightforward composition of the stand-alone component's analysis, because of mutual dependence of their controlling parameters. In this paper the assessment of overall system dependability induced by such integrated fault tolerance organizations is carried out through a stochastic simulation approach. To this purpose, a few fault tolerant multiprocessor architectures, based on the integrated usage of standard error processing structures with a recently proposed diagnostic mechanism, called-count, are selected and evaluated. The diagnostic mechanism gets its input (error signals) from the error processing mechanism, whose behaviour is in turn influenced by the rapidity and correctness with which-count identifies permanently/intermittently faulty processors. The choice of the basic fault tolerance mechanisms to adopt, {{as well as the}} reference system architecture, has been driven by the characteristics of the envisaged target applications: mainly, stringent dependability requirements, to be traded with adequate levels of performance and cost. The analysis has been focused on performability, which is an appropriate measure to evaluate whether a certain design is "better" than another under dependability and performance point of view...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In spite of all advances in computer, technologies, information processing, automation technologies, manufacturing processes, and the push for integration across all functional areas toward a totally integrated and automated manufacturing system, the suggestion is that quality assurance which covers all quality-based functions in the product-life cycle is often overlooked. In spite of {{the important role of}} quality information systems in achieving high quality processes little published research in this area is found in the literature. Study of the available relevant literature and the collection of data from manufacturing industries confirm that different manufacturing situations require different quality <b>assurance</b> <b>systems,</b> and this is evident from the proliferation of differing QA systems found in industry. There are however some common features both universal/or within different classes of industries. Accordingly an 'ISO- 9000 based generic structural model incorporating these common quality based functions and their associated information requirements has been developed. This research further investigates and verifies those factors which may affect the design of a QAIS as a guide for <b>designing</b> Quality <b>Assurance</b> Information <b>Systems</b> for manufacturing business organisations. Realising that knowledge-based systems can provide a support environment for designing QAIS, this research also considers and, develops a KB Decision System for Designing Quality Information Systems (DSDQAIS). The DSDQAIS recommends the structure of a QAIS, {{in the form of an}} IDEFO model, appropriate to specific company profiles input by the user. Since the available software' applications and development tools which support the sub-systems run on a personal computer, the prototype of this system has also been developed and tested on PC.

40|$|It {{should be}} been within the {{interest}} of any university to know and ensure quality in the teaching and assessment of its students. The services offered by universities include; teaching of students, undertaking research and offering community service. These to be attained effectively, universities should institute quality <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> {{in order to ensure}} that they offer quality services to their stakeholders. This paper highlights, the implementation of internal quality <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> in universities in Uganda, and the region as a means of improving the teaching and learning of the students. It has been observed that many universities in Uganda and in the region have not enhanced their quality <b>assurance</b> <b>systems,</b> and thus offering pitiable services to their stakeholders. Research has shown that putting in place functional internal quality <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> is the only way universities can advance and also enhance quality in the services they offer. Some universities in Uganda and in the region have been found to lack the will of advancing and enhancing functional quality <b>assurance</b> <b>systems</b> despite having the means. On the other hand, though some universities have the zeal to implement and operationalize quality <b>assurance</b> <b>systems,</b> they lack adequate resources while quality assurance is attached to a price.
