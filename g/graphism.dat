While it can be claimed that language merely represents a logical development of the vocal signals of the animal world, nothing comparable to the writing and reading of symbols existed before the dawn of homo sapiens.

50|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that <b>graphism</b> {{first appeared in}} the form of tight curves or series of lines engraved in bone or stone. However, there has been no substantial proof to support this hypothesis, with the only comparison being the Australian tjurunga, stone or wood tablets engraved with abstract designs (spirals, straight lines, and clusters of dots) that represented objects of religious significance. The first forms of <b>graphism</b> that allow one to hazardly identify an animal, did not appear until around 30,000 B.C. Prehistoric art records are very numerous, and statistical processing has allowed us to unravel the general meaning of what they represented. The earliest known paintings do not represent a hunt or a family scene, but are graphic building blocks without any associated description. All these early forms therefore suggests that figurative art was directly linked with language and was, in the broadest sense, much closer to writing than to what we understand by a work of art. It was symbolic transposition, not copying of reality, that is to say that <b>graphism</b> did not begin start by reproducing reality in a slavishly photographic manner, but with abstraction.|$|E
40|$|Dijana je na području ilirskih Delmata bila štovana kao jedan od istaknutih protagonista domaće,Silvanove kultne zajednice. O njezinu kultu u tim krajevima svjedoče fi guralni i epigrafski spomenici,kako oni iz priobalja, tako i oni iz kopnenih krajeva, bližeg i daljeg zaleđa. U splitskom Arheloškome muzeju pohranjen je njezin vrlo rustični reljef koji je prikazuje kaosamostalan lik, bez uobičajene pratnje Silvana ili pak nimfa. Prikazana je u niši i u vrlo popularnojikonografskoj interpretaciji Dijane lovkinje; odjevena je u kratki potpasani, gusto naborani hiton,desnicu je usmjerila prema tobolcu obješenom o desno rame te njome pokušava dohvatiti strjelicu,dok u ljevici drži luk koji je u ovom slučaju prikazan izvan prostora niše, na površini okvira kultne slike. Prema podacima iz inventarske knjige splitskog Muzeja reljef potječe iz Bitelića (riječ je o BitelićuGornjem) nedaleko od Sinja. Na temelju oblikovnih i ikonografskih detalja, kao i činjenice da je čitavo cetinsko područje,pa tako i sinjski kraj, jedno od središta kulta božanstava epihorskog podrijetla, poglavito Silvana injemu asociranih božanstava, te uzimajući u obzir epigrafske i poglavito onomastičke elemente - nažrtvenicima posvećenim Dijani koji potječu iz navedenih područja dedikanti su, naime, većinomosobe domaćih korijena - reljef iz Bitelića dovodi se u vezu s autohtonim tradicijama, što dakako neisključuje prisutnost klasične ikonografske komponente koja je na različite načine ugrađena u kultnuostavštinu lokalnog stanovništva. Diana is, {{together}} with the leading Delmatic god Silvanus and his frequent companions nymphs,one of the most loved gods and goddesses of the fairly modest Delmatic pantheon. Her popularityin former Delmatic regions is obvious in rather numerous fi gural images on relief cult scenes thatshow this goddess of hunting and forests, as of other natural phenomena, {{together with}} her pairSlivan, but also on her own, as a separate fi gure. Preserved epigraphic monuments, simple altars,with votive inscriptions also witness that fact. It is very indicative that the inscriptions have thenames {{of the people who}} have dedicated them and for the major part, they belong to the nativeDelmatic inhabitants. Of course, this does not mean that every image of Diana in this region shouldbe connected to the “native” Diana, especially if we consider her Italic provenance, as well as the factthat her character comes from the Greek spiritual tradition and that her connection to Artemis wasproven by the relevant fi nds of the fi gural and epigraphic monuments in our coastal and especiallyisland regions. The most frequent type that can be found in our area of interest - although situation is similarwith the wider Illyric regions, or Dalmatia - is Diana iconographicaly interpreted as a huntress. Aninteresting rustic relief from the Archaeological museum in Split that originates from the Cetinaregion, present-day Bitelić, also belongs to this type (the inventory of the museum in Split statesthat it was found in the hamlet of Panji). Bitelić is also an origin, according to the data from literature,of another fragment of the relief plate that probably shows Diana, which can be deduced from therelief in spite of its fragmentarity. The goddess on relief from Bitelić is shown en face, standing, andis placed within a niche that seems to have a semicircular ending. Her characteristic bell-shapedclothes, short belted hiton, has at its bottom part parallel oblique pleats, while the upper part ofthe dress is smooth, worn-out, almost without any pleats. The head is also worn out so the details ofthe face and hair are vague, so are the shoes, but it seems that she is wearing a short hunting boots. With her right raised arm, Diana is trying to fetch an arrow from the quiver, which can slightly beseen behind her right shoulder; the belt that held the quiver attached to the chest was unfortunatelylost. With her left arm stretched out, Diana is holding the bow that is placed outside the niche, onthe surface of the right edge, or the frame of the cult image. The characteristic of the relief fromBitelić is that it was designed rustically, which can be seen in some oversized details, and especiallyin accentuated <b>graphisms</b> on the drapery. That is why this relief can be compared to the famouscult image from Tilurium that shows Silvanus and nymphs. Among the other analogies coming fromthe Cetina region, iconographically closest to the Bitelić relief is a scene of Diana on relief that wasoriginally carved in a rock close to Aequum, and according to the way the fi gures are presented andthe aforementioned “naive” rusticality, a scene of Silvanus and nymphs from Brnaze near Sinj is verysimilar. Besides the well-known fact that large amount of diff erent monuments carrying names of localorigin come from Cetina region there is also some information in favour of the hypothesis of theauthenticity of the Bitelić relief, which we defi nitely support. The fact is that all the inscriptions onthe preserved altars dedicated to Diana have the names {{of the people who have}} dedicated themof native, Delmatic origin (Panes?, Titus, Madocus). In our opinion, this can hardly be considered acoincidence. All of the aforementioned speaks in favour of the authenticity of the Bitelić relief ofDiana, of her popularity among the Delmatic inhabitants of those times, but it also confi rms thefact about Greek and Italic and so-called “classical” elements that can lead to a conclusion, similarto the one about Silvanus, that this rustic relief is a proof of symbiosis of the indigenous religioussubstratum and the elements taken from the antique cult legacy...|$|R

40|$|Extract] This paper {{explores the}} {{connections}} and disconnections between verbal, written and visual languages in contemporary Australian writing (urban aerosol graffiti). The research recognizes {{the limitations of}} spoken language to express physical, social or political anxieties which prevail in a visually dominant contemporary culture; limitations which for some, are circumvented by visual practice. In writing {{there is more to}} consider than the medium; the material evidence of writing as image reveals that the message is more deeply encoded in the visual; a language few unacculturated to visual practice might understand or articulate. The research examines a medium in which two forms of expression, <b>graphism</b> and language, are seemingly inextricably entwined, yet levels of power are shown to be critical determinants in the dominance of either form. <b>Graphism</b> is shown to draw on primitive survival strategies, the powerless utilizing a ritualized kinetic act of writing to deal with the uncontrollable problems inherent in the immediate urban environment. Writing might be hypothesized as a battle between insiders and outsiders, or a counteraction against unilateral forms of communication (one sided and authoritarian) as exists in books, newspapers and television. Writing might also constitute a reversion to a medieval chirographic culture, the technology of writing a retroaction against typographic print culture which, until recently, was the dominant technology of the Industrial Age. Slayden and Whillock argued that, despite the existence of more means today, less real communication is taking place; discourse has been subsumed by ritualistic and stylistic performances. The communicative acts of writers might be considered in this way. In writing, a confusion of texts, characterizations and iconography from various traditions and styles frequently converge on the walls, for example Wildstyle, bubble, blockbuster and straight text, anime and western cartoon characters, hooded skulls, bubbles, clouds and city backgrounds. Multiple intertexts coalesce in implicit visual and verbal expressions. The key to these diverse acts is to interpret the recontextualized intertexts in the context of visual literacy and the sub-culture that is urban graffiti...|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho propõe uma descodificação do universo musical de Frederic Chopin através da implementação dum sistema imagético – musical aplicado aos seus 24 Prelúdios op. 28. Esta investigação pretende criar e fundamentar uma interpretação nova e bela e, no nosso entender, mais artística e convincente. Pretendemos ainda descodificar o grafismo musical encontrado, relacionando os elementos ponto, linha, plano e cor, elementos que constituem, na visão do pintor Wassily Kandinsky, as bases de qualquer imagem, seja pictórica ou musical, com o universo discursivo e musical imaginado pelo compositor. Utilizando como {{principal}} ferramenta de implementação, a analogia e, em última análise, a transferência sensorial, descobriremos que, atrás do grafismo duma partitura existe um universo que abrange uma simbiose afirmada de conceitos imagéticos e conceitos musicais. Este foi denominado como sendo o Universo Divinatório, uma fonte incansável de recursos imagético – musicais, a qual, através de canais mais ou menos visíveis, direcciona mensagens de natureza invisível e inenarrável, as quais serão codificadas através da escrita gráfico – musical. Neste sentido, o intérprete identificará, na escrita gráfico – musical, elementos gráficos codificadores de momentos temporais e espaciais de tensão criativa e musical, e imagens imagético – musicais que se encontram em perpétua recriação e reformulação. É nosso propósito mostrá-los em concerto através da performance da obra. ABSTRACT: This {{work has}} as primary objective to decode Chopin´s musical cycle known as 24 Prelúdes op. 28. The {{basis of the}} construction is a methodology identified as being related to creation of a process of symbiosis manifested between concepts of imagistic and music. This process will be transposed using musical notation which uses as fundamental elements: the point, the line, the plane, and, on another level, colour. The author was {{able to create a}} relation between Frederic Chopin and Wassily Kandinsky by using as connection the <b>graphism</b> of the scores. Kandinsky created a series of books as “Point and Line to Plane” (1926), that tries to analyze the geometrical elements which and compose any kind of image (pictorial or musical), and others. He describes the cause and effect of their usage and elaborates a series of theories about the subjective effect produced. In order to reach the goal, the author used the 24 Preludes op. 28 of Frederic Chopin as the element of transition between the two worlds of interaction: the imagistic world and the musical world. The paradigm formed creates a new universe which the author denominated as being related to one Universe of Divination. It combines musical and imagistic fractions under the materialization of a symbiosis process. The main tools is used to define the materialization of this Universe is related to the implementation of the Kandinsky´s system of thinking, the <b>graphism,</b> which exists in a visible form in scores. It can translate in a correct way the utilization of motion with different directionality, and the creation of different tensions by combining those motions.

40|$|Tri drvena oltara, dvije ispovjedaonice i sakristijski ormar kapele svetog Franje Ksaverskog okvirno su datirani detaljnom analizom ornamentike i pojedinih dekorativnih motiva. Pronađeni srodni primjeri na području kontinentalne Hrvatske i susjedne Slovenije ukazuju na moguću provenijenciju oltara. The {{church of}} St. Francis Xavier in Rtić, a village near Lukovdol in the Gorski Kotar region, was erected around 1715, {{according}} to Jesuit mission reports. It was furnished {{with a wooden}} polychromed main altar, dedicated to the patron of the church, and side altars of the Holy Guardian Angel and St. Barbara. These were preceded by four illusionistic altars, referred to in a 1725 report as “marble altars”. Next to the triumphal arch, even today there are visible traces of painting from the altars of Virgin and Child and the Holy Guardian Angel. No archival records were found as to the dating and provenance of the main and the side altars, and it remains unclear when the illusionistic altars {{had been replaced by}} wooden ones. This most certainly took place after 1725, and the reasons might be found in the increased popularity of the sanctuary and the necessity for more sumptuous furnishings and a richer iconographic programme, which was probably made possible by plentiful offerings. We attempted to answer the question of at least an approximate dating of the altars and its association to a specific artistic circle or workshop by way of a detailed analysis of the ornamentation, the thus far least studied component of the altar. Literature has associated the wooden altars of the church with the “golden altars” in neighboring Slovenia. The assumption proved to be wrong, as neither the main nor the side altars were decorated with auricular ornaments, typical of the golden altars of {{the second half of the}} 17 th century. All three altars are adorned by an acanthus with a ribbon, an ornament that appeared in altars of continental Croatia around 1715, following the prevalence of the “pure” acanthus ornament and lasting into the 1730 s. At that time, the base of the ribbon and tendril became more often interlocked with motifs from the decorative repertoire of a leaf and strapwork ornament, while the share of acanthus was reduced. This same type of ornament is on the main and the side altars interpreted in different ways. The main altar has the separate elements of the ribbon and the acanthus branch mostly joined together, to the point that impression is given of the acanthus leaves sprouting from the ribbon. A distant model for this type of acanthus can be traced down to the ornamental plates of German printmaker Johann Leonhard Eisler (1697 − 1733), while similar varieties of acanthus motif with a ribbon are also found on the Pauline altars in Remete. What also ties the main altar with the Pauline woodcarving workshop is its architectural structure, with the receding central portion flanked by slanted sides with niches that make the altar reminiscent of the main altar of the Church of St. Nicholas in Jasenovac, also attributed to the Pauline workshop. A comparison for the side altars of the Holy Guardian Angel and St. Barbara can be found in the nearby Vinji Vrh pri Semiču in Slovenia. Here, the main altar of the Holy Trinity Church, by an unknown master, was polychromed and gilded by F. A. Nirenberg of Višnja Gora in 1741, according to an inscription on the predella. Similar ornamental motifs (a series of tassels and acanthus leaves, a motif of a pointed square bordered with acanthus leaves, mirror-symmetrical compositions of acanthus tendrils with stiffly executed leaves and pronounced <b>graphism,</b> as well as tiny volute-scrolled clouds that fill up the upper halves of the niches) tie the side altars in Rtić with the main altar of the Holy Trinity Church in Semič. Also comparable are the sculptures of both altars, with their static postures and schematic execution, which points to the possibility that they were a work of the same, probably local workshop that was active on both sides of the Kupa River. Owing to their shared formal features and the type of decorative motifs, the sacristy cabinet and the two pulpits make up an ensemble that originated prior to the altars, probably around the mid- 17 th century. In addition, the confessional from the Church of the Virgin of Carmel in Moravička Sela is probably the work of the same master (or workshop) ...|$|E

Đuru Griesbacha je na prva radikalnija sažimanja motiva potaknuo dizajnerski zadatak: fotografiranje za reklamne prospekte »Exportdrvo« 1960 -ih godina. Sve jačim sužavanjem izreza sedamdesetih se godina smanjivala razumljivost sadražaja njegovih fotografija, a povećavala mogućnost različitih tumačenja. Eksperimentirajući s tom idejom »u živo« Griesbach je tražio u prirodi motive koji su već sadržavali svoju »tajnu« sliku. Prepoznavao ju je u strukturi kore drveta, u grafizmu krošnji, u raspuklinama kamenja. Time se uključio u svjetski proces traganja za novim oblicima izražavanja. When the {{photographic}} assignment for the Export drvo {{campaign in the}} 1960 s prompted Đuro Griesbach, whose career started in 1927, to rethink photographic design, he arrived at crisp forms, reduced content and a new aesthetics of photography. He accepted the two-dimensional and decorative quality of posters as the measure for photographic <b>graphism.</b> A designer and constructor, technical and design innovator in the 1950 s, Griesbach continued to explore {{in the field of}} photography. Soon abandoning color photography, in the 1970 s Griesbach continued to explore black and white abstract photography as a new creative option, moving from typically Informel optics to laboratory interventions characteristic for his series »Mirages«. Striving for the unreal in photography, Griesbach first shot from unexpected angles and in unusual light to metamorphose the shapes from nature. Later he turned to structure, to the material itself (wood and stone) to achieve a visual effect of structuralism. Finally, he discovered a phantasmagorical world in the phenomenon of symmetry: blending {{the left and the right}} side of the same section of the tree into a symmetrical unit, Griesbach attained fascinating effects, turning a vegetative chaos of nature into strangely regular, human animal and monstrous figures. ln the 1980 s Griesbach actively collaborated with the Ethnographic Museum in Zagreb, which led to a series of official repro-photographs that provided him with an opportunity for a personal »vision«. Griesbach saw photography as a medium of message, education and encouragement. In museum exhibits Griesbach found inspiration for genuine photographic works of art because he was well aware that each object could be photographically transposed into a new, different reality. Even banal subjects can become »eternal« if photographed properly. The first exhibition of Griesbach and Ethnographic Museum in 1984, was »Spindles in Croatia«. In the list of 43 photographs given to Prof. Antun Bauer for his donation to the Vukovar Museum of August 1988 there are photographs of spindies from Lika, Krbava and Dalmatia, with other ethnographic subjects such as pipes from Croatia and Montenegro. The collaboration with the Ethnographic museum and its curator renewed Griesbach 2 ̆ 7 s interest in the national heritage. In 1984 he photographed vernacular architecture of the region below Mount Biokovo, the same motif he used to photograph before the Second World War for the picture postcards produced by his father 2 ̆ 7 s company Griesbach and Knaus. Due to lack of exhibition venues, enthusiastic Griesbach exhibited his 125 photographs 30 x 40 cm laid out on tables covered in green cloth, wrote accompanying texts and later donated the entire series to the Ethnographic Museum in Zagreb. The exhibition in the Matrix Croatiae in Zagreb in 1986 confirmed Griesbach 2 ̆ 7 s personal involvement in the promotion of patriotism and national traditions. ln 1990 Griesbach took part in two exhibitions of the Ethnographic Museum, devoted to hand-made pottery and painted gourds which he found particularly fascinating so that he focused on the details of their ornamentation and enlarged them. The collaboration with the museum continued with exhibitions in 1991 and 1992, where Griesbach showed meticulously executed photographs of Easter eggs from various parts of Croatia. ln 1991 the Ethnographic Museum mounted two solo exhibitions of Đuro Griesbach: »Forgotten Negatives« and »A Walk through the Old Town« that once again draw attention to the intrinsic value of his output. In an interview given at the time, he was asked what is for him photography and where does he draw his strength from. The artist replied: »I am attracted and bewitched by photography. Love for our beautiful homeland, the cultural achievements of our people and our human values fill me with enthusiasm. « After the exhibition »Đuro Griesbach 2 ̆ 7 s Easter« at the Ethnographic museum in 1995, his last exhibition, at the end of 1995, was opened in the Old City Hall in Zagreb with the title »A Walk Through the Zagreb Zoo«. Most exhibited photographs were made during 1995 for the 70 th anniversary of the Zagreb Zoo. This was a symbolic full circle for Đuro Griesbach whose prolific creative career began in 1927 with photographs from the Zagreb Zoo in Maksimir...|$|E
40|$|O trabalho que se apresenta tem por objetivo {{investigar}} a composição gráfica dos livros infantis. O corpus da pesquisa compreende as décadas de 1980 e 1990 e os primeiros anos do século XXI, em Portugal e no Brasil, a partir da seleção dos autores Manuela Bacelar (Portugal) e Roger Mello (Brasil). A escolha do corpus se justifica, pois ambos são, inicialmente, ilustradores para, em seguida, tornarem-se autores com dupla vocação, isto é, produtores de textos verbais e visuais. Além dessa característica, ambos desenvolveram uma produção literária voltada ao público infantil em que impera a diversidade de estratégias e relações entre sistemas semióticos, por exemplo: autores de livros de imagens, autoresilustradores de livros ilustrados e autores de livros-álbum. Essa última modalidade, em que há a integração dos textos verbal e visual, está no centro das discussões. A reflexão sobre o desenvolvimento desse gênero de texto à luz da Semiótica discursiva de linha francesa, a qual também fundamentará todas análises realizadas, compõe o primeiro capítulo deste trabalho de tese. Em seguida, abremse as portas para os livros infantis portugueses e o desenvolvimento do livro-álbum em Portugal, bem como serão realizadas análises minuciosas de três obras de Manuela Bacelar, a saber: O dinossauro (1990), A sereiazinha (1995) e Sebastião (2004). Cada uma das obras será abordada tendo em vista as diferentes relações entre palavra e imagem e a composição final em um projeto gráfico que deveria constituir um todo de sentido. Assim, as obras se diferenciam, pois O dinossauro é um livro-álbum, em que Bacelar é autora de dupla vocação; A sereiazinha é um livro-ilustrado, em que a autora portuguesa ilustra o clássico de Hans Christian Andersen e Sebastião exemplifica aquele gênero, em que, por meio de imagens, a artista plástica conta a história. No terceiro capítulo, o contexto brasileiro é colocado em foco e surge o trabalho em equipe, ou seja, uma equipe de profissionais é formada para criar o objeto-livro, e essa transforma-se em uma característica fundamental para a história do gênero livro-álbum no Brasil. Roger Mello é um autor bastante representativo dessa corrente artística e suas obras eleitas para análise se destacam pela produção em equipe e pela constituição de diferentes relações (ou grau de relações) entre palavra e imagem na composição do projeto gráfico. As seguintes obras serão analisadas com mais atenção: Jardins (2001) e Desertos (2006), texto verbal de Roseana Murray; Fita verde no cabelo: nova velha história (1992), em que Mello ilustra o conto de Guimarães Rosa e Vizinho, vizinha (2002), obra composta por uma equipe formada pelos artistas Mariana Massarani, Graça Lima e Roger Mello, e o último assina como autor do texto verbal. Finalmente, no quarto capítulo, é possível fazer um paralelo entre o contexto do livro-álbum e suas características nos cenários português e brasileiro, chegando a algumas invariantes, como a tendência ao traço pictórico em Portugal e ao grafismo no Brasil. Com isso, a partir de dois contextos particulares, vislumbra-se a importância do livro-álbum como um gênero cada vez mais presente no panorama da Literatura InfantilThe presented dissertation {{intends to}} investigate the graphic composition of childrenś books. The corpus of the research comprises the decades from 1980 to 1990 and {{the first years of}} the 21 st Century, in Portugal and in Brazil, based on the selection of authors Manuela Bacelar (Portugal) and Roger Mello (Brazil). The choice of the corpus is justified because both were illustrators at first and then have become authors with double talent, thatś to say, verbal and visual text producers. Besides this characteristic, both have developed a literary production dedicated to the juvenile public, based on the diversity of strategies and relations among semiotics systems, such as: picture booksáuthors, picture books illustratorauthorsánd album formatted booksáuthors. This last mentioned modality of text, in which there is integration between texts (verbal and visual) is in the center of the discussions and the consideration about its development in light of the French discursive Semiotics, that will also validate every analysis made and constitute the first chapter of this thesis dissertation. Following, the door to Portuguese childrenś books and to the development of album formatted books in such country are opened; also, there will be a detailed analysis of three works by Manuela Bacelar: O dinossauro (1990), A sereiazinha(1995) and Sebastião (2004). Each of the works will be approached considering the different relations between word-image and final composition in a graphic project that should constitute a whole. So, the works differ one from the other, as O dinossauro is a album-book, in which Bacelar is a double talented author; A sereiazinha is an illustrated-book, in which the Portuguese author illustrates the Hans Christian Andersenś classic and Sebastião exemplifies the genre in which, by means of images, the plastic artist tells the history. In the third chapter, the Brazilian context is focused and the teamwork emerges, as in the production of comic books, and becomes a key characteristic to the album-book genreś history in Brazil. Roger Mello is an author quite representative of this ártistic tendencyánd the works chosen to be analyzed stand out by their team production and by their different relations(́or relation degrees) ́ constitution between word and image in the composition of the graphic project. The following works will be analyzed with deeper attention: Jardins (2001) and Desertos (2006) verbal text of Roseana Murray; Fita verde no cabelo: nova velha história (1992), in which Mello ilustrates the tale of Guimarães Rosa and Vizinho, vizinha (2002), a work created by a team composed by the artists: Mariana Massarani, Graça Lima and Roger Mello and, still, the last signs it as its verbal textś author. Finally, in the fourth chapter it is possible to make a comparison between the album-book context and its characteristics in the Portuguese and in the Brazilian scenery, reaching some constants, such as the tendency to the pictorial trace in Portugal and to the <b>graphism</b> in Brazil. Therefore, from the two particular contexts, we can have a notion of the album-book as a genre increasingly present in the Juvenile Literature scen...|$|E
