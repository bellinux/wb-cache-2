5|$|The {{distinctive}} {{sound of}} Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) created {{a blueprint for}} hardcore <b>hip</b> hop during the 1990s and helped return New York City <b>hip</b> hop to national prominence. Its sound also became greatly influential in modern <b>hip</b> hop production, while the group members' explicit, humorous, and free-associative lyrics {{have served as a}} template for many subsequent <b>hip</b> hop records. Serving as a landmark record in the era of <b>hip</b> hop known as the East Coast Renaissance, its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast <b>hip</b> hop artists, including Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.|$|E
5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the <b>hip,</b> damaging it so much that he needed <b>hip</b> replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The <b>hip</b> injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full <b>hip</b> replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E

5|$|<b>HIP</b> 78530 b is {{an object}} that is either a planet or a brown dwarf in the orbit of the star <b>HIP</b> 78530.

The image {{caught the attention of}} the project's science team, so the team followed up on its initial observations. <b>HIP</b> 78530 b orbits a young, hot, bright blue star in the Upper Scorpius association.

5|$|Its {{estimated}} mass is over 23.04 {{times that of}} Jupiter. Additionally, <b>HIP</b> 78530 b orbits its host star at an estimated average distance of 710 AU, which is 710 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun assuming the brown dwarf has a circular orbit. The average distance between dwarf planet Pluto and the Sun is 39.482 AU, meaning that <b>HIP</b> 78530 b orbits its host star nearly eighteen times further than Pluto orbits the Sun. In accordance with the data, <b>HIP</b> 78530 b would complete an orbit approximately every 12,000 years, although the actual orbital motion of <b>HIP</b> 78530 b is most likely smaller than 710 AU, {{but it has not}} been directly observed long enough to know definitively.|$|E
