30|$|In {{the review}} we {{identified}} three topical research areas focused on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sex: (1) <b>dress</b> as cue to sexual information, (2) <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sexual violence, <b>and</b> (3) <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification. Across these three topical areas, {{it is clear}} that dress is used to infer a range of information about sex. Based on our review, the research on <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification is the most recent of the three topical research areas we have defined. That research began after objectification theory was proposed by Fredrickson and Roberts in (1997); whereas the research on dress as a cue to sexual information dates from 1990 and the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> sexual violence dates from 1991 (see Table  1). Furthermore, the research on <b>dress,</b> sex, <b>and</b> objectification is clearer and more focused than research in the other two categories because nearly all of it all relies on objectification theory as a framework, while researchers working in the other two topical areas have relied on a variety of theories or have sometimes not used theory at all. The research on dress as a cue to sexual information is the most varied of the topical trends and overlaps with some of the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> violence. Although unacknowledged in the research, the research on sex, <b>dress,</b> <b>and</b> objectification overlaps with the research on <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> violence because that research has focused on violence in the context of sexually objectifying experiences.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{maintenance of}} extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation into dominant American culture. Establishment of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance {{as an expression}} of cultural group identity allows these variables to be used as measurements of assimilation. ^ The research design was exploratory since research pertaining to <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation was minimal. Survey techniques employed a questionnaire. ^ A cross-cultural sample was 257 female students in university classes, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California, spring semester, 1980. ^ Data gathered includes: <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance; assimilation indices; desire to be assimilated; retention of ethnic identity; and conformity to peer group dress. Data was analyzed by chi-square tests and Spearman rank-order correlations. ^ The conceptual framework was based upon concepts associated with Gordon 2 ̆ 7 s assimilation paradigm: (1) extrinsic traits are quickly lost upon contact with dominant society; (2) extrinsic cultural traits may be retained indefinitely if individuals do not progress beyond first stage of assimilation; (3) once individuals have progressed through structural assimilation evidence of extrinsic cultural traits is completely removed. ^ Research Hypothesis I, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and assimilation was supported. Differences exhibited in assimilation indices of name, residential segregation, citizenship, language, family gatherings, and religion were related to differences in <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance characteristics. Persons with low levels of assimilation wore more ethnic clothing items and fewer items of dominant culture dress when compared to individuals with high levels of assimilation. ^ Research Hypothesis II, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and desire to be assimilated was supported. Individuals desiring assimilation exhibited dress characteristics similar to dominant society. Persons not desiring assimilation retained ethnic dress traits. ^ Research Hypothesis III, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and ethnic identity was supported. Continued identification with ethnic heritage related to maintenance of ethnic dress traits. Ethnic dress was worn on more occasions when there was interaction with ethnic group members. ^ Research Hypothesis IV, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and generation was supported. First and second generation individuals retained ethnic dress traits. As generation changed from first through fourth, items of ethnic culture <b>dress</b> worn decreased <b>and</b> items of dominant culture dress worn increased. ^ Research Hypothesis V, the relationship between <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance and conformity to peer group dress was supported. Retention of ethnically defined dress traits was high when group cohesion between friends, family, and neighbors was strong. Dominant culture dress was worn more by individuals not attached to strong cohesive groups. ^ Conclusions were: (1) Extrinsic traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were not lost quickly upon contact with dominant society. (2) Extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were retained indefinitely by persons remaining unassimilated. (3) Maintenance of other intrinsic and extrinsic cultural traits was related to retention of ethnically specific <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance traits. (4) Extrinsic cultural traits of <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were retained by individuals who had progressed through structural assimilation. (5) Strong group cohesion related to retaining ethnically defined dress traits. Finally, (6) <b>dress</b> <b>and</b> appearance were found to be viable indices for measuring assimilation indicating the extent individuals maintain identity with ethnic heritages. ^ Further study includes: male subjects; hierarchy of clothing items released during assimilation; new <b>dress</b> patterns emerging; <b>and</b> psychological implications of ethnic dress. ...|$|R

25|$|Many {{people with}} {{developmental}} disabilities live in the general community, either with family members, in supervised-group homes or {{in their own homes}} (that they rent or own, living alone or with flatmates). At-home and community supports range from one-to-one assistance from a support worker with identified aspects of daily living (such as budgeting, shopping or paying bills) to full 24-hour support (including assistance with household tasks, such as cooking and cleaning, and personal care such as showering, <b>dressing</b> <b>and</b> the administration of medication). The need for full 24-hour support is usually associated with difficulties recognizing safety issues (such as responding to a fire or using a telephone) or for people with potentially dangerous medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) who are unable to manage their conditions without assistance.|$|E
