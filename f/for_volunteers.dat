They {{were able}} to bring together roughly 8,000 volunteers, mostly from the threatened territories of Pomerania, East Prussia and Silesia. Strachwitz's tactics quickly made news within the Wehrmacht, and even Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief, West as of 11 March 1945, expressed an interest. Strachwitz subsequently had one of his officers transferred to Kesselring's staff.|$|E

5|$|As {{with earlier}} campaigns, {{recruiting}} enough men was a problem. Jefferson {{called for the}} western counties of Virginia to provide militia manpower for Clark's campaign, but county officials protested {{that they could not}} spare the men. Militiamen did not want to set out on a lengthy expedition—they would be gone for six months to a year—while their families and homes were threatened by Lord Cornwallis's army in the east, by Indian raids from the north, and by Loyalists at home. Because of this resistance, Jefferson called <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> rather than ordering the militia to accompany the expedition.|$|E

5|$|During the War of 1812, Governor Shelby called <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> {{to serve}} in the Army of the Northwest. Colonel John Allen raised a regiment, and Madison was {{commissioned}} as his second-in-command. The regiment, known as the 1st Rifle Regiment of Kentucky Volunteers, fought under James Winchester at the Battle of Frenchtown. Winchester was captured by General Henry Procter, but about four hundred men under Madison repelled several charges by the British. Madison's men believed they had won the victory when they observed a white flag {{in the midst of the}} British force, but the flag was being waved by Winchester as an order for Madison's force to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cessation}} of open violence, the city set about forming two new regiments of national guard to expand available forces. The local news recounted on the 24th, that Abbot's engineer corps had re-purposed the armory of the 5th Regiment {{for use as a}} recruiting station, toward the goal of forming the now authorized 8th Regiment, to include a company of artillery. They brought with them from the armory of the 6th, two howitzers, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and 250 muskets. The Governor and Adjutant General put out a call <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> to fill each regiment with 1,000 men. General James Howard was chosen to command the 7th, and General Charles E. Phelps the 8th.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge <b>for</b> <b>volunteers,</b> warning that the job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, Hart's brother Walter {{travelled}} to South Africa {{for service}} with the Fourth Contingent in the Second Boer War. This inspired Hart {{to volunteer for}} the Eighth New Zealand South African Contingent, but his application was declined. However, he, along with another brother, George, successfully enlisted for the Ninth Contingent. The minimum age <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> was 20 and he falsified his age to enlist. By {{the time he reached}} South Africa in April 1902, the war was effectively over. He was discharged in July 1902 with the rank of lance sergeant but travelled to England instead of returning to New Zealand {{with the rest of the}} contingent.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 {{the call}} went out <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> {{from among the}} serving Army {{soldiers}} within certain formations still in Britain, and men of the disbanding Divisional Independent Companies originally raised from Territorial Army Divisions who had seen service in Norway. In November 1940 the new army units were organised into a Special Service Brigade under Brigadier J. C. Haydon, with four Special Service Battalions. By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered for commando training.|$|E
5|$|In September 1914, Lord Kitchener {{announced}} that he was looking <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> and regular NCOs to provide officers for the expanding army. Most of the volunteers came from the middle class, with the largest group from commercial and clerical occupations (27%), followed by teachers and students (18%) and professional men (15%). In March 1915, it was discovered that 12,290 men serving in the ranks had been members of a university or public school Officers' Training Corps (OTC). Most applied for and were granted commissions, while others who did not apply were also commissioned. Direct commissioning largely ceased early in 1916, from then most new officers had served in the ranks first, even if in a unit of potential officers.|$|E

5|$|In early June 1940 {{following}} the lightning {{advance of the}} Germans through France and the subsequent Dunkirk evacuation, the British prime minister, Winston Churchill, realised the need for Britain to maintain some form of offensive action and directed his chief staff officer and military adviser, General Hastings Ismay, to begin organising a force which could conduct raids {{along the coast of}} German-occupied Europe. Shortly after this, even before the concept had been fully developed, the War Office put out a request <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> among the troops in Britain to join a force they would be known as the Commandos. At this stage it was decided to create 12 commando units, each with an establishment of roughly 500 men.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1642, {{both sides}} began to arm. Charles raised an army using the medieval method of {{commission}} of array, and Parliament called <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> for its militia. Following futile negotiations, Charles raised the royal standard in Nottingham on 22 August 1642. At {{the start of}} the First English Civil War, Charles's forces controlled roughly the Midlands, Wales, the West Country and northern England. He set up his court at Oxford. Parliament controlled London, the south-east and East Anglia, as well as the English navy.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Andrew Jackson's plea <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> {{to fight the}} British in the War of 1812, James and Rezin enlisted in the Louisiana militia in late 1814. The Bowie brothers arrived in New Orleans too late {{to participate in the}} fighting. After mustering out of the militia, Bowie settled in Rapides Parish, where he supported himself by sawing planks and lumber and floating them down the bayou for sale. In June 1819, he joined the Long Expedition, an effort to liberate Texas from Spanish rule. The group encountered little resistance and, after capturing Nacogdoches, declared Texas an independent republic. The extent of Bowie's participation is unclear, but he returned to Louisiana before the invasion was repelled by Spanish troops.|$|E

5|$|Krueger {{decided that}} he needed to have his own {{strategic}} reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed the Alamo Scouts as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding. An Alamo Scout Training Center <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> was established on Fergusson Island, not far from Alamo Force's headquarters on Goodenough Island, under the command of Colonel Frederick W. Bradshaw, whom Krueger had first encountered during the Louisiana maneuvers. The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units where they could be used for similar work. By the end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 1861, President Lincoln {{responded to}} the {{surrender}} of the federal fort after the Battle of Fort Sumter by calling for 75,000 volunteers to join the Union army and restore order. Governor Morton telegraphed Lincoln offering 10,000 Hoosier men to defend the country, but the state's initial quota was set at six regiments (a total of 4,683 men) for three months of service. Orders were issued on April 16 to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis a gathering point <b>for</b> <b>volunteers</b> to enlist. On the first day, 500 men were encamped in the city. Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits had signed up {{to fight for the}} Union, nearly three times as many needed to meet the state's initial quota.|$|E
