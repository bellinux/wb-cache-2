50|$|There was no {{restriction}} on body size and doors until 1993, {{when it was}} changed to only allow cars {{with a minimum of}} four doors and no smaller than the EuroNCAP 'Small Family Car' class, although 'Large Family Car' tends to dominate the category. Until 1995, teams were only permitted to fit aerodynamic device that were available through dealers, but that changed when, in 1994 BTCC season, Alfa Romeo entered a 155 with Gabriele Tarquini and Giampiero Simoni as drivers. The car had a front spoiler with a bottom piece that could be unscrewed and moved forward, acting as a splitter, and a rear spoiler with a pair of extensions, giving the car more downforce. When Alfa Romeo won the first five rounds, Ford, supported by Vauxhall, made a complaint to the race stewards. TOCA soon decided the aero devices were illegal and Alfa Romeo were stripped of the points they earned at Snetterton and Silverstone, though this decision was later reversed by appeal. After this point, Alfa were forced to run their spoilers in the retracted position (the position in which the spoilers were fitted on the road going version, the Alfa 155 Silverstone, though the road car was sold with two unfitted spoiler <b>extension</b> <b>brackets).</b> In the mean time, Renault and BMW responded by introducing their own limited edition road cars - to enable them to run with oversized aerodynamic aids. Soon after that, the FIA changed the regulation in all series to allow cars to only use non-production aerodynamic devices with a restricted size. Restrictions varied depending on body type, with Volvo having to revert from the 850 Estate to their four-door saloon model the following season when they found themselves to be disadvantaged by the new rules. In the Italian Supertourismo category, teams entered extended spoilers without complaints.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLarge-scale simulations, e. g. fluid-structure {{interactions}} and aeroacoustics noise generation, require important computing power, visualization systems and high-end storage capacity. Because 3 D multi-physics simulations also run long processes on large datasets, {{an important issue}} is the robustness of the computing systems involved, i. e., the ability to resume the inadvertantly aborted computations. A new approach is presented here to handle application failures. It is based on <b>extensions</b> of <b>bracketing</b> checkpoints usually implemented in database and transactional systems. An assymetric scheme is devised {{to reduce the number}} of checkpoints required to safely restart aborted applications when unexpected failures occur. The tasks are controled by a workflow graph than can be deployed on various distributed platforms and high-performance infrastructures. An automated bracketing process inserts in the workflow graph checkpoints that are placed at critical execution points in the graph. The checkpoints are inserted using a heuristic process based on a evolving set of rules. Preliminary tests show that the number of checkpoints, hence the overhead incurred by the checkpointing mechanism, can be significantly reduced to enhance the application performance while supporting its resilience...|$|R

40|$|We {{classify}} Lie–Poisson brackets {{that are}} formed from Lie algebra extensions. The problem is relevant because many physical systems owe their Hamiltonian structure to such brackets. A classification involves reducing all brackets {{to a set}} of normal forms, and is achieved partially through the use of Lie algebra cohomology. For extensions of order less than five, the number of normal forms is small and they involve no free parameters. We derive a general method of finding Casimir invariants of Lie–Poisson <b>bracket</b> <b>extensions.</b> The Casimir invariants of all low-order brackets are explicitly computed.

We see that the Vassiliev vertex is not just a transversal intersection of Wilson loops, but rather has the structure of Casimir insertion (up to first order of approximation) coming from the difference formula in the functional integral.

40|$|General {{relativity}} {{has previously}} been extended to incorporate degenerate metrics using Ashtekar's hamiltonian formulation of the theory. In this letter, we show that a natural alternative choice {{for the form of}} the hamiltonian constraints leads to a theory which agrees with GR for non-degenerate metrics, but differs in the degenerate sector from Ashtekar's original degenerate <b>extension.</b> The Poisson <b>bracket</b> algebra of the alternative constraints closes in the non-degenerate sector, with structure functions that involve the inverse of the spatial triad. Thus, the algebra does not close in the degenerate sector. We find that it must be supplemented by an infinite number ofsecondary constraints, which are shown to be first class (although their explicit form is not worked out in detail). All of the constraints taken together are implied by, but do not imply, Ashtekar's original form of constraints. Thus, the alternative constraints give rise to a different degenerate extension of GR. In the corresponding quantum theory, the single loop and intersecting loop holonomy states found in the connection representation satisfy all of the constraints. These states are therefore exact (formal) solutions to this alternative degenerate extension of quantum gravity, even though they are not solutions to the usual vector constraint.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents two new systematic feedback {{approaches for}} set point feedback stabilization of drift free systems which employ Lie algebraic techniques. Due to some special features, drift free systems {{are known to}} be difficult to stabilize. For such systems, linearization, and state feedback linearization techniques, fail to be useful. In this dissertation two new feedback approaches the guiding functions approach and the trajectory interception approach are introduced. The importance of these approaches is due to their simplicity {{and the fact that they}} do not require any special transformation techniques. The guiding functions approach delivers piece-wise constant control sequences and relies on the construction of special guiding functions which are not Lyapunov functions. However, a comparison of their values allows to determine a desired direction of system motion and permits to construct a sequence of controls such that the sum of these guiding functions decreases in an average sense. The guiding functions strategy is first analysed with reference to systems which appear in a special rectified form and requires the construction of as many guiding functions as there are control variables. Later, this approach is extended to apply to general drift free systems and usually results in the construction of only a pair of guiding functions. The most important feature of this strategy is that it often leads to dead beat control. For higher order systems, a combined strategy which employs sinusoidal steering in conjunction with the guiding functions approach is also examined. The trajectory interception approach provides a universal method for the construction of time varying stabilizing feedback control for drift free systems. The resulting feedback law is a composition of a standard stabilising feedback control for a Lie <b>bracket</b> <b>extension</b> of the original system and a periodic continuation of a specific solution to an open loop, finite horizon control problem stated in terms of a formal equation on a Lie group. The open loop problem is solved as a trajectory interception problem in logarithmic coordinates of flows. The construction proposed in this approach demonstrates that synthesis of time varying feedback stabilizers for drift free systems can be viewed as a procedure of combining static feedback laws for a Lie <b>bracket</b> <b>extension</b> of the system. This approach is employed to drift free systems which are characterized by both nilpotent and non-nilpotent controllability Lie algebras. The applicability of both approaches is demonstrated on a variety of drift free systems with different algebraic structures: a unicycle, Brockett's system, a front wheel drive car, a rigid spacecraft, a hopping robot in flight phase, an underwater vehicle, a fire truck, a mobile robot with trailer, and a class of wheeled mobile robots.

40|$|This paper studies {{rotational}} virtual knot {{theory and}} its relationship with quantum link invariants. Every quantum link invariant for classical knots and links extends to an invariant of rotational virtual knots and links. The paper sets up the background virtual knot theory, defines rotational virtual knot theory, studies an <b>extension</b> of the <b>bracket</b> polynomial and the Manturov parity bracket for rotationals. We give examples of links that are not detected by the bracket polynomial but are detected by the extended parity bracket. Then the general frameworks for oriented and unoriented quantum invariants are introduced and formulated for rotational virtual links. The paper ends with a section on quantum link invariants in the Hopf algebra framework where {{one can see the}} naturality of using regular homotopy combined with virtual crossings (permutation operators), as they occur significantly in the category associated with a Hopf algebra. We show how this approach via categories and quantum algebras illuminates the structure of invariants that we have already described via state summations. In particular, we show that a certain non-trivial link L has trivial functorial image. This means that this link is not detected by any quantum invariant formulated as outlined in this paper. We show earlier in the paper that the link L is a non-trivial rotational link using the parity bracket. These calculations with the diagrammatic images in quantum algebra show how this category forms a higher level language for understanding rotational virtual knots and links. There are inherent limitations to studying rotational virtual knots by quantum algebra alone.

40|$|The steeply tilted Mount Perkins block, northwestern Arizona, exposes a {{cross section}} of a magmatic system that evolved through the onset of {{regional}} extension. New (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar ages of variably tilted (0 - 90 degrees) volcanic strata <b>bracket</b> <b>extension</b> between 15. 7 and 11. 3 Ma. Preextensional intrusive activity included emplacement of a composite Miocene laccolith and stock, trachydacite dome complex, and east striking rhyolite dikes. Related volcanic activity produced an approximately 18 - 16 Ma stratovolcano, cored by trachydacite domes and flanked by trachydacite-trachyandesite flows, and approximately 16 Ma rhyolite flows. Similar compositions indicate a genetic link between the stratovolcano and granodioritic phase of the laccolith. Magmatic activity synchronous with early regional extension (15. 7 - 14. 5 Ma) generated a thick, felsic volcanic sequence, a swarm of northerly striking subvertical rhyolite dikes, and rhyolite domes. Field relations and compositions indicate that the dike swarm and felsic volcanic sequence are cogenetic. Modes of magma emplacement changed during the onset of extension from subhorizontal sheets, east striking dikes, and stocks to northerly striking, subvertical dike swarms, as the regional stress field shifted from nearly isotropic to decidedly anisotropic with an east-west trending, horizontal least principal stress. Preextensional trachydacitic and preextensional to synextensional rhyolitic magmas were part of an evolving system, which involved the ponding of mantle-derived basaltic magmas and ensuing crustal melting and assimilation at progressively shallower levels. Major extension halted this system by generating abundant pathways to the surface (fractures), which flushed out preexisting crustal melts and hybrid magmas. Remaining silicic melts were quenched by rapid, upper crustal cooling induced by tectonic denudation. These processes facilitated eruption of mafic magmas. Accordingly, silicic magmatism at Mount Perkins ended abruptly during peak extension approximately 14. 5 Ma and gave way to mafic magmatism, which continued until extension ceased.
