2500|$|On 13 June 2013, the U.S. Army {{formally}} cancelled the Individual Carbine competition. [...] The Army said {{none of the}} carbines evaluated during testing met {{the minimum}} scoring requirement needed to continue to {{the next phase of}} the evaluation. [...] Letters were sent to gunmakers involved to inform them that no future contract awards would be made for the soldier evaluation phase. [...] PEO Soldier reported that no competitor demonstrated a significant improvement in weapon reliability to justify buying a new carbine. [...] Weapons tested also had low reliability performance using M855A1 Enhanced Performance Rounds (EPR). [...] Ultimately, the Army decided not to pursue a new carbine because of consideration of operational requirements in the context of available small arms technology, the constrained <b>fiscal</b> <b>environment,</b> and the capability of their current carbines. One reliability requirement that was not reached by the vendors was firing 3,592 mean rounds without malfunctioning. [...] In 1990, the M4 was required to fire 600 mean rounds between stoppages, while the current M4A1 fires 1,691 mean rounds between stoppages using M855A1 ammunition. [...] PEO Soldier said that the new carbine had to be a superior improvement, not a small improvement. [...] The Army has not released how close the competitors came to reaching the mean rounds between stoppages requirement, or how they performed compared to the M4A1. [...] That information is seen as proprietary, and may be up to the manufacturers to release data. [...] Analysis has not yet been done to determine if any exact event cause per vendor led to performance failures.|$|E

40|$|As {{the global}} {{challenges}} posed by chronic, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) run into longer life expectancies and restrictive <b>fiscal</b> <b>environments,</b> public health programs must {{respond to these}} issues. In doing so, health practitioners have framed NCDs as apolitical and largely {{the product of an}} individual’s risk behavior. Consequently, governance strategies embraced by public health to address NCDs emphasize the role of the private sector, including opportunities for patient self-management of illness. The Expert Patients Programme (EPP), an initiative of the U. K. Department of Health, applies to a range of chronic conditions. Via a case analysis of the EPP, this article argues that public health governance of NCDs is increasingly a project of individuals’ self-governance, and that although the techniques of the EPP are constructed as politically neutral, they rather demonstrate a pervasive neoliberal political rationality: in devolving public health responsibilities to the private sector and in constructing the healthy, active participant whose primary aim is to return to an economically productive life...|$|R

40|$|The {{macroeconomic}} picture {{suggests that}} the only viable option for maintaining a given level of public services for transition countries facing revenue volatility or shortfalls is to optimize public spending so that expenditures may be reduced while minimizing disruptions to the provision of government services.

This paper takes a broad look at expenditure policies in the Republic of Kazakhstan in light of these issues, seeking both an overall evaluation and a consideration of options for improvement. Included are discussions of privatization and the changing public role of government, the choice of budget priorities among competing programs, and opportunities for creating a budget atmosphere conducive to proper expenditure management in volatile <b>fiscal</b> <b>environments.</b> The paper proceeds from the perspective of Kazakhstan, but the hope is that the experiences there will offer valuable lessons for other economies in transition.

A major weakness in this literatureis the neglect of voting, the other principal method of preference revelation for local public services. This article seeks to integrate {{the analysis of the}} outcomes of voting and mobility decisions by linking a model of residential property value determination and a public choice model of local public expenditure determination. Capitalization of fiscal differentials is shown to affect voting decisions through the tax price of local services. The interrelationship creates a justification for simultaneous equations estimation of both models. An illustrative empirical analysis is presented in which residential property value and local public expenditure models are estimated with ordinary and two-stage least square techniques. Substantial differences are found between the two techniques supporting the hypothesis that significant interrelationships exist between mobility and voting outcomes in metropolitan areas.;In the last decade. - there have been numerous {{empirical studies}} attempting to verify theTiebout (1956) - bypot hesis that mobility can Provide a mechanism for the efficient provision of local public goo 4,s.

40|$|The list of {{community}} college missions now goes well beyond the core degree granting programs. Activities include developmental education, adult basic education, English as a second language, education and training for individuals facing serious barriers to employment, customized training for specific companies, preparation of students for industry certification exams, non-credit instruction, and small business development. This paper first explains why community colleges continue to pursue an organizational form based on comprehensiveness. We argue that the political and <b>fiscal</b> <b>environments</b> in which the colleges operate provide strong incentives for colleges to expand their activities. While the comprehensive strategy is effective from an organizational point of view, we do not conclude that this approach leads to the best education, or {{that it is in}} the best interest of the students. However, given the environment in which the colleges operate, comprehensiveness makes sense for the institution and calls for organizational simplification will not be successful without changes in incentives structures, or without much more empirical evidence of the disadvantages of complexity. In the second part of this paper, we explore one approach to increasing organizational efficiency: improve coordination and integration of these apparently disparate missions. We conclude that such coordination is extremely difficult to achieve and that political and fiscal incentives militate against it. The costs associated with combining functions appear to outweigh any perceived benefits. We end with recommendations for how colleges and policymakers should think about, and respond to, issues associated with the growing mission diversification at community colleges...|$|R

There is no evidence for the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia and Slovenia, suggesting that fiscal policy was being used for other objectives.

The study was completed in March 2012 and recommended buying a new business jet-based ISR aircraft, such as an Air Force version of the Navy P-8 Poseidon, and the RQ-4B Global Hawk Block 40. However, at a Senate Armed Services Committee meeting on 20 March 2012, the Air Force said it can not afford a new ISR platform. The E-8 is considered viable in the near and medium terms. As of October 2012, a test plane has had a Hewlett-Packard central computer installed, with work to begin on the rest in 2013. Before the AOA started, Northrop Grumman received funds for two batches of new engines. One set of engines has flown on a JSTARS test plane, and the other set is in storage. The Air Force does not plan to replace the engines of the 16-plane fleet due to the <b>fiscal</b> <b>environment.</b> The company wants to replace the aircraft's data link, but the Air Force will not, due to cost and because they can still receive data through satellite links.
