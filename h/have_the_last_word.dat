5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had shown}} the {{potential}} of the Soviet armies to successfully conduct an offensive. This battle can be seen {{as one of the first}} major instances in which the Soviets attempted to preempt a German summer offensive. This later unfolded and grew as Stavka planned and conducted Operation Mars, Operation Uranus and Operation Saturn. Although only two of the three were victories, it still offers concise and telling evidence of the ability of the Soviets to turn the war in their favor. This finalised itself after the Battle of Kursk in July 1943. The Second Battle of Kharkov also had a positive effect on Stalin, who started to trust his commanders and his Chief of Staff more (allowing the latter to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> in naming front commanders for instance). After the great purge in 1937, failing to anticipate the war in 1941, and underestimating German military power in 1942, Stalin finally fully trusted his military.|$|E
500|$|Disraeli {{delivered}} the budget on 3 December 1852, {{and prepared to}} wind up the debate for the government on 16 December—it was customary for the Chancellor to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word.</b> A massive defeat for the government was predicted. Disraeli attacked his opponents individually, {{and then as a}} force, [...] "I face a Coalition... This, too, I know, that England does not love coalitions." [...] His speech of three hours was quickly seen as a parliamentary masterpiece. As MPs prepared to divide, Gladstone rose to his feet and began an angry speech, despite the efforts of Tory MPs to shout him down. The interruptions were fewer, as Gladstone gained control of the House, and in the next two hours painted a picture of Disraeli as frivolous and his budget as subversive. The government was defeated by 19 votes, and Derby resigned four days later. He was replaced by the Peelite Earl of Aberdeen, with Gladstone as his Chancellor. Because of Disraeli's unpopularity among the Peelites, no party reconciliation was possible while he remained Tory leader in the House of Commons.|$|E

2500|$|Twain's {{funeral was}} at the [...] "Old Brick" [...] Presbyterian Church in New York. He is buried in his wife's family plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira, New York. The Langdon family plot {{is marked by a}} 12-foot {{monument}} (two fathoms, or [...] "mark twain") placed there by his surviving daughter Clara. There is also a smaller headstone. He expressed a preference for cremation (for example, in Life on the Mississippi), but he acknowledged that his surviving family would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word.</b>|$|E
2500|$|While Magnolia {{struggled}} {{at the box}} office, it was well-received critically. [...] it has an 84% [...] rating at Rotten Tomatoes, {{based on}} 118 [...] "fresh" [...] reviews out of 141. USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it [...] "the most imperfect of the year's best movies". In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert praised the film, saying: [...] "Magnolia {{is the kind of}} film I instinctively respond to. Leave logic at the door. Do not expect subdued taste and restraint, but instead a kind of operatic ecstasy". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] rating, praising Cruise's performance: [...] "It's with Cruise as Frank T.J. Mackey, a slick televangelist of penis power, that the filmmaker scores his biggest success, as the actor exorcises the uptight fastidiousness of Eyes Wide Shut ... Like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, this cautiously packaged movie star is liberated by risky business". The Independent said that the film was [...] "limitless. And yet some things do feel incomplete, brushed-upon, tangential. Magnolia does not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> on anything. But is superb". Kenneth Turan, in his review for the Los Angeles Times, praised Tom Cruise's performance: [...] "Mackey gives Cruise the chance to cut loose by doing amusing riffs on his charismatic superstar image. It's great fun, expertly written and performed, and all the more enjoyable because the self-parody element is unexpected". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "In the case of Magnolia, I think Mr. Anderson has taken us to the water's edge without plunging in. I admire his ambition and his very eloquent camera movements, but if I may garble something Lenin once said one last time, 'You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs'." ...|$|E

5000|$|The first treaty, {{signed in}} 1970, gave the European Parliament <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>word</b> {{on what is}} known as [...] "non-compulsory expenditure" [...] (compulsory {{spending}} is that resulting from EC treaties (including agriculture) and international agreements; the rest is non-compulsory). The second treaty, signed in 1975, gave Parliament the power to reject the budget as a whole and created the European Court of Auditors.
