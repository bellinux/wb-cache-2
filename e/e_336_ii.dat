Unlike {{any of the}} natural ligands of α 2 β 1 integrin, human echovirus 1 (EV 1) seemed to bind more avidly a ‘closed' than an activated ‘open' form of the α 2 I domain. Furthermore, a mutation <b>E</b> <b>336</b> A in the α 2 subunit, which inactivated α 2 β 1 as a collagen receptor, enhanced α 2 β 1 binding to EV 1. Thus, EV 1 seems to recognize an inactive integrin, and not even the virus binding could trigger the conformational activation of α 2 β 1. This {{was supported by the}} fact that the integrin clustering by EV 1 did not activate the p 38 MAP kinase pathway, a signalling pathway that was shown to be dependent on <b>E</b> <b>336</b> -related conformational changes in α 2 β 1. Furthermore, the mutation <b>E</b> <b>336</b> A did neither prevent EV 1 induced and α 2 β 1 mediated protein kinase C activation nor EV 1 internalization. Thus, in its entry strategy EV 1 seems to rely on the activation of signalling pathways that are dependent on α 2 β 1 clustering, but do not require the conformational regulation of the receptor...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{a number}} of kinetic and spectroscopic studies, the {{chemical}} mechanisms of amine oxidation by flavoenzymes remain widely debated. The mechanisms of by Nmethyltryptophan oxidase (MTOX) and tryptophan 2 -monooxygenase (TMO) were probed {{using a combination of}} pH and primary deuterium, solvent, and 15 N kinetic isotope effects. Slow substrates were chosen for these studies; MTOX was characterized with N-methylglycine and TMO was characterized with L-alanine. Primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects of 7. 2 and 5. 3 were observed for sarcosine oxidation by MTOX and for alanine oxidation by TMO, respectively, independent of the substrate concentration and pH. Monitoring the reduction of flavin spectroscopically revealed no intermediate flavin species with both enzyme-substrate systems. Furthermore, the magnitudes of the 15 N kinetic isotope effects observed with both systems suggest that nitrogen rehybridization and C-H bond cleavage are concerted. These results are consistent with both enzymes utilizing a hydride transfer mechanism for amine oxidation. The role of the iron ligands of tyrosine hydroxylase (TyrH) was also investigated. TyrH contains one iron per monomer, which is held by three conserved amino acid residues, two histidines and a glutamate. As a probe of the plasticity of the metal binding site, each of the metal ligands in TyrH was substituted with glutamine, glutamate, or histidine. The resulting proteins were characterized for metal content, catalytic activity, and dopamine binding. The H <b>336</b> <b>E</b> and H <b>336</b> Q enzymes retain substantial catalytic activity. In contrast, the E 376 Q enzyme retains about 0. 4 % of the wild-type catalytic activity, and the E 376 H enzyme has no significant activity. The H 331 E enzyme oxidizes tetrahydropterin in a tyrosine-independent manner. The position of the charge-transfer absorbance band for the H <b>336</b> <b>E</b> and H <b>336</b> Q enzyme-inhibitor complexes is shifted relative to that of the wild-type enzyme, consistent with the change in the metal ligand.

The experimental units were set in a randomized block design, with four replications. Plants were harvested twice. Emerging leaves, recently expanded lamina and mature lamina were sampled separately at each harvest time. In these three types of tissues the nitrogen concentration was closely related to the nitrogen supply in the solution, whereas the sulphur concentration, N:S ratio and chlorophyll meter (SPAD) readings depended upon the supply of both nitrogen and sulphur. Mature lamina did not relate well to the changing in sulphur supply. To properly assess the nitrogen and sulphur concentrations, N:S ratio and SPAD readings for the Marandu grass, the two recently expanded lamina were the best tissues to indicate the availability of both nitrogen and sulphur in the nutrient solution.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{cavitation}} (damage) has been recently discovered from the Three Gorges turbines, that suggests a complicated inception mechanism involving the boundary-layer K-mode instability triggering cavitation nucleation. As one of the elements, the level of free-stream turbulence increased by wrongly designed guide-plate on the Three Gorges turbines could be a primary concern {{in the sense of}} receptivity and the transient growth of K-mode instability. The investigation focuses on the flow analysis of the on-coming flow influenced by the guide plate in terms of flow structure(s) and turbulence level variation. Firstly, CFD has been performed to obtain the main flow features in the whole turbine passage with more detailed analysis on the free-stream pressure-fluctuations near the lower surface of the guide vanes. The unsteady flow characteristics, especially the pressure fluctuations of low-frequency spectrum have been studied that significantly alternate the turbulence intensities and spectrum in the free-stream flow. The results verify that the addition of the guide-plate increases the free-stream turbulence, particularly contributing to the occurrence of a strongest component of extremely low-frequency pressure-fluctuation (i. <b>e.</b> the 0. <b>336</b> Hz for the case 2 with opening of 16 °). These low-frequency fluctuations readily transmit throughout the entire flow passage of the turbine. An extremely large-scale and united unsteady vortex structure that occupies the whole flow passage of a Francis turbine, has been identified for the first time. That is, a vortex-ring structure triggered by the guide-plate, through the connection of the vortices in the stay-vane and guide-vane channels plus those in the runner channels, further interacts with the helical vortex-rope in the draft tube at part-load conditions (e. g. 16 ° and 30 °), forming such an united giant vortex structure. This extremely large-scale vortex structure is thus responsible for the components of extremely low-frequencies (i. <b>e.,</b> 0. <b>336</b> Hz for 16 °, 0. 15 Hz for 30 °) which have been identified from two part-load conditions. These convincing results have proved how this wrongly designed guide-plate increases the free-stream turbulence by inducing extra unsteadiness with gust-like low-frequency and explained that the flow upstream the cone of draft-tube could affect the cone flow significantly, especially under part-load operation conditions...|$|R

Este trabalho objetivou produzir colorantes naturais de Penicillium purpurogenum DPUA 1275 por cultivo submerso (em frascos agitados e em biorreator) e estudar a extração dos colorantes vermelhos. Para a produção, os estudos iniciais mostraram que 5 discos de micélio, sacarose e extrato de levedura como fontes de carbono e nitrogênio, respectivamente, <b>e</b> <b>336</b> horas de cultivo eram condições adequadas para a produção dos colorantes. Visando à otimização da produção, realizaram-se planejamentos fatoriais, com as variáveis independentes: tempo de cultivo; velocidade de agitação; pH; temperatura; concentração de sacarose e de extrato de levedura. As variáveis-respostas foram produção de colorantes amarelos, laranjas e vermelhos. Dos resultados obtidos, as variáveis mais significativas ao processo foram concentrações de extrato de levedura e de sacarose. A produção dos colorantes vermelhos foi otimizada, alcançando a produção de 2, 97 UA 490 nm, nas condições 48, 90 e 11, 80 g/L de sacarose e extrato de levedura, respectivamente, 30 °C, pH 4, 5 150 rpm <b>e</b> <b>336</b> horas de cultivo. Nos experimentos em biorreator, o melhor resultado foi obtido na frequência de agitação de 500 rpm e na mudança do pH do meio para 8, 0, após 96 horas de bioprocesso. Ademais, avaliou-se a estabilidade dos colorantes vermelhos presentes no meio fermentado em diferentes condições (pH, temperatura, sais, polímeros e tensoativos). Referente a pH e temperatura, os colorantes vermelhos mostraram-se mais estáveis nas condições alcalinas e a 70 °C. Tanto os sais (NaCl e Na 2 SO 4) quanto os polímeros (PEG 1. 000, 6. 000 e 10. 000 g/mol e NaPA 8. 000 g/mol a 5 e 15 %) e os tensoativos (Tween 20, CTAB e SDS) não causaram perda da cor nas condições avaliadas. Estudos de solubilidade e de coeficiente de partição octanol-água mostraram que os colorantes vermelhos apresentam solubilidade superior em solventes polares e característica mais hidrofílica. Nos estudos de extração, as técnicas avaliadas foram Sistemas Poliméricos de Duas Fases Aquosas (SPDFA) formados pelo sistema PEG/NaPA e Colloidal Gas Aphrons (CGA). Pela primeira técnica, os colorantes vermelhos migraram preferencialmente para a fase PEG. Os polímeros PEG 6. 000 g/mol, na presença de NaCl 0, 1 e 0, 5 M, e PEG 10. 000 g/mol, com Na 2 SO 4 0, 5 M, se destacaram dentre as condições analisadas com coeficiente de partição (K) próximo a 13, em ambos os casos, e seletividade de proteínas (SeP) próximas a 3. Para a técnica de CGA, o CTAB proporcionou os melhores resultados, seguido do Tween 20. Porém, o valor de K foi inferior ao obtido com SPDFA, com um máximo de 5 (CTAB 2 mM/pH 9, 0). Os resultados obtidos demonstram um novo produtor de colorantes naturais, as quais têm potencial de aplicação em diversos segmentos industriais. Ademais, os resultados obtidos mostraram a eficiência das técnicas utilizadas para extração dos colorantes vermelhos, com destaque para SPDFA, que apresentou maiores valores de K. There is worldwide {{interest in}} developing research projects involving the production and extraction of natural colorants due to serious safety problems associated with industrial use of synthetic ones. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} production of natural colorants from Penicillium purpurogenum DPUA 1275 by submerged culture (rotatory shaker and bioreactor) besides studying the red colorants extraction. To the production step, initial studies showed that 5 agar mycelial discs, sucrose and yeast extract as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively, and 336 hours of bioprocess promoted the best results. To optimize the colorants production a serie of factorial designs were performed. The independent variables studied were: fermentation time, agitation speed, pH, temperature, sucrose and yeast extract concentration under the responses production of yellow, orange and red colorants. From these results, the most significant variables for the process were sucrose and yeast extract concentration. The red colorants production was optimized achieving 2. 97 UA 490 nm, in the following conditions: 48. 90 and 11. 80 g/L of sucrose and yeast extract, respectively, 30 °C, 4. 5 pH, 150 rev min- 1 and 336 hours of culture. In the experiments performed in bioreactor, the condition that promoted the best results was 500 rpm and pH adjusted for 8. 0 after 96 hours of bioprocess. Furthermore, we evaluated the red colorants stability at different conditions (pH, temperature, salts, polymers and surfactants). Concerning to pH and temperature, the red colorants were more stable under basic conditions and 70 °C; not only the salts (NaCl and Na 2 SO 4) but also the polymers (PEG 1000, 6000 and 10000 g/mol and NaPA 8000 g/mol) and the surfactants (Tween 20, CTAB and SDS) not promoted loss of color upon the conditions evaluated. Studies of red colorants solubility and octanol water coefficient showed that these compounds exhibit a higher solubility in polar solvents and present hydrophilic characteristics. Subsequently, the extraction of red colorant was evaluated through two extraction methods: Polymeric Systems Aqueous Two Phase (ATPS) composed by PEG and NaPA and Colloidal Gas Aphrons (CGA). For the first technique, the red colorant preferentially migrated to the PEG phase. The best results were obtained with PEG 6000 g/mol in the presence of 0. 1 to 0. 5 M NaCl and with PEG 10000 g/mol with 0. 5 M Na 2 SO 4. To both cases the partition coefficient (K) was close to 13 and the Selectivity in terms of proteins (SeP) was close to 3. For the CGA technique, CTAB gave the best results followed by Tween 20. However, the K values were lower than the ones obtained with ATPS with a maximum of 5 in the following condition: CTAB 2 mM/pH 9. 0. For the SeP, the values obtained for both techniques were close. The results above show a new producer of natural colorants which have potential application in various industries. Moreover, the results show the efficiency of the techniques used to extract the red colorants, especially to ATPS that presented higher K values...|$|R

Data from four-point crosses (qa- 1 S mutant 124 x five different qa- 3 mutants in triple mutants qa- 3, qa- 4, qa- 2) indicate the following orientation of the qa- 3 gene within the qa cluster: qa- 1, qa- 3 mutant 336 – 3 – 10 ("left" end) qa- 3 mutant 336 – 3 – 3 ("right" end), qa- 4, qa- 2. Ultraviolet-induced revertants have been obtained from 14 of the qa- 3 mutants. The revertable mutants fall into two major classes: those that revert by changes either at the same site or at a second site within the qa- 3 gene, and those that revert by unlinked suppressor mutations. The intragenic revertants can be further distinguished by quantative and/or qualitative differences in their quinate dehydrogenase activities. Some revertants with activities either equivalent to or less than wild type produce a thermostable enzyme, and others an enzyme which is thermolabile in vitro at 35 °.

40|$|India is {{developing}} at an incredible rate. With development, {{there is an}} alarming increase in the demand for energy. But at the same time, we as a nation, have to economize on our energy costs to focus on human developmental needs. It is an undeniable {{fact that we have}} to strive for energy self-sufficiency to stay relevant in the modern times we live in. In such context, the idea of biomass energy becomes very important and relevant. With its inherent advantages of carbon neutrality and sustainability, biomass energy is the way forward for the nation and the world at large. Biomass energy has the potential and the promise of becoming the prime energy source. Though many forms of bioenergy are in focus of many research and development agencies/organizations, harnessing the biomass energy through combustion is the simplest method. In this project, we attempt to analyse and discuss the feasibility and sustainability of this method. We would have to dwell upon the challenges posed by this method and attempt to quell these in a scientific manner. Abundant land and water resources are the major enabler for adoption of biomass energy, as a principle. But in practice, technical variables such as calorific value, ash content, presence of sulphur, greenhouse gas emissions {{play a significant role in}} the actual adoption of biomass as a major source of energy. To study these, we have chosen wastes of six different agriculture based biomass species such as banana (Musa acuminate), coconut (Cocos nucifera), arecanut (Areca catechu), rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and palm (Borassus flabellifer). The samples were analysed by proximate and ultimate analyses, and further correlation was established through regression analysis. Proximate analysis showed that the coconut has the highest volatile matter content (i. e., 73 wt. %) and banana has the highest fixed carbon content (i. e., 20 wt. %) which indicated higher calorific values. The determination of calorific values validated the former results. Palm exhibited lowest ash content suggesting no ash related problems during combustion. Ultimate analysis performed on some of the selected species showed high carbon and hydrogen contents in the leaves of coconut and arecanut. Out of some selected biomass ashes tested for their fusion temperatures, rice has the lowest initial deformation temperature (i. e., 938 0 C) which is substantially above the boiling temperature, suggesting that all the selected biomass samples can be used safely for combustion in boilers up to a temperature of 800 0 C. The bulk density of rice husk has been found out to be the highest (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>336.</b> 257 kg/m 3), suggesting facilitation of higher amount of rice husk in the boiler and, economical transportation and handling. An attempt has been made to develop empirical formulae statistically using regression analysis to predict gross calorific value using proximate and ultimate analyses data. The land requirements for energy plantation with selected biomass species were computed and found that approximately 4931, 524, 1757, 814, 3043 and 1146 hectares of land for harvesting banana, coconut, arecanut, palm, wheat and rice biomass species for assuring a perpetual supply of electricity at the rate of 5475 MWh per year for a group of 10 - 12 villages consisting of about 2000 households. Further, from the calculations of fuel requirement it was observed that coal requirement can decrease from 4968. 0 to 4289. 1 t/year and 4968 to 4008. 6 t/year with the increase in biomass content from 0 to 15 % in the briquettes of coal with rice husk and coal with palm leaf respectively which suggests that agricultural biomass wastes can be used in co-firing mode for generation of electricity by substituting a portion of coal...|$|R

Twelve Mongrel adult dogs were IM inoculated with 0. 3 mg/Kg of venom and treated two hours after venom inoculation. The dogs were divided into three groups (I, II and III) of four animals each. Group I was treated with specific anti-venom serum diluted in 0. 9 % saline which can neutralize 0. 3 mg/Kg of venom. Group II received flunixin meglumine (1, 1 mg/kg, IM) once a day for five days. Group III was treated with aqueous extract of Curcuma longa (10 %) on the skin at the site of venom inoculation, three times a day, for five days. The results showed a significant decrease (p< 0, 05) in the mean values of erythrocytes, hemoglobin concentration and packed cell volumes in all groups 168 hours after venom inoculation. The leukograms revelead leukocytosis with neutrophilia (p< 0, 05) 24 hours following venom inoculation. The leukograms revelead leukocytosis with neutrophilia (p< 0, 05) 24 hours following venom inoculation. The mean values of band neutrophils were within the normal ranges, but were increased 30 hours after inoculations in group II, and 24 - 168 hours after inoculation in group III. The leukograms revelead leukocytosis with neutrophilia (p< 0, 05) 24 hours following venom inoculation. The mean values of band neutrophils were within the normal ranges, but were increased 30 hours after inoculations in group II, and 24 - 168 hours after inoculation in group III. The numbers of eosinophils dropped significantly (p< 0, 05) in the three groups between six and 168 hours after venom inoculation. Lymphocytes counts were significantly different for groups I and II, 30 hours after venom inoculation, and for groups I and III, 336 hours following venom inoculation. Monocytosis as observed in all groups 336 hours after venom inoculation. The hemograms of dogs envenomed with B. alternatus and treated with specific anti-venom serum, flunixin meglumine and aqueous extract is characterized by anemia and leukocitosis with neutrophilia.
