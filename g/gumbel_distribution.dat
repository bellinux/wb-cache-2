40|$|We {{consider}} a random {{walk on the}} fully-connected lattice with $N$ sites and study the time evolution {{of the number of}} distinct sites $s$ visited by the walker on a subset with $n$ sites. A record value $v$ is obtained for $s$ at a record time $t$ when the walker visits a site of the subset for the first time. The record time $t$ is a partial covering time when $v<n$ and a total covering time when $v=n$. The probability distributions for the number of records $s$, the record value $v$ and the record (covering) time $t$, involving $r$-Stirling numbers, are obtained using generating function techniques. The mean values, variances and skewnesses are deduced from the generating functions. In the scaling limit the probability distributions for $s$ and $v$ lead to the same Gaussian density. The fluctuations of the record time $t$ are also Gaussian at partial covering, when $n-v={\mathrm O}(n) $. They are distributed according to the type-I <b>Gumbel</b> extreme-value <b>distribution</b> at total covering, when $v=n$.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the statistical analysis}} of energy distribution of strong seismic shocks (energy E ≥ 105 J) occurred in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin {{which is one of}} the most seismically active mining areas in the world. In the USCB tremor epicenters do not occur uniformly throughout the whole basin but group in several regions belonging to different structural units and are separated by regions where strong shocks are not observed. The aim of the studies was to determine the modality of the energy distributions and to compare the modal types in regions of the USCB where the shocks epicenters cluster. An analysis was made for shocks with energies equal to or greater than 105 J recorded by Upper Silesian Regional Seismological Network operated by Central Mining Institute (CMI), which took place between 1987 – 2012. The analysis has proven the bimodality of seismic energy distribution in the three of five studied areas of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin. The <b>Gumbel’s</b> <b>distribution</b> II type best fit the experimental energy distribution for almost all studied tectonic units except the main syncline area, where the <b>Gumbel’s</b> <b>distribution</b> I type matched better the low-energy mode.
