40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to innovate}} a new fabric structure, {{which could be}} used as a bed cover based on double <b>honeycomb</b> <b>fabric</b> with self-stitching. The honeycomb air pockets were aimed at facing each other to form closed small air chambers which work to sequester the air. The double fabric increases fabric thickness. Thus, the opportunity to improve thermal comfort could be achieved. A number of samples were produced with different densities and counts of weft yarn. Thermal insulation and water vapour permeability were measured and compared with bed covers produced from reversible weft backed structure. Geometrical properties, abrasion resistance, and air permeability were also measured. The results showed that the innovated structure had higher values of thermal insulation than reversible weft backed structure at certain weft counts and densities...|$|E

Palaeontology, 52 (3), 541 - 559. Desmograptus micronematodes from Thornton quarry, Cook County, Illinois, USA, remarkably {{preserved}} in relief and encased in pyrite, is described. The internal {{details of the}} thecae, and of the stolon system, examined using the SEM, allow {{the reconstruction of the}} growth of a stipe. The stolons and stolonal nodes are formed of a dense crassal fabric, and are surrounded by a loose fabric of three-dimensional fibrils. The nodes have a complex structure of three boxes with proximal and distal nozzles. The base of a bitheca, and the base of each autothecal cup, has a central nozzle surrounded by a unique <b>honeycomb</b> <b>fabric.</b> The ultrastructure of the cortical fibrils, with their clockwise striations, is similar to that in Dendrograptus, and may be universal in the graptolites. The nodes of the stolon system appear identical to those of Acanthograptus and other dendroids, but differ from those of the extant hemichordate Rhabdopleura, which have only a diaphragm, and lack box structures.

40|$|<b>Honeycomb</b> woven <b>fabric</b> is {{a single}} layer of fabric exhibiting {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular shape on both fabric sides due to the combination of periodic straight yarn floats and partial plain weave. In a fabric weave repeat, the triangle shape of increased yarn floats and crossed diagonal woven lines form two inverted pyramidal spaces on the fabric surfaces and a closed internal space. This particular 3 D architecture is bound to influence the fabric transfer and mechanical properties. This study investigated these properties for honeycomb weaves experimentally, including air resistance, thermal conductivity, water absorption and vapor transmission rate, bending rigidity, compressional energy and tensile behavior. The typical two-dimensional plain woven fabrics with the same yarns and density were set as references and elastic yarns were considered as a factor of effect on the fabric properties. The measurements by the Kawabata Evaluation System and Instron machine show that the <b>honeycomb</b> woven <b>fabric</b> has enhanced air permeability and water absorption, as well as lower thermal conductivity {{compared to that of}} the plain woven fabric. Higher bending rigidity, compressional energy and Young’s modulus are also observed for <b>honeycomb</b> <b>fabrics.</b> The mechanical properties are found to be affected significantly by applying the elastic yarns to the <b>honeycomb</b> woven <b>fabrics.</b> Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{ordinary}} loom {{was used to}} weave different sections of 3 D <b>honeycomb</b> <b>fabrics</b> based on the reasonable design of maps and parameters. It could save production cost to {{ordinary loom}} used to weave 3 D fabrics and controllability of fabrics was good. The fabric was used as enhance phase, 307 - 3 polyester resin was used as matrix, and VARTM process was used in making 3 D honey comb basalt fibers woven composites. The composites can overcome the shortcomings such as poor integrity, easy to be cracked, low interlaminar strength and easy to be damaged. This study provides theoretical guidance for 3 D textile composites...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{study the}} {{influence}} of negative oxygen ions fiber content on the released negative oxygen ions concentration of the fabric {{and the effect of}} different organizational structures on wearability of negative oxygen ions fabrics, the blended yarns of modified polyester negative oxygen ions fiber and viscose fiber in different blending ratio were selected, two series of fabrics were manufactured for the experiment. The released amount of negative oxygen ions and wearability of the blended fabrics were tested and analyzed in this paper. The results showed that with the increasing of negative oxygen ions fiber content in fabrics, the released negative oxygen ions concentration had increased. When the blended ratio of negative oxygen ions fiber and viscose fiber in fabric was 50 / 50, the released negative oxygen ions concentration of the fabric reached up to 4810 /cm 3 and was close to that of the field. Wearability of <b>honeycomb</b> weave <b>fabric</b> was best and suitable for home textiles through comprehensive analysis, followed by satin fabric. The conclusion from this research {{can be used as a}} reference to design and develop negative oxygen ions home textiles...|$|R
40|$|Palaeo-desiccated crusts often form {{at the top}} of pre-Holocene shelf sediments during low sea-level stands {{resulting}} in significant changes in the mechanical properties. To assist in understanding these changes and the implications for Quaternary geology, the microfabric of sediment samples from the inner shelf off Hong Kong has been studied using scanning electron microscope techniques incorporating the latest methods of quantitative image analysis. These studies have been supported by petrographic observations and chemical analyses of the pore fluids. Holocene marine sediments usually have a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>fabric</b> while pre-Holocene marine sediments are more compact. In regions of high clay content, the palaco-desiccated crust often possesses large planar voids filled with coarse silt-sized particles. This desiccated crust often contains relics of root traces filled with pyrite showing varying degrees of oxidation. The release of amorphous iron acts as a cementation agent and binds large silt/small sand grains giving a more compact fabric than that in neighbouring regions. Cementation in the pre-Holocene marine deposits creates strengthened open-fabric arrangements which may initially withstand moderate loads. Further evidence of desiccation comes from the presence of halite crystals in the pore fluid which has salt concentrations below that of normal sea water. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd and INQUA.

40|$|Honeycomb {{woven fabric}} is {{considered}} as a single layer fabric produced only using common weaving looms, but it forms a unique three-dimensional (3 D) architecture with inverted pyramidal pits on the fabric surface and repeated tetrahedral-closed space inside the fabric, which is greatly different from the traditional 3 D woven fabrics, such as angle-interlock and orthogonal fabrics, showing good prospect for various applications in fields such as geotextiles, medical textiles, air filter, tower packing and underclothing. This paper proposes an analytical model to characterize the geometrical shape and position of each yarn in a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>fabric</b> unit-cell and {{the volume of the}} internal space. The model {{is based on the assumption}} of fabric thickness in the sum of yarn height and the linear relationship of yarn position and fabric unit-cell dimensions. The model involves geometric parameters, including yarn width, height, spacing, crimp and the number of yarns in a fabric unit-cell. Six honeycomb woven fabrics were manufactured to verify the model. Based on the position and crimp prediction of each yarn node, the architectures of the six fabrics were simulated numerically, which shows close agreement with the observed manufactured fabrics, indicating good accuracy of the geometrical model. A sensitivity study shows that the volume of the internal space decreases with the increase of fabric density, and the application of the elastic yarns to the fabric reduces the volume significantly.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the {{influence}} of factors on the released anion concentration, the factors include the fiber content of negative oxygen ions, warp and weft density, organizational structure and friction time. Fabrics for A and B series were blended with modified polyester negative oxygen ions fiber and viscose fiber in different blending ratio. The released anion concentration were tested and analyzed. From the test results, following conclusions can be gotten. 1) In the same circumstance of other process conditions, with increasing of negative oxygen ions fiber content, the released anion concentration increased; 2) The <b>honeycomb</b> weave <b>fabric</b> B 5 released the highest anion concentration in the other same process conditions, while plain weave fabric B 1 released the least concentration; 3) More negative oxygen ions were produced when the warp and weft density were greater; 4) As the time of friction increased, the released anion concentration of fabric was increased until it reached a stable value; 5) Organizational structure had a great effect on releasing anion concentration through friction between woven fabric of negative oxygen ions and other knitted fabric. When the organization structure had bumpy effect, it was more conducive to release negative oxygen ions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of three different types of resin finishes for improving the dimensional stability of 100 % cotton <b>honeycombed</b> pique knitted <b>fabrics.</b> After application of each resin at five different concentrations, it was found that the fabric shrinkage could be effectively controlled by using a suitable type and concentration of the resin. However, the cellulose crosslinking by the resin resulted in some loss in the fabric bursting strength. In a second set of experiments, three different types of softeners were applied, at three different concentrations, in combination with the optimized type and concentration of the resin. It was found that the loss in fabric bursting strength due to cellulose crosslinking by the resin could be minimised with a suitable type and concentration of softener without any deterioration in the fabric pilling properties...|$|R
