Its {{aim is to}} evaluate the efficacy of RR-enhancing strategies, explore differences in RR between sub-disciplines and geographical regions, provide a critical appraisal of RR <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> research, <b>and</b> offer guidelines for assessing <b>and</b> improving RR <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> research. Data are analysed from 1093 survey-based papers published between 2009 and 2013 in {{a representative sample of}} <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> journals. The results of the study are discussed, and their implications for RR <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> research are provided. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an {{overview}} and evaluation of the “theory/practice” gap <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> research as it has been developed in relation to US <b>and</b> European <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> schools. Design/methodology/approach – The paper combines theoretical and institutional analysis to construct a framework for analyzing the “theory/practice” gap and its wider implications. Findings – The paper suggests that a “dialogical” rather than “linear” model of knowledge production and dissemination is the most analytically and practically useful way of approaching the “theory/practice” gap <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> research. Originality/value – The paper reviews and updates the “theory/practice” gap <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> research <b>and</b> offers a more nuanced and realistic appreciation of how it might be resolved...|$|R

40|$|Visual methodologies {{are slowly}} gaining {{acceptance}} <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> research. However, the term visual methodology is largely perceived {{to reflect the}} production and or analysis of photographs, films, video and corporate visual artefacts (Rose, 2012). Participant produced drawings meanwhile remain ‘unusual’ in <b>management</b> <b>and</b> organisational research (Stiles, 2014). In this chapter we seek to draw together a number of disparate studies {{from a range of}} academic disciplines that have employed, or engaged with, participant-produced drawings as a form of collaborative inquiry. In so doing, we explore why there has been such reluctance <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> to embrace drawing as a legitimate method of research; what drawing has to offer those who study organisations; what processes of drawing research have been developed and finally, what might the future hold for participant-produced drawing <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> research...|$|R
40|$|Ethics is a {{relevant}} value <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> consulting.

Management Consulting on ethics will develop more and more. Law will consider more <b>and</b> more ethics <b>in</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>management</b> consulting. The ethics of corporations influences their workers and behaviour with the customers. It is an evident case of maximum integration between <b>business</b> <b>and</b> individual ethics...|$|R
