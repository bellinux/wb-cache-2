They spend their wedding night at Marge's family's house, sleeping on a couch in the living room, which irritates Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma.|$|E
5|$|He {{was unable}} to reclaim his Test place in 195253 despite making 133 against the touring South Africans and 84 against New South Wales for Queensland before the Tests. Tallon totalled 508 runs at 33.87 for the season and made 33 {{dismissals}} in eight matches, including seven in one fixture against Western Australia, but failed to taste victory in a single Queensland match. His omission angered Queensland fans, who relentlessly heckled the Australians during the First Test against the tourists in Brisbane, making <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mistakes made by Tallon's replacement Gil Langley in particular.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before the}} release of the 2017 film Logan, its {{theatrical}} runtime was extended by several minutes. This was due to the addition of a Deadpool short film playing before Logan in place of a traditional post-credits scene. The short was filmed in December 2016 and serves as a tease for the film Deadpool 2, but is not a trailer for that film. It plays into Deadpool's characteristic humor in several ways, being based on an absurd premise that would not work in a feature film, having fourth wall-breaking references to Logan, making <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character Superman, and featuring a cameo by Stan Lee in one version.|$|E

5|$|The {{succeeding}} year, {{the only}} time since 1851, the school did not hold a commencement. Members of the senior class had decided to make <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> professors in the Green Bag—City College's year book since 1896. When the school board was alerted of the matter, it attempted to censor the edition, passing a resolution requiring the Green Bag to be reviewed by Principal Francis A. Soper. However, the year book had already been printed, and the editors refused to have the edition censored and reprinted. The school board responded by withholding the diplomas of six of {{the editors of the}} Green Bag and the business manager, and by preventing the school from holding a commencement ceremony. One of the boys expelled, Clarence Keating Bowie, {{became a member of the}} school board in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Andrei (Anatoly Solonitsyn), Daniil (Nikolai Grinko) and Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) are {{wandering}} monks and religious icon painters, looking for work. The three represent different creative characters. Andrei is the observer, a humanist who {{searches for the}} good in people and wants to inspire and not frighten. Daniil is withdrawn and resigned, and not as bent on creativity as on self-realization. Kirill lacks talent as a painter, yet still strives to achieve prominence. He is jealous, self-righteous, very intelligent and perceptive. The three have just left the Andronikov Monastery, where they have lived for many years, heading to Moscow. During a heavy rain shower they seek shelter in a barn, {{where a group of}} villagers is being entertained by a jester (Rolan Bykov). The jester, or skomorokh, is a bitterly sarcastic enemy {{of the state and the}} Church, who earns a living with his scathing and obscene social commentary and by making <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boyars. He ridicules the monks as they come in, and after some time Kirill leaves unnoticed. Shortly, a group of soldiers arrive to arrest the skomorokh, whom they take outside, knock unconscious and take away, also smashing his musical instrument. As the rain has stopped the three monks thank the villagers for allowing them to shelter and continue on their way. As they walk on the heavy rain starts again.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack the complexities of cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. The <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E
