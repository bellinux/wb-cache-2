40|$|The central {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show how vertical restraints, which affect intra-brand competition, can and will be used as an effective mechanism for reducing inter-brand competition and increasing producer profits. We show how <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> alter the perceived demand curve, making each producer believe he faces a less elastic demand curve, thereby inducing an increase of the equilibrium price. The use of <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> may increase producers' profits, even if the producers cannot charge franchise fees, and so cannot recapture, from the retailers, the monopoly rents they earn from their exclusive territory: we show that 'double marginalization' effects can be overcome by the strategic effect on producers' competition. We provide a model in which we can clearly specify the full range of feasible contracts between producers and retailers, and show that it is always a dominant strategy for firms to use <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> (so that <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> are used in equilibrium) and that the best situation from the producers' viewpoint may or may not entail franchise fees. In all cases, <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> hurt consumer surplus and reduce total welfare, which yields a different light on vertical restraints from a competition policy perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> {{has long}} been {{controversial}} in the general public, {{the courts and the}} economic literature. This study attempts to address whether <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> are appropriate in a unique setting, the malt beverage industry. In particular the theoretical model shows the use of <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> as a means to correct an information problem that results when a wholesaler 2 ̆ 7 s efforts at one retailer affect sales at second. The second retailer is unwilling to properly compensate the wholesaler for its effort when the other retailer is served by multiple wholesalers. <b>Exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> allow the second retailer to clearly see who is responsible for changes in effort that affect its sales. This theoretical model predicted higher quality and higher prices as a result of using <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories.</b> The model is then tested using store level data collected in 1999 and 2003 on price and quality from Indiana and Illinois. Until January 1, 2002, Indiana banned the use of <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> in the malt beverage industry, while Illinois mandated them at the wholesale level. This allows for two types of tests. The first, a cross state test, using 1999 data, seemed to indicate beer was fresher, the measure of quality, but not more expensive in Illinois. The second test, using 2003 data to compare Indiana across time, there is an indication that <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> has led to higher quality but not higher prices. ^ The data collection allowed for another empirical investigation. Indiana bans the sale of cold beer for off-premise consumption at all licensed outlets except package goods stores. This practice lowers the transactions costs for consumers buying both cold and warm beer. The resulting theoretical prediction and empirical findings using the Indiana data are that cold beer will be more expensive than warm beer, and warm beer at package goods stores will be more expensive than at other outlets. ...|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{restraints}} such as <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> may {{be considered}} {{as an alternative to}} the compensation paid to retailers for taking the risks associated with market shocks. For the first time this approach has been put forward in (Rey and Tirole, 1986). In (Hansen and Motta, 2015) this concept has been further developed, but these authors have come a diametrically opposite result to what Rey & Tirole had reported. The goal of both papers was to compare <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> and retailers’ competition from the point of view of the supplier. In (Rey and Tirole, 1986) the competition was the preferred solution, in (Hansen and Motta, 2015) - the <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories.</b> The explanation of this discrepancy proposed in (Hansen and Motta, 2015) doesn't look convincing enough. The paper proposes a new explanation based on the analysis of the attractiveness of the considered lotteries for the retailers. In (Rey and Tirole, 1986) they were ready to pay for the lottery, but in (Hansen and Motta, 2015) - pretend to get a compensation. Accordingly, in the first case the supplier prefers to allow competition between dealers, in the second - to provide <b>exclusive</b> <b>territories</b> in order to reduce the compensation to be paid to the dealer for participating in the lottery. The paper discusses that the better solution is to consider not the risks associated with market shocks, but the retailers’ risks associated with the so called «cooperative specific investments» (manufacturer can prefer another partner on ex post stage). Trying to support the retailers’ incentives to make cooperative investments, supplier voluntarily redistributes control in favor of retailers...|$|R
