5|$|Although Tingting passed about 400km (250mi) to the {{northeast}} of Guam, torrential rains from a monsoonal feeder band produced record-breaking rainfall. In the span of 24hours, 554.99mm (21.85in) of rain fell on Guam, shattering both the record for highest single day rainfall and the monthly rainfall <b>for</b> <b>June</b> at 80.26mm (3.16in) and 371.09mm (14.61in) respectively. Most of the northern areas of the island received more than 510mm (20in) of rain but the southern areas of Guam reported much lower totals. At Anderson Air Force Base, a total of 287.78mm (11.33in) of rain was recorded over a 30-hour span. Rota recorded much less rainfall than Guam, having 145.28mm (5.72in) during 24hours and a storm total of 221.99mm (8.75in). No rainfall was recorded on both Tinian and Pagan Island {{due to the lack}} of observations. On Saipan, a total of 197.61mm (7.78in) was measured.|$|E
5|$|As {{the figures}} {{given in the}} table above were {{published}} before the turbines had been operational for a full year they are projected rather than recorded figures. Wind speed is not constant, therefore, a wind farm's annual energy production never achieves {{the sum of the}} generator nameplate ratings multiplied by the total hours in a year. The ratio of actual productivity in a year to this theoretical maximum is called the capacity factor. Typical capacity factors are 20–40%, with values at {{the upper end of the}} range achieved on particularly favourable sites. The expected capacity factor for Scout Moor Wind Farm, calculated from the company's projected figures, is 27%. The actual capacity factor calculated from data published by OFGEM <b>for</b> <b>June</b> 2016 to May 2017 was 25.20%.|$|E
