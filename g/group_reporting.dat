2500|$|Likewise, Sydnor {{argued that}} Irving's {{statement}} that all previous Hitler biographies were compromised by their hostility towards der Führer is {{not supported by}} an examination of said biographies. Sydnor remarked that Irving's statement that the Einsatzgruppen were in charge in the death camps {{seems to indicate that}} he was not familiar with the history of the Holocaust as the Einsatzgruppen were in fact mobile death squads who {{had nothing to do with}} the death camps. Moreover, Syndnor noted that Irving falsely claimed that the Einsatzgruppen operating in Poland in 1939 were under the authority of SS General Udo von Woyrsch, when in fact the Einsatzgruppen were divided into two groups, one of which reported to Heydrich and another to Theodor Eicke (General Woyrsch commanded a <b>group</b> <b>reporting</b> to Heydrich). Sydnor commented acidly in light of Irving's claim of Hitler's ignorance of the massacres of Poles that Eicke commanded Einsatzgruppe III and the SS Death's Head Regiment Brandenburg during the Polish campaign from Hitler's headquarters train [...] "Amerika".|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a work-based stress reduction {{training program for}} nursing personnel was assessed. Nurses received training in EMG biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation, or self-relaxation, via daily I-h sessions conducted during their customary working hours for two consecutive work weeks. Progressive muscle relaxation training produced significant within-session decreases in muscle activity levels, whereas biofeedback training produced significant increases in hand temperature, signifying lower autonomic arousal. All three <b>groups</b> <b>reported</b> improvements on measures of trait anxiety after training. At a three-month follow-up, the biofeedback <b>group</b> <b>reported</b> increases {{in the amount of}} work energy and perceived effectiveness of the coping skills when used at work.
