5000|$|According to Eccles {{and colleagues}} {{subjective}} task value {{can be thought}} of the motivation that allows an individual to answer the question [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>This</b> Activity and Why?" [...] Subjective task values can be broken into four subcategories: Attainment Value (Importance for identity or self), Intrinsic Value (Enjoyment or Interest), Utility Value (Usefulness or Relevance), and Cost(loss of time, overly-high effort demands, loss of valued alternatives, or negative psychological experiences such as stress). Traditionally, attainment value and intrinsic value are more highly correlated. What's more, these two constructs tend to be related to intrinsic motivation, interest, and task persistence. Alternatively, utility value has both intrinsic and extrinsic components. and has been related to both intrinsic and extrinsic outcomes such as course performance and interest. Other research shows that utility value has time-dependent characteristics as well. Cost has been relatively neglected in the empirical research; however, the construct has received some attention more recently. Feather combined subjective task values with more universal human values and suggested that the former are just one type of general human motives that help to direct behavior.|$|E

5000|$|Dino De Laurentiis {{bought the}} rights to Barbarella. The comic had {{previously}} been released to a scandal as unlike previous adult oriented comics, it came to prominence after being published by the major Belgian-French publisher Eric Losfield in his own Editions Le Terrain Vague. De Laurentiis connected with France's Marianne Productions and secured a distribution deal in the United States with Paramount. To {{cover the costs of}} the film, De Laurentiis also planned to shoot a less expensive feature, Danger: Diabolik, to help cover the costs. In 1966, Roger Vadim spoke about admiration for comics, specifically Peanuts, stating that he liked [...] "the wild humor and impossible exaggeration of comic strips" [...] and that he wanted to [...] "do something in that style myself in my next film, Barbarella". Vadim saw the film as a chance to [...] "depict a new futuristic morality ... Barbarella has not guilt about her body. I want to make something beautiful out of eroticism." [...] His wife, actress Jane Fonda, noted that Vadim was a fan of science fiction, Vadim commented on the genre, opining that [...] "In science fiction, technology is everything ... The characters are so boring—they have no psychology. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> film as though I had arrived on a strange planet with my camera directly on my shoulder—as though I was a reporter doing a newsreel." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following the {{completion}} of the album, Turner subsequently announced his backing band had named themselves The Sleeping Souls, after a lyric in the track, [...] "I Am Disappeared". Regarding their contributions, Turner noted, [...] "they arrange with me, and there’s a clear distinction. Basically I turn up with songs that are finished {{to the extent that they}} have verses, choruses, middle eights, chord progressions and vocals. I generally have some ideas about what I want people to do. People will suggest a guitar or piano line, but I retain power of veto. It’s a dictatorship, rather than a democracy. To be honest, without getting too precious about this, I pay them to be in my band. I don’t want to be in a band, if I did then I'd do that. This is my project." [...] Turner had previously stated, [...] "I made album with my band, but it feels like more of a solo record than Poetry of the Deed," [...] and further elaborated, [...] "Last time round, I think I was a little excited about having a stable band line-up to take into the studio; also, we worked out all the arrangements in about two weeks of intensive rehearsal. As a result the feel tended towards the rock end of the spectrum and it became a band record - which is fine, but it’s definitely in the side field of what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>This</b> time we were all on tour together pretty much the whole time when I was writing, which meant we had much longer to work on arrangements, plus I was more confident in not using people on some songs, as opposed to just throwing everything on all the time." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1999, {{the band}} entered the studio at Indigo Ranch in Malibu, California with {{producer}} Ross Robinson (At the Drive-In, Korn, Limp Bizkit, Slipknot, among others) {{to record their}} first full-length album titled Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence, which saw release in 2000 through Roadrunner Records. On being signed: [...] "Ross {{showed up at a}} practice," [...] Beck recounts. [...] "We start a song; 5-4-3-2-1. Ross stands up, waving his hands and he's like, 'It's over, it's done. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this,</b> you've got a deal!' The line-up on this record was Palumbo, Beck, Todd Weinstock, Manuel Carrero & Sammy Siegler (who left the band prior to the subsequent tour). Robinson has said of it: [...] "Our goal at the time of that record was to destroy Adidas rock", a self-deprecating reference to the Adidas-sponsored bands (Korn, Limp Bizkit) Robinson had produced and championed as part of the nu-metal movement. The music was aggressive and unrelenting, but also included spacious songs like [...] "When One Eight Becomes Two Zeros", [...] "Her Middle Name is Boom", [...] "Piano" [...] and the epic [...] "Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence", the latter of which deals with Palumbo's problems with Crohn's disease. The music, accompanied with Palumbo's lyrics—which were often bitter and resentful towards particular characters he was discussing—and his singing style in itself—powerful and aggressive guttural screaming along with a melodic touch—created a unique dynamic. Although Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence is often cited as a milestone post-hardcore album, it saw little push from Roadrunner, causing the band to garner an ill-will towards the label. Matters were somewhat worsened when Palumbo started to have bouts with his Crohn's disease on tour, as his aggressive performance style sometimes triggers a relapse, which {{has the potential to be}} fatal. It is alleged that Roadrunner would not allow Palumbo to leave the tour to rest.|$|E
