50|$|The color <b>indicator</b> <b>tube</b> (also {{referred}} to as the Draeger Tube or Stain Tube) is a device many natural gas pipelines use for a quick and rough measurement of moisture. Each tube contains chemicals that react to a specific compound to form a stain or color when passed through the gas. The tubes are used once and discarded. A manufacturer calibrates the tubes, but since the measurement is directly related to exposure time, the flow rate, and the extractive technique, it is susceptible to error. In practice, the error can be as high as 25 percent. The color indicator tubes are well suited for infrequent, rough estimations of moisture in natural gas; for example, if the tube indicates 30 pounds of water, there is a high degree of certainty that it is over 10 pounds.|$|E

With high clinical suspicion for tuberculosis (figures 1 and 2), the aspirated sample was plated on Löwenstein-Jensen me-dium and cultured using the Mycobacteria Growth <b>Indicator</b> <b>Tube</b> 960 automated system (Becton Dickinson). Liquid me-dium systems, such as the Mycobacteria Growth <b>Indicator</b> <b>Tube</b> 960 automated system and the MB Redox tube system (Biotest), are known to expedite the identification of mycobacterial growth [1, 2]. Gene probing of the growth cultured using the Mycobacteria Growth <b>Indicator</b> <b>Tube</b> medium had test results positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, and the final results of the biochemical tests performed on the growth cul-tured using Löwenstein-Jensen medium confirmed M. tuber-culosis as the etiological agent.

This study compared methods of processing potable water samples for the isolation of Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare using spiked sterilized water and tap water decontaminated using 0. 005 % cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). Samples were concentrated by centrifugation or filtration and inoculated onto Middlebrook 7 H 10 and 7 H 11 plates and Lowenstein-Jensen slants and into mycobacterial growth <b>indicator</b> <b>tubes</b> with or without polymyxin, azlocillin, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim, and amphotericin B.

The results suggest that filtration of water for the isolation of mycobacteria is a more sensitive method for concentration than centrifugation. The addition of sodium thiosulfate may not be necessary and may reduce the yield. Middlebrook M 7 H 10 and 7 H 11 were equally sensitive culture media.

The interplay between the oral microbial communities and the immune response could {{play an important role in}} the etiology and pathogenesis of both BS and RAS. Objective: To investigate the salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities in BS and RAS. Methods: Purified microbial DNA isolated from saliva samples (54 BS, 25 healthy controls [HC], and 8 RAS) were examined by the human oral microbe identification microarray. Cultivable salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities from ulcer and non-ulcer sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis. Mycobacterium spp. were detected in saliva and in ulcer and non-ulcer oral mucosal brush biopsies following culture on Lowenstein-Jensen slopes and Mycobacterial Growth <b>Indicator</b> <b>Tubes.</b> Results: There was increased colonization with Rothia denticariosa of the non-ulcer sites of BS and RAS patients (p< 0. 05).

TB (LiPA) assay, and a PCR-based DNA sequencing of the rpoB gene for the rapid identification of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) and other mycobacterial species and for the determination of rifampin (RIF) resistance in MTBC strains. The results were compared to routine culture, identification, and susceptibility testing techniques performed on the same samples. The study results revealed that the DNA AccuProbe assay (on the day of growth positivity) readily identified 95. 7 %, the LiPA assay readily identified 98. 6 %, and rpoB sequencing readily identified 97. 1 % of the 70 MTBC isolates from mycobacterial growth <b>indicator</b> <b>tubes</b> (MGIT). In addition, application of the LiPA for the identification and RIF susceptibility testing of the MTBC in growth-positive MGIT resulted in a turnaround time of less than 2 weeks after specimen receipt. Although DNA sequencing of rpoB required a slightly longer (16 days) turnaround time, this method was capable of identifying several species of nontuberculous mycobacteria in addition to identifying MTBC and determining RIF susceptibility or resistance. The molecular methods were also found to rapidly identify RIF-susceptible and -resistant MTBC {{in two of the}} three mixed mycobacterial cultures weeks earlier than conventional methods. In conclusion, the biomass obtained in MGIT at the time of growth positivity in the 960 system is sufficient for use in all three molecular tests, and this approach can reduce the turnaround time for reporting results...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-tolerant {{bacterial}} persistence prevents treatment shortening in drug-susceptible tuberculosis, and {{accumulation of}} intracellular lipid bodies {{has been proposed}} to identify a persister phenotype of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells. In Malawi, we modeled bacillary elimination rates (BERs) from sputum cultures and calculated the percentage of lipid body-positive acid-fast bacilli (%LB + AFB) on sputum smears. We assessed whether these putative measurements of persistence predict unfavorable outcomes (treatment failure/relapse). METHODS: Adults with pulmonary tuberculosis received standard 6 -month therapy. Sputum samples were collected during the first 8 weeks for serial sputum colony counting (SSCC) on agar and time-to positivity (TTP) measurement in mycobacterial growth <b>indicator</b> <b>tubes.</b> BERs were extracted from nonlinear and linear mixed-effects models, respectively, fitted to these datasets. The %LB + AFB counts were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Patients were followed until 1 year posttreatment. Individual BERs and %LB + AFB counts were related to final outcomes. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients (56 % HIV coinfected) participated, and 15 unfavorable outcomes were reported. These were inversely associated with faster sterilization phase bacillary elimination from the SSCC model (odds ratio [OR], 0. 39; 95 % confidence interval [CI],. 22 -. 70) and a faster BER from the TTP model (OR, 0. 71; 95 % CI,. 55 -. 94). Higher %LB + AFB counts on day 21 - 28 were recorded in patients who suffered unfavorable final outcomes compared with those who achieved stable cure (P =. 008). CONCLUSIONS: Modeling BERs predicts final outcome, and high %LB + AFB counts 3 - 4 weeks into therapy may identify a persister bacterial phenotype. These methods deserve further evaluation as surrogate endpoints for clinical trials. Peer-reviewedPublisher Versio...|$|R

Post-mortem diagnosis may, however, be compromised by lesions caused by other pathogens. In an investigation on its prevalence in slaughter cattle in Kenya, Mycobacterium bovis and dimorphic fungi were inadvertently identified separately or concurrently in tuberculous lesions. Beef carcasses were inspected for lesions in two abattoirs in Nairobi. Tissues with lesions were collected and transported to the laboratory. Smears of lesions were stained by acid-fast procedure and examined microscopically. Lesions were cultured in Löwenstein-Jensen (LJ) and in BBL TM Mycobacterium growth <b>indicator</b> <b>tubes</b> (MGIT) media. Mycobacteria isolates in LJ medium were identified by DNA typing. Smears of BBLTM MGIT cultures were acid-fast stained and examined microscopically. Tissue sections were stained with periodic acid-Schiff reagent before examination. Of the 929 carcasses examined, 176 had granulomatous lesions. Dimorphic fungi were detected as acid-fast negative cells in 58 (32. 9; 33. 5 %) of the lesion smears, either alone (29. 0; 16. 4 %) or concurrently with acid-fast bacilli (29. 0; 16. 4 %).
