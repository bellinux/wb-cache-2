5|$|Although Brubaker {{had been}} {{concerned}} the premise was not commercial {{enough to have}} wide appeal, The <b>Fade</b> <b>Out</b> sold {{better than any of}} the authors' previous collaborations, and early issues went through several printings. The series received positive reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The <b>Fade</b> <b>Out</b> {{very early in}} its publication. However, {{he did not want}} to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected the way he wrote it because he was imagining it in the other medium.|$|E
5|$|In {{the letter}} column of Kill or Be Killed #12 (September 2017), Brubaker {{mentioned}} {{plans for a}} semi-sequel to The <b>Fade</b> <b>Out.</b> He said that if made, the comic book would share the setting {{and some of the}} supporting characters, but the plot would be unrelated.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Fade</b> <b>Out</b> {{is a crime}} comics series {{created by}} writer Ed Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips {{with the help of}} colorist Elizabeth Breitweiser and {{research}} assistant Amy Condit. Twelve issues were published by Image Comics between August 2014 and January 2016. The story has been collected into three trade paperback volumes and a single hardcover collection.|$|E
5|$|At (1:18), the song's main melody is introduced, {{played by}} a guitar, the bass guitar and a glockenspiel, with a chord {{progression}} of E minor, C major seventh, G major, and D major. This is repeated until (3:28), when the guitars <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> into the background, and the drumbeat ends, leaving only the ride cymbal to keep the beat, and the main melody, which is repeated until it gradually fades out, leaving ambient guitar noise.|$|E
5|$|At (4:30), {{the second}} of two prank calls begins, between Martin Bulloch and Colin Hardie, who have a {{conversation}} in which Bulloch plays a joke on Hardie, saying that Aitchison and Braithwaite had a disagreement, causing the former to punch the latter, and leave. Hardie, {{who was in a}} bookmakers {{at the time of the}} call, suggests that Bulloch and Paul Savage continue mixing the song, and says he will try to contact Braithwaite. This ends at (7:04), leaving the sound of ambient guitar noise to <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> and end the song.|$|E

5000|$|Note: The {{ending of}} the album version of [...] "Diamond Sun" [...] is a parody of [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] by The Beatles. Just as the song <b>fades</b> <b>out,</b> the song <b>fades</b> in with only the {{percussion}} beat and <b>fades</b> <b>out</b> again with Alan Frew's voice saying [...] "I buried Paul".|$|R
5|$|In mid-2014, {{having just}} {{finished}} their previous collaboration, Fatale, Brubaker and artist Sean Phillips were deliberating whether their next project {{would be a}} noir period piece or a science fiction tale. Brubaker did not think a noir set in 1940s Hollywood was commercial enough to be accepted through normal channels, but the timing aligned with their five-year exclusive contract with Image Comics. This contract guaranteed that the creators could publish any comic without having to pitch it to the publisher first. The pair announced The <b>Fade</b> <b>Out</b> and their new contract on January 9, 2014, at Image Expo. At the time, no length was given for the series {{because they were not}} sure how many issues were needed to tell the story. Since Fatale had taken twice as long as originally planned, {{they did not want to}} mislead fans or feel pressure to conclude before they were ready. They did know it would be a minimum of 12 issues.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of the ocean at night. It then shows a mansion by the water, in which Buena is seen {{standing}} by a balcony. The following scene shows Range entering the mansion as two men open the doors for her. Buena is shown walking {{in the middle of}} a masquerade ball, in which she captures the attention of a man. The Sugababes are shown on a couch, where Buchanan holds a man's hand; they all then walk down the mansion's staircase. Each group member begins to dance with a man at the ball. Buena walks towards a mirror which depicts a reflection of the Sugababes, while Buchanan drops her white mask which subsequently shatters. Towards the end of the video, they are shown leaving the ball before Buchanan jumps off the balcony and into the water. All three members are shown collectively in the water, which begins to <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> into the sky. The last scene shows the men that were in the mansion walking away.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, the {{university}} was fully accredited to award its first Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT), with the first class entering in fall of 2012. The program is notoriously competitive, with over 400 applications for just 32 seats. This program eventually will <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> the Master's in Physical Therapy by 2015, following standards set by the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education.|$|E
25|$|In , Formula One saw Ferrari and BAR rapidly <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> of sight, as {{the works}} Renault team {{dominated}} {{the early part}} of the season, and Fernando Alonso forged a clear championship lead. In the latter part of the season McLaren were significantly the stronger team, with consistently better results and a win tally of 6 from 7 races. However, their early record of poor reliability had meant that catching Renault in either Drivers' or Constructors' Championships was a tall order.|$|E
25|$|When news broke of {{the death}} of Space Ghost Coast to Coast voice actor and {{animator}} C. Martin Croker, who died on September 18, 2016, the network paid tribute to him by playing the first Coast to Coast episode in his memory that night. They also played a bump in his memory that talked about his work for Adult Swim, and then his name, year of birth, and year of death, with a slow fade in and <b>fade</b> <b>out,</b> like bumps for other deaths. This bump was 30 seconds, while most regular bumps are half of that time.|$|E

25|$|Later {{that same}} day, the College Choir gives a second open-air concert, known as Singing on the River, where they perform madrigals and {{arrangements}} of popular songs from {{a raft of}} punts lit with lanterns or fairy lights on the river. For the finale, John Wilbye's madrigal Draw on, sweet night, the raft is unmoored and punted downstream to give a <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> effect. As a tradition, however, this latter concert dates back only to the mid-1980s, when the College Choir first acquired female members. In the years immediately before this, an annual concert on the river was given by the University Madrigal Society.|$|E
25|$|Building on {{the fitness}} {{he showed the}} {{previous}} year, 2011's pre-season saw Cotchin train with the main group more than ever before. In a profile published in The Age prior to round 1 he cited a previous tendency to <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> late in games due to a low fitness base, but that he believed his first full pre-season {{would allow him to}} correct this. It proved to be the case, with Cotchin showing the strong form {{in the early part of}} the year. Cotchin had his first career game with 30 disposals in a round 4 loss to Collingwood at the MCG. In round 7, he kicked four goals in a match against , his highest tally to date.|$|E
25|$|The chorus {{itself has}} two parts: {{the first part}} is four lines long and uses the chord {{progression}} of D, E minor, A minor, while the second part is two lines long, but repeated twice, and uses G, D, E minor, C. After the second chorus, the song enters a bridge, consisting of just piano and vocals, with a faint synthesised accompaniment. Following {{the end of the}} vocal part, the song moves into a break as a bass guitar enters, leading up to a reprise of the guitar solo, accompanied by a choir who repeat the lyrics of the bridge. The song ends with Smith singing {{the second part of the}} chorus, accompanied by the lead guitar, with an abrupt <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> on the final syllable.|$|E

25|$|After resigning {{from the}} Housing Authority, Wong started to <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> from Hong Kong {{politics}} and {{retired from the}} Executive Council in 2002. Besides, she succeeded Antony Leung as Chairperson of the Education Commission from 2001 to 2007. In January 2001, Wong was employed as a non-executive director to the Cheung Kong Holdings by Li Ka-shing|and her employment aroused public concern. Some public opinions feared she had only {{stepped down from the}} Housing Authority for only seven months and it was inappropriate for her to be employed to a real property corporation. A few legislators also worried that Wong would no longer represent the interest of social workers by having a closer relationship with the business sector. Yet, she responded that she would only received 5,000 HKD annually as director's emoluments from the directorship and she promised to bring the voice of the social work sector into the corporation.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{a strike}} began by local civil servants. He {{was called to}} hold talks with the strikers and {{successfully}} reconciled the dispute. When Queen Elizabeth II visited Hong Kong {{for the first time}} in 1977, in his capacity as the senior unofficial member of the Executive Council, he delivered the welcome speech to the Queen in the City Hall. In March 1979, he accompanied then-governor Sir Murray MacLehose to pay a secret visit to Beijing, where both of them had a meeting with Deng Xiaoping. Knowing that the Communist China insisted on obtaining Hong Kong by 1997 and the British Government intended to give up over the issue of sovereignty, Sir Yuet Keung felt the future of Hong Kong was less assured. After the visit, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE), and retired from the Executive Council in 1980, choosing to <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> from the politics of Hong Kong.|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Image's {{solicitations}} for upcoming comics {{revealed that}} The <b>Fade</b> <b>Out</b> would end with issue twelve, which {{was released on}} January 6, 2016. Like the first issue, it had twice as many pages as a standard comic book. It sold an estimated 16,500 copies and was the 136th-best selling issue of the month. Brubaker has said that The <b>Fade</b> <b>Out</b> was, at the time, his most complex story and that it ended [...] "exactly the way [...] pictured it in the beginning". The creators had already begun work on their next collaboration, Kill or Be Killed, before the final issue of The <b>Fade</b> <b>Out</b> had been published. The series was collected into three trade paperback volumes during publication and one oversized hardcover in October 2016. The articles and essays found in the single issues {{are not included in}} the collections.|$|E
