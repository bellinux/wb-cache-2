5000|$|Manchester {{was a small}} {{provincial town}} in the medieval period, but by 1855 it was a city {{dominated}} by industrial activity, particularly its 95 cotton mills and 1,724 warehouses. It was visited by French historian Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, who scathingly wrote:A sort of black smoke covers the city ... From this <b>foul</b> <b>drain,</b> the greatest stream of human industry flows out to fertilise the world.Manchester became a city in 1853, and the exhibition was financed by the city's increasingly affluent business grandees, who were motivated {{by a desire to}} demonstrate their cultural attainment, and inspired by the Paris International Exhibition in 1855, the Dublin Exhibition in 1853, and the Great Exhibition in 1851; there had been an [...] "Exposition of British Industrial Art in Manchester" [...] in 1845. Unlike these earlier exhibitions, the Manchester exhibition was restricted to works of art: there would be no industrial or trade items on display.|$|E

In India there is a statue of the time of Alexanderthe Great of a cholera vict~m but the flrst appearance of the infection in the British Isles is comparatively recent, only 150 years ago. Cholera was thought to be caused by emanations from <b>foul</b> <b>drains</b> and that spread by contagion did not occur. Consequently it was not understood how it was conveyed from one major town to another which were only connected by roads. The traders who travelled these roads were not considered possible carriers.

50|$|With tired players, Purefoods {{lost to the}} Elasto Painters in Game 1 of the quarterfinals. The {{following}} game, the Giants {{came back}} strong, leading {{by as much as}} 24 points late in the third. Nonetheless, Rain or Shine did not readily gave up, shutting the Giants' offense down and eventually tying the game with 22 seconds to go. Jai Lewis missed the possible go-ahead free throw, giving the Giants a chance to score the winning basket with the shot clock turned off. Chandler drove to the basket, got <b>fouled,</b> and <b>drained</b> two free throws with 1.2 seconds left. Off the timeout, Rob Wainwright missed the jumper and Purefoods tied the series.|$|R

Additional elements may be employed, including metal barriers. The area around the fuel dispensers must have a drainage system. Since fuel sometimes spills on the ground, as little of it as possible should penetrate the soil. Any liquids present on the forecourt will flow into a channel drain before it enters a petrol interceptor which is designed to capture any hydrocarbon pollutants and filter these from rainwater which may then proceed to a <b>foul</b> sewer, stormwater <b>drain</b> or to ground.|$|R
2500|$|If {{clogging}} occurs, it {{is usually}} the result of an attempt to flush unsuitable items, or too much toilet paper. Flushing of large amounts of hair should also be avoided. However, clogging can occur spontaneously due to limescale <b>fouling</b> of the <b>drain</b> pipe, or by overloading the stool capacity of the toilet. Stool capacity varies among toilet designs and is based {{on the size of the}} drainage pipe, the capacity of the water tank, the velocity of a flush, and the method by which the water attempts to vacate the bowl of its contents. The size and consistency of the stool is also a contributing, but hard-to-predict factor.|$|R

6000|$|... --"Of nature;" [...] of {{the order}} and {{constitution}} which God has made for this world we live in, and which if we break them, though God in his mercy so orders the world that punishment comes but seldom even to our worst offences, yet surely do bring punishment sooner or later if broken, in the common course of nature. Yes, my friends, as surely and naturally as drunkenness punishes itself by a shaking hand and a bloated body, so does filth avenge itself by pestilence. Fever and cholera, {{as you would expect}} them to be, are the expression of God's judgment, God's opinion, God's handwriting on the wall against us for our sins of filth and laziness, foul air, <b>foul</b> food, <b>foul</b> <b>drains,</b> <b>foul</b> bedrooms. Where they are, there is cholera. Where they are not, there is none, and will be none, because they who do not break God's laws, God's laws will not break them. Oh! do not think me harsh, my friends; God knows it is no pleasant thing to have to speak bitter and upbraiding words; but when one travels about this noble land of England, and sees what a blessed place it might be, if we would only do God's will, and what a miserable place it is just because we will not do God's will, it is enough to make one's soul boil over with sorrow and indignation; and then when one considers that other men's faults are one's own fault too, that one has been adding to the heap of sins by one's own laziness, cowardice, ignorance, it is enough to break one's heart--to make one cry with St. Paul, [...] "Oh wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?" [...] Ay, my friends, the state of things in England now is enough to drive an earnest man to despair, if one did not know that all our distresses, and this cholera, like the rest, are indeed GOD'S judgments; the judgments and expressed opinions, not of a capricious tyrant, but of a righteous and loving Father, who chastens us just because He loves us, and afflicts us only to teach us His will, which alone is life and happiness. Therefore we may believe that this very cholera is meant to be a blessing; that if we will take the lesson it brings, it will be a blessing to England. God grant that all ranks may take the lesson--that the rich may amend their idleness and neglect, and the poor amend their dirt and stupid ignorance; then our children will have cause to thank God for the cholera, if it teaches us that cleanliness is indeed next to holiness, if it teaches us, rich and poor, to make the workman's home what it ought to be. And believe me, my friends, that day will surely come; and these distresses, sad as they are for the time, are only helping to hasten it--the day when the words of the Hebrew prophets shall be fulfilled, where they speak of a state of comfort and prosperity, and civilisation, such as men had never reached in their time--how the wilderness shall blossom like the rose, and there shall be heaps of corn high on the mountain-tops, and the cities shall be green as grass on the earth, instead of being the smoky, stifling hot-beds of disease which they are now--and how from the city of God streams shall flow for the healing of the nations: strange words, those, and dim; too deep to be explained by any one meaning, or many meanings, such as our small minds can give them; but full of blessed cheering hope. For of whatever they speak, they speak at least of this--of a time when all sorrow and sighing shall be done away, when science and civilisation shall go hand in hand with godliness--when God shall indeed dwell in the hearts of men, and His kingdom shall be fulfilled among them, when [...] "His ways shall be known upon earth at last, and His saving health among all nations"-- of a time when all shall know Him, from the least unto the greatest, and be indeed His children, doing no sin, because they will have given up themselves, their selfishness and cruelty and covetousness, and stupidity and laziness, to be changed and renewed into God's likeness. Then all these distresses and pestilences, which, as I have shown you, come from breaking the will of God, will have passed away like ugly dreams, and all the earth shall be blessed, because all the earth shall at last be fulfilling the words of the Lord's Prayer, and God's will shall be done on earth, even as it is done in heaven. Oh! my friends, have hope. Do you think Christ would have bid us pray for what would never happen? Would He have bid us all to pray that God's will might be done unless He had known surely that God's will would one day be done by men on earth below even as it is done in heaven? ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mosquitoes commute between blood-meal {{hosts and}} water. Thus, {{heterogeneity}} in human biting reflects underlying spatial heterogeneity {{in the distribution}} and suitability of larval habitat as well as inherent differences in the attractiveness, suitability and distribution of blood-meal hosts. One of the possible strategies of malaria control is to identify local vector species and then attack water bodies that contain their larvae. Methods Biting and host seeking, not oviposition, have {{been the focus of}} most previous studies of mosquitoes and malaria transmission. This study presents a mathematical model that incorporates mosquito oviposition behaviour. Results The model demonstrates that oviposition is one potential factor explaining heterogeneous biting and vector distribution in a landscape with a heterogeneous distribution of larval habitat. Adult female mosquitoes tend to aggregate around places where they oviposit, thereby increasing the risk of malaria, regardless of the suitability of the habitat for larval development. Thus, a water body may be unsuitable for adult mosquito emergence, but simultaneously, be a source for human malaria. Conclusion Larval density may be a misleading indicator of a habitat's importance for malaria control. Even if mosquitoes could be lured to oviposit in sprayed larval habitats, this would not necessarily mitigate – and might aggravate – the risk of malaria transmission. Forcing mosquitoes to fly away from humans in search of larval habitat may be a more efficient way {{to reduce the risk of}} malaria than killing larvae. Thus, <b>draining,</b> <b>fouling,</b> or filling standing water where mosquitoes oviposit can be more effective than applying larvicide. </p...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. It was {{published}} in the TRB 2015 Annual Meeting Compendium of Papers DVD [© National Academy of Science]. The definitive version is available from: [URL] road carriageway and pavement sub-surface of many UK highways are drained by Highway Filter Drains (HFD). These are gravel filled trenches fitted with a porous carrier pipe at the base that convey surface and sub-surface water to an outfall. HFD are typically characterized as free draining upon construction however, over time the voids of the granular medium become filled due to the intrusion of fines washed from the adjacent earthworks or pavement surface. The lack of understanding of the deterioration mechanisms and the absence of a structured fouling characterization limit the assessment of operational and residual HFD life to qualitative or subjective estimation of in-service performance. This extends to maintenance procedures that are predominately reactive. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of HFD performance and drainage media condition assessment. It then presents a method of fouling characterization based on assessment of samples from in service <b>drains.</b> Three <b>fouling</b> scales are thus suggested; the percentage <b>drain</b> <b>fouling,</b> the foulant-aggregate ratio and the free voids ratio. In-service HFD are found to be functioning at an acceptable standard with a limited number of localized failures attributed to highly fouled layers at the surface of the trench. It is proposed that a rational evaluation of a HFD section should employ means other than just visual indicators. The fouling assessment is linked to laboratory permeability tests conducted with different levels of filter material fouling. It is found that the extent, spreading and type of fouling are important to determine how the filter aggregate performs...|$|R
60|$|Yes, my friends, it is {{good for}} us to be afflicted, good for us to suffer {{anything}} that will teach us this great truth, that we are our brother's keepers; that we are all one family, and that where one of the members suffers, all the other members suffer with it; and that if one of the members has cause to rejoice, all the others will have cause to rejoice with it. A blessed thing to know, is that--though whether we know it or not, we shall find it true. If we give way to our animal nature, and try to live as the beasts do, each one caring for his own selfish pleasure--still we shall find out that we cannot do it. We shall find out, as those Liverpool people did with the Irish widow, that our fellow-men ARE our brothers--that what hurts them will be sure in some strange indirect way to hurt us. Our brothers here have had the fever, and we have escaped; but we have felt the fruits of it, in our purses--in fear, and anxiety, and distress, and trouble--we have found out that they could not have the fever without our suffering for it, more or less. You see we are one family, we men and women; and our relationship will assert itself in spite of our forgetfulness and our selfishness. How much better to claim our brotherhood with each other, and to act upon it--to live as brothers indeed. That would be to make it a blessing, and not a curse; for as I said before, just because it is in our power to injure each other, therefore it is in our power to help each other. God has bound us together for good and for evil, for better for worse. Oh! let it be henceforward in this parish for better, and not for worse. Oh! every one of you, whether you be rich or poor, farmer or labourer, man or woman, do not be ashamed to own yourselves to be brothers and sisters, members of one family, which as it all fell together in the old Adam, so it has all risen together in the new Adam, Jesus Christ. There is no respect of persons with God. We are all equal in His sight. He knows no difference among men, except the difference which God's Spirit gives, in proportion as a man listens to the teaching of that Spirit--rank in godliness and true manhood. Oh! believe that--believe that because you owe an infinite debt to Christ and to God--His Father and your Father--therefore you owe an infinite debt to your neighbours, members of Christ and children of God just as you are--a debt of love, help, care, which you CAN, pay, just because you are members of one family; for because you are members of one family, for that very reason every good deed you do for a neighbour does not stop with that neighbour, but goes on breeding and spreading, and growing and growing, for aught we know, for ever. Just as each selfish act we do, each bitter word we speak, each foul example we set, may go on spreading from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart, from parent to child, till we may injure generations yet unborn; so each noble and self-sacrificing deed we do, each wise and loving word we speak, each example we set of industry and courage, of faith in God and care for men, may and will spread on from heart to heart, and mouth to mouth, and teach others to do and be the like; till people miles away, who never heard of our names, may have cause to bless us for ever and ever. This is one and only one of the glorious fruits of our being one family. This is one and only one of the reasons which make me say {{that it was a good}} thing mankind was so made that the innocent suffer for the guilty. For just as the innocent are injured by the guilty in this world, even so are the guilty preserved, and converted, and brought back again by the innocent. Just as the sins of the fathers are visited on the children, so is the righteousness of the fathers a blessing to the children; else, says St. Paul, our children would be unclean, but now they are holy. For the promises of God are not only to us, but to our children, even to as many as the Lord our God shall call. And thus each generation, by growing in virtue and wisdom and the knowledge of God, will help forward all the generations which follow it to fuller light and peace and safety; and each parent in trying to live like a Christian man himself, will make it easier for his children to live like Christians after him. And this rule applies even in the things which we are too apt to fancy unimportant--every house kept really clean, every family brought up in habits of neatness and order, every acre of <b>foul</b> land <b>drained,</b> every new improvement in agriculture and manufactures or medicine, is a clear gain to all mankind, a good example set which is sure sooner or later to find followers, perhaps among generations yet unborn, and in countries of which we never heard the name.|$|R
