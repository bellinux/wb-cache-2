Once a week, students present and discuss their articles in class. Students at Universiti Teknologi MARA have found the program extremely beneficial because much new and useful information is disseminated from so many different sources, grammatical features are studied in meaningful contexts and most importantly students are very actively involved in learning. The most useful part of the HLLP has been the "RESPONSE" section which has proved that given the freedom and opportunity students can be motivated to read, think and write excellent responses to ideas or arguments in the text.

The communication was recorded and transcribed word by word. To grasp the phenomenon of quality learning in musikdidaktik, the transcribed text was analysed by means of a phenomenological method.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{ascertain}} how primary school teachers would like to improve their mathematics teaching. The central questions for this research are: In what ways do teachers want to improve their mathematics teaching? How do the teachers justify their statements? What main features can be distinguished out of the teachers answers? Three interviews and seven surveys {{have been used to}} collect information from a total of nine teachers, at one primary school. Teaching pupils from preschool to sixth grade. The results have been analysed, interpreted and discussed using a drama pedagogical perspective, inspired by a <b>holistic</b> approach to <b>learning.</b> In order to investigate connections between drama pedagogic and <b>holistic</b> perspectives on <b>learning</b> in the teachers’ answers, three main characteristics of drama pedagogic usage have been defined: To embody (meaning: to act and/or create); Process (meaning: learning takes time and seeks deep understanding); Play (meaning: joyful activity which involves relatively little supervision by the teacher). The results show that teachers would like to work in more practical ways, where investigative and experimental activities are more commonplace. Although not supported by all responses, a significant majority of respondents expressed belief in working methods, and reasoning about learning, with fundamental connections to a drama pedagogic and <b>holistic</b> perspective on <b>learning.</b> This thesis concludes that the teachers surveyed believe in embodiment actions as a learning medium, and that knowledge can be highlighted by the principles of process.
