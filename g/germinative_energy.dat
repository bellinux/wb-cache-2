The {{influence}} of the two heavy metals (Pb and Cd), in different concentrations, on the seeds germination and roots growing of Allium cepa of the two varieties (yellow onion and red onion), was studied. Sterilized Petri boxes were used; the germination substratum was cotton wool; the seeds were disinfected and wetted in appropriate solutions. For every working variant, 50 seeds of yellow onion and red onion were put in every Petri box. The following variants were used: V 1 – control, distilled water; V 2 – 0. 1 %Pb acetate; V 3 – 0. 4 %Pb acetate; V 4 – 0. 1 %Cd sulphate; and V 5 – 0. 4 %Cd sulfate.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to follow the {{influence}} of the substrate, (single respectively double filter paper), the environment conditions (light, darkness), of the seed’s measure and age, on the beans germination. These aspects were followed because the specialty literature correlates the loss of the germinative capacity with different external and internal factors. Three local varieties: P 1 (Albenghino), P 2 (Cannellini), P 3 (Black Turtle), grown in Maramures County, with undetermined growth and different permeability of the seminal skin, were chosen for the experiment. One hundred seeds of every sort were placed in three replications. The energy and germinative faculty were determined, calculating the average values obtained at the replications. We noted that the P 2 variety had the highest germinative faculty of 83. 33 % on double layer under light conditions, and the germination of 100 % under darkness.

40|$|Malt is {{produced}} by the controlled, but limited germination of barley. To produce good quality malt, the barley employed {{must be able to}} germinate rapidly and synchronously. Dormancy is a seed characteristic that can interfere with the rapid and uniform germination of barley, thereby reducing the resultant malt quality. Various studies have shown that post harvest storage can be used to remove dormancy and enhance barley germination characteristics and malt quality. Because of its complexity, the fundamental basis of dormancy induction, maintenance and termination remain unknown. Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PDH) is the rate limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway and has been associated with dormancy decay and increased seed vigor of a variety of different seeds. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if changes in barley germination vigour were associated with respiration and/or G 6 PDH changes during malting. Commercially grown barley (cv.

Commercially produced malt kernels had higher levels of fermentable sugars and soluble nitrogen than the micromalt despite lower α-amylase, β-amylase and ‘total’ limit dextrinase activity. Differences between the 5 d aerobic micromalt and the 5 d aerobic commercially produced malt are indicative of why micromalting cannot always be used as a model system for what is happening industrially and must be modelled on commercial practice.

The objective {{of the study was}} to develop an optimum brewing procedure for a gluten-free ale-style beer. Four different sorghum hybrids (82 G 63, 83 G 66, RN 315, and X 303) were malted and used in brewing gluten-free ale and evaluated for physical and chemical property differences. The four sorghum hybrids were characterized first as grain and then as malt using proximate analysis, single kernel characterization system (SKCS), amylose, α-amylase, and β-amylase contents. Isolated starch from unmalted and malted samples was evaluated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Malt was evaluated throughout the malting process and percent nitrogen, percent moisture, 72 hr <b>germinative</b> <b>energy,</b> steep out moisture, germination-end, and malting loss were measured. Malted sorghum hybrid samples were milled into grist, and employed in a double mash, double decoction brewing process. Following the brewing process the wort was evaluated for specific gravity, Brix, pH, color and free α-amino nitrogen (FAN). Wort was also analyzed using HPLC for ethanol and glucose content. The fermented beer was analyzed for specific gravity, Brix, pH, alcohol by volume, and color. HPLC was also used to measure ethanol and glucose content. Results of analysis found that a significant difference (p= 0. 05) was found for the DSC data onset temperature, which ranged from 61. 75 to 65. 51, illustrating the difference in starch gelatinization temperature compared to other cereals. A significant difference was found in α-amylase content (p= 0. 05) which ranged from 0. 16 to 058 in unmalted sorghum and 71. 63 to 96. 44 in malted sorghum.

The present study provides new knowledge on the impacts of the FHB pathogen complex on the malting and brewing quality parameters of naturally infected barley. Quantitative real-time PCR and liquid chromatography double mass spectrometry were used to quantify the predominant FHB pathogens and Fusarium mycotoxins, respectively, in commercially grown UK malting barley samples collected between 2007 and 2011. The predominant Fusarium species identified across the years were F. poae, F. tricinctum and F. avenaceum. Microdochium majus was the predominant Microdochium species in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011 whilst Microdochium nivale predominated in 2009. Deoxynivalenol and zearalenone quantified in samples collected between 2007 and 2009 were associated with F. graminearum and F. culmorum, whilst HT- 2 and T- 2, and nivalenol in samples collected between 2010 and 2011 correlated positively with F. langsethiae and F. poae, respectively. Analysis of the regional distribution and yearly variation in samples from 2010 to 2011 showed significant differences in the composition of the FHB species complex. In most regions (Scotland, the South and North of England) the harvest in 2010 had higher concentrations of Fusarium spp. than in 2011, although no significant difference was observed in the Midlands between the two years. Microdochium DNA was significantly higher in 2011 and in the North of England and Scotland compared to the South or Midlands regions. Pathogens of the FHB complex impacted negatively on grain yield and quality parameters. Thousand grain weight of malting barley was affected significantly by M. nivale and M. majus whilst specific weight correlated negatively with F. avenaceum and F. graminearum. To determine the impact of sub-acute infections of the identified Fusarium and Microdochium species on malting and brewing quality of naturally infected samples, selected malting barley cultivars (Optic, Quench and Tipple) were micromalted and subjected to malt and wort analysis of key quality parameters. F. poae and M. nivale decreased <b>germinative</b> <b>energy</b> and increased water sensitivity of barley.

40|$|Phenolics in finger millet (FM) grain, {{including}} tannins, may impact significantly on its antimicrobial properties, functionality and health-promoting potential. Unfortunately, {{the location}} of tannins in the grain is unknown and there is limited information {{on the influence of}} variety on grain phenolic composition and antioxidant activity (AA). The effect of phenolics in FM grain on its malt fungal load and on the functional quality of its food products, including baked goods, is barely known. Twenty two FM grain types of varied visual kernel colour were analysed to determine the influence of grain type on phenolic composition, AA, and tannin localisation in the grain. Condensed tannins, anthocyanins and flavan- 4 -ols were detected. Light coloured grain types had no tannins and had much lower total phenolics (TP) relative to the pigmented types, and types that stained black with the Bleach test had much higher tannin content and much higher AA. The grains that stained black with the Bleach test and had high tannin content (0. 60 to 2. 08 mg catechin eqivalents/ 100 mg, db) had a dark coloured testa layer, indicating that the tannins were located in that layer. The results indicate that occurrence of tannins in FM is a varietal property and the tannins are predominantly responsible for the AA of the grain. <b>Germinative</b> <b>energy</b> (GE), enzymic activity, and total fungal count [TFC], and infection levels of 12 FM grain types of varied phenolic content were measured to determine the impact of phenolics in FM grain on its malt quality. The malt quality of high-phenol FM types was much higher than that of the low-phenol types, with respect to enzymic activity. TFC was negatively correlated with grain total phenolics (TP) and amount of phenolic type (APT) and there were some negative correlations between fungal species infection levels and TP and APT (p< 0. 05). GE and enzymic activity were positively correlated with TP and APT (p< 0. 05) and negatively correlated with TFC (p< 0. 01). The data indicate that phenolics in FM grain impact positively on its malt quality by contributing to its antifungal activity. Cookies in which wheat cake flour was substituted with 15, 35 and 55 % (w/w) of either a non-tannin or a high-tannin FM flour were analysed {{to assess the impact of}} FM phenolics on cookie quality and AA (health-promoting potential). FM-substituted cookies, particularly those with high levels of the high-tannin FM, were inferior to cake flour cookies (control), with respect to spread, texture and integrity and their dark colour decreased their acceptance by a consumer panel. However, the acceptability of cookies containing up to 35 % of either FM type was similar to that of control cookies. Cookies containing the high-tannin FM had antioxidant activities that were similar to or higher than the antioxidant activities of several plant products on the market. Thus, potentially health-promoting cookies can be made by substituting up to approximately 35 % wheat with a high-tannin FM. The study indicates that high-phenol FM grain types have good malt quality, which is partly due to the antifungal activity of their phenolics. Although FM phenolics, particularly tannins, seem to affect cookie quality negatively, they contribute significantly to their health-promoting potential.

40|$|Graduation date: 1954 The Oregon State Cooperative Seed {{laboratory}} uses {{two methods}} for testing {{the quality of}} Douglas-fir seed lots. The first of these is a straight-forward germination test without any pre-treatment of the seed, involving a period of 42 days in the germinator at alternating 20 °C. - 30 °C. temperatures. The second method consists of 14 days pre-chill of the seed on the moistened medium at 5 °C. prior to 28 days germination at the same alternating temperatures. The pre-chill helps to overcome dormancy which may {{be present in the}} lots. Recent work by several investigators has indicated that soaking pre-treatments might also be employed to overcome dormancy in coniferous seed. 	The study was designed to evaluate some of these soaking treatments in relation to the methods at present used by the laboratory. In all cases soaking was followed by pre-chilling; so that a measure of additional effects of the soaking treatment on the dormant seed was obtained. Two studies were made with the normal laboratory testing methods as controls. 	The first consisted of soaking the seed in water at temperatures of 5 °C., 20 °C. and 30 °C. for periods of 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours, prior to pre-chill and germination. 	In the second study soaking temperatures of 5 °C. for 36 hours and 30 °C. for 14 hours were used. The seed was soaked in water and in 0. 2 percent potassium nitrate solution, to determine the merits of the two soaking media. At 5 °C. the effect of light during the soaking was examined together with its effect during pre-chilling on the germination of seed soaked at both temperatures. 	Included in the thesis are the results of a small study designed to determine an effective and reliable method of estimating moisture content in the soaked seed. Consequently moisture content was determined on an over-dry weight basis after heating the soaked seed at 100 °C. for six hours in an air-oven. 	Three seed lots were used in an attempt to obtain results over a wide range of seed quality. As demonstrated by the germination figures, the lots chosen exhibited such a range. Though the lots responded differently to the treatments employed, no over-all increase in germination of the dormant seed present was obtained with any of the treatments. The 30 °C. soaking for the longer periods produced a considerable decline in the germination, germinative capacity and <b>germinative</b> <b>energy</b> of the lots. 	Dormancy was present in two of the three lots, but the number of dormant seeds remained approximately constant over all the treatments. Dormancy was reduced only {{in the case of the}} pre-chilled controls over the controls without pre-chill. The statistical analysis of the germination percentages revealed that temperatures of soaking was the dominant factor affecting germination. The period of soaking, though influencing the moisture content attained, was of little consequence in germination. No responses were obtained with the use of light during soaking and pre-chill, nor with the variation in soaking medium. A convariance analysis of moisture content attained and subsequent germination, indicated the absence of any correlation between the two entities. 	Taken as a whole, soaking procedures are of no advantage over the present germination techniques in use at the Oregon State Laboratory for Douglas-fir tree seed...|$|E
40|$|Antifungal {{compounds}} {{produced by}} Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) metabolites can be natural and reliable alternative for reducing fungal infections pre- and post-harvest with {{a multitude of}} additional advantages for cereal-base products. Toxigenic and spoilage fungi are responsible for numerous diseases and economic losses. This thesis includes {{an overview of the}} impact fungi have on aspects of the cereal food chain. The applicability of LAB in plant protection and cereal industry is discussed in detail. Specific case studies include Fusarium head blight, and the impact of fungi in the malting and baking industry. The impact of Fusarium culmorum infected raw barley on the final malt quality was part of the investigation. In vitro infected barley grains were fully characterized. The study showed that the <b>germinative</b> <b>energy</b> of infected barley grains decreased by 45 % and grains accumulated 199 μg. kg- 1 of deoxynivalenol (DON). Barley grains were subsequently malted and fully characterized. Fungal biomass increased during all stages of malting. Infected malt accumulated 8 -times its DON concentration during malting. Infected malt grains revealed extreme structural changes due to proteolytic, (hemi) -cellulolytic and starch degrading activity of the fungi, this led to increased friability and fragmentation. Infected grains also had higher protease and β-glucanase activities, lower amylase activity, a greater proportion of free amino and soluble nitrogen, and a lower β-glucan content. Malt loss was over 27 % higher in infected malt when compared to the control. The protein compositional changes and respective enzymatic activity of infected barley and respective malt were characterized using a wide range of methods. F. culmorum infected barley grains showed an increase in proteolytic activity and protein extractability. Several metabolic proteins decreased and increased at different rates during infection and malting, showing a complex F. culmorum infection interdependence. In vitro F. culmorum infected malt was used to produce lager beer to investigate changes caused by the fungi during the brewing processes and their effect on beer quality attributes. It was found, that the wort containing infected malt had a lower pH, a higher FAN, higher β-glucan and a 45 % increase in the purging rate, and led to premature yeast flocculation. The beer produced with infected malt (IB) had also a significantly different amino acid profile. IB flavour characterization revealed a higher concentration of esters, fusel alcohols, fatty acids, ketones, and dimethylsulfide, and in particular, acetaldehyde, when compared to the control. IB had a greater proportion of Strecker aldehydes and Maillard products contributing to an increased beer staling character. IB resulted in a 67 % darker colour with a trend to better foam stability. It was also found that 78 % of the accumulated mycotoxin deoxynivalenol in the malt was transferred into beer. A LAB cell-freesupernatant (cfs), produced in wort-base substrate, was investigated for its ability to inhibit Fusarium growth during malting. Wort was a suitable substrate for LAB exhibiting antifungal activity. Lactobacillus amylovorus DSM 19280 inhibited 104 spores. mL- 1 for 7 days, after 120 h of fermentation, while Lactobacillus reuteri R 29 inhibited 105 spores. mL- 1 for 7 days, after 48 h of fermentation. Both LAB cfs had significant different organic acid profiles. Acid-base antifungal compounds were identified and, phenyllactic, hydroxy-phenyllactic, and benzoic acids were present in higher concentrations when compared to the control. A 3 °P wort substrate inoculated With L. reuteri R 29 (cfs) was applied in malting and successfully inhibited Fusarium growth by 23 %, and mycotoxin DON by 80 %. Malt attributes resulted in highly modified grains, lower pH, higher colouration, and higher extract yield. The implementation of selected LAB producing antifungal compounds can be used successfully in the malting process to reduce mould growth and mycotoxin production...|$|E
