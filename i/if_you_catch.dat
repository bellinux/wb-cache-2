25|$|An {{interesting}} {{consequence of}} the difference between these two distributions is that you will get more of the heavy fish, on average, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> n fish one by one than <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> all n at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wretch {{that you}} are! And {{do not be}} jealous <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> me making love to Lady Brandon. I always do so; she expects it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Tartar if you like, it's {{much the}} same <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> him. And it winds up with a girl--which is not surprisin'--who is to be expectorated--" ...|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>catch</b> little fish, <b>you</b> {{can stay}} in the shallow water. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to <b>catch</b> the big fish, you've got to go deeper.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll 'mortify' <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> I <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> showing {{yourself}} to the Millwards like that, my girl! Go right home and dress yourself decently--or eat your supper in the kitchen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You rascal! I'll hang <b>you</b> <b>if</b> I <b>catch</b> <b>you</b> here again. Go home {{quicker than}} you came, {{and tell your}} {{mistress}} to teach <b>you</b> better manners, <b>if</b> she values your life." ...|$|R
60|$|LADY. Make him {{promise that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> my brother he will {{consider}} {{that you have}} cleared your character as a soldier. He will promise anything you ask on that condition.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} do, you knave?" [...] said William. [...] "Hence, go, fly, I give you leave {{to do all}} you can; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> me, I ask nothing in return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't believe me! Well, {{go and see}} for yourself. They are at Robles NOW. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> {{the early}} morning stage at Santa Clara you will come upon them before they disperse. Dare you try it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Don’t do it, Phil. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>catch</b> them, call {{an officer}} and have them locked up. A {{thrashing}} is wasted on such rascals.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't want it back, my lad. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> any proofs {{that will}} help clear your father, I shall be more than satisfied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was only}} wondering," [...] said Mary, [...] "because there's {{a very good}} train at 3.27, {{and it would be}} nice <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>catch</b> it, wouldn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Here {{comes the}} train—we don’t {{want to miss}} it,” cried the money-lender’s son, and he showed that {{he was glad to}} close the interview. “Remember, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> those fellows, I’ll testify against ’em!” he called over his {{shoulder}} as he pushed through the doorway.|$|E
60|$|HYPATIA. Dropped {{down from}} the sky. Dont {{you know that you}} must always go on like this when you get the chance? You must come {{to the top of the}} hill and chase me through the bracken. You may kiss me <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> a {{whiff of}} violets from the {{darkness}} of [...] the shadow of man it will be spring in the world, it will be spring {{in the world of}} the living; wonderment organising itself, heralding itself with [...] the violets, stirring of new seasons.|$|E
50|$|Lester: Rodney's son, he {{will teach}} the player new tricks in {{exchange}} {{for some of the}} goodies you pick up along the way (and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> him).|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear," [...] {{answered}} the old man. [...] "Look! {{there is a}} squirrel running over the grass; see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> it before it reaches that tree." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not he," [...] cried Sammy. [...] "He's a born devil, {{with a dozen}} lives! Take a {{gun with}} you, Mr. Marcy, and shoot him <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can't <b>catch</b> him!" ...|$|R
60|$|And then, during {{absolute}} silence, {{except for}} the bumping of a hind elbow of a hound dog as he pursued a wicked flea, Sam tenderly and carefully tied his guitar across his saddle {{on top of his}} slicker and coat. The guitar was in a green duck bag; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> the significance of it, it explains Sam.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess once {{is enough}} to say them. This is Matthew's doings and I wash my hands of it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> {{pneumonia}} sleeping in a strange bed or {{coming out of that}} hot hall {{in the middle of the}} night, don't blame me, blame Matthew. Anne Shirley, you're dripping greasy water all over the floor. I never saw such a careless child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! it's a fairy {{snow that}} he told me all about; it only comes when {{the sun comes up}} and goes down, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> ever so little of it in your hand it makes all you fink you want come true! Wouldn't that be nice?" [...] But to the child's astonishment her little circle of auditors, even while assenting, sighed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'After all, I don't {{know what}} {{is the use of}} your going, my boy! For even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> should <b>catch</b> a fish, I have no fire to cook it with.' ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{it always}} is with winged horses, and with all such wild and solitary creatures. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> and {{overcome}} them, it is {{the surest way to}} win their love.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> her. She will be ever so {{much more}} good to you than I; and I only hope she will warn you what a Tartar I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is that so! Well, I think you've hit {{the nail}} on the head, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> this Blackie Crowden you'll have the right fellow. Anybody who would run off with my things as he did after he had been treated as well as I treated him wouldn't be above {{committing}} such a crime. But the question is, where did he go? Have you any idea?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} {{continue}} the hunt, while I go home. If you should fall in with 'em tell Henry how matters stand. But, Mr. Risley, let me caution you not to be rash, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> sight of Mrs. Risley {{in the hands of}} the redskins. If you give them the chance they'll burn you at the stake--and it won't help her a bit either." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you'll make of this," [...] he said apologetically. [...] "It's a funny thing. I'm afraid I got beyond my depth in it, but my {{intentions}} were good. Don't bother {{about the little}} features of it. Just see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> {{the feel of the}} big thing in it. It is big, and it is true, though the chance is large that I have failed to make it intelligible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Wantridge? I hope so, indeed. I'll turn up late to-morrow, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>catch</b> me first. Has {{it come to}} you yet?" [...] the visitor, now at the door, went on.|$|R
6000|$|Tipping {{told him}} briefly. [...] "We’ll have him," [...] he said, savagely. [...] "We’ve got a mounted {{policeman}} on the job, besides others. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> him it’s worth half a sov. to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My mistake," [...] he apologized. [...] "I ain't {{told him}} the other game was over. Now just listen an, watch. 'n' see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> on to the tip I'm goin' to give 'm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'That's {{what they}} do in books,' I said, {{thinking}} to laugh her away from her folly," [...] Munster interrupted. [...] "'True,' says she, 'and have you never seen the books come true?' I shook my head. 'Then you're not too old to learn,' says she. 'I'll tell you one thing right now,' says I, 'and that is I'll be blowed <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> me ashore in the night-time stealing niggers in a place like this.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It serves me right! what {{business}} had I {{to put on}} all my best things and come philandering down here, hoping to see the Professor? Jo, I'm ashamed of you! No, you shall not go there to borrow an umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends. You shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> your death and ruin your bonnet, it's no more than you deserve. Now then!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I am bewitched," [...] said Jenkin, {{giving a}} glance towards his dress, [...] "or that these fool's trappings have made as great an ass {{of me as}} of many I have seen wear them; but let line once be rid of the harness, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>catch</b> me putting it on again, I will give you leave to sell me to a gipsy, to carry pots, pans, and beggar's bantlings, {{all the rest of}} my life." [...] So saying, he retired to change his apparel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you are {{master of}} the situation. I have had no proof yet of the {{existence}} of this Jonathan Small. However, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> him I don't see how I can refuse you an interview with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] {{said her}} mother, [...] "you {{had a good}} time trying, at any rate. Perhaps you will see another by-and-by. You may {{possibly}} see a bird, and you can try and see <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>catch</b> him." ...|$|R
