5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water became too low.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the stresses on Titanic caused the ship to split apart between {{the second and third}} funnels at or just below the surface.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} performed since the 1990s has extended {{the understanding of}} the relationship between different organisms. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> the brachiopods do not belong to the Deuterostomata (such as echinoderms and chordates) as was hypothesized earlier, but {{should be included in the}} Protostomia (with mollusks and annelid worms), in a subgroup now called Lophotrochozoa. Although their adult morphology seems rather different, the nucleotid sequence of the 18S rRNA indicates that the horseshoe worms are the closest relatives of the inarticulate brachiopods rather than articulate brachiopods. For now, the weight of evidence is inconclusive as to the exact relations within the inarticulates. Consequently, it has been suggested to included horseshoe worms in the Brachiopoda as a class named Phoronata B.L.Cohen in addition to the Craniata and Lingulata, within the subphylum Linguliformea. The other subphylum Rhynchonelliformea only contains one class, which is subdivided in the orders Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida and Thecideida.|$|E
25|$|The {{history and}} {{identity}} of Tell Arbid have been {{emerging as the}} result of recent excavations. It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the most prosperous period for the ancient Arbid was the IIIrd millennium B.C.|$|E
25|$|The {{low-rise}} skirt in denim is {{the first}} of its kind seen on the Paris runways. What <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> to me is that no self-respecting Banjee Latina, or ghetto-fabulous “Shamecka-girl” or high rolling white chick will be ever able to resist its urban appeal.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} term prostate-{{specific}} antigen is a misnomer: it is an antigen but is not specific to the prostate. Although present in large amounts in prostatic tissue and semen, it has been detected in other body fluids and tissues.|$|E
25|$|In Capitalism and Slavery, Eric Williams {{argued that}} the declining economies of the British West Indies led to the {{abolition}} of the slave trade and of slavery. More recent research has rejected this conclusion; it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the colonies of the British Caribbean profited considerably during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
25|$|Bilateral {{oophorectomy}} {{has been}} traditionally {{done in the}} belief that the benefit of preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh the risks associated with removal of ovaries. However, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that prophylactic oophorectomy without a reasonable medical indication decreases long-term survival rates substantially and has deleterious long-term effects on health and well-being even in post-menopausal women.|$|E

25|$|The {{possibility}} {{of life on}} Mars is a subject of significant interest to astrobiology due to the planet's proximity and similarities to Earth. To date no proof has been found of past or present life on Mars. However, cumulative evidence <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that during the ancient Noachian time period, the surface environment of Mars had liquid water {{and may have been}} habitable for microorganisms. The existence of habitable conditions does not necessarily indicate the presence of life.|$|E
25|$|Cook did {{not lose}} a single man to scurvy, and his report came down in favour of malt and wort, {{although}} it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the reason for}} the health of his crews on this and other voyages was Cook's regime of shipboard cleanliness, enforced by strict discipline, as well as frequent replenishment of fresh food and green stuffs. Another rule implemented by Cook was his prohibition of the consumption of salt fat skimmed from the ship's copper boiling pans, then a common practice in the Navy. In contact with air the copper formed compounds that prevented the absorption of vitamins by the intestines.|$|E
25|$|Since their {{discovery}} in 1873 {{there has been}} considerable debate about their origin. Three theories were dominant: from 1949 to 1970 the connective tissue origin was popular, which stated that osteoclasts and osteoblasts are of the same lineage, and osteoblasts fuse together to form osteoclasts. After years of controversy it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that these cells develop from the self fusion of macrophages. It was {{in the beginning of}} 1980 that the monocyte phagocytic system was recognized as precursor of osteoclasts. Osteoclast formation requires the presence of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κβ ligand) and M-CSF (Macrophage colony-stimulating factor). These membrane-bound proteins are produced by neighbouring stromal cells and osteoblasts, thus requiring direct contact between these cells and osteoclast precursors.|$|E

60|$|As {{the storm}} {{continued}} these glimpses of other vessels {{became more and}} more rare, and the ship being a very fast sailer, the captain indulged the hope that he <b>was</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> {{of the rest of the}} fleet.|$|R
25|$|Roosevelt and Henry Morgenthau {{insisted that}} the Big Four (United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China) {{participate}} in the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, but their goal was frustrated when the Soviet Union would not join the IMF. In the past, {{the reasons why the}} Soviet Union chose not to subscribe to the articles by December 1945 {{have been the subject of}} speculation. But since the release of relevant Soviet archives, it <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that the Soviet calculation was based on the behavior of the parties that had actually expressed their assent to the Bretton Woods Agreements. The extended debates about ratification that had taken place both in the UK and the U.S. were read in Moscow as evidence of the quick disintegration of the wartime alliance.|$|E
500|$|Before {{recognition}} of E. cinnabarina as a species, E. lewisii was interpreted {{to be the}} sister of E. cardinalis. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that E. cinnabarina and E. cardinalis are sister species and that E. lewisii and E. erubescens are sister species. [...] In the hypothesized phylogeny, the 'cinnabarina/cardinalis' pair is sister to the 'lewisii/erubescens' pair.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, {{following}} large-scale frog {{deaths in}} Australia and Central America, research teams in both areas {{came up with}} identical results: a previously undescribed species of pathogenic fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> that many recent extinctions of amphibians in Australia and the Americas are linked to this fungus. [...] This fungus belongs to a family of saprobes known as chytrids that are not generally pathogenic.|$|E

500|$|Controlling {{river flow}} {{by use of}} dams has diminished the river's ability to scour rocks by {{substantially}} {{reducing the amount of}} sediment it carries. Dams on the Colorado River have also changed the character of the river water. Once both muddy and warm, the river <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>clear</b> and averages a [...] temperature year-round. Experimental floods approaching the [...] per second level mentioned above have been carried out in 1996 and 2004 to study the effects on sediment erosion and deposition.|$|E
