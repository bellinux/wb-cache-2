5|$|Entering the 2007 season, Sánchez {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} best {{prospect}} in the Giants' organization (behind only Tim Lincecum) by Baseball America. Sánchez made the Giants' roster out of spring training. He struggled in his first fourteen games, however, and was sent down to Fresno on May 21 when Russ Ortiz came off the disabled list. Sánchez returned to the majors on June 6 when, coincidentally, Ortiz <b>got</b> <b>hurt</b> again. On June 13, {{he picked up his}} first major league hit (an RBI double) in a 7–4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays. On July 4, he was placed on the disabled list with a strained rib cage, but he was reactivated on July 18.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two years}} after Ruth's sale, {{he went on to}} have a record setting season—statistically, one of the {{greatest}} in major league history for a batter. This propelled the Yankees to capture their first pennant and face their rival Giants. On October 5, 1921, the Yankees appeared in and won their very first World Series game. Ruth <b>got</b> <b>hurt</b> during the Series, and the Yankees eventually dropped the last three games, losing the Series five games to three to the Giants in the last ever best-of-nine Series. Both the Yankees and Giants would play in the 1922 World Series as well, a series that would be the Yankees' last in the two teams' shared stadium at the Polo Grounds as the Giants served the Yankees an eviction notice after the 1921 season.|$|E
5|$|Mota was {{originally}} {{signed by the}} New York Mets in 1990 as an infielder. After several years in their organization, he was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the Rule 5 draft in 1996 and converted into a pitcher in 1997. Mota had a 2.96 ERA in 1999, his rookie season, but he struggled in his next two seasons and {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Dodgers prior to 2002. His struggles continued in his first year with the Dodgers, but Mota had a career year in 2003, as he had a 6–3 record with a 1.97 ERA in 76 games. He became the setup man to closer Éric Gagné in 2004, but was traded to the Florida Marlins midseason. Mota started 2005 as their closer, but Todd Jones took over the role when Mota <b>got</b> <b>hurt</b> in April. Following the year, Mota was traded to the Boston Red Sox.|$|E

25|$|The Wild Samoans {{eventually}} {{ended up}} back in the World Wrestling Federation with their former manager Capt. Lou Albano. Afa and Sika began their third WWF Tag Team Championship reign on March 8, 1983 by defeating Chief Jay and Jules Strongbow. In a rematch on March 19, they were also victorious. Also during this time, while feuding with Rocky Johnson, Jimmy Snuka, and André the Giant, the duo added Afa's son Samula to their team, first {{as a replacement for}} Sika when he <b>got</b> <b>hurt,</b> then as their backup upon his return.|$|E
25|$|Far from {{endangering}} kids, teen dances keep kids safe. If {{the young}} people hadn't been at a crowded public dance overseen by extensive security (19 guards were at CHAC on Saturday night) where no one <b>got</b> <b>hurt,</b> the kids would likely have been out at unchaperoned and completely unregulated house parties—not after the dance, but all night. And, without a fat calendar of all-ages events, that's {{where they would be}} every weekend. Because without organized all-ages dances and live-music events, house parties and parking lots are all kids have.|$|E
25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince every {{guy on the}} team that his role was important. If you came in {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win...It was his way of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone <b>got</b> <b>hurt</b> or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, Florence {{attempted}} to swim the 26 miles between Catalina Island and the California coastline. As she began, she was flanked by small boats that watched for sharks and {{were prepared to}} help her if she <b>got</b> <b>hurt</b> or grew tired. After about 15 hours a thick fog set in. Florence began to doubt her ability, and she told her mother, who {{was in one of}} the boats, that she did not think she could make it. She swam for another hour before asking to be pulled out, unable to see the coastline due to the fog. As she sat in the boat, she found out she had stopped swimming just one mile away from her destination. Two months later, she tried again. The same thick fog set in, but she succeeded in reaching Catalina. She said that she kept a mental image of the shoreline in her mind while she swam. She later swam the Catalina channel on two additional occasions.|$|E

I can't see as I can do any good by stopping, and I may do harm; so I will go over to Dunmanway and stop there till I hear what your honor has done.

This includes an electric left-handed guitar, a shirt similar to Cobain's, and a blonde wig. The costuming for the performance is critical; Schwartz explained that [...] "if anything's missing, Al won't do it". The rest of Al's band also participates. Steve Jay, who plays bass, uses two bass straps to emulate and exaggerate [...] "Novoselic's low-hanging bass". He explained that he positions his instrument [...] "to where I can just barely touch the strings". The members of the band also mock-mosh. Jim West, the band's guitarist, noted that moshing is usually tame, but that there [...] "were a few collisions where people <b>got</b> <b>hurt,</b> but not the audience, just the band." [...] Sometimes during the third verse, after Yankovic sings [...] "And I forgot the next verse," [...] he drops out {{for the next few}} lines, pretending to actually forget the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{several options}} at Triple-A (AAA), when Freddy García <b>got</b> <b>hurt,</b> Pat Gillick {{promoted}} Kendrick {{to the major}} leagues, which drew skepticism, as Kendrick was just 22 years old, and had not pitched particularly well for Reading. However, according to Steve Noworyta, Phillies assistant director of player development, Kendrick's [...] "mound presence and his maturity", {{as well as the}} fact that [...] "nothing really seemed to bother him" [...] contributed to his promotion. His MLB debut came on June 13 against the Chicago White Sox at Citizens Bank Park. He pitched six innings and gave up three runs, receiving a no-decision in an 8–4 Phillies' victory. He pitched the second game of the 2007 National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, which the Phillies lost, en route to being swept in the series. He finished the season with a 10–4 win–loss record and a 3.87 ERA in 121 MLB innings pitched. He came in fifth place, ultimately losing to Ryan Braun, in 2007 National League Rookie of the Year Award voting.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Lauryn Hill met Rohan Marley while touring as {{a member}} of the Fugees. The two {{gradually}} formed a close relationship, and while on tour, Hill became pregnant with his child. The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very in touch with my feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I <b>got</b> <b>hurt,</b> every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E

Hindustan Times {{reported that the}} set was ready at Filmistan studio, but following Chopra's father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised {{that it would not}} be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra as she <b>got</b> <b>hurt</b> several times; she says, [...] "They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really hit you. So I had to get hit a lot and that was really hard." [...] Robert Miller, the sports coordinator for films such as Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Chak De!

Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was tasked with depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunt work, nor did he have the stunt performers use wires or dummies; he told them to fall [...] off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. [...] "We had to say, ‘Jump off the rock, land however you land, and go with it,’" [...] he said. [...] "When you’re doing that on a true hillside, you don’t have a choice. Gravity takes over. The only thing stopping the stunt people from dropping another thousand feet down the hillside was padding set up just outside of the shot." [...] Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control. Berg recalled, [...] "Some guys <b>got</b> <b>hurt,</b> some guys got bumped up and ribs were broken, a lung was punctured, some concussions, but these guys were determined to try and do everything they could to capture what Marcus described in the book."
