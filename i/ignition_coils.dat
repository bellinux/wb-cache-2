25|$|The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) {{continued}} the concepts {{introduced in the}} R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they {{do not meet the}} frontal impact standards. (However, in the U.S., there are Federal Laws regarding safety and emissions that require certain documents to be obtained, certain criteria to be met and adhered to, or 25 years to pass, before the sale of this vehicle becomes legal.) For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET's turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the bonnet which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> (also {{called a}} spark coil) is an {{induction}} coil in an automobile's ignition system that transforms the battery's low voltage {{to the thousands}} of volts needed to create an electric spark in the spark plugs to ignite the fuel. Some coils have an internal resistor, while others rely on a resistor wire or an external resistor to limit the current flowing into the coil from the car's 12-volt supply. The wire that goes from the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the distributor and the high voltage wires that go from the distributor to each of the spark plugs are called spark plug wires or high tension leads. Originally, every <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> system required mechanical contact breaker points and a capacitor (condenser). More recent electronic ignition systems use a power transistor to provide pulses to the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil.</b> A modern passenger automobile may use one <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> for each engine cylinder (or pair of cylinders), eliminating fault-prone spark plug cables and a distributor to route the high voltage pulses.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> {{consists}} of a laminated iron core surrounded by two coils of copper wire. Unlike a power transformer, an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> has an open magnetic circuit — the iron core does not form a closed loop around the windings. The energy that is stored in the magnetic field of the core is the energy that is transferred to the spark plug.|$|R
2500|$|The Milan site {{is located}} at 147 Wabash Street in Milan, Michigan. Ford {{purchased}} an existing mill in Milan in 1936. [...] The mill was renovated, including {{the construction of a}} new dam and hydroelectric plant. [...] The mill was used to process soybeans, and a small factory located on site was used to manufacture <b>ignition</b> <b>coils.</b> [...] By 1939, the mill had nearly 200 employees and produced all the <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> used by the Ford Motor Company. [...] The plant continued to make <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> through World War II, but was closed in 1948, with the production line and its employees moved to the nearby Ypsilanti plant. [...] The property was turned over to the village of Milan, who used it for offices, the police department, and a library.|$|E
2500|$|A single breaker {{driven by}} a cam and a return spring is limited in spark rate by the onset of contact bounce or float at high rpm. This limit can be {{overcome}} by substituting for the breaker a pair of breakers that are connected electrically in series but spaced {{on opposite sides of}} the cam so they are driven out of phase. Each breaker then switches at half the rate of a single breaker and the [...] "dwell" [...] time for current buildup in the coil is maximized since it is shared between the breakers. The Lamborghini V-8 engine has both these adaptations and therefore uses two <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> and a single distributor that contains 4 contact breakers.|$|E
2500|$|Like the Model T car, a Fordson tractor {{that was}} {{relatively}} new and well maintained would start easily in warm weather. Under such conditions, often a single crank pull would start it. However, in cold weather, starting could be difficult, especially once the machines were 10, 20, or 30 {{years old and}} worn out. In cold weather, the oil congealed on the cylinder walls and on the clutch plates. The engine had to be hand cranked repeatedly with great effort. [...] Strong men took turns cranking between intervals when individual <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> were adjusted. [...] Sometimes farmers would build a fire under the tractor to warm up the crankcase and gear boxes to make it crank easier. [...] The tractor, when in use, was fueled by kerosene, but gasoline was required to start it.|$|E
25|$|The <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> {{consists}} of two transformer windings — the primary and secondary. These windings share a common magnetic core. An alternating current in the primary induces an alternating magnetic field in the core and hence an alternating current in the secondary. The <b>ignition</b> <b>coil's</b> secondary has more turns than the primary. This is a step-up transformer, which produces a high voltage from the secondary winding.|$|R
50|$|Older engines {{also have}} a wire {{connecting}} the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> to the distributor, known as a coil wire. A coil wire is of the same construction as a spark plug wire, but generally shorter and with different terminals. Some distributors have an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> built inside them, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate coil wire, e.g. GM High energy ignition system and some Toyotas and Hondas.|$|R

The other, high voltage, end of the secondary is connected to the distributor's rotor.|$|R
2500|$|Further {{detail of}} the engine {{includes}} fully sequential electronic multi-point fuel injection with intake manifold-sited fuel injectors, mapped direct ignition system with solid-state high voltage distribution using eight individual single-spark <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> and NGK longlife spark plugs, and three knock sensors. [...] Engine management uses a Bosch Motronic ME7.1.1 engine control unit, which controls all functions of the engine operation; including fuel delivery, ignition system, valve timing, emissions control systems, and torque reduction control—the latter operating {{in conjunction with the}} Bosch ESP5.7 Electronic Stability Programme, as part of the [...] "Anti Slip Regulation" [...] (ASR) traction control system. [...] The engine is compliant with the European Union Euro3 (EU3) standard, and includes two close-coupled primary catalytic converters (CATs), two underfloor main CATs, and four heated oxygen sensors which manage the cylinder bank selective lambda control. [...] This results in a CO2 emissions rating of 350g/km for the Avant and saloon in standard configuration.|$|E

50|$|Ignition {{takes place}} with {{individual}} <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> {{placed on the}} respective spark plug. The spark plugs, together with the <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> and combustion detection module (CDM), are used to detect combustion and possible knocking. This means {{there is no need}} for a camshaft position sensor or separate knock sensor.|$|E
2500|$|An {{improved}} {{ignition system}} {{was developed by}} the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Co. (Delco) and introduced in the 1910 Cadillac.

50|$|The engine {{also had}} a dual-point {{distributor}} with a transistorized ignition amplifier system, running 12 amps of current through a high-output <b>ignition</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|R
50|$|Around the 1970s {{the primary}} breaker points were largely {{replaced}} with a Hall effect sensor or optical sensor. As this is a non-contacting device and the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> is controlled by solid state electronics, {{a great amount of}} maintenance in point adjustment and replacement was eliminated. This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends distributor shaft bearing life. The remaining secondary (high voltage) circuit stayed essentially the same, using an <b>ignition</b> <b>coil</b> and a rotary distributor.|$|R
50|$|The {{distributor}} shaft has a cam that operates the contact breaker (also called points). Opening the points causes a high induction voltage in the system's <b>ignition</b> <b>coil.</b>|$|R

50|$|During the Vietnam War the {{original}} AC-130A Spectre gunships and the A-6C Intruder employed the Pave Mace / Black Crow magnetic anomaly detection system to detect truck <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> in vehicles hidden under heavy jungle canopies. When the electric current flowing {{through such a}} coil changes, it produces a magnetic flux, which {{is a change in}} the magnetic field over a given area. When the trucks were running, the current flowing through the <b>ignition</b> <b>coils</b> produced a large and easily detectable flux.|$|E

25|$|The <b>ignition</b> <b>coil's</b> {{high voltage}} output is {{connected}} to the rotor that sits on top of the distributor shaft. Surrounding the rotor is the distributor cap. The arrangement sequentially directs the output of the secondary winding to the appropriate spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil's secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug that in turn ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored in the <b>ignition</b> <b>coil’s</b> magnetic field.|$|R
