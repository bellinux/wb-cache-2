Additional ingredients include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins and plumped raisins, dates, chopped apple, chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and spices such as cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and allspice.

After baking, applesauce cake is sometimes topped with an icing, frosting or <b>glaze,</b> such as a caramel <b>glaze.</b> It also may be served topped with a dusting of confectioner's sugar or whipped cream. Gluten-free applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.|$|E

5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic <b>glaze</b> have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon <b>glaze</b> is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan celadon wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{windows are}} usually <b>glazed</b> with one large sheet of glass per sash, while {{windows in the}} past were <b>glazed</b> with {{multiple}} panes separated by <b>glazing</b> bars, or muntins, due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, <b>glazing</b> bars tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. <b>Glazing</b> bars are typically wooden, but occasionally lead <b>glazing</b> bars soldered in place are used for more intricate <b>glazing</b> patterns.|$|R

40|$|Homes {{with single}} <b>glazing</b> {{represent}} {{a large majority}} of the New Zealand housing stock. With the recent changes to the NZ Building Code Clause H 1 Energy Efficiency, new homes require higher <b>glazing</b> thermal performance. This will lead to an increased need for cost effective methods to improve window thermal performance in existing single <b>glazed</b> homes without completely replacing the windows, which includes 'secondary' <b>glazing.</b> There are several secondary <b>glazing</b> options available including 'stick-on' plastic <b>glazing</b> as well as aluminium framed glass solutions that are installed inside the existing joinery. Secondary <b>glazing</b> is marketed as a cost effective alternative to insulated <b>glazing</b> units, providing both improved acoustic and thermal insulation to existing windows. There is little information regarding the in-use performance and cost benefits of secondary <b>glazing</b> in New Zealand. This thesis explores the efficacy of the secondary <b>glazing</b> products when installed in existing single pane frames. A guarded hotbox was used to make thermal resistance measurements on a typical single <b>glazed</b> aluminium window with timber reveal liner. Four common secondary <b>glazing</b> systems were retrofitted into the window - (1) thin plastic film; (2) magnetically-attached acrylic sheet; (3) aluminium framed secondary glazing; and (4) aluminium framed low emissivity (low-E) secondary <b>glazing.</b> Models of 'typical' New Zealand homes created in the ALF building thermal simulation programme were used to explore the heating energy savings and cost benefits provided by the different secondary <b>glazing</b> systems in a range of locations. Of the tested products, the low-E secondary <b>glazing</b> produces the largest cost-benefits. At current energy and material costs, secondary <b>glazing</b> was found to not be a financially viable solution in warmer climates such as Auckland. In cooler climates such as Christchurch and Dunedin, secondary <b>glazing</b> was found to be a cost effective retrofit alternative for existing single <b>glazed</b> home...|$|R

5|$|Ceramic {{industry}} consumes {{a significant}} amount of zinc oxide, in particular in ceramic <b>glaze</b> and frit compositions. The relatively high heat capacity, thermal conductivity and high temperature stability of ZnO coupled with a comparatively low coefﬁcient of expansion are desirable properties in the production of ceramics. ZnO affects the melting point and optical properties of the glazes, enamels, and ceramic formulations. Zinc oxide as a low expansion, secondary ﬂux improves the elasticity of glazes by reducing the change in viscosity as a function of temperature and helps prevent crazing and shivering. By substituting ZnO for BaO and PbO, the heat capacity is decreased and the thermal conductivity is increased. Zinc in small amounts improves the development of glossy and brilliant surfaces. However, in moderate to high amounts, it produces matte and crystalline surfaces. With regard to color, zinc has a complicated inﬂuence.|$|E
