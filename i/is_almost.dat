5|$|A {{system of}} {{apprenticeship}} called Duale Ausbildung {{leads to a}} skilled qualification which <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> comparable to an academic degree. It allows students in vocational training to learn in a company {{as well as in}} a state-run trade school. This model is well regarded and reproduced all around the world.|$|E

60|$|The {{effect of}} her simple words on Barnes <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> magical. The dull colour {{streamed}} into his sallow cheeks, he shook {{all over with}} excitement. His voice, when he spoke, <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> hysterical. He had been so near to despair. This indeed had <b>been</b> <b>almost</b> his last hope.|$|R

5|$|Adams {{has left}} behind a mixed legacy. Most historians applaud him for {{avoiding}} an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> always condemned.|$|E
5|$|Although the Juno orbiter, which {{arrived at}} Jupiter in 2016, has a camera called JunoCam, it <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> entirely focused on {{observations}} of Jupiter itself. However, {{if all goes}} well it should be able to capture some limited images of the innermost moons Metis and Adrastea.|$|E
5|$|Although we {{are used}} to {{thinking}} of supernovae primarily as luminous visible events, the electromagnetic radiation they release <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> a minor side-effect. Particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae, the emitted electromagnetic radiation is {{a tiny fraction of the}} total energy released during the event.|$|E
50|$|Cases of {{poisoning}} from tin metal, its oxides, and its salts <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> unknown. On {{the other}} hand, certain organotin compounds <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> as toxic as cyanide.|$|R

5|$|Ariel is the fourth-largest of the 27 known moons of Uranus. Ariel orbits and rotates in the {{equatorial}} plane of Uranus, which <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> {{perpendicular to the}} orbit of Uranus and so has an extreme seasonal cycle.|$|E
5|$|Belief in pig-faced women declined, and {{the last}} {{significant}} work to treat their existence as genuine was published in 1924. Today, the legend <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> forgotten.|$|E
5|$|Cambodia has no proven {{fossil fuel}} reserves, and <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> {{completely}} dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay {{some of the}} highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development.|$|E
50|$|If the {{molecules}} <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> identical chemically, e.g., 1-butanol and 2-butanol, then the solution will <b>be</b> <b>almost</b> ideal. Since the interaction energies between A and B <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> equal, {{it follows that}} there is a very small overall energy (enthalpy) change when the substances are mixed. The more dissimilar the nature of A and B, the more strongly the solution is expected to deviate from ideality.|$|R
50|$|The manufacturing, {{agricultural}} and transportation {{sectors of the}} economy <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> entirely automated and employ very few humans. Across the world, poverty, war and disease <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> nonexistent thanks to technology alleviating want.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{very slight}} smile upon her lips, the glimmer of {{something}} that <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> appealing, in her eyes. Granet {{took her hand and}} patted it kindly. Her response <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> hysterical.|$|R
5|$|Cycling: Cycles are {{available}} for hire near Roehampton Gate and, at peak times, near Pembroke Lodge. The Tamsin Trail (shared between pedestrians and cyclists) provides a circuit {{of the park and}} <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> entirely car-free.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{very successful}} in providing a framework for accurate models which describe {{an impressive array of}} physical phenomena. On the other hand, there are many interesting open questions, and in particular, the theory as a whole <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly incomplete.|$|E
5|$|Helium <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> always placed above neon (which {{is in the}} p-block) in the {{periodic}} table as a noble gas, although it is occasionally placed above beryllium due to their similar electron configuration.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned her}} head {{and looked at him}} intently. For a moment she <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> startled. There <b>was</b> {{something}} unreal in the sound of his words. Something that <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> a foreboding chilled her.|$|R
50|$|Two {{sets are}} said to <b>be</b> <b>almost</b> {{disjoint}} sets if their intersection is small in some sense. For instance, two infinite sets whose intersection is a finite set {{may be said to}} <b>be</b> <b>almost</b> disjoint.|$|R
5000|$|Two subsets [...] and [...] of [...] {{are said}} to <b>be</b> <b>almost</b> {{disjoint}} if [...] is finite, and a family of subsets of [...] is said to <b>be</b> <b>almost</b> disjoint if its members <b>are</b> pairwise <b>almost</b> disjoint. A maximal almost disjoint (mad) family of subsets of [...] <b>is</b> thus an <b>almost</b> disjoint family such that for every subset [...] of [...] not in , there is a set [...] such that [...] and [...] <b>are</b> not <b>almost</b> disjoint(that <b>is,</b> their intersection <b>is</b> infinite). The <b>almost</b> disjointness number [...] is the least cardinality of an infinite maximal almost disjoint family.A basic result is that ...|$|R
5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{prepared}} by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. Hydrogen chloride {{can be generated}} in many ways, and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist. The large-scale production of hydrochloric acid <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> always integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|In {{fact the}} place of Sir John A. Macdonald in this country was so large and so {{absorbing}} that it <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> impossible to conceive that {{the politics of this}} country, the fate of this country, will continue without him. His loss overwhelms us.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in accurately calibrating the instruments used, {{and the problem of}} spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> certainly present.|$|E
50|$|An {{aircraft}} engine is the {{component of the}} propulsion system for an aircraft that generates mechanical power. Aircraft engines <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> always either lightweight piston engines or gas turbines, except for small multicopter UAVs which <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> always electric aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|In his Philosophical Dictionary, Voltaire endorses Montesquieu's {{criticism}} of the slave trade: Montesquieu <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> always in error with the learned, {{because he was not}} learned, but he <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> always right against the fanatics and the promoters of slavery.|$|R

Funding is provided mainly from sales taxes, but a small percentage of total budget is obtained from donations, paid extension programs and corporate sponsors.|$|E

5|$|Proportionally, {{the skull}} is much shorter and {{smaller than that}} of Edmontosaurus (formerly Trachodon), Kritosaurus, or Saurolophus, but when {{including}} its crest, its superficial area <b>is</b> <b>almost</b> as large.|$|E
50|$|Passwords <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> always case-sensitive.|$|R
25|$|The mass of {{the neutron}} and the proton <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> identical: they <b>are</b> nearly degenerate, and both are thus often called nucleons. Although the proton has a {{positive}} electric charge, and the neutron is neutral, they <b>are</b> <b>almost</b> identical in all other aspects.|$|R
30|$|In addition, the {{occurrence}} of the keyword NoPossess was four times greater in the High Performance groups. Consequently, the level of students’ interaction <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> four times greater in the High Performance groups compared with the Low Performance groups. Similarly, {{the occurrence}} of the keywords Simultaneous and Another <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> three times greater in the groups with high performance. Therefore, the level of students’ involvement <b>was</b> <b>almost</b> three times greater in the high performance groups compared with the low performance groups.|$|R
