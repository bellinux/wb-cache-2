25|$|At {{the age of}} 11 months Genie {{was still}} in overall good health, and had no noted mental abnormalities, but had fallen to the 11th {{percentile}} for weight. The people who later studied her believed this {{was a sign that}} she was starting to suffer some degree of malnutrition. When Genie was 14 months old, she came down with a fever and pneumonitis and her parents took her to a pediatrician who had not previously seen her. The pediatrician said that, although her illness prevented a definitive diagnosis, there was a possibility that she was mentally retarded and that the brain dysfunction <b>kernicterus</b> might be present, further amplifying her father's conclusion that she was severely retarded.|$|E
25|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinaemia}} in {{a newborn}} {{can lead to}} accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as <b>kernicterus.</b> The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions {{that may lead to}} hyperbilirubinaemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the faeces (this is largely why the faeces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{infectious}} agents include cytomegalovirus, the {{herpes simplex}} virus, hyperthermia, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis. [...] Mother exposure to cytomegalovirus can cause microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, blindness, chorioretinitis (which can cause blindness), hepatosplenomegaly, and meningoencephalitis in fetuses. [...] Microcephaly is a disorder {{in which the}} fetus has an atypically small head, cerebral calcifications means {{certain areas of the}} brain have atypical calcium deposits, and meningoencephalitis is the enlargement of the brain. [...] All three disorders cause abnormal brain function or mental retardation. [...] Hepatosplenomegaly is the enlargement of the liver and spleen which causes digestive problems. [...] It can also cause some <b>kernicterus</b> and petechiae. [...] <b>Kernicterus</b> causes yellow pigmentation of the skin, brain damage, and deafness.

2500|$|Bilirubin encephalopathy, {{also known}} as <b>kernicterus,</b> is the {{accumulation}} of bilirubin in the grey matter of the central nervous system. The main accumulation targets of hyperbilirubinemia are the basal ganglia, ocular movement nucleus, and acoustic nucleus of the brainstem. Pathogenesis of bilirubin encephalopathy involves several factors, including the transport of bilirubin across the blood-brain barrier and into neurons. Mild disruption results in left cognition impairment, while severe disruption results in ADCP. Lesions caused by accumulation of bilirubin occur mainly in the global pallidus and hypothalamus. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier by disease or a hypoxic ischemic injury can also contribute to an accumulation of bilirubin in the brain. Bilirubin encephalopathy leading to cerebral palsy has been greatly reduced by effective monitoring and treatment for hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants. [...] As <b>kernicterus</b> has decreased due to improvements in care, over the last 50 years the proportion of children developing athetoid CP has decreased.

50|$|The only {{effective}} way at preventing <b>kernicterus</b> is {{to lower the}} serum bilirubin levels either by phototherapy or exchange transfusion.

50|$|In 1904 Schmorl {{coined the}} term <b>kernicterus</b> to {{describe}} nuclear jaundice of the basal ganglia. This condition was earlier identified in 1875 by pathologist Johannes Orth (1847-1923).|$|E
5000|$|Signs of {{hemolytic}} {{disease of}} the newborn include a positive direct Coombs test (also called direct agglutination test), elevated cord bilirubin, and hemolytic anemia. It is possible for a newborn with this disease to have neutropenia and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia as well.Hemolysis leads to elevated bilirubin levels. After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared (via the placenta) from the neonate's blood and the symptoms of jaundice (yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes) increase within 24 hours after birth. Like other severe neonatal jaundice, {{there is the possibility}} of acute or chronic <b>kernicterus,</b> however the risk of <b>kernicterus</b> is higher because of the rapid destruction of blood cells. It {{is important to note that}} isoimmunization is a risk factor for neurotoxicity and lowers the level at which <b>kernicterus</b> can occur. Untreated profound anemia can cause high-output heart failure, with pallor, enlarged liver and/or spleen, generalized swelling, and respiratory distress.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the severe}} anemia of erythroblastosis fetalis {{is usually the}} cause of death, many {{children}} who barely survive the anemia exhibit permanent mental impairment or damage to motor {{areas of the brain}} because of precipitation of bilirubin in the neuronal cells, causing destruction of many, a condition called <b>kernicterus.</b>|$|E
