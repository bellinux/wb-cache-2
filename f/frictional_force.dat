5|$|Friction is {{a surface}} force that opposes {{relative}} motion. The <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> {{is directly related}} to the normal force that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: static friction and kinetic friction.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional gripping is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the <b>frictional</b> <b>force,</b> thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced gripping ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E

Due to <b>frictional</b> <b>force,</b> the {{velocity}} decreases in proportion to the acting <b>frictional</b> <b>force.</b> While simple harmonic motion oscillates with only the restoring force acting on the system, damped harmonic motion experiences friction. In many vibrating systems the <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> Ff can be modeled as being proportional to the velocity v of the object: , where c is called the viscous damping coefficient.|$|E

Methods: 0. 016 -inch nickel titanium (NiTi) wires and 0. 017 × 0. 025 -inch stainless steel (SS) wires were used, and the angulations between the brackets and wires were set to 0 o, 5 o, and 10 °. Upper maxillary premolar brackets (Clippy-C®) with a 0. 022 -inch slot were selected for the study and a tensile test was performed with a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min.

30|$|Hydraulic {{actuators}} {{have high}} power-to-weight ratios, making them suitable for high-power robotic {{applications such as}} in walking robots and construction machines. However, large <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> in hydraulic actuators, rotary hydraulic actuators in particular, degrade the control performance. To suppress <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> and increase robustness against modeling errors, this study considered the integration of feedback modulators (with minimum control inputs exceeding static <b>frictional</b> <b>forces)</b> with disturbance observers. In the proposed controller, nonlinear static <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> are suppressed by the feedback modulators and linear disturbances are suppressed by the disturbance observers.

40|$|Seismic {{response}} of a one-storey structure with sliding support to bidirectional (i. e. two horizontal components) earthquake ground motion is investigated. <b>Frictional</b> <b>forces,</b> which are mobilized at the sliding support, {{are assumed to}} have ideal Coulomb-friction characteristics. Coupling effects due to circular interaction between the <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> are incorporated in the governing equations of motion. Effects of bidirectional interaction of <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> on the response are investigated by comparing the response to two-component excitation with the corresponding response produced by the application of single-component excitations in each direction independently. It is observed that the {{response of}} the sliding structure is influenced significantly by the bidirectional interaction of <b>frictional</b> <b>forces.</b> Further, it is shown that the design sliding displacement may be underestimated if the bidirectional interaction of <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> is neglected and the sliding structures are designed merely on the basis of single-component excitation...|$|R
25|$|The Coulomb {{approximation}} mathematically {{follows from}} the assumptions that surfaces are in atomically close contact only over {{a small fraction of}} their overall area, that this contact area is proportional to the normal force (until saturation, which takes place when all area is in atomic contact), and that the <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> is proportional to the applied normal force, independently of the contact area (you can see the experiments on friction from Leonardo da Vinci). Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between normal force and <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> is not exactly linear (and so the <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.|$|E

25|$|When the {{surfaces}} are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes {{a very poor}} approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even {{when there is no}} normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{efficiency}} of vibrating machines will be greatly improved {{with the proper}} working parameters. A new type of hydraulic vibration pile driver extractor is presented in this paper. The machine-pile-soil dynamic model of the hydraulic vibration pile driver extractor based on <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> and vibration coupling is established with <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> of the pile-soil contact surface and the resistance force of the pile-end. Furthermore, the nonlinear dynamical characteristics of the dynamic model are studied and the influences of different system working parameters on <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> of pile-soil interface, working efficiency and capability are discussed by numerical simulation. The different working parameters are exciting force, frequency and stiffness. The {{results show that the}} suitable parameters of the vibrating machine can change the soil characteristics and decrease the <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> of the pile-soil interface. The work can provide useful guidance for the research on the vibration friction, selection in the suitable parameters of interface surface in engineering and design in the development of such machines...|$|R
40|$|The {{interplay between}} local {{mechanical}} strain energy and lateral <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> determines {{the shape of}} carbon nanotubes on substrates. In turn, because of its nanometer-size diameter, {{the shape of a}} carbon nanotube strongly influences its local electronic, chemical, and mechanical properties. Few, if any, methods exist for resolving the strain energy and static <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> along the length of a deformed nanotube supported on a substrate. We present a method using nonlinear elastic rod theory in which we compute the flexural strain energy and static <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> along the length of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) manipulated into various shapes on a clean SiO 2 substrate. Using only high resolution atomic force microscopy images of curved single walled nanotubes, we estimate flexural strain energy distributions on the order of attojoules per nanometer and the static <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> between a SWCNT and SiO 2 surface to be a minimum of 230 pN nm−...|$|R
25|$|The rate of {{relaxation}} of density fluctuations will be rapid if the restoring force, which {{depends upon the}} network elasticity, is large—and if the friction between the network and the interstitial fluid is small. The theory suggests that the rate is directly proportional to the elasticity and inversely proportional to the <b>frictional</b> <b>force.</b> The friction in turn depends upon both the viscosity of the fluid and the average size of the pores contained within the polymer network.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{stepping}} stick-slip motor, all these motors {{work on the}} same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a phase difference of 90°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an elliptical path, producing a <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a sine wave signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage {{can be used to}} produce a high vibration amplitude.|$|E
25|$|Friction. This {{is a force}} always {{opposing}} the forward motion, whereby the vector invariably acts in the negative direction s with an effect to reduce the speed. The friction at play in the balanced-flow models is the one exerted by the roughness of the Earth's surface on the air moving higher above. For simplicity, we here assume that the <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> (per unit mass) adjusts to the parcel's speed proportionally through a constant coefficient of friction K. In more realistic conditions, the dependence of friction on the speed is non-linear except for slow laminar flows.|$|E

40|$|Response of {{structures}} {{supported on the}} sliding systems under near-fault earthquake ground motion is investigated. The fault normal and parallel components are applied in two horizontal direction of the system. The superstructure {{is considered to be}} rigid and the <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> mobilized at the interface of the sliding system are assumed to be velocity dependent. The interaction between <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> of sliding system in two horizontal directions is duly considered and coupled differential equations of motion of the system are solved in the incremental form using step-by-step method with iterations. The iterations are required due to dependence of the <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> on the response of the system. The response of the system is analyzed to investigate the performance of sliding systems under near-fault motion. In addition, the effects of velocity dependence and bi-directional interaction of <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> on the response of isolated system are also investigated. The response of sliding system due to fault normal and parallel components is found to be more or less uncorrelated and the resultant sliding base displacement is mainly contributed by the fault normal component. It is also observed that the dependence of friction coefficient on relative velocity of system does not have noticeable effects on the peak response of the isolated system. However, if the effects of bi-directional interaction of <b>frictional</b> <b>forces</b> are neglected then the sliding base displacements under near-fault motion will be underestimated which can be crucial from design point of view. © Elsevie...|$|R
25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. For an example of potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement.

25|$|Since {{it is at}} {{the limit}} of (or beyond) current {{technology}} to observe individual gas particles (atoms or molecules), only theoretical calculations give suggestions about how they move, but their motion is different from Brownian motion because Brownian motion involves a smooth drag due to the <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> of many gas molecules, punctuated by violent collisions of an individual (or several) gas molecule(s) with the particle.

In principle, if 80 percent of wing is laminar, then overall drag could be reduced by 25 percent. The <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> between {{the air and the}} aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar one. The principal type of active laminar-flow control is removal of a small amount of the boundary-layer air by suction through porous materials, multiple narrow surface slots, or small perforations (boundary layer suction).|$|E

So even though you may see microphotographs of delicately etched silicon gears, such devices are currently little more than curiosities with limited real world applications, for example, in moving mirrors and shutters. [...] Surface tension increases in much the same way, thus magnifying the tendency for very small objects to stick together. This could possibly make any kind of [...] "micro factory" [...] impractical: even if robotic arms and hands could be scaled down, anything they pick up will tend to be impossible to put down.

When the angle θ does not satisfy the above condition, the horizontal component of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional <b>frictional</b> <b>force</b> tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference.

The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces.
