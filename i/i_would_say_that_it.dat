2500|$|In 1970 New Jersey Senator Harrison A. Williams [...] "reminded {{his colleagues}} of James Madison's strong {{objection}} when the post {{was created in}} 1793", and [...] "noted the modern fulfillment of another of Madison's warnings, that there would inevitably be discrimination in the appointment of such a chaplain against the (then) smaller denominations such as Catholics and Jews." [...] Williams pointed out [...] "that although Catholics have for some time comprised the largest religious affiliation in both the Senate and {{the population as a}} whole, there has been only one Catholic Senate Chaplain since 1793, and not a single rabbi." [...] He noted [...] "Only eight denominations have been represented in the office." [...] In light of this Williams put forward Senate Resolution 90 which [...] "resulted in the Senate's decision to appoint a new chaplain annually, rather than let the incumbent serve for life." [...] The appointment would also [...] "rotate among the nation's three major religious groups." [...] When asked by reporters about the question of Constitutionality raised by his citing Madison he replied [...] "If this were tested, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could go either way. It could be declared unconstitutional. Any taxpayer could question this, but no one ever has." [...] He held that in places where people were isolated by acts of government, such as people in the armed services, hospitals or prisons that chaplains serving them would be Constitutional, [...] "But, I don't know anybody less isolated than members of Congress." [...] In following eras the courts would rule on the constitutionality of the chaplaincy.|$|E

In the meantime, my dear Plush, if you ask me what the great obstacle is towards the dramatic fame and merit of our friend, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not lie so much in hostile critics or feeble health, as in a careless habit of writing, and a peevish vanity which causes him to shut his eyes to his faults.

"If {{you would}} have my free opinion, my lord," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Oldbuck, [...] "and will not catch too rapidly at it as matter of hope, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is very possible the child yet lives. For thus much I ascertained, by my former inquiries concerning the event of that deplorable evening, that a child and woman were carried that night from the cottage at the Craigburnfoot in a carriage and four by your brother Edward Geraldin Neville, whose journey towards England with these companions I traced for several stages. I believed {{then it was a}} part of the family compact to carry a child whom you meant to stigmatize with illegitimacy, out of that country where chance might have raised protectors and proofs of its rights. But I now think that your brother, having reason, like yourself, to believe the child stained with shame yet more indelible, had nevertheless withdrawn it, partly from regard to the honour of his house, partly from the risk to which it might have been exposed in the neighbourhood of the Lady Glenallan." ...|$|E

Here is Abundance, a woman of exceeding usefulness in a newly-settled region, hath made Reuben a gift of three noble boys this very morning. The accession is little known, and less discoursed of, in that the good wife is accustomed to such liberality, and that the day hath brought forth still greater events. Now a child, more or less, to such a woman, can neither raise question among the neighbors, nor make any extraordinary difference to the household. My brother Ring would be happy to add the boy to his stock; and should there be any remarks concerning the color of the younker, at a future day, it should give no reason of surprise, had the whole four been born, on the day of such an inroad, red as Metacom himself!".|$|E

6000|$|... "Were {{the commons}} of England united, well armed, and disciplined, they could doubtless do so," [...] Edgar replied, quietly. [...] "I know not {{whether you are}} united, but {{certainly}} you are neither armed nor disciplined. We saw how little an undisciplined mass, even if well armed, can do against trained troops, when a few thousands of English soldiers defeated nigh twenty times their number at Poictiers. And I say that against a force of steel-clad knights and men-at-arms any number of men, however brave, if armed as these are, could make no stand. It {{would not be a}} battle--it would be a slaughter; therefore, while wishing you well, and admitting the full justice of your demands, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> were best for your own sakes, and for the sakes of those who love you, that you should conduct yourselves peaceably, so as to show all men that no harm can arise from granting you the charter you ask for, and in giving you all the rights and privileges of free men." ...|$|E
60|$|The rule I {{have adopted}} {{in my own}} case, is to defer to every usage, in matters of etiquette, so far as I have {{understood}} them, that belongs to {{the country in which}} I may happen to be. If, as has sometimes happened (but not in a solitary instance in France), the claims of a stranger have been overlooked, I have satisfied myself by remembering, that, in this respect at least, the Americans are the superiors, for that is a point in which we seldom fail; and if they are remembered, to accept of just as much attention as shall be offered. In cases, in which those arbitrary distinctions are set up, that, by the nature of our institutions cannot, either in similar or in any parallel cases, exist in America, and the party making the pretension is on neutral ground, if the claim be in any manner pressed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> became an American to resist it promptly; neither to go {{out of his way to}} meet it, nor to defer to it when it crosses his path. In really good society awkward cases of this nature are not very likely to occur; they are, however, more likely to occur as between our own people and the English, than between those of any other nation; for the latter, in mixed general associations, have scarcely yet learned to look upon and treat us as the possessors of an independent country. It requires perfect self-possession, great tact, and some nerve, for an American, who is brought much in contact with the English on the continent of Europe, to avoid a querulous and ungentlemanlike disposition to raise objections on these points, and at the same time to maintain the position, and command the respect, with which he should never consent to dispense. From my own little experience, I should say we are better treated, and have less to overlook, in our intercourse with the higher than with the intermediate classes of the English.|$|E
6000|$|Immediately {{following}} this last charge, {{there are several}} insinuations in the resolution, which are too silly to require any sort of notice, {{were it not for}} the fact that they conclude by saying, [...] "to the great injury of the people at large." [...] In answer to this <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is strange enough, that the people are suffering these [...] "great injuries," [...] and yet are not sensible of it! Singular indeed that the people should be writhing under oppression and injury, and yet not one among them to be found to raise the voice of complaint. If the Bank be inflicting injury upon the people, why is it that not a single petition is presented to this body on the subject? If the Bank really be a grievance, why is it that no one of the real people is found to ask redress of it? The truth is, no such oppression exists. If it did, our people would groan with memorials and petitions, and we would not be permitted to rest day or night, till we had put it down. The people know their rights, and they are never slow to assert and maintain them, when they are invaded. Let them call for an investigation, and I shall ever stand ready to respond to the call. But they have made no such call. I make the assertion boldly, and without fear of contradiction, that no man, who does not hold an office, or does not aspire to one, has ever found any fault of the Bank. It has doubled the prices of the products of their farms, and filled their pockets with a sound circulating medium, and they are all well pleased with its operations. No, Sir, it is the politician who is the first to sound the alarm (which, by the way, is a false one.) It is he, who, by these unholy means, is endeavoring to blow up a storm that he may ride upon and direct. It is he, and he alone, that here proposes to spend thousands of the people's public treasure, for no other advantage to them than to make valueless in their pockets the reward of their industry. Mr. Chairman, this work is exclusively the work of politicians; a set of men who have interests aside from the interests of the people, and who, to say the most of them, are, taken as a mass, at least one long step removed from honest men. I say this with the greater freedom, because, being a politician myself, none can regard it as personal.|$|E
