25|$|A {{turntable}} ladder (TL) {{is perhaps the}} best-known form of special purpose aerial apparatus, and is used {{to gain access to}} fires occurring at height using a large telescopic ladder, where conventional ladders carried on conventional appliances might not reach. The name is derived {{from the fact that the}} large ladder is mounted on a turntable on the back of a truck chassis, allowing it to pivot around a stable base. To increase its length, the ladder is telescopic. Modern telescopic ladders are either <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic.</b> These mechanical features allow the use of ladders which are longer, sturdier, and more stable. They may also have pre-attached hoses or other equipment.|$|E
500|$|Since 1995, all Community Transit buses are low-floored and {{equipped}} with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> [...] "kneeling" [...] device in addition to wheelchair lifts for 6-wheeled motorized wheelchairs. CT buses have also feature two bicycle racks located {{in front of the}} windshield since 1996; Swift bus rapid transit buses have three bicycle racks located inside the vehicle for reduced dwell times.|$|E
50|$|A {{fluid power}} system has a pump {{driven by a}} prime mover (such as an {{electric}} motor or internal combustion engine) that converts mechanical energy into fluid energy, Pressurized fluid is controlled and directed by valves into an actuator device such as a <b>hydraulic</b> cylinder <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder, to provide linear motion, <b>or</b> a <b>hydraulic</b> motor <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> motor, to provide rotary motion or torque. Rotary motion may be continuous or confined to less than one revolution.|$|R
50|$|An {{actuator}} {{requires a}} control signal {{and a source}} of energy. The control signal is relatively low energy and may be electric voltage <b>or</b> current, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic</b> pressure, <b>or</b> even human power. The supplied main energy source may be electric current, <b>hydraulic</b> fluid pressure, <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> pressure. When the control signal is received, the actuator responds by converting the energy into mechanical motion.|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic hybrid and {{pneumatic}} hybrid vehicles use an engine to charge a pressure accumulator {{to drive the}} wheels via <b>hydraulic</b> (liquid) <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> (compressed air) drive units. In most cases the engine is detached from the drivetrain, serving solely to charge the energy accumulator. The transmission is seamless. Regenerative braking {{can be used to}} recover some of the supplied drive energy back into the accumulator.|$|R
2500|$|Gravity feed saws {{fall under}} their own weight. [...] Most such saws have a method to allow the cutting force to be adjusted, such as a movable {{counterbalancing}} weight, a coil spring with a screw-thread adjustment, or a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> damper (speed control valve). The latter does not force the blade downwards, but rather simply limits {{the speed at which}} the saw can fall, preventing excessive feed on thin or soft parts. This is analogous to door closer hardware whose dampering action keeps the door from slamming. Gravity feed designs are common in small saws.|$|E
2500|$|Weight is {{commonly}} measured {{using one of}} two methods. A spring scale or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> scale measures local weight, the local force of gravity on the object (strictly apparent weight force). [...] Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object (the same mass) at different locations. [...] To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a nominal standard gravity of 9.80665m/s2 (approx. 32.174ft/s2). [...] However, this calibration is done at the factory. [...] When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, {{the force of gravity}} will be different, causing a slight error. [...] So to be highly accurate, and legal for commerce, spring scales must be re-calibrated at the location at which they will be used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tailhook}} is {{a strong}} metal bar, with its free end flattened out, thickened somewhat, and fashioned into a claw-like hook. [...] The hook is mounted on a swivel on the keel of the aircraft, and is normally mechanically and hydraulically held in the stowed/up position. [...] Upon actuation by the pilot, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> pressure lowers the hook to the down position. [...] The presence of a tailhook is not evidence of an aircraft's aircraft carrier suitability. [...] Carrier aircraft hooks {{are designed to be}} quickly raised by the pilot after use. [...] Many land-based fighters also have tailhooks for use in case of a brake/tire malfunctions, aborted takeoffs, or other emergencies. [...] Land-based aircraft landing gear and tailhooks are typically not strong enough to absorb the impact of a carrier landing, and some land-based tailhooks are held down with nitrogen pressure systems that must be recharged by ground personnel after actuation.|$|E
50|$|A robotic leg {{is moved}} by an actuator, {{which is a}} type of motor for moving or {{controlling}} a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, usually {{in the form of an}} electric current, <b>hydraulic</b> fluid pressure <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> pressure, and converts that energy into some kind of motion.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} years, target drones were often {{launched}} from aircraft; or off a rail using solid-fuel rocket assisted takeoff (RATO) boosters; <b>or</b> <b>hydraulic,</b> electromagnetic, <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> catapult. Very small target drones can be launched by an elastic bungee catapult. Few target drones have landing gear, {{and so they}} are generally recovered by parachute or, in some cases, by a skid landing. Beginning in April 1966, and lasting {{through the end of the}} war in 1975, the USAF successfully conducted approximately 2,655 Mid-Air Retrieval System (MARS) catches, out of 2,745 attempts, primarily using the Ryan 147J model drone.|$|R
5000|$|Telescopic {{cylinders}} are {{a special}} {{design of a}} <b>hydraulic</b> cylinder <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> cylinder which provide an exceptionally long output travel from a very compact retracted length. Typically the collapsed length of a telescopic cylinder is 20 to 40%of the fully extended length depending {{on the number of}} stages. Some pneumatic telescoping units are manufactured with retracted lengths of under 15% of overall extended unit length. [...] This feature is very attractive to machine design engineers when a conventional single stage rod style actuator will not fit in an application to produce the required output stroke.|$|R

50|$|External {{concrete}} vibrators attach, via {{a bracket}} or clamp system, {{to the concrete}} forms. There are {{a wide variety of}} external concrete vibrators available and some vibrator manufacturers have bracket or clamp systems designed to fit the major brands of concrete forms. External concrete vibrators are available in <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> electric power.|$|R
5000|$|In control theory, a {{controller}} is a device, historically using mechanical, <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> {{electronic techniques}} often in combination, but more {{recently in the}} form of a microprocessor or computer, which monitors and physically alters the operating conditions of a given dynamical system. [...] Typical applications of controllers are to hold settings for temperature, pressure, flow or speed.|$|R

50|$|An {{actuator}} is {{a device}} {{that is responsible for}} moving or controlling a mechanism or system. It is operated by a source of energy, which can be mechanical force, electrical current, <b>hydraulic</b> fluid pressure, <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> pressure, and converts that energy into motion. An actuator is the mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple (a fixed mechanical or electronic system), software-based (e.g. a printer driver, robot control system), a human, or any other input.|$|R
40|$|The {{clamping}} system (20) has one or multiple clamping devices (23) for receiving a component, where each clamping device has an adjustment medium (24 a to 24 d). The adjustment medium allows a linear or rotational adjustment, particular an adjustment to serially combined linear or rotational axes. The adjustment mediums are controlled in a <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>pneumatic,</b> <b>or</b> electric manner. An independent claim is also included for an automatic component alignment and tensioning system for receiving a component, particularly a large sheet workpiece...|$|R
50|$|Side-tipping wagons have <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> {{electric}} , {{that enables}} the wagon body to be lifted on one side. Depending on the design, they may be tipped to both sides or just one side only. In order to prevent wagons from falling over during the tipping operation, some are equipped with track pinch bars with which they can be securely anchored to the trackbed. These wagons are often seen in unit trains being used to remove excavated material from major construction sites.|$|R
50|$|Sensor-based sorting {{has been}} {{introduced}} by Wotruba and Harbeck as an umbrella term for all applications where particles are singularly detected by a sensor technique and then rejected by an amplified mechanical, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> process.|$|E
50|$|A camless or free-valve {{piston engine}} has poppet valves {{operated}} {{by means of}} electromagnetic, <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> actuators instead of cams. Actuators {{can be used to}} both open and close valves, or to open valves closed by springs or other means.|$|E
50|$|The opening or {{closing of}} {{automatic}} control valves is usually done by electrical, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> actuators. Normally with a modulating valve, {{which can be}} set to any position between fully open and fully closed, valve positioners are used to ensure the valve attains the desired degree of opening.|$|E
5000|$|Exact {{definition}} of a brassboard depends on the industry and has changed with time. A 1992 guide book on proposal preparation defined a brassboard or a breadboard as [...] "a laboratory or shop working model {{that may or may}} not look like the final product or system, but that will operate in the same way as the final system". The {{definition of}} abreadboard was further narrowed to purely electronic systems, while a brassboard was treated as [...] "a similar arrangement for <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> mechanically interconnected components".|$|R

The network voltage is expected to increase far above Paschen’s minimum, thus increasing the risk of partial discharges. Furthermore the use of inverter drives will be generalized and PD detection on square voltage powered equipments will become a mandatory challenge. The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose a method to denoise partial discharge signals embedded in the electromagnetic noise induced by switchings. This denoising is performed using the wavelet decomposition...|$|R
5000|$|A winch is a {{mechanical}} device {{that is used}} to pull in (wind up) or let out (wind out) or otherwise adjust the [...] "tension" [...] of a rope or wire rope (also called [...] "cable" [...] or [...] "wire cable"). In its simplest form it consists of a spool and attached hand crank. In larger forms, winches stand at the heart of machines as diverse as tow trucks, steam shovels and elevators. The spool can also be called the winch drum. More elaborate designs have gear assemblies and can be powered by electric, <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>pneumatic</b> <b>or</b> internal combustion drives. Some may include a solenoid brake and/or {{a mechanical}} brake or ratchet and pawl device that prevents it from unwinding unless the pawl is retracted.|$|R
5000|$|Researchers have {{attempted}} to overcome the difficulties of robotic components in MRI {{in a variety of}} ways; some have placed controls and other magnetic sensitive units outside the shielded room of the MRI.

50|$|Cable carriers, {{also known}} as drag chains, energy chains, or cable chains {{depending}} on the manufacturer, are guides designed to surround and guide flexible electrical cables and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> hoses connected to moving automated machinery. They reduce wear and stress on cables and hoses, prevent entanglement, and improve operator safety.|$|E
5000|$|These {{suspension}} modifications are {{in contrast}} to Lowriders with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> <b>pneumatic</b> suspensions. Lowriders use another type of suspension tuning in which the height of each individual wheel can be rapidly adjusted by a system of rams which, in some cases, {{makes it possible to}} [...] "bounce" [...] the wheels completely clear of the ground.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} multibody dynamic analysis of a mechanically interconnected suspension, as applied to a small off-road vehicle. Interconnected suspensions use some sort of connection between the axles of a vehicle in order improve ride quality or vehicle handling. In principle, the connection may be <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>pneumatic,</b> <b>or</b> mechanical, but for installation in a typical passenger car, a mechanical connection would likely be impractical due to weight and complexity. In this paper, the vehicle in question is the University of Windsor SAE Baja off-road competition vehicle, and novel mechanical design is proposed. A multibody dynamic analysis is performed on the proposed design using the EoM open source multibody software developed by the University of Windsor Vehicle Dynamics and Control research group {{in order to assess}} any potential performance improvements...|$|R
40|$|Shape-memory alloys {{are unique}} "smart materials" {{that can be}} used in a wide variety of {{adaptive}} or "intelligent" components. Because of a martensitic solid-state phase transformation in these materials, they can display rather unusual mechanical properties including shape-memory behavior. This phenomenon occurs when the material is deformed at low temperatures (below the martensite finish temperature, Mf) and then heated through the martensite-to-austenite phase transformation. As the material is heated to the austenite finish temperature Af, it is able to recover its predeformed shape. If a bias is applied to the material as it tries to recover its original shape, work can be extracted from the shape-memory alloy as it transforms. Therefore, shape-memory alloys are being considered for compact solid-state actuation devices to replace <b>hydraulic,</b> <b>pneumatic,</b> <b>or</b> motor-driven systems...|$|R

The network voltage is expected to increase far above Paschen’s minimum, thus increasing the risk of partial discharges. These discharges, known as silent enemies, may affect the reliability of the system. Moreover, some electrical equipments are located in unpressurized area and their operating conditions (temperature, pressure) may change in a large range. These environmental parameters (and their cycling) have an influence on discharge inception voltage and may even modify its nature. This paper deals with the influence of the pressure on partial discharges and especially on the modification of partial discharges spectra with pressure. Twisted pairs of enamel wires were subjected to repetitive square voltage waveform and sinusoidal voltage at various pressures...|$|R
