5|$|Although {{competitions}} are {{no longer}} held outdoors, the most important competitions (Olympics, World Championships, World Cups) are still scheduled for the Northern Hemisphere summer season because they are combined with outdoor events. Many lesser international events, however, are held during the European indoor season between October and March, culminating in the European Championships each year. Most of these competitions are multi-day events <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> air rifle matches.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Preclassic {{structures}} were built using volcanic stone <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> clay, {{as in the}} Middle Preclassic. However, they evolved to include stepped structures with indented corners and stairways dressed with rounded pebbles. At the same time, old Olmec-style sculptures were moved from their original positions and {{placed in front of}} the new-style buildings, sometimes reusing sculpture fragments in the stone facing.|$|E

5|$|Not {{much detail}} {{is known about}} Bhimsen Thapa's early life. At the age of 11, Bhimsen {{possibly}} {{came into contact with}} the Nepalese Royal Palace when his bratabandha ceremony was <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> the Crown Prince Rana Bahadur's in Gorkha in 1785. In 1798, his father took him to Kathmandu and enrolled him as a bodyguard to the king. In Kathmandu, Bhimsen took up residence at Thapathali Durbar, after which he lived in Bagh Durbar near Tundikhel after becoming a kaji (equivalent to a minister).|$|E
5|$|The {{floor of}} the barn was {{originally}} made of hard-packed flint gravel <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which {{was used as a}} more readily available alternative to stone. In subsequent years it was repaired with brick, tile and, ultimately, cement, obscuring the original appearance of the floor. An indication of how it would have looked can still be obtained from the outside of {{the west side of the}} barn.|$|E
5|$|Structure 12 lies to {{the east}} of Structure11. It has also been {{excavated}} and, like Structure11, it is covered with rounded boulders <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> clay. It lies {{to the east}} of the plaza in the southern area of the Central Group. The structure is a three-tiered platform with stairways on the east and west sides. The visible remains date to the Early Classic but they overlie Late Preclassic construction. A row of sculptures lines {{the west side of the}} structure, including six monuments, a stela and an altar. Further monuments line the east side, one of which may be the head of a crocodilian, the others are plain. Sculpture69 is located on the south side of the structure.|$|E

5|$|The helmet was too fragile to be {{excavated}} in situ so it {{was removed}} within a block of earth <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> plaster of Paris. It {{was taken to the}} British Museum in London for conservation, which took nine years of work by conservator Marilyn Hockey and her colleagues Fleur Shearman and Duygu Çamurcuoğlu. Corrosion and the effects of time had shattered the helmet into thousands of pieces, most of which were smaller than the nail on a person's little finger. The reconstructed and conserved helmet was unveiled in January 2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E
5|$|An adult {{dragonfly}} {{has three}} distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen {{as in all}} insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It {{is dominated by the}} two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The facets facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet {{at the top of the}} head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This arrester system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.|$|E

The first offering as svaha is to prana by holding the little finger or Kanishtika and the thumb together; the second offering is with the ring finger or anamika and the thumb <b>held</b> <b>together</b> to Apana; <b>with</b> the middle finger and the thumb <b>held</b> <b>together</b> to Vyana; <b>with</b> all fingers <b>together</b> to Udana; and with the forefinger and thumb together to Samana.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{technique}} for sewing panels together {{is called the}} French felled, French fell, or double lap seam. The two pieces of fabric are folded over on each other at their common edge, possibly with a load tape as well, and sewn <b>together</b> <b>with</b> two rows of parallel stitching. Other methods include a flat lap seam, {{in which the two}} pieces of fabric are <b>held</b> <b>together</b> simply <b>with</b> two rows of parallel stitching, and a zigzag, where parallel zigzag stitching holds a double lap of fabric.|$|R
5|$|Two more {{distinctive}} stone tombs {{were built}} beside the Fitomiandalana, {{to the north}} of Tranovola, the first of which was completed in 1828 by Louis Gros for RadamaI. Further north, the second tomb was originally built for Queen Rasoherina by James Cameron in 1868. Both of these stone tombs were topped with a tomb house. Radama's tomb bears features popularised during the reign of his father, Andrianampoinimerina: three superimposed levels (excluding the tomb house) with upright sheets of stone at the base level, one of which could be removed to provide access to the subterranean chamber where the sovereign's body was laid upon a massive stone slab. Radama's tomb house broke with tradition by replacing the usual miniaturised version of the aristocratic wooden house (typified by Besakana and other ancient houses in the Rova grounds) with a house featuring a veranda, an architectural novelty introduced during his reign. The roof of this tomb house was originally thatch made from rushes but was replaced in the 1850s with wooden shingles, an innovation introduced from nearby Reunion Island or Mauritius. By contrast, the tomb of Rasoherina, erected forty years later, featured a two-level base (excluding the tomb house) made of chiselled stone blocks <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> cement.|$|E
25|$|The sagittarius {{was armed}} with the bow (arcus), {{shooting}} an arrow (sagitta) with a composite bow, made of horn, wood, and sinew <b>held</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> hide glue. However, Vegetius recommended training recruits arcubus ligneis, with wooden bows. The reinforcing laths for the composite bows were found throughout the empire, even in the western provinces where wooden bows were traditional.|$|E
