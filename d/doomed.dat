5|$|Ramanuja's Vishishtadvaita {{school and}} Shankara's Advaita school are both nondualism Vedanta schools, both are {{premised on the}} {{assumption}} that all souls can hope for and achieve the state of blissful liberation; in contrast, Madhvacharya believed that some souls are eternally <b>doomed</b> and damned.|$|E
5|$|Seemingly <b>doomed</b> to death, Kamo {{then had}} the good luck along with other prisoners to have his {{sentence}} commuted to a long prison term {{as part of the}} celebrations of the Romanov dynasty tricentennial in 1913.

50|$|On October 1, 1996, a port {{containing}} levels from Master Levels for <b>Doom</b> II and Final <b>Doom</b> {{was released}} for the PlayStation {{under the name}} Final <b>Doom.</b> The PlayStation version of Final <b>Doom</b> has thirteen levels from Master Levels for <b>Doom</b> II, eleven levels from TNT: Evilution, and six levels from The Plutonia Experiment. Like the PlayStation version of <b>Doom,</b> Final <b>Doom</b> uses passwords. Unlike the PlayStation version of <b>Doom,</b> support for the PlayStation Mouse peripheral is available for Final <b>Doom.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many level editors are {{available}} for <b>Doom.</b> The original <b>Doom</b> Editing Utility (DEU) was ported {{to a number of}} operating systems, but lost significance over time; many modern <b>Doom</b> editors still have their roots in DEU and its editing paradigm, including DETH, DeePsea, Linux <b>Doom</b> Editor, and Yadex. Other level editors include WadAuthor, <b>Doom</b> Builder (released in January 2003), and <b>Doom</b> Builder 2 (released in May 2009 as the successor to <b>Doom</b> Builder). Some <b>Doom</b> level editors, such as <b>Doom</b> Builder and <b>Doom</b> Builder 2, feature a 3D editing mode. As of now those two are discontinued, but a newer fork has been released and is regularly updated, known as GZDoom Builder.|$|R

5|$|Without the railway, Wason saw {{his project}} as <b>doomed,</b> and sold up in 1900. A rural mail service was {{discussed}} for the Ashburton District in September 1924 {{and after the}} contracts were let in February 1925, the Barrhill post office was closed. The school closed in 1938.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} her wedding, the Second Sino-Japanese War erupted. The Imperial Japanese Army {{attacked}} Shanghai in August 1937, {{and the national}} capital Nanking in December. Tang's older brother, General Tang Shengzhi, was the chief commander of the <b>doomed</b> defense of Nanking, {{which resulted in the}} Nanking Massacre. Tang Shengming, meanwhile, was the deputy commander of Changsha and chief commander of Changde, both in Hunan province.|$|E
5|$|Any counterattack or {{relief effort}} {{contemplated}} by the South Vietnamese was <b>doomed</b> {{by the thousands}} of refugees that took to the roads in order to escape the fighting. Desertion among South Vietnamese units became common, as soldiers began disappearing from the ranks in search of family members. This pattern was to become too common as the offensive continued, not just among the territorial forces, but among the regular troops.|$|E

50|$|In What If Doctor <b>Doom</b> Were Sorcerer Supreme? A young Victor Von <b>Doom</b> {{does not}} {{stay with the}} hidden sect of monks in the Himalayas but {{continues}} on to find the Ancient One. The Ancient One immediately sees <b>Doom's</b> vast potential and hopes that by taking him on as a student he can teach <b>Doom</b> humility and channel his talent away from evil. <b>Doom's</b> fellow student, Mordo, is threatened by <b>Doom's</b> vastly superior talent and plans to kill off the competition. <b>Doom</b> easily turns the table on Mordo and plants a small bomb in his skull as insurance against further treachery. The Ancient One fears that <b>Doom</b> is growing into a dangerous power and so decides to conclude their relationship by taking <b>Doom</b> to the Mephisto's realm to rescue <b>Doom's</b> mother. Later <b>Doom</b> dies and transfers his memories into Doctor Strange (in this universe he is only a surgeon).|$|R
5|$|As the {{demographics}} of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was <b>doomed</b> to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains.|$|E
5|$|Authors Joyce Murdoch and Deb Pryce {{say another}} {{effect of the}} case was a {{softening}} of the Court's attitude towards the gay community. Jacobson was the first such person to come before the Court to receive even the slightest empathy from it, {{and even a few}} years earlier his case might have been <b>doomed</b> from the start on that basis alone.|$|E
5|$|Breton {{folklore}} {{holds that}} storm petrels are {{the spirits of}} sea-captains who mistreated their crew, <b>doomed</b> to spend eternity flying over the sea, and they are also held to be the souls of drowned sailors. A sailing superstition holds that {{the appearance of a}} storm petrel foretells bad weather. Sinister names from Britain and France include waterwitch, satanite, satanique and oiseau du diable.|$|E

5|$|By March 1942, the Japanese {{invasion}} of the Philippines had compelled MacArthur to withdraw his forces on Luzon to Bataan, while his headquarters and {{his family moved to}} Corregidor. The <b>doomed</b> defense of Bataan captured the imagination of the American public. At a time when the news from all fronts was uniformly bad, MacArthur became a living symbol of Allied resistance to the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the {{uprising}} was <b>doomed</b> by poor communication and the overeagerness {{of some of}} the PMO activists. Piłsudski failed to discourage local PMO activists from carrying out the Sejny Uprising in the Suwałki Region. The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched {{the uprising}}, which while locally successful, led to the failure of the nationwide coup. PMO members in Lithuania stated that the Sejny uprising had damaged their reputation, and many of its former supporters rejected calls by PMO recruiters.|$|E
5|$|However, {{through the}} written {{dialogue}} in his diary, Choe did express slight {{differences between the}} cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him {{whether or not the}} Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of the Classics and not all five of them was <b>doomed</b> to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.|$|E

5|$|I {{believe in}} all sincerity {{that if you}} do not deflate the {{opposition}} candidate before your own campaign gets started, the odds are you are <b>doomed</b> to defeat.

5|$|Phu's {{excessive}} {{preoccupation with}} secrecy, however, <b>doomed</b> the effort from the beginning. Operational planning was limited {{only to a}} few trusted subordinates who had either contributed to or knew about it. Staff work was non-existent. The {{chief of staff of}} II Corps, for example, admitted that he was completely in the dark about the planned abandonment of Pleiku and Kon Tum. Command of the convoy itself was handed over to the commander of the II Corps Rangers.|$|E
