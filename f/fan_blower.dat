40|$|From all fossil fuels, {{natural gas}} {{has the lowest}} carbon to {{hydrogen}} ratio, which enables Gas Turbines (GTs) running on natural gas to produce electricity with the lowest CO 2 emissions per produced kWh. These lower emissions have pushed power production towards natural gas. However, {{if we want to}} move towards a carbon clean power production, the carbon in the exhaust must be captured. This leads to a major challenge since the low CO 2 concentration in the exhaust of a GT makes carbon capture much more expensive compared to coal fired power production. The CO 2 concentration can be increased by performing Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). However, EGR on GT cycles negatively affects the efficiency. Using the concept of Humid Air Turbine (HAT), we investigate whether the efficiency losses can be compensated by introducing water in the cycle. This paper presents this novel approach by showing the impact of EGR on a flexible humidified micro Gas Turbine (mGT). It is based on results of simulations performed in Aspen® using the Turbec T 100 mGT as reference case. Both the dry and wet operation of the Turbec T 100 were simulated and validated with experimental results. For improved carbon capture, EGR was simulated in both the dry and the humidified mGT cycle. Simulation results indicate that EGR has no effect on the thermodynamic performance of the mGT and its components (compressor, turbine and recuperator), however efficiency is reduced significantly (up to 3. 8 % relative at nominal power output) because of additional losses to the <b>fan</b> <b>blower</b> installed to ensure the EGR. Additionally, the cycle performance strongly depends on the degree of cooling of the EGR stream before injection in the compressor inlet. Nevertheless, the simulation results also reveal that mGT humidification increases the total cycle efficiency, entirely compensating the EGR induced losses. Humidifying the mGT with EGR even leads to a higher electric efficiency than the standard mGT cycle, unlocking the idea of carbon capture in mGTs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} using a dry, density-based {{separator}} to achieve efficient, near-face rock removal, {{commonly referred to as}} deshaling, was evaluated in several applications across the U. S [...] Varying amounts of high-density rock exist in most run-of-mine feed. In the central Appalachian coalfields, a rock content exceeding 50 % in the feed to a preparation plant is commonplace due to high amounts of out-of-seam dilution made necessary by extracting coal from thin seams. In the western U. S, an increase in out-of-seam dilution and environmental regulations associated with combustion emissions have resulted in a need to clean low rank coals and dry cleaning may be the only option. A 5 ton/hr mobile deshaling unit incorporating a density-based, air-table technology commercially known as the FGX Separator has been evaluated at mine sites located within the states of Utah, Wyoming, Texas, West Virginia, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The FGX technology utilizes table riffling principles with air as the medium. Air enters through the table and creates a fluidized bed of particles comprised of mostly fine, high density particles. The high density particle bed lifts the low-density coal particles {{to the top of the}} bed. The low-density coal moves toward the front of the table due to mass action and the downward slope of the table. The high-density particles settle through the fluidized particle bed and, upon making contact with the table, moves toward the back of the table with the assistance of table vibration. As a result, the low-density coal particles exit the front of the table closest to the feed whereas the high-density, high-ash content particles leave on the side and front of the table located at the farthest from the feed entry. At each test site, the run-of-mine feed was either directly fed to the FGX unit or pre-screened to remove the majority of the - 6 mm material. The surface moisture of the feed must be maintained below 9 %. Pre-screening is required when the surface moisture of the feed coal exceeds the maximum limit. However, the content of - 6 mm in the feed to the FGX separator should be maintained between 10 % and 20 % to ensure an adequate fluidized bed. A parametric evaluation was conducted using a 3 -level experimental design at each test site to identify the optimum separation performance and parameter values. The test data was used to develop empirical expressions that describe the response variables (i. e., mass yield and product ash content) as a function of the operating parameter values. From this process, it was established that table frequency and longitudinal slope are the most critical factors in controlling both mass yield and clean coal ash while the cross table slope was the least significant. <b>Fan</b> <b>blower</b> frequency is a critical parameter that controls mass yield. Although the splitter positions between product and middling streams and the middling and tailing streams were held constant during the tests, a separate evaluation indicated that performance is sensitive to splitter position within certain lengths of the table and insensitive in others. For a Utah bituminous coal, the FGX separator provided clean coal ash contents that ranged from a low of 8. 57 % to a high of 12. 48 % from a feed coal containing around 17 % ash. From the 29 tests involved in the statistically designed test program, the average clean coal ash content was 10. 76 % while the tailings ash content averaged around 72 %. One of the best separation performances achieved an ash reduction from 17. 36 % to 10. 67 % while recovering 85. 9 % of the total feed mass, which equated to an ash rejection value of around 47 %. The total sulfur content was typically decreased from 1. 61 % to 1. 49 %. These performances were quantified by blending the middlings stream with the clean coal product. At a second Utah site, coal sources from three different bituminous coal seams were treated by the FGX deshaling unit. Three parameter values were varied based on the results obtained from Site No. 1 to obtain the optimum results shown in Table E- 1. Approximately 9 tests were performed on each coal source. The average ash content reductions were: Glenwal (= 25. 6 % to 8. 6 %), Pinnacle (= 17. 3 % to 9. 0 %) and Westridge (= 20. 6 % to 7. 5 %). Under optimum conditions, nearly 70 % of the high-density rock was rejected while recovering approximately 100 % of the 1. 60 float material. In the Powder River Basin, a small portion of the extracted coal is mistakenly diluted with out-of-seam rock. Since coal cleaning is not currently practiced, the diluted coal containing 20 %- 30 % ash is left in the pit as fill material, thereby representing a lost resource. A FGX test program conducted on the high ash sub-bituminous coal revealed the ability to produce clean coal containing 7 %- 8 % ash on a dry basis (5 %- 6 % on an as-received basis) with 62 % recovery. The product grade meets typical end user contract specifications for PRB coal...|$|E
