25|$|The first {{peacekeeping}} mission {{was launched in}} 1948. This mission, the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO), {{was sent to the}} newly created State of Israel, where a conflict between the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Arab states over the creation of Israel had just reached a ceasefire. The UNTSO remains in operation to this day, although the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict has certainly not abated. Almost a year later, the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) was authorized to monitor relations between the two nations, which were split off from each other following the United Kingdom's decolonization of the Indian subcontinent.|$|E
25|$|According to Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, as of February 2013, of Israel's 8 million people, 75.4% were Jews of any background.

Nearly {{half of all}} Israeli Jews are descended from Jews who made aliyah from Europe, while around the same number are descended from Jews who made aliyah from Arab countries, Iran, Turkey and Central Asia. Over two hundred thousand are, or are descended from, Ethiopian and Indian Jews.|$|E
25|$|On 5 June 1967 the Six-Day War {{began after}} an Israeli strike wiped out Egypt's Air Force. The Egyptian army {{commander}} in Cairo transmitted to General Riad that the Israeli strike had failed, and that Israel's Air Force was almost wiped out. Based {{on the information}} from Cairo, Riad ordered the Jordanian army to take offensive positions and attack Israeli targets around Jerusalem. Jordanian Hawker Hunters made sorties but were destroyed by Israel {{when they went to}} refuel; Syria's and Iraq's air forces followed. Israel's air superiority {{on the first day of}} war proved decisive. Two Israeli jets attempted to assassinate Hussein; one was shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the other shot directly at Hussein's office in the royal palace. Hussein was not there, the CIA director in Amman Jack O'Connell relayed a message threatening the <b>Israelis,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attempts stopped. The Jordanians had prepared a war strategy, but the Egyptian commander preferred to build his strategy based on information from Egypt.|$|E

2500|$|Clayton Swisher wrote a {{rebuttal}} to Clinton and Ross's accounts {{about the}} causes for {{the breakdown of the}} Camp David Summit in his 2004 book, The Truth About Camp David. Swisher, the Director of Programs at the Middle East Institute, concluded that the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Americans were at least as guilty as the Palestinians for the collapse. M.J. Rosenberg praised the book: [...] "Clayton Swisher's 'The Truth About Camp David,' based on interviews with [...] Martin Indyk, Dennis Ross and [...] Miller himself provides a comprehensive and acute account – the best we're likely to see – on the [...] Miller describes." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his book, The Oslo Syndrome, Harvard Medical School {{professor}} of psychiatry and historian Kenneth Levin summarized {{the failure of the}} 2000 Camp David Summit in this manner: [...] "espite the dimensions of the Israeli offer and intense pressure from President Clinton, Arafat demurred. [...] He apparently was indeed unwilling, no matter what the Israeli concessions, to sign an agreement that declared itself final and forswore any further Palestinian claims." [...] Levin argues that both the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Americans were naive in expecting that Arafat would agree to give up the idea of a literal [...] "right of return" [...] for all Palestinians into Israel proper no matter how many 1948 refugees or how much monetary compensation Israel offered to allow.|$|E
2500|$|Cain {{supports}} Israel, {{and believes}} that the US should aid Israel in defending itself. [...] After President Obama said that {{the starting point of}} negotiations for peace between the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians should be based on the 1967 borders with mutually agreed-upon land swaps, Cain said: I was shocked at the president's position, and I was equally shocked that he would unilaterally suggest that Israel would move the borders back which they acquired 44 years ago. [...] This president threw Israel under the bus, there is no way around it. It demonstrates once again the arrogant disregard of this president for the opinion of the American people who like the relationship we have with Israel, and for Israel having the right to make its own decisions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} Obama never {{mentioned}} the word [...] "terrorism" [...] or [...] "terror" [...] was positively interpreted {{by many in}} the Muslim street, given that many of them see a 'war on terror' interchangeably as a 'war on Islam'. American conservatives also picked up on this and argued that it weakened Obama's overall message. House Republican leader John Boehner also commented after the speech that Obama [...] "seemed to place equal blame on the <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Palestinians.... I have concerns about that because Hamas is a terrorist organisation". As well, he said, [...] "here he continues to say he will sit down with the Iranians without any preconditions, I just think that that puts us in a position where America looks weak in the eyes of their rulers." ...|$|E

The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well.

2500|$|J Street {{endorsed}} the nuclear disarmament deal with Iran, which Obama supported and Netanyahu and AIPAC opposed. In 2016 the political focus of J Street was to unseat Republican senators who led U.S. Congressional {{opposition to the}} Iran deal. When The Forward solicited opinions of the completed Iran deal from American Jewish organizations, some were critical, but J Street stated: [...] "For {{the first time in}} nearly a decade, Iran does not have the nuclear material needed to build even a single bomb. That makes Americans, <b>Israelis</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Iranian people themselves immeasurably safer.... That Iran has completed these steps—and granted international inspectors the unprecedented access necessary to verify and continuously monitor compliance on an ongoing basis—in an unexpectedly short period of time is further proof of the power of tough, effective diplomacy in addressing some of our most serious security concerns." ...|$|E
