40|$|Researchers in {{cognitive}} neuroscience have used brain-imaging methods (e. g., EEG, fMRI) {{to investigate the}} neural correlates of creative cognition and have found increased activity in the alpha frequency band (Fink et al., 2009 a, 2009 b; Martindale, 1975), however few studies have used neuroscientific measures to investigate artistic creativity. Such studies are valuable because they share a characteristic of ecological validity. In this study I used EEG, the Alternate Uses Test (Guilford, 1967), and the Consensual Assessment Technique (Amabile, 1982) to substantiate a conceptualization of creativity as a mental state characterized by a distinct pattern of neural activity. The participants were musicians with and without previous formal institutional training in improvisation. Amongst those with previous training, <b>frontal</b> <b>upper</b> alpha synchronization in the right hemisphere was greater when musicians improvised than when they played back and listened to melodies. Originality scores correlated with <b>frontal</b> <b>upper</b> alpha synchronization in the right hemisphere during improvisation, and <b>frontal</b> <b>upper</b> alpha synchronization in the right hemisphere correlated with expert ratings of created products. The relationship of <b>frontal</b> <b>upper</b> alpha synchronization in the right hemisphere during improvisation {{and the quality of}} created products was mediated by aptitude for originality. This suggests that training acts as a pathway for the development of creative gifts into creative talents observable in the quality of created products...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} on the tension crack {{occurring in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of rock slopes, barodynamics experiment using models representing rock slope was performed, and tensile strain on <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> was measured. Results obtained by this experiment were examined by elasto-plastic analysis using FEM. By both barodynamics experiment and theoretical analysis following conclusions were obtained:(1) In case of vertical slope, horizontal strain near <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> is always tensile strain, and its magnitude increases as slope height increases. (2) In case θ≦ 80 ℃, horizontal strain near the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> is compressive strain when slope height is small. As slope height increases, compression failure near the toe of slope causes increase in compressive strain near the <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b> When slope failure occurs the horizontal strain near the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> suddenly turns into tensile strain. By these facts, {{it can be seen}} that slope failure occurs progressively from the toe of slope...|$|R

30|$|In the circle/Hopf {{bursting}} {{as illustrated}} in Fig.  67 of [15], there are depolarized plateaus on the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> alternating with episodes of hyperpolarized silence on the lower surface. Transitions between these “up” and “down” states are caused by fold, or saddle node, bifurcations {{at the edges of}} the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>surfaces.</b> The circle (SNIC) and Hopf bifurcations that initiate and terminate spiking both occur on the <b>upper</b> <b>surface,</b> so the sequence of bifurcation starting with spike initiation is SNIC-HB-SN-SN, and there are nonspiking, silent periods before and after spiking on the <b>upper</b> <b>surface,</b> as well as during the entire trajectory on the lower surface. In the fold/Hopf bursting {{as illustrated in}} Fig.  63 of [15], spiking is initiated on the fold of the lower surface causing a jump to the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> and termination on the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> via a Hopf bifurcation, followed by a quiescent period of depolarization block, so the bifurcation scheme is SN-HB-SN.|$|R
