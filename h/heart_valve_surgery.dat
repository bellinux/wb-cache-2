40|$|Global {{myocardial}} ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion injury {{are potential}} adverse events related with cardioplegic arrest. Beating heart surgery has avoided such complications and adapted to <b>valve</b> <b>surgery</b> following successful results published on myocardial revascularization. Difficulty in weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass may be lessened by using on-pump beating <b>heart</b> <b>surgery</b> for mitral <b>valve</b> interventions. Here we describe a 64 -year-old male patient with severe mitral regurgitation and dilated cardiomyopathy. Beating <b>heart</b> mitral <b>valve</b> replacement <b>surgery</b> was performed without aortic cross-clamping through a right thoracotomy approach.

40|$|We hereby {{present a}} {{technical}} modification for mitral-aortic annular enlargement. The mitral valve is replaced through the retro-septal approach, avoiding patches for left atrial roof closure. We report a mitral-aortic valve replacement {{in a patient}} whose original annuli would preclude adequate prostheses. The simultaneous annular enlargement may be necessary for avoiding patient-prosthesis mismatch and for reconstructing destroyed mitral and aortic annuli. The technique may {{minimize the risk of}} bleeding and of paravalvular leakage, using an approach well known to cardiac surgeons.

40|$|The {{development}} of vascular and <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> <b>surgeries</b> {{have contributed to}} improve outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. However, there are drawbacks, such as risk of infection and lack of growth potential. Tissue engineered vascular graft (TEVG) and tissue engineered <b>heart</b> <b>valve</b> (TEHV) hold great promise to address these drawbacks as the ideal TEVG and TEHV is easily implanted, biocompatible, non thrombogenic, durable, degradable, and ultimately remodels into nativelike tissue. In general, the TEVG and/or TEHV concept consists of scaffold, cells for scaffold seeding, and a subsequent remodeling process driven by cell accumulation and proliferation, and/or biochemical and mechanical signaling. Despite rapid progress in the field over the past decade, small-diameter arterial TEVG and TEHV have not been translated into clinical applications successfully. To successfully utilize TEVGs and TEHVs clinically, further elucidation of the mechanisms for TEVG and TEHV remodeling and further translational research outcome evaluations will be required...|$|R
