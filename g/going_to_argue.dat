But in its way it is a {{thoughtful}} and entertaining one, especially {{in comparison with the}} pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: [...] "It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support." [...] Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: [...] "... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as [...] "unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted" [...] von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that [...] "even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing". She concluded of the film's overall pace, [...] "The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, [...] " [...] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn’t much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was." [...] Lane thought that there was [...] "too much" [...] character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, [...] "These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis." ...|$|E

Conversely, journalist Damien Shields stated in 2015 that Rooney had Lopez record the song in 1998, and that it had already been allocated to her when Jackson heard it.

40|$|This article {{approaches}} {{the question of}} whether terrorism “works” and argues that an examination of some of terrorism’s more “modest” effects can contribute to the way we analyse its overall effectiveness and strategic impact. The article looks at whether terrorist violence has brought “disorientation” to European societies and led states to launch repressive counterterrorist operations. Its main empirical focus is a comparison of Britain’s and France’s responses to contemporary jihadist terrorism. It examines the extent to which we can understand these cases from a rational choice perspective, before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that a state’s responses to terrorism are filtered through certain domestic societal norms in each country that determine whether or not terrorist violence leads to a repressive response from governments. This has implications for the way we analyse the interaction between terrorists and the state, as well as the effectiveness of terrorism itself...|$|R

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{acknowledged}} that social theorists {{can make an}} important contribution to our understanding of environmental risk. There is however a danger that the current ascendancy of social theory will encourage a tendency to assimilate issues around environmental risk to those at stake in entrenched debates between realist and constructivist social theorists. I begin by citing a recent example of this trend, before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that framing the issues in terms of a monism/pluralism dichotomy would make for a more informative analysis. Noting that realists and constructivists can make common cause against risk monism, I turn, {{in the second half of}} the paper, to setting out a positive case for risk pluralism. Citing some fictional examples of risk behaviour, I show how different individuals might rationally adopt different perspectives on the same risk. I conclude by exploring some implications of the truth of risk pluralism for two current approaches to environmental decision-making (which I term, respectively, the 'teleological-pluralistic' approach, and the 'economic-monistic' approach). I argue that the importance of risk pluralism lies in its capacity to highlight the shortcomings of the latter approach. pluralism, monism, realism, insurance, risk...|$|R
30|$|There {{are just}} two {{justifications}} for two-tier bargaining in Boeri’s schema. First, sectoral agreements could be retained for those firms where plant-level bargaining does not take place. Second, and more positively, there is scope for multi-employer agreements that set rules rather than wage changes to be applied uniformly to all firms irrespective of their performance. Somewhat reminiscent of some modern Scandinavian practice, the rules in question would govern the proportion of operational value added <b>going</b> <b>to</b> workers. He <b>argues</b> that these reforms would provide a (better) means of reconciling microeconomic flexibility with macroeconomic stability than two-tier bargaining per se. But to repeat, whether multi-level bargaining as currently practiced might be an intermediate step in this direction or whether it can be construed as pursuing decentralization consistent with single-employer bargaining while preserving degrees of freedom in macro adjustment is nowhere addressed.|$|R

Troup complains to Barttelot that Jameson is always absent during floggings and has always voted against them, {{on the grounds that}} enough of the porters are dying from disease already. Ward returns and says he is coming round to Jameson's point of view, and suggests they should try not flogging for a while. Troup agrees, but Bartellot is adamant that they should continue with the floggings, from which many people now have died. Jameson returns with no confirmation of Tippu Tib being near, but he has seen the remains of a cannibal feast. Troup demands that they talk about what they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>arguing</b> that Stanley couldn't possibly want them to wait indefinitely, particularly as medical supplies are running low.

40|$|According to Uriah Kriegel’s self-representational {{theory of}} {{conscious}}ness, mental state M is conscious {{just in case}} it is a complex with suitably integrated proper parts, M 1 and M 2, such that M 1 is a higher-order representation of lower-order representation M 2. Kriegel claims that M thereby “indirectly” represents itself, and he attempts to motivate this claim by appealing to what he regards as intuitive cases of indirect perceptual and pictorial representation. For example, Kriegel claims that it’s natural {{to say that in}} directly perceiving the front surface of an apple one thereby perceives the apple itself. Cases such as this are supposed to provide intuitive support for the principle that if X represents Y, and Y is highly integrated into complex object Z, then X indirectly represents Z.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the definition {{and management of}} creativity in the 'creative industries'. Initially the paper sets out the economic and cultural context {{for the emergence of}} the creative industries, before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>argue</b> that there are gaps in our understanding of the role of creativity and particularly the management of creativity within these industries. Based on research undertaken with new media SMEs in the North West of England, the paper then explores the ways in which creativity is defined and managed within this sub-sector. It is shown that the meanings attached to creativity are variable and contested and that the precise definition and management of creativity is strongly determined by the internal workplace culture, and the external social and economic conditions within which firms operate. It is further suggested that while creativity is often seen as a 'must have' attribute for new media firms it may also, conversely, be considered a barrier to commercial success. The paper concludes that if we are to understand work and production in the creative industries, and offer institutional support for firms to develop and sustain creativity for competitive advantage, {{it may be necessary to}} develop a more detailed understanding of the role of creativity and creative management as both a general and specific, socially embedded process...|$|R
