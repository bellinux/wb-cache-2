5|$|Mole crickets {{have three}} life stages, eggs, nymphs, and adults. Most {{of their life}} in these stages is spent underground, but adults have wings and {{disperse}} in the breeding season. They vary in their diet; some species are vegetarian, mainly feeding on roots, others are omnivores, including worms and grubs in their diet, while a few are largely predatory. Male mole crickets have an exceptionally loud song; they sing from a subsurface burrow that opens out into {{the air in the}} shape of an <b>exponential</b> <b>horn.</b> The song is an almost pure tone, modulated into chirps. It is used to attract females, either for mating, or for indicating favourable habitats for them to lay their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double <b>exponential</b> <b>horn</b> with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E

The old sound box with its needle-linked diaphragm was replaced by an electromagnetic pickup that converted the needle vibrations into an electrical signal.

40|$|International audienceISMA 11 Homogeneity of {{emission}} and timbre {{of musical}} instruments {{is a difficult}} issue. Intuitively it {{can be related to}} the regularity of the geometry, even if this relation is another difficult issue. The present talk aims at contribute to the discussion about the regularity of both woodwind and brass instruments. Benade published a paper in 1960 where woodwinds were modeled as periodic media with regular toneholes. In 1974, with Jansson, he compared bells of brass instruments and <b>exponential</b> <b>horns.</b> He had a particular interest in both the definition and the effects of cutoff frequencies for wind instruments. Recently we discussed a definition of acoustic regularity in the context of woodwinds. This work is first summarized, then some open questions are discussed concerning instruments with toneholes and with bells, starting with an analogy between <b>exponential</b> <b>horns</b> and periodic lattice of toneholes...|$|R
25|$|The <b>exponential</b> <b>horn</b> has an {{acoustic}} loading property {{that allows the}} speaker driver to remain evenly balanced in output level over its frequency range. The benefits of the design were first published by C.R. Hanna and J. Slepian in 1924 for the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). A major drawback is that the <b>exponential</b> <b>horn</b> allows for a narrowing of the radiation pattern as frequency increases, making for high frequency 'beaming' on axis and dull sound off axis. Another concern is that a throat of small diameter is needed for high efficiency at high frequencies but a larger throat is best for low frequencies. A common solution is to use two or more horns, each with the appropriate throat size, mouth size and flare rate for best performance in a selected frequency range, with sufficient overlap between the frequency ranges to provide a smooth transition between horns. Another solution tried in the late 1930s by Harry F. Olson of RCA was to use multiple exponential flare rates, either by connecting increasingly larger horns in series or by subdividing {{the interior of a}} single horn. Exponential horns continue to be used by some designers, and in some applications.|$|E

2500|$|The tractrix horn is {{very similar}} in many respects to the <b>exponential</b> <b>horn</b> and has gained adherents among DIY horn enthusiasts, audiophile consumers, and now some {{manufactures}} as well. [...] It uses a curve formula derived by assuming that a tangent to any point on the horn's inner curve will reach the central axis of the horn with a line segment of set length. At the mouth, the tangent line segment becomes perpendicular to the axis and describes the radius of the mouth. This horn concept was studied by Paul G.A.H. Voigt in the mid-1920s and patented in 1927. The size of the tractrix horn is generated by specifying the desired low frequency [...] "cutoff" [...] or limit which will determine the mouth diameter. Two incremental improvements over the <b>exponential</b> <b>horn</b> include slightly better support for low frequency extension and a somewhat broader high-frequency coverage pattern.|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} symmetrical, narrow dispersion, usually <b>exponential</b> <b>horns</b> can be {{combined}} in an array driven by a single driver to produce multicell horns. Patented in 1936 by Edward C. Wente of Western Electric, multicell horns {{have been used in}} loudspeakers since 1933 {{to address the problem of}} directivity at higher frequencies, and they provide excellent low frequency loading. Their directional control begins to beam both vertically and horizontally in the middle of their target frequency range, narrowing further at high frequencies with level changes as great as [...] between lobes. Multicell horns are complex, difficult to fabricate and thus have a higher associated expense. They persisted in public address applications for many years because, even with their faults, they sounded relatively good. The revolutionary coaxial driver, the Altec Lansing Duplex 601 and 604, used a multicell horn for its high frequency component from 1943 to 1998.|$|R

2500|$|Radial horns {{have two}} {{surfaces}} {{based on an}} exponential flare rate, and two straight walls that determine the output pattern.

For ease in mounting to loudspeaker cabinets, flat front radial horns have been used, for instance by [...] in their SQ 90 high-frequency horn. JBL's diffraction or [...] "Smith" [...] horn was a variation on the radial design, using a very small vertical dimension at the mouth as a method of avoiding the mid-range horizontal beaming of radial horns that have a larger vertical dimension at the mouth.|$|E

The room is rectangular in shape. Acoustic energy is supplied through two 50 -Hz cutoff <b>exponential</b> <b>horns</b> about 12 feet long. Each of the two horns has two transducers rated at 4000 acoustic watts each. A gaseous nitrogen supply is used to supply the energy. The equalized electrical signal is corrected by a circuit designed {{to compensate for the}} transducer nonlinearity, then fed into one channel of a phase linear power amplifier, then into the transducer. The amplifiers have been modified to increase their reliability. The acoustic energy in the room is monitored by six B and K 1 / 2 -inch condenser microphones.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Stepped <b>exponential</b> <b>horns</b> are {{proposed}} {{as a measure}} of acoustic impedance adaptation in an acoustic energy transfer (AET) system. Resonances due to impedance mismatches in the horn are used to obtain a maximal power throughput at a single frequency. Finite element (FE) models are used for optimisation of the horn parameters. Although experimental results do not match particularly well with simulations, the results still look promising. The horns boost the power transfer and efficiency for greater distances, {{which was one of the}} major problems in prior AET systems. The measured output power increased by a factor 3. 1 and the efficiency by a factor 7. 5 at a distance of 10 cm between the transmitter and the receiver. Discrepancies between the model and the measurements are expected to be largely due to variations in transducer parameters. The transducer losses were measured separately by means of impedance measurements in vacuum for improvement of the FE model...|$|R

The frequency range of interest includes the 80 Hz to 8000 Hz one-third octave bands. Reverberation time and sound pressure level measurements were conducted and standard deviations from the mean were computed. It was concluded that a diffuse field could be produced above the Schroeder frequency in the 400 Hz one-third octave band and higher for all applications. This frequency could be lowered by installing panel diffusers or moving vanes to improve the acoustic modal overlap in the chamber. In the 80 Hz to 400 Hz one-third octave bands a successful measurement will be dependent on the type of measurement, the test configuration, the source and microphone locations and the desired accuracy.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the general}} trend towards to {{minimally}} invasive interventions {{is present in}} all the medical domains. For the surgical intervertebral spinal disc cutting or removal domain, it is particularly a necessity because the manual methods currently employed are tedious, time consuming and taxing on {{the hands of the}} practitioner. In that context, new devices that are small enough to pass through a small opening in the skin or through a small portal are required. A detailed analysis of current cutting methods that are or could be used for disc and disc nucleus removal provided that ultrasonics technology should be investigated as a possible solution. The study of ultrasonics technology to fulfil the overall cutting function needed for spinal annulus and nucleus disc material removal is based on a design methodology that breaks down the overall cutting function in many partial functions. The applied design methodology consists in drawing a complete catalogue of solutions for each partial function. Based on a predetermined choice of criteria for each partial function, the evaluation and the classification of each solution allows determination of the best solutions for each partial function. A new ultrasonic transducer designed device composed of a piezoelectric stack for the source of energy and movement, a transmission partial function with rods or discs, an amplification partial function with <b>exponential</b> <b>horns</b> and the cutting partial function solutions is detailed. Existing analytical methods for the design of ultrasonic transducers are mostly based on quarter wavelength segments used to build the transducer. The modeling of that transducers with a finite element method (FEM) avoids building the prototypes and constitutes progress. Analytical models different from the quarter wavelength approach have already been developed and are very useful when used in an optimization process. Furthermore, when the geometry of the analyzed model is not straightforward, a FEM optimization approach to solve that kind of problems can be a valid solution too. Some existing optimization algorithms and other already developed pseudo-gradient methods applied to optimize the analytical models of the ultrasonic transducers are not valid for numerical optimizations where the computing time is a key factor. This leads to the development a new genetic algorithm (GA) optimization methods. One advantage being that the number of parameters to be optimized does not change the complexity of the algorithm unlike other algorithms. Three GAs with improvements done on different parts are discussed, implemented and tested. One GA is chosen to optimize the transducer model with numerical methods. As the main drawback with FE optimizations is the amount of computation time spent for each simulation, this creates a need to develop numerical 2 D models that can be quickly simulated but with accurate results. Ultrasonic transducer prototypes are also built and measured. As the prototype has to be used for the cutting or the removal of spinal disc material, the cutting effect of the prototypes has been tested and evaluated...|$|R
