25|$|The earth {{inductor}} compass failed {{soon after}} takeoff and after {{an attempt to}} fix it, Hegenberger disregarded the instrument. At 7:45a.m. {{he picked up the}} Crissy beacon as planned, but within an hour the receiver failed. Hegenberger seemingly repaired the radio by switching out the batteries, but the signal was lost again after another thirty minutes, forcing Hegenberger to navigate by dead reckoning using the magnetic compass and <b>driftmeter.</b> As part of his pre-flight planning, Hegenberger had computed azimuth and altitude for the sun, as well as selecting stars for sighting, for various points along the route. He used these figures for celestial observations to supplement his dead reckoning.|$|E
25|$|At McCook Field in 1923, Hegenberger (who {{had also}} become a Robins protégé) worked closely with {{engineer}} Bradley Jones, a leading authority on air navigation, to test and adapt for military purposes an earth inductor compass developed by the Pioneer Instrument Company {{in conjunction with the}} National Bureau of Standards. Hegenberger designed an instrument panel incorporating the earth inductor compass, a <b>driftmeter,</b> and a magnetic compass for a navigation station at which sextant readings could also be taken; and a cockpit panel with a dial connected to the navigation station that indicated to the pilot if he was steering to the right or left of the course set by the inductor compass. On September 6, 1923, Hegenberger and Jones successfully tested the equipment by navigating from Dayton to Boston, Massachusetts in a DH-4, above unbroken clouds that completely prevented them from seeing any landmarks on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|On June 27, Maitland and Hegenberger {{made the}} short hop from Crissy Field {{to the newly}} opened Oakland Municipal Airport, whose [...] runway was much {{preferable}} for the takeoff roll with full fuel load, and departed the next morning just after 7 a.m. for Wheeler Field, Oahu, with Maitland as pilot and Hegenberger as navigator. Although assisted as planned by the Signal Corps beacon on Maui, the directional radio receiver in the C-2 operated only intermittently before cutting out altogether. The earth inductor compass on the C-2 failed just after takeoff, and despite increasingly cloudier weather, Hegenberger navigated most of the charted Great Circle route by dead reckoning, using a magnetic compass and <b>driftmeter</b> supplemented by celestial navigation observations. Contact with several ships at sea was used to verify their position and adjust the original flight plan.|$|E
2500|$|Planning for a {{transoceanic flight}} began in February 1919 at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio, {{by members of}} the Air Service, the {{immediate}} forerunner of the Air Corps. 2nd Lt. Albert F. Hegenberger, an MIT-trained aeronautical engineer assigned to the Air Service Engineering Division, established the Instrument Branch to study ideas in air navigation (or avigation, as it was referred to at that time), and produce [...] "new developments in compasses, airspeed meters, <b>driftmeters,</b> sextants, and maps." [...] Hegenberger educated himself in over-water flight by attending a U.S. Navy course in navigation at Pensacola, Florida, that included flights over the Gulf of Mexico practicing dead reckoning and celestial navigation.|$|R

40|$|An {{evolution}} of ionospheric convection was studied {{for a double}} transpolar arc phenomenon on February 11, 1999. While one transpolar arc split from the auroral oval in the morning sector and drifted duskward, another arc appeared in the evening sector. The convection was investigated with three velocity data sets: E B drift velocities from the ASTRID- 2 satellite; Ion <b>Driftmeter</b> data from the DMSP satellites; and Doppler-shift data from the Super-DARN radars. We inferred convection cells from these data sets {{and found that the}} number of convection cells changed from three to four as the dominance of IMF changed from a negative By to a positive Bz. Our result suggests that the ionospheric convection that has been so far discussed for various conditions of IMF may be applied even to the cases accompanied by transpolar arcs...|$|E
40|$|Aurorae {{which appear}} in the polar cap are called transpolar arcs, polar cap arcs, sun-aligned arcs, or {{occasionally}} Theta-aurora because of its spatial distribution resembling Greek character 'Theta. ' Morphology, IMF (Interplanetary Magnetic Field) relationship, and ionospheric convection patterns were studied in quest of mechanisms of transpolar arcs. Four events were analyzed: 1999 /Jan/ 22 / 19 : 00 - 23 / 01 : 30 (1 event: a) 1999 /Jan/ 24 / 06 : 00 - 10 : 00 (1 event: b) 1999 /Feb/ 1 1 / 20 : 00 - 12 / 02 : 00 (2 events: c, d), with data set of ExB drift velocity data obtained by electric field measurements of ASTRID- 2 and FAST, DMSP ion <b>driftmeter</b> data, and line-of-sight velocity data of SuperDARN. POLAR-UVI image data were used for spatial and temporal variations of transpolar arcs and ACE data set were used for investigation of IMF relationship. IMF-Bz was strongly positive (Bz from + 8 nT to + 20 nT) during periods of all four transpolar arcs. In events (a),(b),(c), transpolar arcs appeared immediately after the direction of IMF turned northward, though IMF was fluctuating in event (b). A sudden increase of IMF-By, from + 3 nT to + 18 nT, was observed in event (d). Two different types of transpolar arc development were observed in POLAR-UVI: one which begins as a split from dawn or dusk sector of auroral oval and shifts poleward in event (a),(c),(d), and another which is initially a patch of auroral oval disturbed by substorm but develops as a transpolar arc, forming a growing finger-like shape from midnight sector (event b). Sunward flow, associated with positive IMF-Bz, were observed within newly-created polar caps in event (a),(c),(d). Not clear ionospheric convection pattern was seen across the polar cap arc in event (b) die to limitation of data set. In event (c), O+ with energy more than 1 keV were observed by FAST within a transpolar arc, suggesting that their origin be from plasma sheet. Transpolar arcs {{are thought to be}} projection of plasma sheet bifurcation into lobe regime. There can be several ways of development of transpolar arcs and two different patterns were observed through this work...|$|E
