40|$|A phenomenological {{model of}} the bulk force exerted by a lithium ion cell during various charge, discharge, and {{temperature}} operating conditions is developed. The measured and modeled force resembles the carbon expansion behavior associated with the phase changes during intercalation, as there are ranges of state of charge (SOC) with a <b>gradual</b> <b>force</b> increase and ranges of SOC with very small change in force. The model includes the influence of temperature on the observed force capturing the underlying thermal expansion phenomena. Moreover the model is capable of describing the changes in force during thermal transients, when internal battery heating due to high C-rates or rapid changes in the ambient temperature, which create a mismatch in {{the temperature of the}} cell and the holding fixture. It is finally shown that the bulk force model can be very useful for a more accurate and robust SOC estimation based on fusing information from voltage and force (or pressure) measurements. © The Author(s) 2014.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesPrevious {{studies have}} {{identified}} preload forces {{and an important}} feature of skillful execution of spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) as performed by manual therapists (eg, doctors of chiropractic and osteopathy). It {{has been suggested that}} applying a <b>gradual</b> <b>force</b> before the thrust increases the spinal unit stiffness, minimizing displacement during the thrust. Therefore, the main objective {{of this study was to}} assess the vertebral unit biomechanical and neuromuscular responses to a graded increase of preload forces. MethodsTwenty-three participants underwent 4 different SMT force-time profiles delivered by a servo-controlled linear actuator motor and varying in their preload forces, respectively, set to 5, 50, 95, and 140 N in 1 experimental session. Kinematic markers were place on T 6, T 7, and T 8 and electromyographic electrodes were applied over paraspinal muscles on both sides of the spine. ResultsIncreasing preload forces led to an increase in neuromuscular responses of thoracic paraspinal muscles and vertebral segmental displacements during the preload phase of SMT. Increasing the preload force also yielded a significant decrease in sagittal vertebral displacement and paraspinal muscle activity during and immediately after the thrust phase of spinal manipulation. Changes observed during the SMT thrust phase could be explained by the proportional increase in preload force or the related changes in rate of force application. Although only healthy participants were tested in this study, preload forces may be an important parameter underlying SMT mechanism of action. Future studies should investigate the clinical implications of varying SMT dosages. ConclusionThe present results suggest that neuromuscular and biomechanical responses to SMT may be modulated by preload through changes in the rate of force application. Overall, the present results suggest that preload and rate of force application may be important parameters underlying SMT mechanism of action...|$|E

40|$|Predicting the {{ecological}} consequences of environmental change {{requires that we}} can identify the drivers of long-term ecological variation. Biological assemblages can exhibit abrupt deviations from temporal trends, potentially resulting in irreversible shifts in species composition over short periods of time. Such dynamics are hypothesised to occur as <b>gradual</b> <b>forcing</b> eventually causes biological thresholds to be crossed, but could also be explained by biota simply tracking abrupt changes to their environment. Here, we modelled temporal variation in a North Sea benthic faunal assemblage over a 40 -year period (1972 – 2012) to test for changes to temporal trends of biota and determine whether they {{could be explained by}} underlying patterns in sea temperature and primary production. These extrinsic factors were postulated to influence community dynamics through their roles in determining and sustaining the metabolic demands of organisms, respectively. A subset of mainly large and long-lived taxa (those loaded on the first principal component of taxa densities) exhibited two significant changes to their temporal trends, which culminated in a shift in assemblage composition. These changes were explained by an increase in pelagic primary production, and hence detrital food input to the seabed, but were unrelated to variation in sea temperature. A second subset of mainly small and short-lived taxa (those loaded on the second principal component) did not experience any significant changes to their temporal trends, as enhanced pelagic primary production appeared to mitigate the impact of warming on these organisms. Our results suggest that abrupt ecological shifts can occur as biota track underlying variation in extrinsic factors, in this case primary production.

40|$|Detailed {{investigations}} of high latitude sequences recently {{collected by the}} Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) indicate that periods of rapid climate change often culminated in brief transient climates, with more extreme conditions than subsequent long term climates. Two examples of such events {{have been identified in}} the Paleogene; the first in latest Paleocene time {{in the middle of a}} warming trend that began several million years earlier: the second in earliest Oligocene time near the end of a Middle Eocene to Late Oligocene global cooling trend. Superimposed on the earlier event was a sudden and extreme warming of both high latitude sea surface and deep ocean waters. Imbedded in the latter transition was an abrupt decline in high latitude temperatures and the brief appearance of a full size continental ice-sheet on Antarctica. In both cases the climate extremes were not stable, lasting for less than a few hundred thousand years, indicating a temporary or transient climate state. Geochemical and sedimentological evidence suggest that both Paleogene climate events were accompanied by reorganizations in ocean circulation, and major perturbations in marine productivity and the global carbon cycle. The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum was marked by reduced oceanic turnover and decreases in global delta 13 C and in marine productivity, while the Early Oligocene glacial maximum was accompanied by intensification of deep ocean circulation and elevated delta 13 C and productivity. It has been suggested that sudden changes in climate and/or ocean circulation might occur as a result of <b>gradual</b> <b>forcing</b> as certain physical thresholds are exceeded.

40|$|A mid- to late-Holocene {{synthesis}} of fire activity from the Mediterranean basin explores the linkages among fire, climate variability and seasonality through several climatic and ecological transitions. Regional fire histories were created from 36 radiocarbon-dated sedimentary charcoal records, {{available from the}} Global Charcoal Database. During the mid-Holocene 'Thermal Maximum' around 7500 - 4500 cal. BP, charcoal records from the northern Mediterranean suggest an increase in fire while records from the southern Mediterranean indicate a decrease associated with wetter-than-present summers. A North-South partition between 40 degrees and 43 degrees N latitude is apparent in the central and western Mediterranean. Relatively abrupt changes in fire activity are observed c. 5500 - 5000 cal. BP. Records of Holocene fire activity appear sensitive to both orbitally forced climate changes and shorter-lived excursions which {{may be related to}} North Atlantic cold events, possibly modulated by an NAO-like climate mechanism. In cases where human-fire interactions have been documented, the regional coherency between fire occurrence and climate forcing suggests a dominant fire-climate relationship during the early-mid Holocene. The human influence on regional fire activity became increasingly important after c. 4000 - 3000 cal. BP. Results also suggest that: (1) teleconnections between the Mediterranean area and other climatic regions, in particular the North Atlantic and the low latitudes monsoon areas, influenced past fire activity; (2) <b>gradual</b> <b>forcing,</b> such as changes in orbital parameters, may have triggered abrupt shifts in fire activity; (3) regional fire reconstructions contradict former notions of a gradual (mid-to late-Holocene) aridification of the entire region due to climate and/or human activities and the importance of shorter-term events; (4) Mediterranean fire activity appears hightly sensitive to climate dynamics and thus could be considerably impacted by future climate changes...|$|R
40|$|The last {{deglaciation}} was characterised by two abrupt warming events, at {{the start}} of the Bølling-Allerød and at the end of the Younger Dryas, but their underlying causes are unclear. Some abrupt climate changes may involve <b>gradual</b> <b>forcing</b> past a bifurcation point, in which a prevailing climate state loses its stability and the climate tips into an alternative state, providing an early warning signal in the form of slowing responses to perturbations. However, the abrupt Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events during the last ice age were probably triggered by stochastic fluctuations without bifurcation or early warning, and whether the onset of the Bølling-Allerød (DO event 1) was preceded by slowing down or not is debated. Here we show that the interval from the Last Glacial Maximum to the end of the Younger Dryas, as recorded in three Greenland ice cores with two different climate proxies, was accompanied by a robust slowing down in climate dynamics and an increase in climate variability, consistent with approaching bifurcation. Prior to the Bølling warming there was a robust increase in climate variability but no consistent slowing down signal, suggesting this abrupt change was probably triggered by a stochastic fluctuation. The Bølling warming marked a distinct destabilisation of the climate system, which excited an internal mode of variability in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength, causing multi-centennial climate fluctuations. There is some evidence for slowing down in the transition to and during the Younger Dryas. We infer that a bifurcation point was finally approached at the end of the Younger Dryas, in which the cold climate state, with weak Atlantic overturning circulation, lost its stability, and the climate tipped irreversibly into a warm interglacial state. The lack of a large triggering perturbation at the end of the Younger Dryas, and the fact that subsequent meltwater perturbations did not cause sustained cooling, support the bifurcation hypothesis...|$|R

Some abrupt climate changes may involve <b>gradual</b> <b>forcing</b> past a bifurcation point, in which a prevailing climate state loses its stability and the climate tips into an alternative state, providing an early warning signal in the form of slowing responses to perturbations, which may be accompanied by increasing variability. Alternatively, short-term stochastic variability in the climate system can trigger abrupt climate changes, without early warning. Previous work has found signals consistent with slowing down during the last deglaciation as a whole, and during the Younger Dryas, but with conflicting results in the run-up to the Bolling-Allerod. Based on this, we hypothesise that a bifurcation point was approached at the end of the Younger Dryas, in which the cold climate state, with weak Atlantic overturning circulation, lost its stability, and the climate tipped irreversibly into a warm interglacial state. To test the bifurcation hypothesis, we analysed two different climate proxies in three Greenland ice cores, from the Last Glacial Maximum to the end of the Younger Dryas. Prior to the Bolling warming, there was a robust increase in climate variability but no consistent slowing down signal, suggesting this abrupt change was probably triggered by a stochastic fluctuation. The transition to the warm Bolling-Allerod state was accompanied by a slowing down in climate dynamics and an increase in climate variability. We suggest that the Bolling warming excited an internal mode of variability in Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength, causing multi-centennial climate fluctuations. However, the return to the Younger Dryas cold state increased climate stability. We find no consistent evidence for slowing down during the Younger Dryas, or in a longer spliced record of the cold climate state before and after the Bolling-Allerod. Therefore, the end of the Younger Dryas may also have been triggered by a stochastic perturbation...|$|R
40|$|Tipping points’ in {{the climate}} system are characterised by a {{nonlinear}} response to <b>gradual</b> <b>forcing,</b> and may have severe and wide-ranging impacts. One {{of the best ways}} to identify and potentially predict threshold behaviour {{in the climate}} system is through analysis of palaeoclimate records. It has been suggested that early warning signals occur on the approach to a tipping point, generated from characteristic fluctuations in a time series as a system loses stability. Although early warning signals have been found in climate models and high-resolution marine and ice core palaeodata, studies from terrestrial records are lacking. In this study, a number of Pleistocene terrestrial records were selected to represent a range of regions strongly influenced by different climate modes which are thought to be capable of displaying threshold behaviour. These records included lake sediments from the North Atlantic, tree-rings from the South Pacific, a Chinese speleothem and were complemented by a new Greenland ice core chronology. Recently developed methods to detect signals of ‘critical slowing down’, ‘flickering’, and stability changes on the approach to a tipping point were utilised. Specific methodological issues arising from analysing palaeoclimate data were also investigated using a simple bifurcation model. A number of key criteria were found to be necessary for the reliable identification of early warning signals in palaeoclimate records, most crucially, the need for a low-noise record of sufficient data length, resolution and accuracy. Analysis of a Chinese speleothem identified the East Asian Summer Monsoon as an important climate ‘tipping element’, which may display a cascade of impacts. However, in some cases where early warning signals may fail, a deeper understanding of the underlying system dynamics is required to inform the development of more robust system-specific indicators. This was exemplified by the analysis of an abrupt, centennial-duration shutdown recorded during the Younger Dryas Chronozone in New Zealand, which demonstrated no slowing down, consistent with a freshwater pulse into the Southern Ocean. This study demonstrates that time series precursors from palaeoclimate archives provide a means of useful forewarning of many potential climate tipping points...|$|R

By comparing how proprietors and ironworkers contested the meaning of industrial order, I illustrate how the North and the South became distinct regions during the colonial and early national eras. ^ The dissertation contains four parts. The first examines the unique demands that charcoal iron production placed on humans. The second situates the colonial iron industry in an Atlantic economy and compares how colonial ironmasters in the North and the South organized work. The third examines {{the development of the}} charcoal iron industry from the Revolution to 1840 and explores how proprietors and ironworkers contested initiatives to make iron more efficiently. The last section compares work and life at two ironworks, one in Virginia that exploited slave labor exclusively and one in New Jersey that depended solely on free labor. ^ The voracious appetite of ironworks for capital and labor compelled ironmasters to make production efficient and predictable. In the colonial Chesapeake, the proprietary quest for control quickly wedded slavery to industrial order. In the North, colonial ironmasters relied on waged hands, but ironically found that they could not mold free labor to suit their needs without slavery. After the Revolution, most southern ironmasters still held that slavery offered the best way to forge a disciplined work <b>force.</b> <b>Gradual</b> abolition <b>forced</b> northern proprietors to devise new means to harness waged labor to the routines of charcoal iron production. ^ This study examines how proprietors and workers within one industry negotiated the terms of labor over more than a century.

The African monsoon climate system is thus a low-latitude corollary to the bi-stable behavior of high-latitude deep ocean thermohaline circulation, which is similarly capable of rapid and large-amplitude climate transitions...|$|R

The versatility and attractiveness of the wavelet approach lie in its decomposition properties, principally its time-scale localization. It is especially relevant {{to the analysis of}} non-stationary systems, i. e., systems with short-lived transient components, like those observed in ecological systems. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach for time-series analysis from an ecological perspective. Wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper and illustrated by appropriate synthetic and ecological examples. Wavelet {{analysis is}} notably free from the assumption of stationarity that makes most methods unsuitable for many ecological time series. Wavelet analysis also permits analysis of the relationships between two signals, and it is especially appropriate for following <b>gradual</b> change in <b>forcing</b> by exogenous variables...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} context of global {{infectious}} disease risks, {{a better understanding}} of the dynamics of major epidemics is urgently needed. Time-series analysis has appeared as an interesting approach to explore the dynamics of numerous diseases. Classical time-series methods can only be used for stationary time-series (in which the statistical properties do not vary with time). However, epidemiological time-series are typically noisy, complex and strongly non-stationary. Given this specific nature, wavelet analysis appears particularly attractive because it is well suited to the analysis of non-stationary signals. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach as an appropriate and elegant method for time-series analysis in epidemiological studies. The wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper based on epidemiological examples. In particular, the wavelet approach permits analysis of transient relationships between two signals and is especially suitable for <b>gradual</b> change in <b>force</b> by exogenous variables...|$|R

The results showed implicit learning can be induced both in healthy and stroke patients with hemiplegia. The pilot study also showed feasibility that functional MRI and Volume based morphometry can detect associated cortical/sub-cortical areas that are used underlying such am implicit motor learning.
