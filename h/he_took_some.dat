5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|During the war Vaughan Williams stopped writing music, {{and after}} {{returning}} to civilian life <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> time before feeling ready to compose new works. He revised some earlier pieces, and {{turned his attention to}} other musical activities. In 1919 he accepted an invitation from Hugh Allen, who had succeeded Parry as director, to teach composition at the RCM; he remained on the faculty of the college for the next twenty years. In 1921 he succeeded Allen as conductor of the Bach Choir, London. It was not until 1922 that he produced a major new composition, A Pastoral Symphony; the work was given its first performance in London in May conducted by Adrian Boult and its American premiere in New York in December conducted by the composer.|$|E

25|$|Much of Grace's {{success as}} a bowler was due to his {{magnificent}} fielding to his own bowling; {{as soon as he}} had delivered the ball he covered so much ground to the left that he made himself into an extra mid-off and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> extraordinary catches in this way.|$|E

25|$|To {{support his}} {{position}} that methodological rules {{generally do not}} contribute to scientific success, Feyerabend provides counterexamples to the claim that (good) science operates according to a certain fixed method. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> examples of episodes in science that are generally regarded as indisputable instances of progress (e.g. the Copernican revolution), and showed that all common prescriptive rules of science are violated in such circumstances. Moreover, he claimed that applying such rules in these historical situations would actually have prevented scientific revolution.|$|E

25|$|Bishop's map {{showed some}} 16km of cave passages, {{half of which}} were {{discovered}} by him. While the map does not represent a modern accurate instrumental survey, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> pains to indicate relative passage dimension and length, with cross shading to show water (as modern cave cartographers do.) The topology, if not the scale and orientation, of the map is accurate, that is, the indications of junction layouts correspond to reality {{in a way that}} some later celebrated maps do not. Beyond this, the Bishop map is the first to truly suggest, at a glance, the majestic scale of Mammoth Cave, especially its extraordinary degree of connectivity. In 160 years, Bishop's map has not lost the ability to inspire interest in both its subject and its source.|$|E

Meanwhile, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara informed that there is a conspiracy behind this scandal is to withdraw Kusal from 2016 ICC World Twenty20 tournament due to his effectiveness in the format. If the B sample was positive, he was likely to face a four-year ban.|$|E

A large force under Hasan bey set out to march into Albania through the same pass as Sinan a month before, unaware that Skanderbeg was ready to meet him. While the Ottomans were idle, Skanderbeg ordered the enemy guards to be killed and a full-scale battle soon ensued. Most of the Ottoman soldiers were killed and Hasan himself was wounded by an arrow piercing through his right arm. Despite {{the fact that most}} of his army was annihilated and that it was late at night, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> of his most loyal soldiers up into a more secure place. Skanderbeg came to understand this the next morning and immediately set off to find him. Out of desperation, Hasan came out unarmed and surrendered to Skanderbeg asking for mercy. Skanderbeg gave Hasan what he was asking for and the latter was taken prisoner.|$|E
