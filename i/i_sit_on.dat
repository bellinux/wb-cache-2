2500|$|Several {{different}} sculpture {{models were}} used in creating the monument. A large model of the horse which Nicholas <b>I</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> was commissioned from the Tsar's favourite sculptor, Peter Klodt.|$|R

6000|$|... "Say, do you know, I'd {{like to try}} that," [...] remarked Roger. [...] "I think <b>I</b> could <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> one {{of those}} ponies, {{if he had the}} saddle on." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Jason {{heard that}} he cried, 'I shall take the curse away, for by the splendour of Lady Hera's brow, I shall bring the Fleece of Gold {{from the land of}} the world's end before <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the throne of my father.' ...|$|E
60|$|The fame {{which came}} to me through that gallant rescue was a little embarrassing. I was a marked man. Did I walk through the village, heads emerged from windows, and eyes {{followed}} me out of sight. Did <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the beach, groups formed behind me and watched in silent admiration. I was {{the man of the}} moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "When {{he comes}} home from shooting, or the farm, if you COULD see dear Thomas with me and our dear little Bob! as <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> one knee, and baby on the other, and as he dances us both about. I often wish that we had Sir Joshua, or some great painter, to depict the group; for sure it is the prettiest picture in the whole world, to see three such loving merry people.|$|E
6000|$|... "You meddlesome bacon!" [...] cackled the ungrateful bird; [...] "if {{you don't}} take that orb {{directly}} back, <b>I</b> 'll <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> you till <b>I</b> hatch {{you out of}} your saddle-cover!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Again 'tis well. Come in, and <b>I</b> will <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the throne," [...] {{and with}} a {{sweeping}} gesture of welcome, the wild man {{stepped back into the}} cabin, and Nat Poole followed.|$|R
50|$|Several {{different}} sculpture {{models were}} used in creating the monument. A large model of the horse which Nicholas <b>I</b> <b>sits</b> <b>on</b> was commissioned from the Tsar's favourite sculptor, Peter Klodt. The initial sketch created by it represented the horseman on easy standing game. The author planned {{by means of a}} mimicry and gestures to reflect character of the emperor, but this variant has been rejected of Monferran's for the reason that could not serve the primary purpose of association of spatial ensembles.|$|R
60|$|Figure to {{yourself}} a dingy room, somewhere in that network of streets that lies about Tottenham Court Road, a dingy bedroom {{lit by a}} solitary candle and carpeted with scraps and patches, with curtains of cretonne closing the window, and a tawdry ornament of paper in the grate. <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a bed beside a weary-eyed, fair-haired, sturdy young woman, half undressed, who is telling me in broken German something that my knowledge of German is at first inadequate to understand....|$|E
6000|$|I {{have picked}} up on the moor the {{chrysalis}} of a common English butterfly. As <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the heather and turn it over attentively, while it wriggles in my hands, I can't help thinking how closely it resembles the present condition of our British commonwealth. It is a platitude, indeed, to say that [...] "this is an age of transition." [...] But it would be truer and more graphic perhaps to put it that this is an age in which England, and for the matter of that every other European country as well, is passing through something like the chrysalis stage in its evolution.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Low was not {{quick to}} answer, {{but he did}} answer at last. [...] "That is true, though I have never told you so. Indeed, it is hardly true to say that I hope it. I have my dreams, and {{sometimes}} dare to tell myself that they may possibly become waking facts. But if ever <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a Treasury bench I shall sit there by special invitation, having been summoned to take a high place because of my professional success. It is but a dream after all, and I would not have you repeat what I have said to any one. I had no intention to talk about myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not go asleep; {{your very}} life may depend upon it. Have your pistol ready {{in case we}} should need it. <b>I</b> will <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of the}} bed, and you in that chair." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her eyes filled. She {{drew her}} hand from Mrs. Bretton's and made a {{movement}} to leave her lap; it was at first resisted, but she said--"Please, I wish to go: <b>I</b> can <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a stool." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was an old}} man who said, 'How [...] Shall I {{flee from}} this terrible cow? [...] <b>I</b> will <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> a stile and {{continue}} to smile [...] Till I soften the heart of this cow.'" ...|$|R
60|$|The carpet! It {{had been}} a stout article in its time, had evidently began in a drawing-room; then descended to a coffee-room; then gone upstairs {{altogether}} to a bedroom. The ground was brown, and the pattern was bunches of leaves and roses speckled over the ground at regular distances. I reckoned up the bunches. Ten along the room--eight across it. When I had stepped out five one way and four the other, and was {{down on my knees}} on the center bunch, as true as <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> this chair I could hear my own heart beating so loud that it quite frightened me.|$|E
6000|$|By the bivouac's fitful flame, A {{procession}} winding around me, solemn {{and sweet}} and slow;--but first I [...] note The tents {{of the sleeping}} army, the fields' and woods' dim outline, The darkness, lit by spots of kindled fire--the silence; Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving; The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes {{they seem to be}} stealthily [...] watching me;) While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts, Of life and death--of home and the past and loved, and of those that are [...] far away; A solemn and slow procession there as <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the ground, By the bivouac's fitful flame.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, each to his taste, I suppose," [...] Douglas said, laughing; [...] "I {{have not}} seen much of war yet, and I envy you {{with all my heart}} the fights which you have gone through; but I can see no {{amusement}} in getting drenched to the skin by the sea. I think I can understand your feeling, though, for it is near akin to my own when <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the back of a fiery young horse, who has not yet been broken, and feel him battle with his will against mine, and bound, and rear, and curvet in his endeavours to throw me, until at last he is conquered and obeys the slightest touch of the rein." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Wilberforce {{was perhaps}} {{not enough of}} a thinker; but if I went into Parliament, as I {{have been asked to}} do, <b>I</b> should <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the {{independent}} bench, as Wilberforce did, and work at philanthropy." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Sir Christopher dead," [...] {{he muttered}} to himself. [...] "I knew his {{grandfather}} when I was a lad, {{and my grandfather}} {{told me that he}} knew his grandfather's great-grandfather--say three hundred years of them--and now <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the cold toes of the last of the lot, butchered like a mad ox in his own yard by a Spanish priest and his hirelings, to win his wife's goods. Oh! yes, it is wonderful, all very wonderful; and the Lady Cicely dead, burnt like a common witch. And Emlyn dead--Emlyn, whom I have hugged many a time in this very churchyard, before they whipped her into marrying that fat old grieve and made a monk of me.|$|E
6000|$|By the bivouac's fitful flame, [...] A {{procession}} winding around me, solemn {{and sweet}} and slow--but [...] first I note, [...] The tents {{of the sleeping}} army, the fields' and woods' dim outline, [...] The darkness lit by spots of kindled fire, the silence, [...] Like a phantom far or near an occasional figure moving, [...] The shrubs and trees, (as I lift my eyes {{they seem to be}} stealthily [...] watching me,) [...] While wind in procession thoughts, O tender and wondrous thoughts, [...] Of life and death, of home and the past and loved, and of those that [...] are far away; [...] A solemn and slow procession there as <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the ground, [...] By the bivouac's fitful flame.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} do not, Teacher. No doctor {{believes}} in another doctor's Spirits, since each has his own, {{and there are more}} Spirits than there are doctors. Teacher Tombool, I greet you and tell you at once that we are at war over this matter of Spirits. This tribe, Teacher, is a cleft log, yes, it is split into two. The Chief there, Kosa, sits on one half of the log with his Christians; <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the other half with the rest, who are as our fathers were. So if you wish to fight I shall fight with such weapons as I have. No, do not look at the spears--not with spears. But, if you leave me and my following alone, we shall leave you alone. If you are wise I think that you will do well to walk your own road and suffer us to walk ours." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>Sits</b> is {{a tribute}} to Helbing's mother, Pat. The {{sculpture}} was inspired by a poster that she had that showed an orangutan sitting. The original title of the piece was Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>sits</b> and thinks and sometimes <b>I</b> just <b>sits.</b> <b>On</b> the piece Helbing states: [...] "It is a place to sit and dream becoming a sculpture that is completed by the participants. It becomes {{more than the sum of}} its parts." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah! well," [...] she sighed, [...] "I am by {{profession}} a manicurist, {{but some}} freak of nature {{gave me the}} power of keeping my mouth closed, of looking as though I knew a good deal, but of saying so little. Now, messieurs, what could a poor girl know {{in the way of}} secrets for which that young man would get credit if he had succeeded in eliciting them? What could I know, indeed? <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> my little stool and sometimes there are great people who give me their hands, and they are thoughtful. And sometimes I ask questions and they answer me absently, because, after all, what does it matter?--a manicurist from the shop downstairs, earning her thirty shillings a week, and anxious to be agreeable for the sake of her tip! And then sometimes while I am there they dictate letters, or a caller comes, or the telephone rings. One does not think of the manicure girl at such a time. Fortunately, there are some like me who know so well how to keep silent, to say nothing, to be dumb." ...|$|E
6000|$|You may {{say they}} won't grow, and say they'll decay-- Say it again till you're {{sick of the}} say, Get up on your ear, blow your blaring bazoo And hire a hall to {{proclaim}} it; and you May stand on a stump with a lifted hand As a pine may stand or a redwood stand, And stick to your story and cheek it through. But I point with pride to the far divide Where the Snake from its groves is seen to glide-- To Mariposa's arboreal suit, And the shaggy shoulders of Shasta Butte, And the feathered firs of Siskiyou; And I swear as <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> my marvelous hair-- I roll my marvelous eyes and swear, And sneer, and ask where would your forests be To-day if it hadn't been for me! Then I rise tip-toe, with a brow of brass, Like a bully boy with an eye of glass; I look at my gum sprouts, red and blue, And I say it loud and I say it low: [...] "They know their man and you bet they'll grow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who am I?" [...] he said. [...] "I am the Molimo of the Bambatse Makalanga; I am {{the ladder}} {{between them and}} Heaven; <b>I</b> <b>sit</b> <b>on</b> the topmost bough of the tree under which they shelter, {{and there in the}} crest of the tree Munwali speaks with me. What to you are winds, to me are voices {{whispering}} in my spirit's ears. Once my forefathers were great kings, they were Mambos of all the land, and that is still my name and dignity. We lived in peace; we laboured, we did wrong to no man. Then you Zulu savages came upon us from the south-east and your path was red with blood. Year after year you robbed and you destroyed; you raided our cattle, you murdered our men, you took our maidens and our children to be your women and your slaves, until at length, of all this pit filled with the corn of life, there is left but a little handful. And this you say you will eat up also, lest it should fall into good ground and grow again. I tell you that I think it will not be so; but whether or no that happens, I have words for the ear of your king--a message for a message. Say to him that thus speaks the wise old Molimo of Bambatse.|$|E
