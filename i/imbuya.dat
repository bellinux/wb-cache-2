40|$|To {{improve the}} diet of rural families, small scale {{production}} of leafy vegetables, {{as a source}} of vitamin A and other nutrients should be encouraged. In this study, conducted under controlled environmental conditions (day temperatures in the greenhouse varied between 22 and 29 °C with night temperatures between 13 and 16 °C), Beta vulgaris (Swiss chard) and Amaranthus spp. (<b>imbuya)</b> were grown, using gravel and pumice as substrates for 'Ebb-and-Flood' and 'constant level' production systems. The results of this study showed that a combination of an 'Ebb-and-Flood' system with gravel as substrate, gave the best results of root development and leaf yield, especially for 'imbuya'. The water-use-efficiency (WUE) of 'imbuya' was significantly higher than that of Swiss chard. The yield and leaf chlorophyll content of 'imbuya' was low for the 'constant level' system with gravel used as substrate. Pumice improved root production, leaf yield and leaf chlorophyll content only for the 'constant level' system, probably owing to capillary action in pumice and associated improved root aeration.

40|$|Cultivation of {{indigenous}} crops was neglected during the apartheid era in South Africa, but in June 2000, farmers from the Umbumbulu community delivered the first crates of amadumbes (Colocasia esculenta) to Pick n Pay, a South African retailer. Woolworths, another major retailer, has shown interest in selling indigenous vegetables, provided the growers meet organic and hygienic standards. To foster organic cultivation {{and marketing of}} native food crops, the South African universities of Natal and Zululand, the Dutch Agricultural University, the Mangosuthu Technikon, the private organic farm H 2 A Botanicals and the Farmers Support Group (a South African NGO) {{have set up a}} joint research programme to further develop a practical information base. Research focuses on indigenous knowledge, crop cultivation and harvesting techniques. As a start, the project will concentrate on amadumbes, Amaranthus spp. (<b>Imbuya,</b> yugobolo), Galinsoga parviflora (Ushukeyana), Bidens pilosa (Uqadolo) and Curcurbita spp. (Zulu pumpkins). The programme also helps black communities to deal adequately with corresponding certification and marketing procedures. As a result, the Umbumbulu community has already taken its first steps to acquire a smallholder group certification for growing organic crops.

40|$|Family scale {{vegetable}} production {{should be}} enhanced {{in rural areas}} {{in order to prevent}} vitamin A deficiencies. A soil-less water-use-efficient 'Ebb-and-Flood' production system, developed for areas with limited water resources, was compared with two conventional soil irrigation systems, using Amaranthus hypochondriatus L., locally known as <b>Imbuya.</b> The soil-grown plants were flood-and drip irrigated once every week, using nutrient solutions at two electrical conductivity (EC) levels of 1. 80 mS cm- 1 and 3. 60 mS cm- 1. The same volumes of nutrient solution were applied to these soil-irrigated plots as was used in the preceding week by the soil-less 'Ebb-and-Flood' system. With the soil-less 'Ebb-and-Flood' system, plants were fertigated five times per day and the containers were randomly allocated between the soil-grown field plots. Leaf yield as well as water use efficiency was highest when the high EC nutrient solution was drip irrigated. As part of the drip treatment, the dripper lines were covered with white plastic soil mulch to limit soil moisture losses. Due to rain before transplanting, the field-grown drip- and flood-irrigated treatments received extra water from the soil. In spite of this, the 'Ebb-and-Flood' system out yielded the flood treatment, when the nutrient solution with an EC of 3. 60 mS cm- 1 was used, probably due to insufficient root aeration in the flooded soil or due to better water uptake by the 'Ebb-and-Flood' system under saline conditions.
