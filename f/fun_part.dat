500|$|In 2000, Fey {{partnered with}} fellow SNL cast member Rachel Dratch in the Off Broadway two-woman show Dratch & Fey at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in New York City. The {{production}} was well received by critics. Tim Townsend of The Wall Street Journal {{wrote that the}} <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> of watching Fey and Dratch perform was [...] "seeing how comfortable they are with each other". He concluded that the production [...] "isn't about two women being funny ... Dratch and Fey are just funny. Period." [...] One of the SNL sketches, [...] "Sully and Denise", originated at The Second City.|$|E
500|$|With S.H.I.E.L.D. being {{announced}} {{as a legitimate}} organization again, after working in secret {{since the end of}} the series' first season, executive producer Jed Whedon said that the reaction to this would be mixed, as [...] "there are people who, as we see with the senator, are outspoken against Inhumans and will be against any form of protection for them. There are also people who are afraid. The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. We get to do that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without ever really talking about them." ...|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with British radio station XFM, Björk explained its recording process, saying work on [...] "Oceania" [...] was kept being delayed {{because she wanted to}} do it especially for the Olympics. During the last day of mixing, she thought she needed [...] "sirenes", like in Greek mythology. She called up an English choir to record these sounds. The singer had done an arrangement for piano on the computer that was impossible for a piano to play, and she got them to sing it. Then, she also called up beatboxer Shlomo, who was recommended to her as [...] "the new bright hope of the hip hop scene". He went to record the next day and Björk asked him to do a techno tango beat, which he did. Recalling her work on the song until her last day of mixing, she commented, [...] "That was the most <b>fun</b> <b>part,</b> in the end. Sometimes it's good for you to work with a gun against your head and just go for it, because you can sometimes sit too long with ideas. Sometimes adrenaline is a good thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|CDJournal reviewers {{felt the}} song's simple beat created a [...] "striking" [...] rock'n' roll-style song. They praised Ochi's [...] "refreshing", [...] "attacking" [...] and varying vocals, in {{particular}} the chorus. Many of the instruments were also praised, including the [...] "dancing" [...] guitars and hammond organ, however Tatsuya Nakamura's drums were singled out as [...] "wild and tight", and what pull the song together. The reviewers further noted the contrasting of long tone melodies were a <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> of the song.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> {{was that}} the goal of the basic design was ‘A Fast Boat’ without any distortions for {{handicap}} rules [...] [...] The rule being used mostly was PHRF and keeping the name at 37 when the boat was actually longer than that was a tongue-in-cheek effort to fool the handicappers when it was introduced [...] [...] [...] After the boat was sailing and presumably sailing better than a 37 footer, they would change the rating – but by then we would have at least created ‘notice’ in the marketplace – HA [...] [...] [...] [...] [...]|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Justin Speer {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 4 out of 5, calling it [...] "a ridiculously violent, unbelievably profane game {{that lets you}} glorify {{yourself}} with virtual {{millions of dollars in}} hard-earned drug money, fast cars, boats, underlings, women and copious amounts of blood. It's a good feeling." [...] However, he noted that [...] "gamers who are getting used to the next-generation of console visuals aren't going to be impressed with either the PS2 or the Xbox version." [...] He also argued the game becomes somewhat repetitive towards the end. However, he concluded [...] "Scarface is a long-lasting experience that's simply a lot of <b>fun.</b> <b>Part</b> guilty pleasure, part blazingly successful experiment in game design, Scarface: The World is Yours is definitely worth a shot." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a March 2007 video interview, Chaplin and Hughes {{spoke of}} wanting {{to take a more}} [...] "organic" [...] {{approach}} on album three, but played down suggestions about the use of guitars, referring to them as [...] "a <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> of the live set" [...] at present; however, the cover of [...] "She Sells Sanctuary", became the first song recorded since [...] "The Happy Soldier" [...] (2001) to feature the instrument. Photographic updates to the Keane website also implied the use of guitars in the album's recording sessions. Jesse Quin joined the band since this album as permanent studio and live member. He plays the bass, percussion, guitar, synths and backing vocals. On 25 August 2008, Keane appeared as studio guests on BBC 6 Music with Steve Lamacq where three of the new songs from Perfect Symmetry were played for the first time: [...] "Spiralling", [...] "The Lovers Are Losing", and [...] "Better Than This".|$|E
2500|$|Promotion on {{the album}} ended soon after its December release and Norwood {{subsequently}} started work on a second album with Epic Records. Amongst those to record with her were songwriting and production partners Tricky Stewart, The-Dream, Stargate, Ne-Yo, and Human collaborator Brian Kennedy. Expressing her dissatisfaction with Humans commercial performance, Norwood told Blues & Soul magazine she was [...] "a little disappointed about that" [...] but also felt [...] "pleased that Sony has given me another chance to do another project that I feel they're totally behind. In hindsight I do feel the last album was a little political. So a lotta changes have been made since Human – and hopefully they're changes for the better! Because, having got all the deep stuff off my chest, I'm now able to really tap into the <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> of music again [...] it's exactly the type of album that I need to be makiing right now!" ...|$|E

Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. There are times when I think it's hard and tiring, but the <b>fun</b> <b>part</b> is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|Evan Lucy of Alternative Press {{praised the}} album for its return-to-roots musical style and wrote, [...] "Good Charlotte might be multi-platinum superstars, but [...] "Cardiology" [...] might be their best effort yet." [...] Amy Bangs, writing in Rock Sound, was also positive, saying: [...] "Musically, they've ditched their early material's urban (ish) influences, while {{maintaining}} the <b>fun</b> <b>parts</b> of pop-punk. So we're left with the Good Charlotte that brought us the brilliantly catchy 'Seasons' or 'Festival Song', without the awkward rapping interludes. And for that we thank them." ...|$|R

Not only is there a feeling of loss regarding the character, but also the player doesn't have anything to do until a new character can be brought in. We thought a campaign where a character's death wouldn't be the end of play for that character or player would be a neat twist on standard D&D." ...|$|R

[...] Kreisberg explained that since they are all comic book fans themselves, they have all debated the age-old question of which superhero would win in a fight; [...] "So, the idea that [...] would fight each other in one of these episodes was one of our earliest ideas, and that the cast members would have that Comic-Con argument on camera was one of our earliest ideas."

[...] Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was less impressed, scoring the game 7 out of 10, writing [...] "The harsh reality is, for all the plentiful additions, there's much work to be done before LucasArts can boast it has created the ultimate Star Wars FPS. Sure, it's the best one yet, but with some often laughable AI and creaking tech underpinning it, the flaws are there for all to see." ...|$|R
