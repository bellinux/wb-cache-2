25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E

25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know what else I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E
500|$|Sparks {{produced}} the album, their first in this genre, {{after it was}} commissioned as a radio musical by Sweden's national broadcasting service, Sveriges Radio. The project was proposed to Sparks by Marie Wennersten of SR Radioteatern, the station's radio drama department. Wennersten had become a Sparks fan after watching the duo perform in Sweden in 2004: [...] "I {{had never seen such}} energy and love from the audience. I thought the Södra Theatre was going to take off and fly away. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> the Sparks fansite and thanked them for the experience." [...] Wennersten subsequently travelled to Los Angeles as a journalist, to attend and report on another Sparks concert. By that time, the idea of a collaboration had formed in her mind: [...] "I always dreamed of dragging them into the radio world." ...|$|E
500|$|Lisa Mahapatra from The New Indian Express was {{impressed}} with the story and Tripathi's writing and praised [...] "the interactions between Shiva and Sati, [...] intriguing. Age-old thoughts and philosophies were delivered in a very modern context, which I thought made for an interesting juxtaposition." [...] Mahapatra added that [...] "the only downside throughout the novel, I was unable to really get into the main characters—they remained mostly on a two-dimensional level." [...] It received a mixed review from Hindustan Times, where the reviewer was critical of Tripathi's usage of common, everyday language. [...] "There are many other subtle depictions of Lord Ram and other characters and overall its very well written. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Amish to express one small observation, the script writing is not that sharp. You have words like 'Goddamnit', 'bloody hell', 'In the name of God what is this nonsense?' etc, which I guess would be great for an Indian audience but after you just finish a Steven Erikson novel you find it falling a little flat," [...] the reviewer concluded.|$|E

500|$|In June 2014, The Guardian {{reported}} that the film had [...] "touched a nerve" [...] within the North Korean government, as they are [...] "notoriously paranoid about perceived threats to their safety." [...] The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the state news agency of North Korea, {{reported that}} their government [...] promised [...] "stern" [...] and [...] "merciless" [...] retaliation if the film was released. KCNA said that {{the release of a}} film portraying the assassination of the North Korean leader would not be allowed and it would be considered the [...] "most blatant act of terrorism and war." [...] The next month, North Korea's United Nations ambassador Ja Song-nam condemned the film, describing its production and distribution as [...] "an act of war" [...] and because of Kim's assassination in the film, [...] "the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism." [...] The Guardian [...] described Song-nam's comments as [...] "perfect publicity for the movie." [...] Later in July, KCNA wrote to U.S. President Barack Obama, asking to have the film pulled. Shortly before the planned release of the film on December 25, 2014, screenwriter Dan Sterling told Creative Screenwriting: [...] "I couldn't believe that the most infamous man in the world knew about my script – but most importantly, I would never want something <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> lead to some kind of humanitarian disaster.

2500|$|Savage {{stated in}} a column that he favors outing in some cases, {{specifically}} mentioning anti-gay activist Tyler Whitney.

[...] I viewed it as something elsean appalling lack of leadership, not only in Washington and London, but also on Butler's part. He was allowing a golden opportunity to slip through his fingers.

2500|$|... "Another stock {{quotation}} {{down the}} years has been that, supposedly, of the Greek-Catholic Archbishop of Galilee. For example, Israel's Abba Eban told the U.N.
