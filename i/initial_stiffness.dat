The proposed study was conducted using fixed-free resonant column - torsional shear (RCTS).

The behavior observed is qualitatively similar to that of saturated soil, while wetting data clearly indicate that G(0) depends significantly on volumetric behavior.

40|$|Abstract—Analytical seismic {{response}} of multi-story building supported on base isolation system is investigated under real earthquake motion. The superstructure is idealized as a shear type flexible building with lateral degree-of-freedom at each floor. The force-deformation behaviour of the isolation system is modelled by the bi-linear behaviour {{which can be}} effectively used to model all isolation systems in practice. The governing equations of motion of the isolated structural system are derived. The {{response of}} the system is obtained numerically by step-by-method under three real recorded earthquake motions and pulse motions associated in the near-fault earthquake motion. The variation of the top floor acceleration, interstory drift, base shear and bearing displacement of the isolated building is studied under different <b>initial</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the bi-linear isolation system. It was observed that the high <b>initial</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the isolation system excites higher modes in base-isolated structure and generate floor accelerations and story drift. Such behaviour of the base-isolated building especially supported on sliding type of isolation systems can be detrimental to sensitive equipment installed in the building. On the other hand, the bearing displacement and base shear found to reduce marginally with the increase of the <b>initial</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the <b>initial</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the isolation system. Further, the above behaviour of the base-isolated building was observed for different parameters of the bearing (i. e. post-yield stiffness and characteristic strength) and earthquake motions (i. e. real time history as well as pulse type motion).

Intrinsic mechanical properties were represented by the <b>initial</b> <b>stiffness</b> of the muscle, measured prior to reflex action, and by the tendency of the muscle to yield during stretch {{in the absence of}} the stretch reflex. Stiffness regulation by the stretch reflex was evaluated by measuring the extent to which reflex action reduces yielding and the extent to which stiffness depends on background force. Intrinsic mechanical properties were measured in muscles deprived of effective autogenic reflexes using the method of muscular reinnervation. Reinnervated muscles were recruited to force levels comparable to those achieved during natural locomotion. As force declined during crossed-extension reflexes in reinnervated and intact muscles, <b>initial</b> <b>stiffness</b> declined according to similar convex trajectories.
