500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{it with a}} B+. SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall wrote, [...] "Tightly written, well acted, {{and directed}} with a sure hand, this second episode of the season bears out my original prediction: this year is going to rock." [...] Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times praised the episode's use of a [...] "Harold", in which three separate plots working off a central theme converge together. He also loved the climatic scene involving a gunshot-induced deaf Peter and the subway. [...] "I hope more people were watching this episode for so many reasons: To see how good [...] "Fringe" [...] has become, to get addicted to the show and, most important, {{to see that they}} quoted my blog in the promo <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> Thursday night has become [...] "Fringe" [...] night".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} Walter smoking his own strain of {{marijuana}} {{while listening to}} [...] "Roundabout" [...] by the band Yes. The scene was originally removed out of concern it would be airing on network television, but was later reinserted because [...] "the story itself had so many different genres playing. We had a noir element. We had a musical element. and it just really played funnier coming from an altered state of Walter", according to co-producer Tanya Swerling. Jeff Pinkner added [...] "We {{set out to do}} an episode that explored Walter's state of mind — he's dealing with some very upsetting news. When we realized that the way Walter would deal with such news would be to try to anesthetize himself with copious amounts of marijuana, well, singing and dancing became a natural outcome." [...] Music supervisor Charles Scott IV and J.R. Wyman are big Yes fans, and consequently chose the song that appeared in the opening scene. As the episode was done with a 1940s aesthetic, every department had to act accordingly. Torv's normally straight hair was placed into a curl hairdo fashionable for the time period, and lighting changes were made to reflect the period as well. New furniture was brought in for various sets, such as Walter's lab and Nina's office at Massive Dynamic, which was then removed in preparation for the following week. The ending was a challenge for the producers, as it was supposed to end with Ella's version of the story conclusion and Walter still feeling upset over Peter's absence, but they felt this ended making viewers feel depressed. They debated ways to make it a happier tone, so Wyman added the Observer scene to change the feeling of the episode, and prepare viewers <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E

5000|$|After the game, coach Eric Mangini {{refused to}} endorse Chad Pennington as the quarterback <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week's</b> {{game against the}} Buffalo Bills, stating that he'd [...] "need {{to look at the}} tape," [...] {{indicating}} a possible change to Kellen Clemens.|$|R

He is sending out cards <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> but I could take you to-day--that is, if you would care about it. We can go somewhere for some tea afterward." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{went past}} the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I {{go to see}} LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or the Lily of Killarney? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big {{powerful}} change. Wet bright bills <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> Fun on the Bristol. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.|$|E
60|$|I {{talked with}} the man. He was fifty-four and a broken-down docker. He could only find odd work {{when there was a}} large demand for labour, for the younger and {{stronger}} men were preferred when times were slack. He had spent a week, now, on the benches of the Embankment; but things looked brighter <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> and he might possibly get in a few days' work and have a bed in some doss-house. He had lived all his life in London, save for five years, when, in 1878, he saw foreign service in India.|$|E
50|$|Second ranked LSU played Middle Tennessee State {{in front}} of a sold out crowd in Tiger Stadium. Head coach Les Miles didn't play {{starting}} QB Matt Flynn because of an ankle injury he suffered during the week, and to rest him <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>weeks</b> game at home against the South Carolina Gamecocks. Instead, he started Sophomore Ryan Perrilloux who threw 20-26 passing for 298 passing yards to help lead LSU to a 44-0 win against MTSU. Senior WR Early Doucet didn't play to rest <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>weeks</b> game as well. LSU held Middle Tennessee to a total of 90 yards on offense. LSU only allowed 9 yards rushing in the game against the same MTSU team that put up 264 yards of total rushing against Louisville the week before. LSU won the game 44-0.|$|R

I always found those evenings so restful and pleasant. Won't you try and forget that you have lost a few pennies; forget, also, your other worries, {{whatever}} they may be? I have had a letter to-day from the one great writer whom we both admire. I shall read it to you.

6000|$|Meanwhile {{a few of}} his {{followers}} had organized an [...] "Anti-Poverty Society" [...] similar to those which had already sprung up in New York, and my brother and I used to go of a Sunday evening to the old Horticultural Hall on Tremont Street, contributing our presence and our dimes in aid of the meeting. Speakers were few and as the weeks went by the audiences grew smaller and smaller till one night Chairman Roche announced with sad intonation that the meetings could not go on. [...] "You've all got tired of hearing us repeat ourselves and we have no new speaker, none at all <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b> I am afraid we'll have to quit." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bill Kuchman of Popculturology said, [...] "While I'm not too {{pleased that}} HIMYM used {{a good chunk}} of its final minutes to rehash Ted and Robin", the episode [...] "was the show's final chance to tie up loose ends and to get the {{necessary}} pieces where they needed to be <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week's</b> series finale." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, Jo did {{not like}} to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't suit her at all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing for her to do but bow and walk away, looking {{particularly}} tall and dignified, as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed. Just then she was both, for it was perfectly evident from the knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little fiction of 'my friend' was considered a good joke, and a laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as he closed the door, completed her discomfiture. Half resolving never to return, she went home, and worked off her irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously, and in an hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
60|$|The tickets {{being all}} sold <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>week,</b> {{and no other}} {{announcement}} being yet made, there is nothing new in that way to tell of. Dolby is over at New York, where we are at our wits' end how to keep tickets {{out of the hands}} of speculators. Morgan is staying with me; came yesterday to breakfast, and goes home to-morrow. Fields and Mrs. Fields also dined yesterday. She is a very nice woman, with a rare relish for humour and a most contagious laugh. The Bostonians having been duly informed that I wish to be quiet, really leave me as much so as I should be in Manchester or Liverpool. This I cannot expect to last elsewhere; but it is a most welcome relief here, as I have all the readings to get up. The people are perfectly kind and perfectly agreeable. If I stop to look in at a shop-window, a score of passers-by stop; and after I begin to read, I cannot expect in the natural course of things to get off so easily. But I every day take from seven to ten miles in peace.|$|E
