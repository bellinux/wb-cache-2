5|$|Doctors will {{sometimes}} prescribe immunosuppressive {{drugs such as}} prednisolone and ciclosporin <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E
5|$|Hospice Medical Director: The hospice medical director, a physician, often {{provides}} the most support to the clinical staff providing care to the patient and family. The medical director may also provide medical care if the primary physician is unavailable or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> {{does not have a}} primary care provider. The hospice medical director is also required under Medicare to recertify patients.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> {{presents}} {{less than}} eight hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly {{reduces the risk of}} serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48hours after ingestion. In clinical practice, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory.|$|E
5000|$|Fourteen {{patients}} with anemia and fever were studied by Barton. He discovered bacillus within their red blood cells. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> recovered from <b>the</b> acute phase, the bacillus changed shape to cocci; and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> developed characteristic skin lesions—hemangioma-like nodules {{in the skin}} and mucous membranes-the so-called [...] "Verruga peruana", the bacteria disappeared from the peripheral blood.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> enter fully remission, the {{consolidation}} with stem cell transplantation is highly recommended.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> {{condition}} is mild {{and signs of}} inflammatory process are present without signs of infiltrates, then conservative treatment with antibiotics is sufficient.|$|R
5|$|Medical {{attention}} should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. If the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, activated charcoal is given. Gastric lavage can be considered <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> presents within one hour of ingestion. Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended in any poisoning situations.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a patient}} is {{enrolled}} in hospice, the hospice becomes the insurance payor for that patient for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if {{a patient is}} on hospice for end-stage congestive heart failure, the hospice is responsible for all care related to the heart failure. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of tracheal intubations involve {{the use of a}} viewing instrument of one type or another. The modern conventional laryngoscope consists of a handle containing batteries that power a light and a set of interchangeable blades, which are either straight or curved. This device is designed to allow the laryngoscopist to directly view the larynx. Due to the widespread availability of such devices, the technique of blind intubation of the trachea is rarely practiced today, although it may still be useful in certain emergency situations, such as natural or man-made disasters. In the prehospital emergency setting, digital intubation may be necessitated <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is in a position that makes direct laryngoscopy impossible. For example, digital intubation may be used by a paramedic <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is entrapped in an inverted position in a vehicle after a motor vehicle collision with a prolonged extrication time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> {{condition}} permits, having increased daily activity {{incorporated into}} their schedule can help promote an earlier bed time {{and need for}} sleep.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient's</b> {{disease is}} treated {{by means of}} surgery, it is {{recommended}} that <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> undergoes post-surgical therapies for maintenance and periodic monitoring of gums {{for the sake of the}} possibility of re-occurrence of HGF.|$|R

5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the hospice benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with hospice care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in hospice, the patient may remain on hospice while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|Generally, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> {{is treated}} and survives then a full {{recovery}} is expected. Patients who present early to medical facilities and have prompt medical treatment typically will have a favorable outcome. Alternatively, patients presenting late with {{signs and symptoms of}} coma, hyperkalemia, seizures, or severe acidosis have a poor prognosis. Patients who develop severe central nervous system manifestations or stroke who survive may have long term neurologic dysfunction; in some cases they may recover, although convalescence may be prolonged. The most significant long-term complication is related to the kidneys. Cases of permanent kidney damage, often requiring chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported after severe poisoning.|$|E
5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading dose followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E

5|$|Brachytherapy {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic radionuclide (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, dirty clothes might suggest schizophrenia or depression. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E

25|$|As {{it occurs}} infrequently, {{many cases of}} MODY are {{initially}} assumed to be more common forms of diabetes: type 1 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is young and not overweight, type 2 <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is overweight, or gestational diabetes <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> is pregnant.

40|$|Abstract. As it is well-known, {{the stroke}} {{is known to}} be a {{cerebrovascular}} disease due to circulation disorders. Physical disabilities do remain due to nerve damages after strokes occur. These physical disabilities of <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> can be reduced by the rehabilitation treatment. This effect of rehabilitation appears with improvements of motor function. In order to evaluate the improvements of this motor function, therapists have used Fugl-Meyer assessment method (FMA). FMA method consists of fifty command motions such as thirty three command motions for motor function’s assessment of upper limbs and seventeen command motions for lower limbs. Further FMA method suggests three scores per each command motions. So to speak, in <b>the</b> FMA method, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> perform perfectly a given command motion, then they receive 2 points in a given command motion. Also <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> cannot perform, they receive 0 point. Finally, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>patients</b> perform partially, they receive 1 point. FMA method has a limit that cannot suggest exact assessments of <b>the</b> recovering <b>patients.</b> For <b>the</b> example, improvements of motor function of a patient cannot be evaluated from the initial stroke to full recovery. So it is hard to accurate diagnosis about <b>patient's</b> improvement. On <b>the</b> other hands, rapid upper limb assessment (RULA) method is suggested to evaluate the fatigue of muscle in a working environment. This RULA method suggests more detailed and quantitative assessment with diagnostic approaches than FMA method...|$|R
