5|$|In 1928, Fairley {{received}} an appointment in London as Assistant Physician to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and Lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Although he and Kellaway convinced the governors to delay Fairley's commencement until their major venom work was completed, he departed for London {{by the end}} of that year. He also opened a consulting practice in Harley Street. In London he encountered patients with <b>filariasis</b> and devised a test to diagnose the disease at an early stage; but when he went to write up his results he discovered that details of a similar test had already been published. In 1934, a sewer worker was referred to his ward with acute jaundice which Fairley diagnosed as caused by <b>filariasis.</b> The disease was revealed to be an occupational hazard of sewer workers, and steps were taken to protect the workers. Perhaps his most important work in this period was research into blackwater fever. Since malaria cases were uncommon in the United Kingdom, he made annual visits to the Malaria Research Laboratory of the League of Nations at the Refugee Hospital in Salonika. In the process, he described methaemalbumin, a previously unknown blood pigment. For his scientific accomplishments in London, Fairley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{at birth}} {{is estimated to}} be 54.71 years in 2012, among the lowest in the world. Endemic diseases include dengue fever, <b>filariasis,</b> leishmaniasis, malaria, meningitis, schistosomiasis, and sleeping sickness. The HIV/AIDS seroprevalence rate is estimated at 5.4% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. Breast ironing, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health. Female genital mutilation (FGM), while not widespread, is practiced among some populations; according to a 2013 UNICEF report, 1% of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM. Traditional healers remain a popular alternative to evidence-based medicine.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its {{neighbours}} in the halogen column (chlorine and iodine), bromine is {{not known}} to have a confirmed biological role in humans. A single 2014 study suggests {{that it may be}} a necessary catalyst to make collagen IV, making it essential to basement membrane architecture and tissue development, but these findings have not been confirmed and the precise role posited for bromine is not certain. Aside from this, only circumstantial evidence in the form of hypothesised deprivation symptoms exists for a trace role for bromine. Nevertheless, even if bromine is not an essential element, it can be pharmacologically beneficial. For example, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, formed by the eosinophil, and either chloride or bromide ions, eosinophil peroxidase provides a potent mechanism by which eosinophils kill multicellular parasites (such as, for example, the nematode worms involved in <b>filariasis)</b> and some bacteria (such as tuberculosis bacteria). Eosinophil peroxidase is a haloperoxidase that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating hypobromite (hypobromous acid), although the use of chloride is possible.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{intestinal}} nematodes cause diseases affecting human beings, including ascariasis, trichuriasis and hookworm disease. Filarial nematodes cause <b>filariasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Causes {{are unknown}} in most cases, but {{sometimes}} {{there is a}} previous history of severe infection, usually caused by a parasitic disease, such as lymphatic <b>filariasis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Doxycycline is {{also used}} as a {{prophylactic}} treatment for infection by Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) and is effective against Yersinia pestis, the infectious agent of bubonic plague.

25|$|In 2014–15, the WHO {{estimated}} that approximately 2 billion people were infected with soil-transmitted helminthiases, 249 million with schistosomiasis, 56 million people with food-borne trematodiasis, 120 million with lymphatic <b>filariasis,</b> 37 million people with onchocerciasis, and 1 million people with echinococcosis. Another source estimated {{a much higher}} figure of 3.5 billion infected {{with one or more}} soil-transmitted helminths.|$|E
25|$|Epidemics of cholera, malaria, rabies and African hemorrhagic fevers like Marburg hemorrhagic fever, {{are common}} {{diseases}} in several {{parts of the}} country. Many regions {{in this country have}} high incidence rates of tuberculosis and high HIV prevalence rates. Dengue, <b>filariasis,</b> leishmaniasis and onchocerciasis (river blindness) are other diseases carried by insects that also occur in the region. Angola {{has one of the highest}} infant mortality rates in the world and one of the world's lowest life expectancies. A 2007 survey concluded that low and deficient niacin status was common in Angola. Demographic and Health Surveys is currently conducting several surveys in Angola on malaria, domestic violence and more.|$|E
25|$|Lymphedema may be {{inherited}} (primary) or {{caused by}} {{injury to the}} lymphatic vessels (secondary). It is most frequently seen after lymph node dissection, surgery and/or radiation therapy, in which damage to the lymphatic system is caused during the treatment of cancer, most notably breast cancer. In many patients with cancer, this condition does not develop until {{months or even years}} after therapy has concluded. Lymphedema may also be associated with accidents or certain diseases or problems that may inhibit the lymphatic system from functioning properly. In tropical areas of the world, a common cause of secondary lymphedema is <b>filariasis,</b> a parasitic infection. It can also be caused by a compromising of the lymphatic system resulting from cellulitis.|$|E
25|$|Over 3,500 {{species of}} the Culicidae have already been described. They are {{generally}} divided into two subfamilies which in turn comprise some 43 genera. These figures are subject to continual change, as more species are discovered, and as DNA studies compel rearrangement of the taxonomy of the family. The two main subfamilies are the Anophelinae and Culicinae, with their genera {{as shown in the}} subsection below. The distinction is of great practical importance because the two subfamilies tend to differ in their significance as vectors of different classes of diseases. Roughly speaking, arboviral diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever tend to be transmitted by Culicine species, not necessarily in the genus Culex. Some transmit various species of avian malaria, {{but it is not clear}} that they ever transmit any form of human malaria. Some species do however transmit various forms of <b>filariasis,</b> much as many Simuliidae do.|$|E
500|$|Scientific {{studies on}} malaria made their first {{significant}} advance in 1880, when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran—a French army doctor {{working in the}} military hospital of Constantine in Algeria—observed parasites inside the red blood cells of infected people for the first time. He, therefore, proposed that malaria is caused by this organism, {{the first time a}} protist was identified as causing disease. For this and later discoveries, he was awarded the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. [...] A year later, Carlos Finlay, a Cuban doctor treating people with yellow fever in Havana, provided strong evidence that mosquitoes were transmitting disease to and from humans. This work followed earlier suggestions by Josiah C. Nott, and work by Sir Patrick Manson, the [...] "father of tropical medicine", on the transmission of <b>filariasis.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Irritation {{is caused}} by large numbers of Musca house-flies, through to severe biting stress from dense populations of Stomoxys or Haematobia flies. Musca house-flies, face-flies, and similar types {{transmit}} a variety of bacteria involved in mastitis of cattle. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye {{is caused by}} Moraxella bovis bacteria transmitted by Musca autumnalis face-flies. The feeding of various Musca species of fly permits the contaminative transmission of nematode worms, for example Parafilaria bovicola, causing a nodular <b>filariasis</b> in cattle. Stomoxys species transmit several species of Trypanosoma protozoa to cattle, sheep and goats causing various types of trypanosomiasis. [...] Haematobia horn-flies transmit nematode worms in the genus Stephanofilaria to the skin of cattle, causing stephanofilariasis, a suppurating dermatitis known as hump sore. Stomoxys flies transmit the bacterium Eperythrozoon ovis to sheep and this infection may lead to fever and anemia.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s MSU {{expanded}} {{its reputation as}} a world-grant university, including responding to the invitation of Nigerian President Nnamdi Azikiwe to partner with Nigerians to build the first land-grant model university in Africa, the University of Nigeria at Nsukka. [...] The many years of faculty experience in Nigeria created {{the foundation for a}} major MSU African Studies Center. By the 1990s MSU had the largest faculty in the nation of Africa specialists (170) and was producing more Ph.D.s on Africa, offering more study abroad in Africa (26), and teaching more African languages (30) than any other university. The faculty is deeply engaged in many African development problems in food security, health (especially tropical diseases such as malaria, river blindness, and <b>filariasis),</b> education, and gender equity. In 1978, MSU divested the stocks of companies doing business in apartheid-governed South Africa from its endowment portfolio.|$|E
2500|$|Dirofilaria immitis, the {{heartworm}} or dog heartworm, is a parasitic roundworm that {{is spread}} from host to host through the bites of mosquitoes. The heartworm {{is a type}} of filarial worm, a small thread-like worm, that causes <b>filariasis.</b> The definitive host is the dog, but it can also infect cats, wolves, coyotes, jackals, foxes, and other animals, such as ferrets, bears, sea lions and even, under very rare circumstances, humans. The parasite is commonly called [...] "heartworm"; however, adults often reside in the pulmonary arterial system (lung arteries), as well as the heart, and a major effect on the health for the animal is a manifestation of damage to the lung vessels and tissues. Occasionally, adult heartworms migrate to the right heart and even the great veins in heavy infections. Heartworm infection may result in serious disease for the host, with death typically as the result of congestive heart failure.|$|E
2500|$|Mosquitoes are small, midge-like flies that {{constitute}} the family Culicidae. Females of most species are ectoparasites, whose tube-like mouthparts (called a proboscis) pierce the hosts' skin to consume blood. The word [...] "mosquito" [...] (formed by mosca and diminutive -ito) is Spanish for [...] "little fly". [...] Thousands of species feed on the blood of various kinds of hosts, mainly vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and even some kinds of fish. Some mosquitoes also attack invertebrates, mainly other arthropods. Though the loss of blood is seldom of any importance to the victim, the saliva of the mosquito often causes an irritating rash that is a serious nuisance. Much more serious though, are the roles of many species of mosquitoes as vectors of diseases. In passing from host to host, some transmit extremely harmful infections such as malaria, yellow fever, Chikungunya, West Nile virus, dengue fever, <b>filariasis,</b> Zika virus and other arboviruses, rendering it the deadliest animal family in the world.|$|E
2500|$|M. S. Swaminathan {{was born}} in Kumbakonam on 7 August 1925. He was the second son of surgeon Dr. M.K. Sambasivan and Parvati Thangammal Sambasivan. M.S. Swaminathan learnt from his father, [...] "that the word 'impossible' exists mainly in our minds and that given the {{requisite}} will and effort, great tasks can be accomplished." [...] Surgeon M.K. Sambasivam, a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, {{took the lead in}} Kumbakonam in [...] "burning his foreign clothes," [...] a symbolic act in support of the Swadeshi movement: which emphasized the use of Indian rather than foreign-made clothes, and handloomed rather than mill-spun cloth. The political purpose of the swadeshi movement was to free India from dependence on foreign imports and to protect village industry. His father led in opening the temples to s, part of the temple entry movement of the Indian independence movement in Tamil Nadu, and in eradicating <b>filariasis</b> in Kumbakonom, an area long infected with the dread disease. The sense of service to one's fellow man was thus ingrained in him early.|$|E
5000|$|The {{differential}} diagnosis for podoconiosis includes other causes of tropical lymphedema, such as <b>filariasis</b> or leprosy, and mycetoma pedis. [...] Podoconiosis begins {{almost exclusively in}} the foot, as opposed to <b>filariasis,</b> where the initial edema can appear anywhere in the lower extremities. Podoconiosis is usually asymmetrically bilateral, whereas <b>filariasis</b> and mycetoma are usually unilateral. Additionally, groin involvement with podoconiosis is extremely rare and is usually indicative of <b>filariasis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Brugia malayi is a {{nematode}} (roundworm), one of {{the three}} causative agents of lymphatic <b>filariasis</b> in humans. Lymphatic <b>filariasis,</b> also known as elephantiasis, is a condition characterized by swelling of the lower limbs. The two other filarial causes of lymphatic <b>filariasis</b> are Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia timori, which both differ from B. malayi morphologically, symptomatically, and in geographical extent.|$|E
50|$|If a {{clinical}} distinction between podoconiosis and <b>filariasis</b> cannot be made based on history and examination alone, blood smears and ELISA antigen testing {{can be useful}} to screen for <b>filariasis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like {{other human}} <b>filariasis</b> infections, Brugia timori <b>filariasis</b> causes acute fever and chronic lymphedema. The {{life cycle of}} Brugia timori {{is very similar to}} that of Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, leading to nocturnal {{periodicity}} of the disease symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Subcutaneous <b>filariasis</b> {{is caused}} by Loa loa (the eye worm), Mansonella streptocerca, and Onchocerca volvulus. These worms occupy the {{subcutaneous}} layer of the skin, in the fat layer. L. loa causes Loa loa <b>filariasis,</b> while O. volvulus causes river blindness.|$|E
50|$|Lymphatic <b>filariasis</b> {{and malaria}} are mosquito-borne {{diseases}} also targeted by The Carter Center. The Center has distributed four million long-lasting insecticidal bed nets.
