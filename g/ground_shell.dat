It was buff colored, {{contains}} large fragments of ground mussel shell as a tempering agent, and isn't as smooth and polished as other varieties. Other kinds found there are much finer, with a finer <b>ground</b> <b>shell</b> as a temper, some instances being so finely ground as to look untempered. The Nodena Phase people put a bowl and a bottle into a grave with the bodies, usually of the finer variety of pottery. Shapes and decoration were varied in the mortuary pottery, from brighly colored abstract spiral designs, to elaborate effigy vessels depicting human heads, animals, and hunters and their prey. Pottery made by the Nodena people was built up from strips of clay, and then smoothed out by the potter, much like other pottery in the Eastern America area where the potters wheel was unknown. Slips using galena for white, hematite for red, and sometimes graphite for black were used to paint the pottery, with a red on white swastika design being particularly popular. Sometimes incising was used (an example is the incised raptor image on the effigy head pot pictured), although it is rare in Nodena pottery.|$|E

They often cut designs into the surface of the wet clay and, like their Caddoan contemporaries, the Plaquemine peoples engraved designs on pots after they were fired.

This optimization modeling took into account mixtures of primary fuel (mineral coal, pet-coke and heavy oil) and its alternative fuel which is agricultural waste (rice husk, sugar waste and <b>ground</b> <b>shell).</b> The optimization simulation models predict the cost benefit to the manufacturer using alternative fuel, environmental impact to world at large and finally {{the quality of the}} cement produced to the end user. Production cost for one (1) ton of cement using PSO is ($ 23 = 4945 naira), GA ($ 33 = 7095 naira), PS (38. 2 = 8170 naira). The oxides in this research work met standard cement specification: Silica Modulus (M. S- 2. 9), Alumina Modulus (M. A- 1. 3), Lime Saturation factor (LSF- 93. 3 %).

40|$|Palm kernel shells {{are one of}} {{the waste}} {{products}} in the palm oil industry. This work was focused on investigating the properties of pellets made from the palm kernel shells for use in syngas generation through gasification. The strength of the pellets increased with compaction pressure but the strength reached a plateau when the pellets achieved no or near-zero porosities, indicating that the maximum strength was achieved. High compaction speeds and short hold time during the compaction process; high humidity conditions and long storage time during post-production were found to result in lower pellet strengths. These effects were mainly related to the porosities of the pellets, and new modifications of the Ryshkewitch-Duckworth model have been proposed to describe the relationships between the strength and the porosity. The strength of binary pellets made of palm kernel shell and HZSM- 5 zeolite decreased with increasing zeolite composition. This decrease was associated with higher porosities and elastic rebound of the pellets {{in the presence of the}} zeolite particles. Modifications of the Ryshkewitch-Duckworth model have been proposed to predict the strength of the binary mixture pellet, based on strength at zero porosity and the bonding capacity of zeolite and palm kernel shell. In the gasification studies, the pellets achieved a higher conversion rate from biomass to gaseous products compared to raw palm kernel shells and <b>ground</b> <b>shell</b> powder. The gasification of binary palm kernel shell and HZSM- 5 zeolite pellets was proven to be feasible but not as effective in reducing tar from the gaseous products as zeolite added in-situ with raw palm kernel shells. For the same amount of catalyst used, the amount of tar reduced was less when the pelletised form was gasified, compared to that when the raw, ungrounded form was gasified in situ with zeolite. This was probably due to zeolite being trapped within the binary pellet and hence not all the zeolite was available to crack the tar...|$|E

30|$|An {{economic}} sorbent {{is defined}} as the one which is abundant in nature, or is a by-product or waste from industry, has little or no economic value and requires little processing. Agricultural residues, also called lingo cellulosic biomass resources are defined as a biomass by-product from the agricultural system and include straws, husks, shell and stalks. These wastes can be divided into two groups: crop residues, which remain in the field after harvest, for example, cotton; agricultural residues, which are the by-products of the industrial processing of crops, for example, rice husk (Tunc et al. 2009). Several million tons of agricultural wastes are being disposed in the world every year through different ways such as incineration, land applications and land filling. Dye adsorption by these wastes may provide an attractive alternative treatment due to their low cost and readily availability (Farooq et al. 2010). A number of studies on removal of dye from aqueous solution using different low-cost materials such as Posidonia oceanic (L.) dead leaves (Cavas et al. 2011), peanut husk (Song et al. 2011), Capsicum annuum seeds (Akar et al. 2011), oil palm shell (Foo and Hameed), cotton seed hull (Qi et al. 2011), pine tree leaves (Deniz and Karaman 2011), waste tea activated carbon (Auta and Hameed 2011), Thespesia populena pods (Arulkumar et al. 2011), Ananas comosus (Chowdhury et al. 2011 b), coffee husk-based activated carbon (Ahmad and Rahman 2011), palm kernel fiber (El-Sayed 2011), sugarcane bagasse (Zhang et al. 2011 a), treated ginger waste (Kumar and Ahmad 2011), Mangifera indica (Alencar et al. 2012), Jujuba seeds (Reddy et al. 2012), wheat residue (Zhong et al. 2011), peanut hull (Tanyildizi 2011), Oryza sativa (Safa and Bhatti 2011), <b>ground</b> <b>shell</b> powder (Kumar et al. 2013), wheat straw (Zhang et al. 2011 b), NaOH-modified rice husk (Chowdhury and Saha 2013), Dithiocarbamated symphoricarpus albus (Kara et al. 2012), cashew nut shell (Senthilkumar et al. 2010), rice straw (Chakraborty et al. 2011), tamarind seed powder (Patel and Vashi 2012), oil palm empty fruit bunch (Auta 2012) have been reported. Despite that many low-cost adsorbents have been studied for decontamination purposes, study on the Citrullus lanatus rind and Cyperus rotundus as economical sorbents for the treatment of wastewater is a win–win strategy because it not only converts the waste into a useful material but it also prevents on-site burning of the waste and saves disposal costs (Weng et al. 2009).|$|E
