50|$|The <b>Italian</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus plebejus) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish in the family Cyprinidae, nearly related to the common barbel Barbus barbus.|$|E
50|$|Endemic fish {{include the}} Bergatino loach, the <b>Italian</b> <b>barbel,</b> the brook chub, the Arno goby, the Garda carp, the carpione del Fibreno, and the Timavo sculpin.|$|E

40|$|The Southern Alpine region {{represents}} a hotspot {{of freshwater fish}} biodiversity, seriously compromised by anthropogenic pressures. Beside water pollution and multiple forms of habitat alteration, stocking-induced genetic introgression acts as an important - but still undervalued - threat factor. Here we summarise the outcomes of genetic surveys focusing on Marble Trout, Brown Trout, European Grayling, Lake Garda’s Carpione as well as <b>Italian</b> <b>Barbels.</b> We outline multiple scenarios of secondary contact, ranging from no-admixture to limited introgression and, finally, to complete loss of the native taxon. The observed sharp differences in terms of introgression reflect differing aspects of life-history of the investigated species, including home-range, demography and reproductive behaviour. In addition, the magnitude of introgression is conditioned by dissimilar fisheries management histories, with stocking duration and magnitude being likely triggers for introgression. Finally, we point to species-specific management strategies, urgently needed to impede further loss of Southern Alpine freshwater fish biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Until {{recently}} {{research on}} fish migration and fish passage efficiency mainly targeted diadromous species, {{while there is}} still a significant knowledge gap on endemic potamodromous. In this study, carried out during the period October 2010 -October 2011, the movements of radio-tagged marble trout (Salmo marmoratus; N= 28) and <b>Italian</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus plebejus; N= 31) along the lower course of Chiusella river and Dora Baltea river (NW Italy) were analysed during migration periods, with a particular focus on passage at a partial width nature-like fish ramp built on a 3 m high weir. The monitoring, carried out through automatic stations and weekly manual tracking sessions, allowed to collect data on the behaviour of marble trout (repeated up and downstream passages, homing behaviour, use of the ramp as habitat) and on the significant impact of avian predation during winter (3 ̆e 28...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{restoration}} of longitudinal connectivity of a watercourse altered by man-made obstacles {{is a key}} issue for the protection and safeguard of freshwater ecosystems {{and the construction of}} fish passes constitutes a relevant ad hoc measure. However, in many countries, like Italy, there is still not an adequate technical-scientific background and experience in this field and therefore several migratory species have become extinct or are suffering from severe impacts. The main elements of the river rehabilitation for fish project promoted by the Modena Province concerning the middle course of the Panaro River (North Italy), a watercourse characterised by high naturalistic and environmental values but fragmented by several weirs built to prevent riverbed erosion, are presented in this paper. The case study is analysed through the main steps that were carried out to define a preliminary plan for the {{restoration of}} the river continuity for the migration of four target species (South European nase (Chondrostoma genei), <b>Italian</b> <b>barbel</b> (Barbus plebejus), chub (Leuciscus cephalus cabeda) and soufie (Leuciscus souffia muticellus)) through the design of an innovative type of steep-slope fish ramp with large-scale roughness elements. The case study is part of an overall project and is the applicative section of an “educational ” document drawn up in the form of guidelines on the correct methodological approach for fish passes design, that will be addressed to professionals, technicians and local Authorities working in the field of water resource management...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} given {{substantial}} attention to external {{factors that affect}} the distribution and diversification of freshwater fish in Europe and North America, in particular Pleistocene and Holocene glacial cycles. In the present paper we examine sequence variation at one mitochondrial and four nuclear loci (over 3 kbp) from populations sampled across several drainages of all species of Barbus known to inhabit Italian freshwaters (introduced B. barbus and native B. balcanicus, B. caninus, B. plebejus and B. tyberinus). By comparing species with distinct ecological preferences (rheophilic and fluvio-lacustrine) and using a fossil-calibrated phylogeny we gained considerable insight about the intrinsic and extrinsic processes shaping barbel distribution, population structure and speciation. We found that timescales of <b>Italian</b> <b>barbel</b> diversification are older than previously thought, starting in the Early Miocene, and involving local and regional tectonism and basin paleo-evolution rather than Pleistocene glacial cycles. Conversely, more recent environmental factors associated with glaciation-deglaciation cycles have influenced species distributions. These events had a more marked impact on fluvio-lacustrine than on rheophilic species by means of river confluence at low sea levels. We show that genetic structure is influenced by species ecology: populations of small rheophilic species inhabiting upper river stretches of large basins are less connected and more differentiated than large fluvio-lacustrine species that inhabit lower river courses. We report the existence of both natural and human-induced interspecific gene flow, which could have great impacts on the evolution and persistence of species involved. In addition, we provide evidence that B. tyberinus is genetically distinguishable from all other Italian taxa and that its morphological similarity to B. plebejus and intermediacy with B. caninus are best explained by recent common ancestry and similar ecology with the former, rather than by hybrid origin involving these two species as previously hypothesized...|$|E
