5|$|The charred {{remains were}} {{found by the}} Soviets. By 11 May, Hitler's dentist, Hugo Blaschke, dental {{assistant}} Käthe Heusermann and <b>dental</b> <b>technician</b> Fritz Echtmann confirmed that the dental remains belonged to Hitler and Braun. The Soviets secretly buried the remains at the SMERSH compound in Magdeburg, East Germany, along with the bodies of Joseph and Magda Goebbels and their six children. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team with detailed burial charts secretly exhumed five wooden boxes of remains. The remains were thoroughly burned and crushed, after which the ashes were thrown into the Biederitz river, {{a tributary of the}} nearby Elbe.|$|E
5|$|Schwester Selma and Dr. Wallach adopted {{three girls}} who had been {{abandoned}} in the hospital. One was Samoohah Calderon, whose mother had died and whose father had been drafted into the Turkish army; the infant's grandparents asked them to keep the baby. The second adoptee, Bolissa, was given to them by her father, who had carried her {{all the way from}} Syria; her mother had died en route. Bolissa was killed in the 1948 Ben Yehuda Street bombing. The third adoptee was named Sarina. The girls grew up on hospital grounds and were sent to school; one of the girls became a nurse; another a <b>dental</b> <b>technician.</b>|$|E

30|$|Education of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> {{varies by}} country, {{and there are}} a variety of means by which {{personnel}} master fabrication knowledge and skills. For example, a survey of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> in the UK conducted by Bower et al. [35] reveals that while subjects read commercial magazines published for <b>dental</b> <b>technicians,</b> they rarely subscribed to academic journals in the field of prosthodontics, and two thirds of the survey’s respondents had never attended a training course on fabrication practices. By contrast, certified <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> of JSOI are required to belong to an academic society and to participate in society meetings and certification courses to maintain their credentials. Subscription to JSOI’s journal is an example of the advantages of membership for continuing education.|$|R

25|$|Clarkson {{was born}} Lorna Jane Smith {{in a small}} town in Lancashire, England, the younger of two sisters. Her mother, Jean Hale, a secretary, raised the girls as a single parent. The family emigrated to Brisbane, Australia, when Lorna was ten years old. As a child, she learned ballet, played netball, and was a school cheerleader. She {{attended}} Springwood State High School, and as a teenager, worked at Mathers shoe store in Woodridge Plaza. She wanted to become a journalist after high school, but was discouraged by her mother, so became a <b>dental</b> <b>technician</b> instead. While studying dental therapy, Smith began teaching aerobics at night.|$|E
500|$|For {{politically}} motivated reasons, the Soviet Union presented various versions of Hitler's fate. In {{the years immediately}} following 1945, the Soviets maintained Hitler was not dead, but had fled and was being shielded by the former western allies. This worked for a time to create doubt among western authorities. The chief of the U.S. trial counsel at Nuremberg, Thomas J. Dodd, said: [...] "No one can say he is dead." [...] When President Harry S. Truman asked Stalin at the Potsdam Conference in August 1945 whether or not Hitler was dead, Stalin replied bluntly, [...] "No". But by 11 May 1945, the Soviets had already confirmed through Hitler's dentist, Hugo Blaschke, dental assistant Käthe Heusermann and <b>dental</b> <b>technician</b> Fritz Echtmann that the dental remains found were Hitler's and Braun's. In November 1945, Dick White, then head of counter-intelligence in the British sector of Berlin (and later head of MI5 and MI6 in succession), had their agent Hugh Trevor-Roper investigate the matter to counter the Soviet claims. His findings were written in a report and published in book form in 1947.|$|E

40|$|Aims: To compare {{wage earner}} <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> with non-exposed {{salaried}} subjects for the preva-lence of respiratory symptoms and function, and {{chest x ray}} abnormalities. Methods: A total of 134 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> and 131 non-exposed subjects participated. A medical and an occupational questionnaire were filled in to evaluate the prevalence of respiratory symptoms and occupational exposures. Subjects underwent respiratory tests and chest x ray examination. Results: Mean age of the <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> was 36. 6 years with a mean duration of dental work of 16. 5 years. There was a significant risk of cough (day and night) and usual phlegm in dental techni-cians. Respiratory function parameters were lower in <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> with {{a significant difference between}} exposed and non-exposed groups for % FVC (forced vital capacity), % FEF 25 (forced mid expiratory flow), and % FEF 50. The prevalence of small opacities increased with age. Small opacities were significantly related to an exposure to asbestos in the past. Conclusions: Our young population of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> is at risk of respiratory morbidity. They should benefit from adequate technical prevention measures. <b>Dental</b> <b>technicians</b> are exposed to dust and vapour duringthe manufacture of dental prostheses from the negativeimpression of the patient’s teeth obtained by the dentist.

2500|$|Mikhail Moiseyevich Botvinnik {{was born}} on August 17, 1911, {{in what was then}} Kuokkala, Vyborg Governorate, Grand Duchy of Finland, but is now the {{district}} of Repino in Saint Petersburg. His parents were Russian Jews, his father was a <b>dental</b> <b>technician</b> and his mother a dentist, which allowed the family to live outside the Pale of Settlement to which most Jews in the Russian Empire were restricted at the time. As a result, Mikhail Botvinnik grew up in Saint Petersburg's Nevsky Prospekt. His father forbade the speaking of Yiddish at home, and Mikhail and his older brother Issy attended Soviet schools. Mikhail Botvinnik later said, [...] "I am a Jew by blood, Russian by culture, Soviet by upbringing." [...] On his religious views, Botvinnik called himself an atheist.|$|E
2500|$|James Dean {{was born}} February 8, 1931, at the Seven Gables {{apartment}} {{on the corner of}} 4th Street and McClure Street in Marion, Indiana, the only child of Winton Dean (January 17, 1908 – February 21, 1995) and Mildred Marie Wilson (September 15, 1910 – July 14, 1940). His parents were of mostly English ancestry, with smaller amounts of German, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh. Six years after his father had left farming to become a <b>dental</b> <b>technician,</b> Dean and his family moved to Santa Monica, California. He was enrolled at Brentwood Public School in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, but transferred soon afterward to the McKinley Elementary School. The family spent several years there, and by all accounts, Dean was very close to his mother. According to Michael DeAngelis, she was [...] "the only person capable of understanding him". In 1938, she was suddenly struck with acute stomach pain and [...] quickly began to lose weight. She died of uterine cancer when Dean was nine years old.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} with transmission electron microscopy to find whether bronchoalveolar lavage could be used to identify subjects with occupational exposure to mineral particles. Non-fibrous mineral particles in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from 46 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> and 41 white collar controls with lung diseases but free from occupational exposure to dusts were analysed. The total particle concentration in BAL fluid was significantly higher in <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> than in controls (12. 18 x 10 (5) particles/ml of BAL fluid, v 2. 03 x 10 (5) particles/ml, p < 0. 001). <b>Dental</b> <b>technicians</b> had significantly more crystalline silica, aluminium, and alloys containing nickel and chromium. There was a non-significant twofold increase of total particle concentration in the lungs of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> who were smokers compared with non-smokers. The results strongly support the use of BAL fluid analysis to assess dust accumulation in workers in heavily exposed occupations such as <b>dental</b> <b>technicians.</b> This is a valid method to evaluate occupational exposure to non-fibrous mineral particles, and may be useful to determine the occupational aetiology of some respiratory diseases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Occupational {{and chronic}} {{exposure}} to solvents and metals {{is considered a}} possible risk factor for Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. While manufacturing <b>dental</b> prostheses, <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> are exposed to numerous chemicals that contain toxins known to affect the central nervous system, such as solvents (which contain n-hexane in particular) and metals (which contain mercury, iron, chromium, cobalt and nickel). Methods We performed an epidemiological and clinical study on all 27 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> working in a school for <b>dental</b> <b>technicians.</b> We asked all the technicians to fill in a self-administered questionnaire on extrapyramidal symptoms, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), a self-administered screening instrument, to detect any psychiatric disorders. Moreover, we invited all 27 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> to undergo a neurological examination and provide a detailed occupational history in our clinic. Results Of the 14 subjects who underwent the neurological examination, four had postural tremor and one had a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Conclusion We found a high prevalence of extrapyramidal signs and symptoms in this group of male <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> working in a state technical high school in Rome. We believe that this finding {{may be due to}} the presence of toxins in the dental technician's work. </p...|$|R

40|$|From the {{registry}} of self employed workers living in Paris, {{a group of}} 105 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> was studied to evaluate occupational exposure, to determine respiratory manifestations, and to investigate immune disturbances. Seventy one <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> (age range 43 - 68 : group D), 34 <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> younger than 43 or older than 68 (group d), and 68 control workers (age range 43 - 66 : group C) were investigated. The demographic characteristics and the smoking habits of the groups D and C did not differ significantly. The <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> often worked alone (43. 7 %) or in small laboratories without adequate dust control. The mean duration of their exposure was long (group D 34. 0 (SD 8. 4) years). The prevalence of respiratory symptoms did not differ between groups D and C except for the occurrence of increased cough and phlegm lasting for three weeks or more {{over the past three}} years (group D 16. 9 %, group C 2. 9 %, p < 0. 007). The effect of cigarette smoking on respiratory symptoms and lung function was obvious. All mean values of lung function for <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> and controls were within normal limits. Significant decreases in all mean lung function values were found among smokers by comparison with non-smokers, however, and a positive interaction with occupational exposure was established. The x ray films of <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> (n = 102, groups D and d) were read independently by four readers and recorded according to the International Labour Office classification of pneumoconioses. The prevalence of small opacities greater than 1 / 0 was 11. 8 % with a significant increase with duration of exposure. The prevalence among <b>dental</b> <b>technicians</b> with 30 years or exposure or more was significantly higher (22. 2 %) than those with less than 30 years (3. 5, p < 0. 004). The prevalence of autoantibodies (rheumatoid factors, antinuclear antibodies, and antihistone antibodies) was not significantly different in the groups D and C. When positive, autoantibodies only occurred at low concentrations. This finding contrasts with previous reports on the occurrence of autoantibodies and even of connective tissue diseases in <b>dental</b> <b>technicians.</b> In conclusion, the study confirms an increased risk of pneumoconiosis among <b>dental</b> <b>technicians.</b> Moreover, there may be other lung disorders such as impairment of lung function especially in association with cigarette smoking...|$|R
