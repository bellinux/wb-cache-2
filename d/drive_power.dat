25|$|Some hybrid {{vehicles}} {{such as the}} Lexus RX400h provide {{power to}} an AWD system through a pair of electric motors, one to the front wheels and one to the rear. In {{the case of the}} AWD model version of the Lexus RX400h (and its Toyota-branded counterpart, the Harrier hybrid), the front wheels can also receive <b>drive</b> <b>power</b> directly from the vehicle's gasoline engine as well as via the electric motors, whereas the rear wheels derive power only from the second electric motor. Transfer of power is managed automatically by internal electronics based on traction conditions and need, making this an all-wheel-drive system.|$|E

25|$|Xing Yi Quan {{features}} aggressive shocking {{attacks and}} direct footwork. Most {{of the training}} and footwork are practiced on straight lines. The linear nature of the art hints at both the military origins {{and the influence of}} spear technique alluded to in its mythology. The goal of the Xing Yi exponent is to reach the opponent quickly and <b>drive</b> <b>power</b> through them in a single burst. The analogy with spear fighting is useful here. This is achieved by coordinating one's body as a single unit, and the intense focusing of one's Intent (Yi 意) and coordinated power (Jin 劲) utilizing tight circles (usually in a forward direction). Issuing explosive power in Xing Yi is referred to as 'Fa Jin' (发劲), the same term used in many other traditional Chinese Martial Arts.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, {{particularly}} from the 1860s to the 1890s, many streetcar operators switched from animals to other types of motive power. [...] Before the use of electricity the use of steam dummies, tram engines, or cable cars was tried in several North American cities. [...] A notable transition took place in Washington, D.C. in the U.S. where horsecars were used on street railways from 1862 to the early 1890s. [...] From about 1890 to 1893 cable drives provided motive power to Washington streetcars, and after 1893 electricity powered the cars. [...] The advantages of eliminating animal <b>drive</b> <b>power</b> included dispensing {{with the need to}} feed the animals and clean up their waste.

2500|$|A {{small part}} of the {{workings}} of the drives is revealed in Galactic North. [...] The drive has six manual control dials that allow the power of the drive to be varied. [...] As the <b>drive</b> <b>power</b> is increased, so does the risk of an uncontrolled, ship destroying explosion. [...] Lighthuggers mount a pair of Conjoiner drives, both of which are controlled by a disembodied Conjoiner brain that performs rapid calculations to control the internal drive reactions. [...] If the turbulence within the drive exceeds the ability of the brain, the drive will explode. The drive is also designed to explode if non-Conjoiners attempt to open it for reverse engineering, or if the gap between two drives on the same ship grows too large. [...] This occurs because the Conjoiner brain is housed within one of the engines and controls the other remotely; once the other drive passes out of the brain's control, the internal reactions quickly spiral out of control.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a structured {{development of a}} compound state space model of an inverter <b>driven</b> <b>power</b> grid. It allows to perform stability investigations on power grids, depending on the inverter parameters influencing their dynamich behavior and on the grid structure. The general approach is to separate the active components, i. e. the inverters, from the passive components, i. e. the grid, and model them separately. A state space model of a single voltage source inverter is developed and then extended into a multi-inverter model. Based on the linearized power equations of one grid branch, a matrix representation of the grid is developed, based on the sorted node incidence matrix. The grid matrix model and the multi-inverter state space model are joined into one compound control model for inverter <b>driven</b> <b>power</b> grids...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Switching {{the devices}} to {{low-power}} states in prolonged period of inactivity {{is a widely}} used technique to conserve energy for battery-powered wireless devices. In this paper, we present a mathematical abstraction of time-out <b>driven</b> <b>power</b> management policies together with different wakeup mechanism in wireless networks to characterize the energy-performance trade-offs. The time-out <b>driven</b> <b>power</b> management is modeled as a M/G/ 1 /K queue with multiple vacations and an attention span. We then derive the steady state behaviors of such systems, and present a closed-form solution for systems with large buffers. The analysis reveals that the “best ” power management policy to minimize energy-delay product exhibits a threshold structure, i. e., when the traffic load is below certain threshold, a node should switch to the low-power state whenever possible and always remain active otherwise, and suggests a threshold-based power management protocol.
