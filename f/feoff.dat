2500|$|Yuan ( [...] , [...] ) is a Chinese surname ranked 37th in China by population. He {{selected}} the second character in his grandfather's style name, Boyuan (伯爰), {{to be his}} own family name. Yuan Taotu was granted a <b>feoff</b> in Yangjia (陽夏), {{in what is now}} Taikang county, Henan. This estate is regarded as the ancestral home of the earliest Yuan clan. [...] Through its connection with the ruling family of Chen, the Yuan house could also claim ancestry from the semi-legendary Emperor Shun. Descendants of Yuan house are mentioned by name in the Zuo Zhuan as holding high office in the state of Chen until it was extinguished by Chu in 479 BC.|$|E

[...] His words are (pp. 13-14, M. J. de Goeje's edition; Lugduni Batavorum, 1866)--"It was related to me by Abú Abíd el-Kásim bin Sallám; who said he was told by Ishák bin Isa, from Malík ibn Anas and from Rabíat, who heard from a number of the learned, that the Apostle of Allah (upon whom be peace!) gave in <b>feoff</b> (Iktá'at) to Bilál bin el-Háris el-Muzni, mines (Ma'ádin, i.e. of gold) in the district of Furú' (variant, Kurú'). Moreover, it was related to me by Amrú el-Nákid, and by Ibn Saham el-Antáki (of Antioch), who both declared to have heard from El-Haytham bin Jamíl el-Antáki, through Hammád bin Salmah, that Abú Makín, through Abú Ikrimah Maulá Bilál bin el-Háris el-Muzni, had averred 'The Apostle of Allah (upon whom be peace!) enfeoffed the said Bilál with (a bit of) ground containing a mountain and a (gold) mine; that the sons of Bilál sold part of the grant to one 'Umar bin 'Abd el-'Azíz, when a (gold) mine or, according, to others, two (gold) mines were found in it; that they said to the buyer, Verily we sold to thee land for cultivation, and we did not sell thee (gold) mining-ground; that they brought the letter of the Apostle (upon whom be peace!) in a (bound) volume: that 'Umar kissed it and rubbed it upon his eyes, and said, Of a truth let me see what hath come out of it (the mine) and what I have laid out upon it.' Then he deducted from them the expenses of working and returned to them the surplus. [...] . And I was told by Musa'b el-Zubayri, from Malik ibn Anas, that the Apostle of Allah (upon whom be peace!) gave in <b>feoff</b> to Bilál bin Háris mines in the district of Fara' (sic). There is no difference of opinion among our learned men on this subject, nor do I know any of our companions who contradicts (the statement) that the (gold) mine paid one-fourth per ten (= 2 1/2 per cent.) royalty (to the Bayt el-Mál, or Public Treasury). Musa'b further relates, from El-Zahri, that the (gold) mine defrayed the Zakát or poor-rate: he also said that the proportion was one-fifth (= 2 per cent.); like that which the people of El-Irák (Mesopotamia) take to this day from the (gold) mines of El-Fara' (sic), and of Nejrán, and of Zúl-Marwah, and of Wady El-Kura[EN#60] and others. Moreover, the fifth is also mentioned by Safáin el-Thauri, and by Abú Hanífah and Abú Yúsuf, {{as well as by the}} people of El-'Irák." ...|$|E
50|$|To allay {{northern}} suspicions {{and prevent}} conflict, Qian Chu {{stayed in the}} Song capital, Bianjing (now Kaifeng), and moved 3000 members of his household there. Qian nominally remained a king. His sons {{and a large number}} of the Wuyue elite were given various imperial posts and titles. Initially, Emperor Taizong of Song raised the prefecture of Yangzhou to the nominal state of Huaihai, and installed Qian Chu as King of Huaihai. In 984, Qian Chu was made King of Hannan (a smaller nominal <b>feoff)</b> instead, and in 987 reduced again to King of Hanyang, with the right to take up residence in Hanyang, but then immediately additionally created Prince of Xu, with an enlarged <b>feoff.</b> In 988, Qian Chu lost his title as king and was made Prince of Deng instead, with a larger nominal <b>feoff</b> and actual income.|$|E

2500|$|The age of burgraves in Middle Franconia had {{its origin}} in the High Middle Ages when king Henry VI <b>feoffed</b> Frederick III, who {{originated}} from Swabia, with the heritable fiefdom of the Nuremberg burgrave office in 1192. Frederick III founded the Frankish line of the House of Hohenzollern under the name [...] "Burgrave Frederick I of Nuremberg". Due to clever marriages and trade-offs the Frankish Zollern gained increasing wealth and influence.|$|R

5000|$|These estates had a {{thriving}} cultural scene which, for example, led to Eutin being described {{at the turn}} of the 19th century as the [...] "Weimar of the North". Until the middle of the 19th century the area was dominated by Denmark, which initially ran the region as a <b>feoff,</b> but eventually integrated it into the Danish nation-state. In 1867 Holstein Switzerland was transferred to Prussia as part of Holstein. After the end of the First World War some of the traditional estates were broken up. Following the Second World War, tourism has played a leading role in the economy of the region.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Ochsenkopf" [...] {{does not}} appear in old {{descriptions}} of the mountains. The first person to write about the Fichtelgebirge, Matthias von Kemnath (actually Matthias Widmann, b 23 February 1429 in Kemnath) reported in 1476: Ein bergk, hoch, weitt, wolbekant ligt in Beiern, gnant der Fichtelberg ("A mountain, high, wide and well-known, lies in Bavaria, known as the Fichtelberg"). In descriptions of the border in 1499 and 1536 the mountain is called Vichtelberg, thereafter the name was extended to the whole mountain region. It is also mentioned in old documents: around 1317 the Lords of Hirschberg were enfeoffed inter alia with the walt zu dem Vythenberge. By the 14th century iron ore was being extracted in the St. Veith Pit on the southern foot of the Ochsenkopf. Vyth → Veit → Fichtel. High-profile local history and name researchers have still not had the last word. The name Ochsenkopf appeared in mining deeds {{for the first time in}} 1495, when Lorenz von Ploben from Nürnberg was given the mine on the Fichtelberge [...] "near the Ochsenkopf" [...] as a <b>feoff.</b> That may be the first reference to the head of a steer carved into a rock on the suummit, which can still be seen today.|$|E

50|$|There is a {{total of}} 15 manors in Mäntsälä, 4 of which {{are open to the}} public, the rest being private residences. Russian czar Alexander I visited as guest of Ulla Möllersvärd in 1809 in the Mäntsälä manor lying in the city center. The manors emerged in the 17th century as noblemen <b>feoffs.</b> Traditionally the land belonged to the manors. There were many crofts in Mäntsälä and new {{legislation}} in 1918 enabled the crofters to claim the land for themselves. In the 1920s the manors were still a sizable land owner in the parish.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} years the Wohldenberg was consistently mortgaged and <b>feoffed.</b> But {{most of the time}} it was possessed by the bishopric of Hildesheim, as it is today again. Among other it was possessed by the earls of Wöltingerode who moved their domicile hereto in 1174. Their former domicile, castle Wöltingerode near Goslar, was at this time used as a Cistercians monastery, whose monks built up a distillery there. Temporarily robber-knights resided also at the castle Wohldenberg. In the beginning of the 14th century the castle stayed for a long time in the ownership of the Bortfeld family. Other owners of this time were: ...|$|R
25|$|In 1331 the burgraves {{moved to}} Ansbach. In 1363 they were {{elevated}} to sovereigns and in 1417 they were <b>feoffed</b> with the margrave of Brandenburg. Expensive holding of court and persistent {{conflicts with the}} imperial city Nuremberg {{lead to a high}} level of debt of the young principality and consequently they imposed an unbearable burden of taxes upon their subjects. As a consequence, on 6 May 1525 the German Peasants' War also broke out in southern Franconia. On this day rebellious peasants gathered on Hesselberg's peak, thence they went to Wassertrüdingen and captured the margrave vogt. Afterwards they plundered the monastery of Auhausen. On their way to Heidenheim the peasants were captured or killed by margrave soldiers from Gunzenhausen.|$|R
50|$|In the 11th century, the {{commendation}} ceremony {{required the}} liegeman {{to pay homage}} (homagium or Mannschaft), which involved the handclasping ceremony {{as well as a}} declaration of intent. The liege lord could also make a declaration, but he would often forego this. This was followed by the loyalty oath and sometimes a kiss. Since, in the Middle Ages, a binding legal act could be constituted by a symbolic action, an object was symbolically handed over in a process known as livery of seizin and could be a staff or a banner (called a Fahnenlehn). The emperor could also symbolically hand over his sceptre (in the so-called Zepterlehen). As literacy rose, a charter of feoffment was also made out as part of the act that, over time, listed the <b>feoffed</b> estate and benefits that the vassal was to receive in ever increasing detail.|$|R
