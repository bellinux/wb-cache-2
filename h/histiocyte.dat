40|$|The {{present study}} reports a rare case of {{systemic}} M. scrofulaceum infection in an AIDS patient and analyses the inflammatory infiltrate in a lymph node by immunohistochemistry. Special emphasis {{is put on}} the <b>histiocytes.</b> The diffuse infiltrate consists mainly of large <b>histiocytes</b> that contain numerous bacilli. These cells display the phenotype of mature <b>histiocytes</b> and in addition coexpress the antigens recognized by RFD 7 and RFD 9, both markers of different subsets of <b>histiocytes</b> which {{have been reported to}} be co-expressed by the infected <b>histiocytes</b> in the infiltrate of lepromatous lepra. Interdigitating reticulum cells are rare as well as T cells which are mainly of the suppressor/cytotoxic type. These findings are similar to those reported for lepromatous lepra and might indicate common deficiencies in T cell-macrophage interactions in both conditions.

Immune mouse <b>histiocytes</b> (from BCG-immunized animals) were able to induce cellular resistance in normal homologous and heterologous (rabbit) animal species; mouse histiocytic ribosomes were also tested in the homologous species and found to be active. Immune guinea pig <b>histiocytes</b> (from BCG-immunized guinea pigs) were ineffective in transferring cellular resistance to either homologous or heterologous (mouse and rabbit) animal species. Immune rabbit <b>histiocytes</b> were capable of inducing cellular resistance in mice and guinea pigs; rabbit histiocytic ribosomes were also tested in normal mice and found to be active in induction of cellular resistance. Recipient guinea pig <b>histiocytes</b> (from guinea pigs inoculated with immune rabbit <b>histiocytes)</b> were capable of inducing cellular resistance in normal guinea pigs and rabbits. Cultivation of lysed immune <b>histiocytes</b> of all three animal species on glycerol-blood agar medium failed to reveal any viable BCG; this provided one additional bit of evidence against the idea that induction of cellular resistance is due to viable bacilli...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{of passive}} {{transfer}} of cellular resistance, as manifested by refractoriness to necrotization with virulent tubercle bacilli, {{have shown that}} immune <b>histiocytes</b> or immune lymphocytes were effective transferring agents; immune polymorphonuclear leucocytes and immune serum as well as comparable cells from normal animals lacked this capacity. Comparisons of immune <b>histiocytes</b> and immune lymphocytes showed that the former cells were more efficient; this was indicated by (a) the smaller numbers of immune <b>histiocytes</b> needed for passive transfer, (b) the longer duration of cellular resistance in recipients given <b>histiocytes</b> than in those given lymphocytes, (c) the greater capacity of <b>histiocytes</b> to effect serial passive transfer, and (d) the ability of histiocytic but not lymphocytic lysates to transfer cellular resistance. Experiments to establish the mechanism of passive transfer of cellular resistance showed {{that there was no}} active induction of resistance in recipients through transfer of bacillary antigens contained in immune histiocytes; in fact, the results of serial passive transfers with immune <b>histiocytes</b> suggested an active replication of the "cell resistance factor. ...|$|R

The β subunit is also present in some of CD 8 (+) T lymphocytes. In the present study, the ontogeny of these <b>histiocytes</b> and lymphocytes was investigated. Human yolk sacs, embryos and fetuses from the 4 th to 21 st weeks of gestation were examined for the presence of S- 100 protein subunits by an immunohistochemical method, using antisera monospecific to each subunit. S- 100 α(+) <b>histiocytes</b> were present in yolk sacs and hepatic sinusoids by the 4 th week of gestation, before bone marrow hematopoiesin had developed. As gestation proceeded, their distribution and frequency became similar to those of S- 100 α(+) <b>histiocytes</b> of the adults. No S- 100 β(+) cells were found in yolk sacs. S- 100 β(+) <b>histiocytes</b> were first detected in the hepatic sinusoids of 5 th week embryos and later, they distributed in other lymphoid organs. S- 100 β(+) lymphocytes were not found in the liver and they were first detected in the thymus at the 12 th week of gestation, subsequently distributing in other lymphoid organs. These results suggest that S- 100 β(+) lymphocytes and <b>histiocytes</b> may belong to different cell lineages, and that S- 100 β(+) lymphocytes may not be the precursors of <b>histiocytes...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{rate and}} form {{of growth of}} Histoplasma capsulatum within <b>histiocytes</b> derived from homothermic and poikilothermic animals, and {{incubated}} at 25, 30, and 37 C, are described.

The generation time of the fungus in mouse cells incubated at 30 C was {{the same as it was}} at 37 C. Germ tube formation was not a prominent feature of intracellular growth at 30 C. The rate of growth of H. capsulatum within frog <b>histiocytes</b> at 30 and 25 C was slower than it was in mouse cells at the same temperatures. Some loss of frog <b>histiocytes</b> in cultures incubated at 37 C prevented accurate estimation of the rate of growth of the fungus at this temperature. Growth of H. capsulatum in frog <b>histiocytes</b> kept at 25 C was progressively retarded, and the retardation was accompanied by germination of the yeasts. Yeast-phase growth predominated in fish <b>histiocytes</b> incubated at 30 C, whereas germ tubes were formed within such cells incubated at 25 C.

50|$|The histiocytic sarcoma (HS) complex {{encompasses}} {{a number of}} distinctive clinical entities which will be described below. Some definitions are in order, and reflect the preferred nomenclature of the writing group of the <b>Histiocyte</b> Society. Histiocytic neoplasia which originates at a single site is called histiocytic sarcoma. This form of histiocytic sarcoma, which is often encountered on the extremities, has the best prognosis if treated early by surgical excision or by amputation of a limb. When spread to distant sites beyond the local lymph node occurs, the disease is then termed disseminated histiocytic sarcoma; this {{is more likely to}} occur unnoticed when primary lesions occur in cryptic sites (e.g. spleen, lung, and bone marrow). This latter form of HS is most like malignant histiocytosis (MH). MH is an aggressive, histiocytic neoplasm which arises in multiple sites simultaneously. Most lesions previously defined as MH are probably more correctly termed disseminated HS. The occurrence of true MH is difficult to establish because the lesions often occur in cryptic sites, and the existence of histiocytic neoplasia is only recognized after clinical signs have appeared and disease progression is advanced. HS and MH are capable of widespread metastasis, hence in time the 2 syndromes merge clinically and it is not always possible to differentiate true multicentric origin (MH) from widespread metastasis of disseminated HS. Also, it is never possible to know exactly how long the disease process has been operative. Hence, the perception is that both disseminated HS and MH follow a rapid clinical progression despite therapeutic intervention. This is certainly true once clinical signs are apparent, but the subclinical period is of unknown duration.|$|E

In contrast, the BCG-immune <b>histiocyte</b> and certain of its subcellular components (ribosomes and ribosomal RNA) were effective in inducing cellular resistance in normal animals against both Brucella and mycobacteria. When RNA was used, only immune ribosomal RNA was effective; when intact ribosomes were used, both immune and recipient ribosomes proved active.

40|$|Earlier reports (1, 2) {{from this}} {{laboratory}} {{have shown that}} immunization of animals with the BCG strain of tubercle bacillus resulted {{in the development of}} resistant populations of <b>histiocytes</b> in these animals; this form of cellular resistance was manifested by the refractoriness of infected immune <b>histiocytes</b> to necrotization by virulent tubercle bacilli (H 37 Rv strain).
