Speirs made his debut {{on the opening}} day of the 1909–10 season, as City lost 1–0 to Manchester United.

5|$|The next game, away to Scotland on 2 February, {{resulted}} in defeat for Wales, with the seven forwards system receiving {{much of the}} blame. The Williams–Gabe combination performed well on the left wing, but the Welshmen were unable to cross their opponents' line. Against Ireland at Cardiff Arms Park on 9 March, Wales fielded a team including eight Cardiffians. Gabe was appointed captain for the match, while Billy Trew - the former captain - and <b>Dicky</b> Jones, were replaced at halfback by Percy Bush, Cardiff's captain, and <b>Dicky</b> David, also from Cardiff and earning his first - and only - cap for Wales. Wales beat Ireland 29–0, and 26 of the points came from Cardiff players. In the first four minutes of the game, the Welshmen reached the Irish 25. Following a scrum, the ball reached Gabe, and he, after making some ground, passed to Williams, who ran in a try unopposed. Early in the second half, with Wales leading by two tries to nil, a lineout to Wales on the Irish 25, {{resulted in}} Williams receiving the ball and, after breaking through the Irish defence, with only Hinton, the fullback, to beat, passed to Gabe to score the try. Williams scored a second try after David, receiving the ball from the forwards, passed to Bush, who got past the Irish halfbacks, and passed to Gabe, missing out Evans. Gabe then ran up to Hinton, and passed the ball to Williams to score. A third try came for Williams in similar style, and he came close to scoring a fourth. The David–Bush halfback pairing, and the Gabe–Williams partnership on the left wing, supported by the excellent play of Winfield at fullback, {{and that of the}} forwards, were the decisive factors in the Welsh triumph over Ireland.|$|E
