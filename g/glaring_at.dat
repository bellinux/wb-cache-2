25|$|The series follows Umaru Doma, a {{high school}} girl who lives with her older brother Taihei. At school, Umaru {{appears to be the}} ideal student with good looks, top grades, and a lot of talent. Once she gets home, however, she reverts into a layabout who spends her time lying around, playing video games, and {{constantly}} depending on her older brother, much to his dismay. Over the course of the series, Umaru's alternative personalities help her become friends with her female classmates Kirie Motoba, who has a reputation of <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> people; and Sylphynford Tachibana, her competitive school rival; both of whom turn out to be little sisters of Taihei's coworkers.|$|E
60|$|The {{two sisters}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> {{each other over}} the {{helpless}} man between them. Then another woman entered who looked sympathetically at Gabriel and then <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> them both. It was Mrs Markle. At which, happily for Gabriel, the family bickering ceased.|$|R
60|$|As Burley {{must have}} <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Bothwell when they rushed {{together}} in the dread encounter on the mountain side; as Achilles may have <b>glared</b> <b>at</b> Hector when at last they met, each resolved to test in fatal conflict the prowess of the other, so did Dr Fillgrave <b>glare</b> <b>at</b> his foe from Greshamsbury, when, on turning round on his exalted heel, he found his nose on a level with the top button of Dr Thorne's waistcoat.|$|R

500|$|The final {{match of}} the night and main event was the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match between Yokozuna and Bret Hart. The guest referee for the match was [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper, while the guest ring {{announcer}} was Burt Reynolds and the guest timekeeper was Jennie Garth. Yokozuna attacked Hart before the bell, and Hart attempted a couple of comebacks in vain. Eventually, Yokozuna made a mistake and allowed Hart to knock him to the mat. Cornette tried to distract Piper, but Piper punched him and knocked him off the ring apron. Yokozuna performed a leg drop on Hart but then missed an Avalanche attempt. Bret maintained the advantage for a little while, but Yokozuna came back with a belly to belly suplex. When Yokozuna attempted the Banzai drop, however, he lost his balance and fell to the mat. Hart quickly pinned Yokozuna to win the title. He celebrated in the ring with several of the face wrestlers including Lex Luger, [...] "Rowdy" [...] Roddy Piper, Razor Ramon, Tatanka, The 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg and [...] "Macho Man" [...] Randy Savage. Others who joined in the celebration included Burt Reynolds, Rhonda Shear, Donnie Wahlberg, and WWF commentators Gorilla Monsoon and Vince McMahon. Owen Hart stood in the aisle, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> Bret, then quickly left.|$|E
500|$|In a much-noted incident, Model had to {{deal with}} an attempt by Adolf Hitler to {{interfere}} with his arrangements. A telephone call from Army Group Center's chief of staff on 19 January 1942 informed him that Hitler, having become nervous about the direct Soviet threat against Vyazma, had decided that XLVII Panzer Corps, 2nd SS Division Das Reich and 5th Panzer Division were not to be employed in the imminent counterattack but reserved for other use in the rearguard. Immediately, Model drove back from Rzhev to Vyazma in a raging blizzard and boarded a plane for East Prussia. Bypassing the figure of field marshal Günther von Kluge, his immediate superior, he sought a personal confrontation with Hitler. At first he attempted to lay out his reasons in the best, dispassionate General Staff manner, only to find the Führer unmoved by logic. Suddenly, <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> Hitler through his monocle, Model brusquely demanded to know: [...] "Mein Führer, who commands Ninth Army, you or I?". Hitler, shocked at the defiance of his newest army commander, tried to find another solution favorable for both, but Model still was not satisfied. [...] "Good, Model", the exasperated Hitler finally responded. [...] "You do it as you please, but it will be your head at risk".|$|E
500|$|In salamanders, defence of a {{territory}} involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder. This may involve snapping, chasing and sometimes biting, occasionally causing {{the loss of}} a tail. The behaviour of red back salamanders (Plethodon cinereus) has been much studied. 91% of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre (yard) of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock. A similar proportion, when moved experimentally a distance of , found their way back to their home base. The salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged [...] in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair. These deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas. Much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals. An aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> the opponent who often turned away submissively. If the intruder persisted, a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves. Damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival, either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.|$|E

2500|$|The King had a [...] "long talk" [...] with Robertson on 1 July and {{was left}} {{convinced}} that French {{should be removed}} as Commander-in-Chief of the BEF. Attending a council of war in London in early July 1915, Robertson was asked at the end {{if he had any}} comments—he produced a map and delivered a 45-minute lecture, and when interrupted stood <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> the minister. His presentation made a strong impression compared to the indecisiveness of the politicians and Kitchener.|$|E
2500|$|The {{burning of}} Brody had devoured {{almost half of}} the town – several hundred {{exclusively}} Jewish houses...With its old market place, the unsigned area looked impoverished and dejected. Many stores, especially the bigger one and richer ones, were locked or boarded up…The instant…I entered the market, we were surrounded by whole army of poor, ragged, famished kids, who were begging for a kopek. Most of them were Christian, but three or four were jewish. I gave each child a few kopeks, no matter what is his religion. But the instant I handed a coin to a Jew, all Christian children began shouting at me: [...] "Don’t give him anything! Don’t give him anything! He is a Jew! The children were joined by a Jewish beggar, a strange woman of about sixty. She wore a red dress, her grey hair was powdered, and her movements were nervous. She stood before me, grinning, her nasty, hungry eyes <b>glaring</b> <b>at</b> me, and she sort of danced a little. Then in a hoarse voice, mangling the language, she began warbling a sentimental Russian song, [...] "Ptichka Kanareyka", dearest little canary, about a young man who sends out a canary with a greeting for his beloved. The old beggar woman's screechy voice and outlandish appearance made a terrible impression on me. I gave her some coins and tried to hurry off. But she blocked my way, taring into my eyes and squawking her horrible song. She plainly expected me to be surprised that she could sing in Russian. I was haunted {{for the rest of the}} day by the nightmare of the beggar's appearance and performance.|$|E
