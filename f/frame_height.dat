50|$|In 1913, French film {{entrepreneur}} and inventor Léon Gaumont unveiled Chronochrome, a full-color additive system. The camera used three lenses {{with color}} filters to photograph red, {{green and blue}} color components simultaneously on consecutive frames of one strip of 35 mm black-and-white film. The projector had a corresponding triad of lenses. To reduce the strain imposed on the film as the mechanism in each device pulled it down three frames at a time, <b>frame</b> <b>height</b> was reduced from the usual four film perforations to three, resulting in a widescreen image format identical with the modern 16:9 aspect ratio.|$|E
50|$|While {{lifting a}} vehicle to gain ground {{clearance}} is helpful to off-roaders, it can also make a vehicle dangerous as, when a vehicle has been lifted, its center of gravity rises, which causes the vehicle to {{be more likely to}} tumble in certain situations.

50|$|The SW1001, in essence, {{placed the}} hood and {{powertrain}} of the SW1000 with the underframe and cab of the earlier SW1200. The EMD 645-series diesel engine had a deeper crankcase and oil pan than the SW1200's EMD 567-series engine. The engine had to be mounted on risers for sufficient clearance, raising the whole hood about 6 in above the walkway compared to the SW1000, and requiring a spacer under the hood. The cab {{was similar to that}} of the SW1200, but not identical; it is longer, and has a different window arrangement. The SW1001 uses the same pilot plates as the SW1000; given the lower <b>frame</b> <b>height,</b> these protrude above the walkway deck height, giving the most obvious SW1001 spotting feature.|$|E

For example, if a folder contains many large video files totaling hundreds of gigabytes, and the Window Explorer pane is in Details view mode showing a property contained within the metadata (for example Date, Length, <b>Frame</b> <b>Height),</b> Windows Explorer might have to search the contents of the whole file for the meta data. Some damaged files can cause a prolonged delay as well.

5000|$|In 1956 they {{launched}} the Ross Auto 25, which could carry a payload of 25 cwt when {{fitted with a}} milk float body, but with a low <b>frame</b> <b>height</b> of just 1.5 ft, could also be fitted with a refuse collection body, or {{could be used as}} a tractor unit, when it could carry 1 ton and pull a 1-ton trailer. It was 4 ft wide, and came fitted with a [...] motor, which was mounted on Metalastic rubber bushes, to reduce shock loads to the transmission system. Two racks of batteries were mounted either side of the chassis, and battery capacities of 161 Amp-hours to 240 Amp-hours could be accommodated, depending on the use to which the vehicle would be put. The batteries were designed so that they could easily be replaced with fully charged batteries if they became flat. Control was by a two or three speed fully automatic controller and contactor assembly. The vehicle was extremely manoeuvrable, having a turning circle of only 20 ft, and depending on the gear ratio of the back axle, had a top speed of 8 or 16 mph. [...] Ross exhibited a four-wheel ride-on float with a vertical steering wheel at the 1958 Dairy Show. It was the first time they had attended the show, and the 20 cwt vehicle had a range of 12 - 20 miles and a speed of 10-12 mph.|$|E
40|$|A {{swinging}} arm type of <b>frame</b> <b>height</b> sensor {{was designed to}} measure the distance variation between the soil surface and the frame of a sensor system developed for the online measurement (tractor-based continuous measurement) of the spatial variation in soil compaction. A linear variable displacement transducer (LVDT) with a 0. 2 m stroke length was used to connect the frame to a metal wheel of the <b>frame</b> <b>height</b> sensor at the axle of the wheel. An analytical-statistical hybrid model was developed for the direct calculation of the <b>frame</b> <b>height</b> variation. Tests were performed on four surfaces: asphalt road; rough dirt track; and agricultural silty clay loam soil (bare soil and soil with stubble present). The results were compared with ultrasonic measurements to validate the sensor. An excellent correspondence of distance measurement {{was found between the}} two sensors with a standard error (SE) of 0. 0033 m and with a high determination coefficient R- 2 of 0. 93. However, the measurement of the <b>frame</b> <b>height</b> was found to be exaggerated when using the wheel-LVDT sensor on the dirt track, which was attributed to the wheel sinkage in the loose soil. Although the standard error between the wheel-LVDT measurements and ultrasonic distance measurements was still low (0. 0049 m) for the dirt track, this was higher than that found on the asphalt road. Similarly, the trajectories of the <b>frame</b> <b>height</b> measurement performed on the field showed a good correspondence between the wheel-LVDT sensor and the ultrasonic sensor. The wheel-LVDT sensor measured a slightly larger height than the ultrasonic sensor, with mean deviations ranging between 0. 018 and 0. 021 m. In comparison with the standard error (0. 035 m) of the measurement line with maize stubble, lower standard errors of 0. 0064 and 0. 0088 m with high R- 2 were found for the bare soil surface without and with subsoiler, respectively. Pressing of the stubble by the relatively large mass of the wheel of 175 N made the measurement of <b>frame</b> <b>height</b> variation with the wheel-LVDT sensor apparently less affected by stubble compared to the measurement with the ultrasonic sensor. Therefore, the wheel-LVDT sensor can be used more accurately than the ultrasonic sensor, in fields covered with plant residues and stubble, providing the input for the position control of the tractor three-point linkage aiming at online measurement of soil compaction at constant depths. Based on a certain soil type, moisture content and dry bulk density, correction factors need to be selected and subtracted from the wheel-LVDT sensor output to compensate for the extra distance measured due to the wheel sinkage on a bare soil surface.

40|$|Frame and cab {{suspension}} {{designs of}} Class 8 heavy trucks were investigated {{to see their}} effects on ride comfort. Four trucks were used in this study, each with a different frame: a factory low frame, a lightweight low frame, a factory high frame, and a lightweight high frame. There were two different <b>frame</b> <b>heights</b> and three thicknesses. Two different rear cab suspensions were also tried out on each truck. Both suspensions used two airsprings and two dampers mounted vertically to control the vertical motion. The first suspension used two horizontally mounted dampers to control the lateral motion, while the second used a panhard rod connected to a torsion spring. In addition, two different sets of airsprings and two sets of vertical shocks were tried with each suspension, giving eight suspension combinations. The trucks were shaken through the forward drive (second) axle using two 5500 lb hydraulic actuators with displacement control. The steering (first) axle was left {{in contact with the}} ground (through the tires) and the rear drive (third) axle was strapped to the truck’s frame and acted solely as dead weight.
