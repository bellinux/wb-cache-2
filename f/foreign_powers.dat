5|$|After China's {{defeat in}} the First Opium War, the country was {{forcibly}} opened to foreign trade {{by a number of}} treaties collectively referred to as the Unequal Treaties. Following the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), the British established the first treaty ports. Following China's concession to the British Empire, other <b>foreign</b> <b>powers</b> including France, the United States, Portugal, Germany, Japan, and Russia won concessions as well. Foreigners, who were centered in foreign sections of the cities, enjoyed legal extraterritoriality as stipulated in the Unequal Treaties. Foreign clubs, racecourses, and churches were established in major treaty ports. Some of these port areas were directly leased by <b>foreign</b> <b>powers,</b> such as the concessions in China, effectively removing them from the control of local governments.|$|E
5|$|Some {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} that <b>foreign</b> <b>powers,</b> including Russia, may have been behind the shooting. They pointed {{out the fact that}} Armenia and Azerbaijan were close in signing some kind of an agreement at the OSCE 1999 Istanbul summit over Karabakh, something not in Russia's interest.|$|E
5|$|Future space {{missions}} carrying dogs {{would be}} designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent <b>foreign</b> <b>powers</b> from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.|$|E

5|$|Ranavalona's reign {{was marked}} by a {{struggle}} between France and Britain to secure control over Madagascar. The French, who held several small islands off Madagascar, were interested in gaining control over the main island but this move was opposed by the British who {{had an interest in}} maintaining a safe passage to India. Ranavalona pursued a policy of self-reliance to limit the influence of these <b>foreign</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sargsyan, {{along with}} Demirchyan and several others, {{was assassinated in}} the Armenian {{parliament}} shooting of 27 October 1999. The perpetrators were {{sentenced to life in}} prison. However, the distrust toward the trial process gave birth to a number of conspiracy theories. Some experts and politicians argue that their assassination was masterminded by Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan. Others have suspected the possible involvement of <b>foreign</b> <b>powers</b> in the shooting.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{version of}} the Bricker Amendment, {{considered}} by the Senate in 1953–54, declared that no treaty could {{be made by the}} United States that conflicted with the Constitution; treaties could not be self-executing without the passage of separate enabling legislation through Congress; treaties could not give Congress legislative powers beyond those specified in the Constitution. It also limited the president's power to enter into executive agreements with <b>foreign</b> <b>powers.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Previously FISA only {{defined the}} {{duration}} of a surveillance order against a <b>foreign</b> <b>power</b> (defined in [...] ) [...] This was amended by section 207 (Duration of FISA surveillance of non-United States persons who are agents of a <b>foreign</b> <b>power)</b> to allow surveillance of agents of a <b>foreign</b> <b>power</b> (as defined in section [...] ) for a maximum of 90 days. Section 304(d)(1) was also amended to extend orders for physical searches from 45 days to 90 days, and orders for physical searches against agents of a <b>foreign</b> <b>power</b> are allowed for a maximum of 120 days. The act also clarified that extensions for surveillance could be granted for a maximum of a year against agents of a <b>foreign</b> <b>power.</b>|$|R

5|$|While the Polish {{king and}} the Senate of Poland were debating on the course of action, the {{patience}} of <b>foreign</b> <b>powers</b> was running out. Eventually, {{one of the most}} prominent opponents of agreeing to the foreign demands, bishop Adam Stanisław Krasiński, was abducted by Cossacks and transported to Warsaw, where the foreign ambassadors demanded that the King and the Senate call in the Sejm (the entire Polish parliament) to ratify the partition. In another sign of their influence, the next meeting of the Senate saw the senators from the annexed territories denied participation (those denied participation included the bishop of Inflanty, the voivode of Ruthenia and the voivode of Witebsk). When no help was forthcoming and the armies of the combined nations occupied Warsaw to compel by force of arms the calling of the assembly, no alternative was available save passive submission to their will. Warsaw was de facto a garrison of the <b>foreign</b> <b>powers,</b> with their forces commanded by the Austrian (or Russian, sources vary) general Abram Romanius (Abraham). On 19 April the Senate agreed to call for the Sejm to convene.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the early}} Meiji era {{witnessed}} a warming between the imperial court and <b>foreign</b> <b>powers,</b> relations with France temporarily soured {{due to the}} initial support by France for the Shogun. Soon however a second military mission was invited to Japan in 1874, and a third one in 1884. A high level of interaction resumed around 1886, when France helped build the Imperial Japanese Navy's first large-scale modern fleet, {{under the direction of}} naval engineer Louis-Émile Bertin. The modernization of the country had started during the last years of the Shogunate, and the Meiji government ultimately adopted the same policy.|$|E
5|$|An {{airport at}} Lakselv was first {{proposed}} out of military considerations. Despite a Norwegian neutrality policy, {{there was a}} fear that Norway could be occupied by <b>foreign</b> <b>powers</b> {{to take advantage of}} the country's strategic position. The military therefore wanted to construct airfields throughout the country to increase the air force's mobility. Especially Finnmark was regarded as a key location, given the increased Soviet militarization on the Kola Peninsula. Increased military funding was granted from 1937, and the following year, a triangular runway was built at Banak.|$|E

50|$|With the {{beginning}} of democratic elections, Taiwanese nationalists now view Taiwanese citizens who collaborated with a hostile <b>foreign</b> <b>power,</b> especially the People's Republic of China, as Taijian. At the same time Chinese nationalists view these so called Taiwanese nationalists as hanjian for collaborating with a hostile <b>foreign</b> <b>power</b> such as Japan.|$|R
5|$|Byzantine Greeks, {{forming the}} {{majority}} of the Byzantine Empire proper at the height of its power, gradually came under the dominance of <b>foreign</b> <b>powers</b> with the decline of the Empire during the Middle Ages. Those who came under Arab Muslim rule, either fled their former lands or submitted to the new Muslim rulers, receiving the status of Dhimmi. Over the centuries these surviving Christian societies of former Byzantine Greeks in Arab realms evolved into Antiochian Greeks, Melchites or merged into the societies of Arab Christians, existing to this day.|$|E
5|$|He was {{preoccupied with}} his own security, {{regularly}} changing where he slept and sometimes grounding all other planes in Libya when he was flying. He made particular requests when traveling to foreign nations. During his trips to Rome, Paris, Madrid, Moscow, and New York City, he resided in a bulletproof tent, following his Bedouin traditions. Gaddafi was notably confrontational in his approach to <b>foreign</b> <b>powers,</b> and generally shunned Western ambassadors and diplomats, believing them to be spies.|$|E
5|$|In the House of Representatives, Voorhis was a loyal {{supporter}} of the New Deal and compiled a liberal voting record. His major legislative achievement was the Voorhis Act of 1940 requiring registration of certain organizations controlled by <b>foreign</b> <b>powers.</b> After being re-elected by comfortable margins four times, he faced Nixon in 1946 in a bitter campaign in which Voorhis' supposed endorsement by groups linked to the Communist Party {{was made into a}} major issue. Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against Nixon in 1948.|$|E
5000|$|Section 702 {{expands the}} {{definition}} of [...] "agent of a foreign power" [...] to include a non-U.S. person who: (1) acts in the United States for or {{on behalf of a}} <b>foreign</b> <b>power</b> engaged in clandestine intelligence activities in the United States contrary to U.S. interests or as an officer, employee, or member of a <b>foreign</b> <b>power,</b> irrespective of whether the person is inside the United States; or (2) knowingly aids, abets, or conspires with any person engaging in an international {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} destruction on behalf of a <b>foreign</b> <b>power</b> or conducting activities in preparation for such proliferation.|$|R

5|$|In {{the area}} of {{warships}} also, {{some of the most}} recent ironclads such as the Kōtetsu coexisted with older types of steamboats and even traditional sailboats. The Shogunate initially had a rather strong edge in warships, and it had the vision to order the state-of-the-art French-made Kotetsu, although the ship was blocked from delivery by <b>foreign</b> <b>powers</b> on ground of neutrality once the conflict had started, and was ultimately remitted to the Imperial faction shortly after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that foreign}} support would be {{necessary}} for {{the continued existence of}} the United Belgian States, the Statists tried to make contact with <b>foreign</b> <b>powers</b> they believed to be sympathetic. Despite numerous attempts, however, the revolution failed to gain foreign support. The Dutch were not interested and, although the Prussian king, Frederick William II, was sympathetic and did send some troops to aid the revolutionaries in July, Prussia was also forced to withdraw its forces under combined Austrian and British pressure.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{requested}} {{help from}} British Admiral William Bowles. He wrote from Chile {{and expected to}} find him in Buenos Aires, but Bowles had embarked for Río de Janeiro. Bowles considered that San Martín was more trustworthy than Alvear, and praised his monarchism. San Martín did not obtain the ships and interrupted the correspondence with Bowles for some months. He returned to Chile; his wife Remedios stayed in Buenos Aires with her daughter Mercedes because of her health problems. Unable to get help from either Buenos Aires or <b>foreign</b> <b>powers,</b> San Martín promoted a more decisive commitment from Chile to finance the navy.|$|E

5|$|The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was {{instructed}} by Frederick III {{to negotiate with}} the Swedes, and the resulting peace treaty can largely be credited to him. Without any direct involvement by <b>foreign</b> <b>powers,</b> the Danes and Swedes managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much to the surprise of both parties. A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Prince's Palace of Monaco is the {{official}} residence of the Sovereign Prince of Monaco. Built in 1191 as a Genoese fortress, during its long and often dramatic history it has been bombarded and besieged by many <b>foreign</b> <b>powers.</b> Since {{the end of the}} 13th century, it has been the stronghold and home of the Grimaldi family who first captured it in 1297. The Grimaldi ruled the area first as feudal lords, and from the 17th century as sovereign princes, but their power was often derived from fragile agreements with their larger and stronger neighbours.|$|E
