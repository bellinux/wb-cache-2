40|$|The {{most common}} types of {{orofacial}} pain originate at the dental or periodontal level {{or in the}} musculoskeletal structures. However, the patient may present pain in this region even though the source is located elsewhere in the body. One possible source of <b>heterotopic</b> <b>pain</b> is of cardiac origin. Objectives: Report two cases of orofacial pain of cardiac origin and review the clinical cases described in the literature. Study Design: Description of clinical cases and review of clinical cases. Results and conclusions: Nine cases of atypical pain of cardiac origin are recorded, which include 5 females and 4 males. In craniofacial structures, pain of cardiac origin is usually bilateral. At the craniofacial level, the most frequent location described is in the throat and jaw. Pain of cardiac origin is considered atypical due to its loca-tion, although roughly 10 % of the cases of cardiac ischemia manifest primarily in craniofacial structures. Finally, the differential diagnosis of pain of odontogenic origin {{must be taken into}} account with pain of non-odontogenic origin (muscle, psychogenic, neuronal, cardiac, sinus and neurovascular pain) in order to avoid diagnostic error...|$|E
40|$|Myogenous pain is {{frequently}} associated with tenderness of the involved muscle. One way of quantifying tenderness is to evaluate pressure pain thresholds [PPTs]. Pressure pain threshold meausurements, however, show marked inter-individual and intra-individual variations. We designed {{a series of}} experiments to investigate the effects of several factors on PPT threshold variations in human jaw muscle [masseter and temporalis] in healthy subjects and patients with myogenous pain. Short-term and long-term reliability of pressure algometry were evaluated in normal subjects; the inter-individual variability {{was found to be}} much higher than the intra-individual variability, a result suggesting that pressure algometers are particularly indicated for longitudinal within-subject design studies. A non-experimental emotional stressor [a difficult pre-graduate examination] in healthy subjects was found to decrease the mechanical pain thresholds of the masticatory muscles, The ovarian cycle in healthy fertile women also influenced muscle sensitivity, with PPTs being significantly lower in the periovulatory phase. Prolonged chewing activity in normal subjects did not modify pain thresholds, a result indicating that jaw muscles are extremely resistant to fatigue induced by prolonged dynamic contractions. In contrast, static endurance tasks [sustained bilateral biting at 7. 5, 10, 15, 25 and 40 % of the maximal voluntary contraction on bite force transducers in the molar regions until exhaustion] in healthy subjects significantly decreased PPTs. Short-term periodontal pain [provoked in healthy subjects by inserting orthodontic separators] significantly reduced PPTs. Pressure pain thresholds of jaw muscles in female myogenous patients [i. e., affected with myofascial pain] were significantly lower than in control subjects. In conclusion, in healthy subjects psychological stress, masticatory activity, <b>heterotopic</b> <b>pain</b> and ovarian cycle can affect PPT of the masseter and termporalis muscles, however, the contribution of each factor to the variations of PPT range from 0 to 25 % at the most. These values are far below the differences in percentage found between muscle pain patients and control subjects [4 - 50 %]...|$|E
40|$|Synaptic plasticity, {{including}} {{long-term potentiation}} (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), represents a cellular model {{of learning and}} memory. LTP, a long-lasting increase of synaptic strength, can be induced by electrical stimulation with a high frequency. Low-frequency stimulation (LFS) leads to a decrease of synaptic transmission referred to as LTD. Synaptic plasticity was shown in the nociceptive system. LTP is suggested {{to be involved in}} central sensitization of pain, leading to a so-called pain memory. As LFS is able to reverse LTP, it might be useful to attenuate or even erase pain memory. Therefore it is of great interest to investigate LFS-induced LTD in humans, in order to use it in future therapy of chronic pain. So far, most studies were conducted in animals, showing sustained homosynaptic LTD after LFS of spinal afferents. The few studies in humans investigated the influence of LFS on trigeminal reflexes, evoked potentials and general pain perception. Present thesis is dealing with a detailed investigation of LTD in spinal nociceptive processing in healthy human. In all parts nociceptive A-delta fibers were electrically stimulated by a concentric electrode. Painful test stimulation series were applied before (Pre) and after (Post) conditioning LFS (1 Hz, 20 min) to the hand dorsum. In Control experiments with the same volunteers no LFS was applied, but stimulation was interrupted. LFS effect was examined by electrophysiological, psychophysical and brain imaging methods. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, putative homotopy of LTD was investigated in 30 volunteers by alternating application of test stimulation series unilateral to radial and ulnar side of right hand dorsum or bilateral to radial side of right and left hand dorsum. Conditioning LFS was applied to radial side of right hand dorsum. Somatosensory evoked cortical potential were recorded and volunteers rated stimulus intensity. After homotopic LFS, amplitude of cortical potential and pain rating significantly decreased. Amplitude reduction after heterotopic LFS did not differ from habituation effects in Control experiment without LFS. <b>Heterotopic</b> <b>pain</b> perception was not affected. This part demonstrated homotopic organization of LTD. Investigation of LFS effect on sensory and affective pain perception in the second part of the study was performed on 20 healthy volunteers, who were asked to rate their pain on multidimensional assessment including Verbal Rating Scale of perceived stimulus intensity and unpleasantness and Pain Perception Scale with sensory and affective items. After LFS, pain perception ratings were reduced as compared to Pre series and Control experiments. During LFS, ratings decreased. Factor analysis of sensory items of the Pain Perception Scale revealed sole reduction of superficial sharp pain perception after LFS in contrast to Control experiment. Perception of deep rhythmic pain decreased over time. Deep constant pain and superficial heat pain were not affected. This study showed sustained LTD of sensory and affective components of pain. Reduction of sharp pain points to A-delta fiber mediated LTD. In the third part of the thesis, LFS effects on cerebral activation were investigated in 17 healthy male volunteers by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Volunteers rated sensory and affective pain perception. Electrical test stimulation activated brain areas involved in sensory (primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, posterior insula) and affective (anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula) pain processing. After LFS, activity was significantly reduced. There was no change during Control experiments. Sensory and affective pain rating solely decreased after LFS. Pain relief was correlated with increased activity after LFS in rostral part of anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, striatum, frontal and temporal cortex. This part revealed LTD of pain-related cerebral activation, involving sensory and affective processes. Increased brain activation after LFS suggested involvement of endogenous pain modulatory systems leading to stronger LTD. The present thesis indicated sustained reduction of nociception and pain after LFS for at least one hour. Homotopic A-delta fiber mediated LTD was expressed by declined somatosensory evoked potentials, sensory and affective pain perception rating and pain-related cerebral activation. Reduction of nociceptive processing might be due to peripheral effects on the first nociceptive synapse as it is indicated from in vitro studies. The magnitude of pain relief was correlated with increased brain activation after LFS, suggesting an involvement of endogenous pain modulatory pathways. This thesis was an important step towards the understanding of LTD in humans. Detailed knowledge about LTD is a prerequisite in order to use LFS as therapy in chronic pain patients in future...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Toothache {{prevalence}} in {{the overall}} population is considerable. However, for clinical purposes, the classification schemes available {{do not appear to}} be sufficiently sophisticated. Moreover, not all known forms of dental pain are considered. A refined classification that meets current standards is therefore introduced. To facilitate diagnosis, the characteristic features of the various types of odontalgia are summarized. RESULTS: The new classification differentiates among seven different origins of pain: 1. dentinal pain (originating from the pulpal tissues), 2. pulpal pain (originating from the pulpal tissues), 3. periodontal pain, 4. alveolar-osseous pain, 5. atypical odontalgia, 6. <b>heterotopic</b> dental <b>pain,</b> 7. odontalgia associated with primary psychosocial factors. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, the proposed classification differentiates among the different forms of odontalgia more precisely than all previous ones. However, its viability and advantages over other available classification schemes still need to be verified in daily practice...|$|R
40|$|A close {{relationship}} between painful and non-painful (somatosensory) percepction was noticed already in the past centuries and led into development of many analgesic methods. Only basic neuroanatomical and neurophysiological research using animal models of nociception was able to shed more light on their proper mechanisms until the era of modern non- invasive imaging methods. The main aim of this thesis was to analyze non-invasively, in human volunteers and patients with chronic pain, spatiotemporal relations between brain evoked responses to painful (or aversive) and non-painful stimuli. In next step, to discuss the roles of different engaged mechanisms in found interactions and suggest recommendations for further research of pain. 4 experimental studies (3 in healthy volunteers and 1 in patients with failed back surgery syndrome) are presented. Using high-resolution EEG, phasic electrical stimulation of median, tibial or sural nerve(s), and source analysis of recorded data, modulations of all repersentative components of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) by several interfering conditions were analyzed. In healthy volunteers, effects of <b>heterotopic</b> repetitive heat <b>pain</b> administered {{to the right side}} of the body (ipsilateral to electrically stimulated nerve) were tested in Experiment 1 (compared to the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{retrospectively}} {{studied the}} results achieved in adolescent and adult patients with cerebral palsy, following management of chronically painful dislocated hips with the McHale procedure. Thirteen patients with seventeen procedures {{were included in}} the study. The indication for surgery was pain in all patients. Limitation in sitting was also reported in eight cases and nursing care was difficult in ten of thirteen patients. All patients underwent clinical and radiological examination of the hips, and a questionnaire was answered by both parents and caretakers. Improvement was noted in all patients with respect to pain. In six patients sitting was tolerated for longer intervals and 10 out of 13 patients were easier to nurse owing to improved mobility of the hip. Although these results appear promising, the procedure had a high complication rate, including <b>heterotopic</b> ossification, residual <b>pain</b> caused by hardware, fracture and pulmonary complications, for which a second procedure was necessary in several cases. There was also in several cases a prolonged period of pain postoperatively, for which an additional procedure was needed in eight patients. The McHale procedure is a technique that can provide pain relief and improvement in motion. There is however a high incidence of failure and complications. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Heterotopic {{pregnancy}} {{is a rare}} event consisting of simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancies. If undiagnosed, it is probable the patient will present to an Emergency Department and require emergent care. Case Report: A 25 year-old woman arrived at the Emergency Department at 14 weeks gestation reporting sharp abdominal cramping and pelvic pain {{with a history of}} current tobacco use. Trans-abdominal ultrasound revealed a viable intrauterine pregnancy consistent with 14 weeks, closed cervix with free fluid noted in pelvis, and no evidence of ovarian torsion. Over the next three hours, the patient’s condition deteriorated and hemoglobin levels dropped. The surgeon on call was consulted and suspected ruptured hepatic adenoma versus hepatic hemangioma versus visceral aneurysm. A laparotomy was emergently performed with supraceliac control of aorta to permit resuscitation, and the right and left upper quadrants of the abdominal cavity were investigated without discovery of bleeding source. Further investigation revealed ruptured left tubal ectopic pregnancy and a partial salpingectomy was performed. Conclusions: This case serves as a clinical reminder that while heterotopic {{pregnancy is}} thought to be rare, when a patient presents with known intrauterine pregnancy and abdominal <b>pain,</b> <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy {{should be included in the}} differential diagnosis. More common use of assisted reproductive technology may increase the incidence of heterotopic pregnancies, making familiarity with the signs, symptoms, and risk factors for this condition important...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the clinical outcomes of radial head excision for multifragmentary radial head fracture in patients over 65  years old. Methods: We retrospectively examined 30 patients over 65  years of age treated with radial head excision for comminuted radial head fractures. Patients were evaluated through clinical examinations, administrative questionnaires (DASH—Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand; MEPS—Mayo Elbow Performance Score, VAS—Visual Analog Scale) and plain films. Results: The mean follow-up was 40  months (range 24 – 72  months); 27 out of 30 patients {{claimed to be}} satisfied. The mean DASH score was 13 (range 3 – 45. 8) and mean MEPS was 79 (range 65 – 97). The radiographic evaluation showed 21 cases of elbow arthritis; only two of them complained about <b>pain.</b> <b>Heterotopic</b> ossification was evident in six cases with functional impairment in only one patient. Six patients with increased ulnar variance had clinical distal radio-ulnar joint instability. Discussion: Radial head excision has been considered a safe surgical procedure with satisfactory clinical outcomes. Development in biomechanical studies and prosthetic replacement of the radial head question the validity of radial head excision. In current literature, there are neither long-term follow-up studies on radial head prosthesis outcomes nor studies which consider elderly patient samples. Conclusion: Radial head resection remains a good option when a radial head fracture occurs in elderly patients, {{taking into account the}} influence of poor bone quality and comorbidities on the outcome. Radial head excision is not indicated in the presence of associated lesions, because of the risk of residual elbow instability; complications associated with advanced age must be considered and a strict follow-up granted...|$|R
40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} answer three {{questions}} related to chronic myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) : 1) Is the motor cortex excitability, as assessed by transcranial magnetic stimulation parameters (TMS), related to state-trait anxiety? 2) Does anxiety modulate corticospinal excitability changes after evoked pain by Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) ? 3) Does the state-trait anxiety predict the response to pain evoked by QST if simultaneously receiving a <b>heterotopic</b> stimulus [Conditional <b>Pain</b> Modulation (CPM) ]? We included females with chronic MPS (n = 47) and healthy controls (n = 11), aged 19 to 65 years. Motor cortex excitability was assessed by TMS, and anxiety was assessed based on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The disability related to pain (DRP) was assessed by the Profile of Chronic Pain scale for the Brazilian population (B:PCP:S), and the psychophysical pain measurements were measured by the QST and CPM. Results: In patients, trait-anxiety was positively correlated to intracortical facilitation (ICF) at baseline and after QST evoked pain (β = 0. 05 and β = 0. 04, respectively) and negatively correlated to the cortical silent period (CSP) (β = - 1. 17 and β = - 1. 23, respectively) (P < 0. 05 for all comparisons). After QST evoked pain, the DRP was positively correlated to ICF (β= 0. 02) (P < 0. 05). Pain scores during CPM were positively correlated with trait-anxiety when it was concurrently with high DRP (β = 0. 39; P = 0. 02). Controls’ cortical excitability remained unchanged after QST. Conclusions: These findings suggest that, in chronic MPS, the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory descending systems of the corticospinal tract is associated with higher trait-anxiety concurrent with higher DRP...|$|R
40|$|JUDGING by {{textbooks}} muscular {{diseases are}} very uncommon, {{but this is}} hardly {{in harmony with the}} fact that the musculature-the active locomotor apparatus-is the largest organ of the body. According to Sir Colin Mackenzie (1930) the animal body contains not less than 434 muscles, which constitute about 45 per cent. of the total weight, and the musculature con-tains about one-third of the total blood (R. J. S. McDowall, 1938). Further, one has to bear in mind that the muscles are subject for the greater part of the day to wear and tear, and from a purely theoretical point of view the muscles may be expected to be very liable to disease. Muscular diseases are very frequent indeed, but their recognition has been delayed probably owing to the fact that they give rise to referred or <b>heterotopic</b> (D. Waterston) <b>pain.</b> This fundamental fact regarding muscle physiology has been studied very recently-experimentally (Sir Thomas Lewis and I. H. Kellgren, 1938) and clinically (Good, 1938). The commonest muscular disease is myalgia, and is present in and responsible for pain complained of by the vast majority of people suffering from what is generally called rheumatism, and in a number of other minor diseases. Myalgia is a disease, the cardinal symptom of which is pain associated with more or less disturbance of function. Since the disturbance of function-e. g., locomotion-is solely due to pain, which is aggravated by contraction of the affected muscle or muscles, myalgia may be looked upon as the prototype of the disease of pain (La maladie de la douleur, R. Leriche, 1932). In. such conditions pain is the outstanding symptom, but it is a subjective phenomenon; local tenderness, too, is solely sub-jective. Experience has shown that there exist normosensitive, hypersensitive- and hyposensitive individuals or patients with regard to pain, indicating that the threshold of pain differs individually. In the case of myalgia the diagnosis can be based on objective phenomena. DErinmoN. -Myalgia is a muscular disease localised in well-definable parts of a muscle and in its appendages-tendon...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Pseudotumours around metal-on-metal hip {{resurfacing}} arthroplasties (MoMHRA) {{have caused}} increased concern. Although pseudotumours {{are associated with}} increased prosthesis wear, {{a few studies have}} suggested that they are not always associated with highly worn prostheses. This has led to the suggestion that the extensive necrosis and tissue destruction seen results not from the cytotoxic effect of the large number of metal particles on macrophages, which have phagocytosed these particles, but from a hypersensitivity response to one or more metal wear particle components. In keeping with this hypothesis, a prominent perivascular lymphoid infiltrate, commonly termed ALVAL, is frequently seen. Whether pseudotumours are due to wear particle-induced cytotoxicity, hypersensitivity or both remains to be determined. OBJECTIVES: The aim {{of this study was to}} correlate histopathological changes in periprosthetic tissues with clinical findings and the amount of implant-derived metal wear. METHODS: We analysed morphological changes in periprosthetic soft tissues of 56 failed MoMHRAs, all of which had bearing surface wear measurements. The majority of revisions were in female hips and the mean age at primary MoMHRA was 56 years. The mean implant survival was 4. 7 years. The majority of retrieved implants were BHR and Conserve Plus. The commonest cause of revision was the presence of a symptomatic pseudotumour (n= 45). Other failures included fracture, impingement, unexplained <b>pain,</b> <b>heterotopic</b> ossification and cup loosening. The extent of tissue necrosis and the nature of the inflammatory cell infiltrate, including ALVAL, was evaluated semiquantitatively. Furthermore, tissues were graded using the ALVAL-score described by Campbell et al. Bearing surface wear was determined for all patients using RedLux. Prostheses were considered to be highly worn if total linear wear rate (TLWR) was 4 μm/yr. All assessors were blinded to mode of failure and other measurements. RESULTS: Substantial necrosis and a heavy macrophage infiltrate were noted in most MoMHRA periprosthetic tissues, including all pseudotumours, many of which contained a significant ALVAL infiltrate. Most pseudotumours were associated with highly worn prostheses (80 %). The extent of necrosis and macrophage infiltration correlated with the amount of prosthesis wear. Wear weakly correlated with the amount of ALVAL measured quantitatively and with higher ALVAL scores as per Campbell. All pseudotumours with low wear had a strong ALVAL response. CONCLUSION: The majority of pseudotumours are associated with increased wear. This increased wear is associated with necrosis and a heavy non-specific foreign body macrophage response coupled with a variable specific immune response (ALVAL). A minority of pseudotumours are associated with low wear and a significant immune response. We hypothesise that the amount of wear required to trigger an ALVAL response varies per individual; as the wear volume increases, the chance of exceeding the individual’s threshold and triggering a response also increases. Surgeons should aim to minimise wear as this would lead to a reduction in pseudotumour incidence. However, even under optimal conditions some pseudotumours can still occur due to an exacerbated immune response...|$|R
