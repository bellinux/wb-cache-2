40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{contemporary}} views in personality psychology {{as a means}} for understanding people participating in sport and physical activity. Specifically, we focus on McAdams’ integrative framework [McAdams (2013). The psychological self as actor, agent, and author.

McAdams indicates that people can be defined through three layers of understanding, incorporating (a) dispositional traits, (b) characteristic adaptations, and (c) narrative identities. Together these layers provide a vision of the whole person – a perspective of personality rarely adopted by the sport and <b>exercise</b> <b>community.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} introduce scholars and practitioners to the potential benefits of embracing this whole person outlook, and to discuss the opportunities and challenges McAdams’ framework may have for advancing scholarship in sport and exercise psychology...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to understand the role of the family on the sexual experiences of adolescents from urban, disadvantaged settings in Baltimore and Johannesburg. Data were collected as part of the WAVE study, a global study of disadvantaged youth in five cities. Qualitative data were based on key informant interviews, a Photovoice <b>exercise,</b> <b>community</b> mapping, focus groups and in-depth interviews with adolescents. Quantitative data were gathered from an ACASI survey that was administered to approximately 450 - 500 adolescents per site. Results from the qualitative data revealed that while parents were viewed as important sources of information for sexual and reproductive health, they were often not present in the adolescents' lives. This lack of parental presence was perceived to result in adolescents feeling an overall lack of adult support and guidance. The impact of parental presence and support on adolescent sexual experience was further examined from the quantitative data and revealed a complex picture. In both Baltimore and Johannesburg, female adolescents who were raised by other relatives were less likely to report having had sex compared to those raised by two biological parents, which was not observed for males. In Johannesburg, female adolescents who were paternal orphans were less likely to have had sex compared to non-orphans; the opposite was true among males. Finally, in both sites, female adolescents who had been exposed to violence were more likely to have had sex compared to those who had not; for males, there was no significant relationship. The study demonstrates the powerful influence of both context and gender for understanding the influences of the family on adolescent sexual behaviors. Programs aiming to reduce adolescent sexual risk behaviors the need to understand the complex influences on risk behaviors in different settings and in particular, the role of mothers and fathers. Prevention strategies need to also understand and incorporate gender-specific messages and interventions in order to address the high risk of sexual behaviors among adolescents in these settings...|$|E

Our study sought to determine the feasibility of an oncology rehabilitation exercise program embedded within a cardiac rehabilitation program. Methods: Patients who rated their fatigue > 4 / 10 after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer were screened for eligibility and the outcomes were assessed (Piper Fatigue Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast [FACT-B], Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, body composition, stress test, and physical activity measurement [accelerometer]). Participants received individualized exercise prescription. Following the 16 -week program, repeat assessment plus patient acceptance and satisfaction survey was completed. The primary end point was the composite of accrual rate > 25 %, program adherence > 80 %, and mean compliance with accelerometer use > 80 %. Results: Twenty of 24 screened patients consented to the study and completed the baseline assessment. Adherence was 30. 3 %. Mean accelerometer use was 3. 88 / 7 days (78 %). Fatigue at baseline was rated at 4. 82 / 10, and at 3. 59 (p = 0. 09) after the intervention. Overall well-being (FACT-B) score changed from 92. 7 to 98. 3 (p = 0. 05). There were no significant changes in body composition (except for bone mineral content), aerobic exercise capacity, or activity patterns. Conclusion: Although the primary outcome was not met, our study indicates that an oncology exercise rehabilitation program {{can be incorporated into}} an existing cardiac rehabilitation program. Based on feedback received, we propose that in order to achieve exercise goals, frequent, encouraging, and tailored feedback and group sessions to foster a sense of community may additionally be needed to strengthen adherence to a prescribed exercise program.

Linking the wellness and health sectors could increase program availability. We evaluated if people with OA were {{willing to participate in}} programs delivered by trainers in community centers/gyms. Methods: We conducted an online survey of the general public in Canada over a period of 2  months. Participants included those aged ≥ 30  years with self-reported chronic OA-like knee or hip pain. We evaluated access to community/fitness centers, exercise frequency, interest in attending an evidence-based program twice a week for 6  weeks, and willingness to pay. Analyses included descriptive statistics with 95 % confidence intervals and chi-square tests to evaluate factors associated with willingness to attend the program. Results: After removing duplicate records, 751 respondents completed the survey with 408 likely having hip and/or knee OA and never having received a joint replacement. These 408 respondents had an age range of 30 to ≥ 75 years and 86 % were female. Of the 408, (63. 7 %) were between 45 and 64 years of age. Only two respondents reported that a community center was > 1 hour away. One hundred and fifty-six (38 %) reported a current membership, and 203 (50. 4 %) reported exercise 3  days/wk, 120 (29. 8 %) < 3  days, and 80 (19. 9 %) reported no exercise. Two hundred and ninety-seven respondents (73. 7 %) were willing to attend a program, and, of these, 26 % were willing to pay $ 100 Cdn or more. Age, sex, access to a community center/gym, current gym membership, and current frequency of exercise were not significantly associated with willingness to attend a program. Conclusion: Almost 75 % of respondents with OA, despite one in three having a community center membership, were interested in attending a targeted program delivered in community/fitness centers. A program in the wellness sector may be a viable option to support people in managing their hip and or knee OA.
