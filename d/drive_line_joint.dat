In order {{to investigate the}} causes and control methods of the <b>drive</b> <b>line,</b> the box-shaped part with curved bottom was designed based on the shape characteristics of automobile panel. Then this part was taken as an experimental model to analyze the causes and forming process of the <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> on its surface. Finally, influencing laws on the <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> from the draw bead, the important forming process parameter, were obtained by the experiments. The {{results showed that the}} draw bead has great impact on the <b>drive</b> <b>line.</b> Different setting ways of the draw beads can make good control for the formation, displacement and its direction of the <b>drive</b> <b>line.</b> Besides, it is an important way for setting the draw beads properly to prevent the stamping parts from the formation of the <b>drive</b> <b>line...</b>|$|R

40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} hybrid <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> in which four constant displacement Floating Cup (FC) wheel drive units are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four wheel <b>drive</b> hydrid <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> with wheel hub motors realises reductions of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of floating cup technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four wheel <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front wheel <b>drive</b> <b>line</b> is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC drive units, which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid <b>drive</b> <b>lines</b> are given...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Correct {{restoration}} of the <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> is generally considered as crucial when performing total knee arthroplasty. During revision knee arthroplasty however, elevation of the <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> occurs frequently. The general belief is that this negatively affects clinical outcome, but reasons are still not well understood. Materials and Methods: In this cadaveric in vitro study the biomechanical consequences of <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> elevation were investigated using a previously validated cadaver model simulating active deep knee squats and passive flexion-extension cycles. Knee specimens were sequentially tested after total knee arthroplasty with <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> restoration and after 4 mm <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> elevation. Results: Results show that no significantly negative effects of 4 mm <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> elevation were observed on tibio-femoral kinematics, collateral ligaments lengths, tibio-femoral contact pressures or quadriceps forces after TKA. Discussion and Conclusion: Our study suggests that <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> elevation by 4 mm in revision total knee arthroplasty does not cause significant kinematic and kinetic differences during passive flexion/extension movement and squatting in the tibio-femoral joint, nor does it affect the elongation patterns of collateral ligaments. Therefore, clinical problems after <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> elevation are probably situated in the patello-femoral joint or caused by <b>joint</b> <b>line</b> elevation of more than 4 mm. status: publishe...|$|R
