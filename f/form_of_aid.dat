25|$|Desirable actions such as enrolling {{children}} in school or receiving vaccinations can be encouraged by a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> known as conditional cash transfers. In Mexico, for example, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families {{to stay at home}} rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children stopped begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program.|$|E

Much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions, particularly in the Middle East. Saudi Arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, known as Wahhabism, throughout the world, via religious charities such al-Haramain Foundation, which often also distributed funds to violent Sunni extremist groups such as Al-Qaeda and the Taliban.|$|E

25|$|The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was {{the third}} {{occasion}} on which the developing countries have confronted the rich {{with the need to}} use trade and aid measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> (the so-called 'link'). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} portion of Nauru's income {{has been in the}} <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> from Australia. In 2001, the MV Tampa, a Norwegian ship that had rescued 438refugees from a stranded 20-metre-long boat, was seeking to dock in Australia. In {{what became known as the}} Tampa affair, the ship was refused entry and boarded by Australian troops. The refugees were eventually loaded onto Royal Australian Navy vessel HMAS Manoora and taken to Nauru to be held in detention facilities which later became part of the Howard government's Pacific Solution. Nauru operated two detention centres known as State House and Topside for these refugees in exchange for Australian aid. By November 2005, only two refugees, Mohammed Sagar and Muhammad Faisal, remained on Nauru from those first sent there in 2001, with Sagar finally resettling in early 2007. The Australian government sent further groups of asylum-seekers to Nauru in late 2006 and early 2007. The refugee centre was closed in 2008, but, following the Australian government's re-adoption of the Pacific Solution in August 2012, it has re-opened it.|$|E

Kent continues this mission today with the Parents Fund and the Financial Aid Program, with 44% {{of the student body}} receiving some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> Awarding more than eight million dollars in the 2014-2015 academic year, Kent's commitment to financial aid, relative to its endowment, ranks first among its peer schools.|$|E
2500|$|The late 1960s saw the old {{tensions}} {{boil over}} into an eruption {{of violence in}} Northern Ireland. Haughey was generally seen as coming from the pragmatist wing of the party, and was not believed to have strong opinions on the matter, despite having family links with Derry. Indeed, many presumed {{that he had a}} strong antipathy to physical force Irish republicanism; during his period as Minister for Justice he had followed a tough anti-IRA line, including using internment without trial against the IRA. The hawks in the cabinet were seen as Kevin Boland and Neil Blaney, both sons of founding fathers in the party with strong Old IRA pasts. Blaney was also a TD for Donegal; a staunchly Republican area which bordered Derry. They were opposed by those described as the [...] "doves" [...] of the cabinet; Tánaiste Erskine Childers, George Colley and Patrick Hillery. A fund of £100,000 was set up to give to the Nationalist people in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid.</b> Haughey as Finance Minister would have {{a central role in the}} management of this fund.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{municipalities}} {{and water}} agencies {{are engaged in}} international cooperation to improve access to {{water supply and sanitation}} in developing countries. As opposed to [...] "centralized" [...] international cooperation implemented by the French Development Agency or multilateral development banks, in France this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> is called decentralized cooperation. In 2002 the Court of Audit of France condemned decentralized cooperation by water agencies as contrary to their objectives. In response, the conservative member of Parliament André Santini, President of the Council of the Water Agency for Seine-Normandie and President of SEDIF, the utility in charge of water supply in the region of Paris, introduced a law passed in 2005 named after himself and former Senator Jacques Oudin. The Loi Oudin-Santini allows water agencies and municipal water companies to spend up to 1% of their budget on international cooperation. According to the NGO psEau the law could mobilize up to Euro 100 million. However, far from all water companies make use of the option provided by the law. The NGO s-eau-s (pronounced SOS) criticized the law, because it allegedly promotes the [...] "export of the French water management model" [...] and the [...] "conquest of markets by big French water companies".|$|E

Accordingly, the international criminal law further regulates illegal arms trafficking as an international crime and as complicity to core crimes. Therefore, the article first presents arms trafficking as an international crime and subsequently discusses arms trafficking as complicity in core crimes. The article concludes with a discussion on the regulation of arms trafficking in Slovene law, beginning with legal arms trafficking according to the Firearms Act- 1 and ending with illegal arms trafficking as a crime. ...|$|R
