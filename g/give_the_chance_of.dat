6000|$|The summer {{life had}} been very {{different}} from the winter one. There was much less intercourse with the Homestead, partly from Rachel being much engrossed with the F. U. E. E., driving over whenever the coachman would let her, to inspect progress, and spending much of her time in sending out circulars, answering letters, and writing a tale on the distresses of Woman, and how to help them, entitled [...] "Am I not a Sister?" [...] Tales were not much in Bachel's line; she despised reading them, and did not love writing them, but she knew that she must sugar the cup for the world, and so she diligently applied herself to the piece de resistance for the destined magazine, heavily weighting her slender thread of story with disquisitions on economy and charity, and meaning to land her heroines upon various industrial asylums where their lot should be far more beatific than marriage, which was reserved for the naughty one to live unhappy in ever after. In fact, Rachel, in her stern consistency, had made up her mind to avoid and discourage the Colonel, and to prevent her own heart from relenting in his favour, or him from having any opportunity of asking an explanation, and with this determination she absented herself both from Ermine's parlour and Lady Temple's croquet ground; and if they met on the esplanade or in a morning call, took care never to <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> a tete-a-tete, which he was evidently seeking.|$|E

Toynbee?s understanding of history is based on a recognition of uniqueness, individuality and originality of each social formation in the history, which are created a chain of cultural types - civilizations, in each of which are inherent the characteristic features, laws of existence, public rules and private life, but the defining factor of existence civilizations is the religion and the highest moral values. The concept A. Toynbee allocates a number of laws of genesis of civilizations and opens mankind?s history as system process.

40|$|Statistics, {{and have}} some comments. The {{possible}} positions of {{a player in the}} simplified Snakes and Ladders game may be viewed as the states of a stationary Markov Chain. Consequently, “finding the probability of taking exactly n moves”, n> 2, to finish the game, which Melrose rightly claims as “more difficult ” than is the case n = 2, is still easily tackled by students who have had just a bit of matrix algebra. In particular, if P is the one-step probability transition matrix, then the appropriate element of P n (see Kemeny and Snell (1960), for instance, for details) will <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> finishing in at most n moves. The chance of finishing in exactly n moves then, is an element of P n minus an element of P n- 1. Kemeny and Snell (1960) also explain how to compute the expected game length from P (relatively easy) and the standard deviation of game length (more difficult). The interested reader may wish to consult Althoen, King and Schilling (1993) or Gadbois (1993) for further details concerning the full version of Snakes and Ladders to share with his or her students. The results in these articles are readily adapted for the simplified games presented by Melrose (1998) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of assessing {{and using the}} socio-economic potential of Russia is considered within the fundamental monograph prepared {{on the basis of}} the Institute of Economics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The main achievements of the large research of the problem of the Russian socio-economic potential conducted by a group of authors with the definition of the most rational and important suggestions for the prospects of the Russian economy are allocated. Certain critical comments are noted, and the author’s position is specified concerning the policy of the new industrialization and innovative development within the modern scientific polemic about the subject and tools of economic policy, and also the need of ensuring it by the system efficiency. The main achievement of the presented teamwork of the scientists of the Ural economic school is the development of a methodological framework and hardware (techniques, models) of the diagnostics of the socio-economic potential of the economic system of any level of complexity (despite the main specialization of this school on the regional research) and measuring base.

40|$|Geographic Information Systems, {{together}} with remote sensing, represent today a basic tool for land management and planning {{and for the}} monitoring of the environmental critical factors of human and natural origin. Their use has been increasing {{in the last years}} also thanks to software and hardware development; therefore the use of GIS has spread not only into the field of cartography or land management and planning but also into other particular sectors among which there are the environmental and civil protection, geomarketing, social and economical analyses, agriculture, water, the exploitation of underground and overground resources, etc. All this testifies the relevance that this technologies have acquired in the more advanced countries: they <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> a complete integration of the available information, guaranteeing the possibility of immediate and rational decisions by assisting the operator in the data organization and in the comprehension of their mutual spatial correlations. In this paper, after a brief introduction to the geographic information systems through the definitions of their main basic concepts, we shall describe an information system created for the monitoring and the territorial planning of the city of Khouribga (Morocco), chosen {{as a model for the}} several environmental problems it presents. In fact the city and its surroundings are characterised by the presence of an intense mining activity for phosphate minerals and of extended areas in which phosphate waste materials are accumulated. These are a source of strong degradation, pollution and landscape alteration to which the competent local authorities want to find a solution...|$|E

40|$|The rise of {{knowledge}} society {{along with the}} diffusion of new technologies and software, has opened a form of “democratization” of the creative professions, {{at the same time}} allowing an easier management of each stage of the project. While increasing its creative capabilities and enlarging its community, design is spreading as a “mass profession” {{and at the same time}} lowering its authorship role in society. The designer cannot act anymore the role of the hero for creating unique artworks just by manipulating raw materials, moreover he works as a DJ or a VJ, remixing and reprogramming preexisting shapes and languages already circulating into new contexts. While starting the era of postproduction, technologies <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> recording/sampling/reproducing/elaborating parts of images, shapes, languages, texts, sounds already existing after an action of creative manipulation which gives a free reorganization and interpretation and creates copies altering the first original. Notions of production and reproduction, master and copy, same and different, originality and replica are blurred through the concept of postproduction, which summarizes and overcomes them all. The paper will focus postproduction as a cultural shift which works through a process of “copy and paste” on recorded materials far from boundaries of copyright and methodologically brings closer the activities of production and consumption. Through a transdisciplinary theory-based and design-based approach, linking design, social and communication sciences, anthropology, cultural studies, the paper will display how new technologies and their accessibility and ease of use make the designer create new products informed from preceding products through an act of consumption. Therefore designers, due to an act of productive consumption, enrol a new social role by selecting cultural artifacts and giving them new contexts (of elaboration/production/use) and opening to ever new catalogues of shapes which can be collectively shared...|$|E

5000|$|In conclusion, it is {{possible}} to tell that botnet Festi {{was one of the most}} powerful botnets for sending spam and carrying out attacks like [...] "distributed denial of service". The principles by which Festi botnet is constructed increase bot lifetime in the system as much as possible, hinder with bot detection by the antivirus software and network filters. The mechanism of modules allows to expand functionality of botnet in any side by means of creation and loading of necessary modules for achievement of different purposes, and the object-oriented approach to development complicates botnet researching with use of methods of the reverse engineering and <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> bot porting on other operating systems through an accurate demarcation of specific to a concrete operating system functionality and remaining logic of bot. Powerful systems of counteraction to detection and debugging make Festi bot almost invisible and stealthy.
