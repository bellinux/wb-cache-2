Thus, although insoluble Cr(VI) is probably the active fibrogen in stainless steel fumes, an etiological factor common to all fibrogenic welding exposures must be sought; it is tentatively proposed to be NOX, a potent experimental in vivo fibrogen copiously produced by certain welding processes and ubiquitous at low concentrations in the welding environment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> {{of human}} {{multipotent}} mesenchymal stromal cells in injured liver BAERTSCHIGER, Reto Marc, et al. Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are currently investigated clinically as cellular therapy {{for a variety}} of diseases. Differentiation of MSC toward endodermal lineages, including hepatocytes and their therapeutic effect on fibrosis has been described but remains controversial. Recent evidence attributed a fibrotic potential to MSC. As differentiation potential might be dependent of donor age, we studied MSC derived from adult and pediatric human bone marrow and their potential to differentiate into hepatocytes or myofibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. Following characterization, expanded adult and pediatric MSC were co-cultured with a human hepatoma cell line, Huh- 7, in a hepatogenic differentiation medium containing Hepatocyte growth factor, Fibroblast growth factor 4 and oncostatin M. In vivo, MSC were transplanted into spleen or liver of NOD/SCID mice undergoing partial hepatectomy and retrorsine treatment. Expression of mesenchymal and hepatic markers was analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, adult and pediatric MSC expressed characteristic surface antigens of MSC.

40|$|Adult {{skeletal}} muscle possesses a remarkable regenerative ability, which largely depends on satellite cells; however, in severe muscular dystrophies, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), {{skeletal muscle}} integrity is compromised and the muscle is often {{replaced by a}} mixture of fibrous tissue and white adipocytes in a process termed fibro-adipogenic degeneration. The precise cellular origin and the environmental cues responsible for accumulation of fat/fibrotic tissues {{during the course of}} the disease remain unknown. Using a previously published preplate technique, two distinct populations of muscle derived cells from skeletal muscle were isolated: 1) a rapidly adhering cell population (RACs), which is non-myogenic, Pax 7 - and expresses the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) marker PDGFRα, hence termed non-myogenic MSCs (nmMSCs); and 2) a slowly adhering cell population (SACs) which is Pax 7 + and highly myogenic, termed myogenic progenitor cells (MPCs). In this dissertation, the role of nmMSCs in the histopathogenesis of dystrophin/utrophin double knock out (dKO) mice, an animal model of DMD, was investigated. The nmMSCs become activated during the disease progression in dKO mice, displaying increased proliferation and adipogenic, osteogenic, and <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potentials</b> compared to age-matched WT counterparts. The activated dKO-nmMSCs also significantly reduced the myogenic potential of the dKO-MPCs, an effect, at least partially, mediated by the secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP 1) released by the dKO-nmMSCs. These results suggest that nmMSCs are likely the cell source involved in the deposition of non-muscle tissues in dKO muscles and activation of nmMSCs likely exacerbates muscle wasting and degeneration during the disease progression by limiting the myogenic potential of MPCs. Interestingly, the nmMSCs also appear to play an important role in muscle regeneration after acute injury in normal WT muscle. The nmMSCs isolated from cardiotoxin injured WT muscle significantly enhanced the myogenic potential of MPCs after co-cultivation, suggesting that the nmMSCs may facilitate muscle repair in normal WT muscle. These results suggest that the muscle micro-environment plays a major role in the fate of nMMSCs. Overall, data from this dissertation proposes that a therapeutic strategy targeting nmMSCs could represent a novel treatment for DMD...|$|R

NASH progression results from numerous events originating within the liver, as well as from signals derived from the adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract. In a fraction of NASH patients, disease may progress, eventually leading to advanced fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Understanding the mechanisms leading to NASH and its evolution to cirrhosis is critical to identifying effective approaches for the treatment of this condition.

40|$|Activated {{pancreatic}} stellate cells (PaSC) are key {{participants in}} the stroma of pancreatic cancer, secreting extracellular matrix proteins and inflammatory mediators. Tumors are poorly vascularized, creating metabolic stress conditions in cancer and stromal cells that necessitate adaptive homeostatic cellular programs. Activation of autophagy and the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) have been described in hepatic stellate cells, but the role of these processes in PaSC responses to metabolic stress is unknown. We reported that the PI 3 K/mTOR pathway, which AMPK can regulate through multiple inputs, modulates PaSC activation and <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential.</b> Here, using primary and immortalized mouse PaSC, we assess the relative contributions of AMPK/mTOR signaling, autophagy and the UPR to cell fate responses during metabolic stress induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. The mitochondrial uncoupler rottlerin at low doses (0. 5 - 2. 5 μM) was added to cells cultured in 10 % FBS complete media. Mitochondria rapidly depolarized, followed by altered mitochondrial dynamics and decreased cellular ATP levels. This mitochondrial dysfunction elicited rapid, sustained AMPK activation, mTOR pathway inhibition, and blockade of autophagic flux. Rottlerin treatment also induced rapid, sustained PERK/CHOP UPR signaling. Subsequently, high doses (> 5 μM) induced loss of cell viability and cell death. Interestingly, AMPK knock-down using siRNA did not prevent rottlerin-induced mTOR inhibition, autophagy, or CHOP upregulation, suggesting that AMPK is dispensable for these responses. Moreover, CHOP genetic deletion, but not AMPK knock-down, prevented rottlerin-induced apoptosis and supported cell survival, suggesting that UPR signaling is a major modulator of cell fate in PaSC during metabolic stress. Further, short-term rottlerin treatment reduced both PaSC <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> and IL- 6 mRNA expression. In contrast, expression levels of the angiogenic factors HGF and VEGFα were unaffected, and the immune modulator IL- 4 was markedly upregulated. These data imply that metabolic stress-induced PaSC reprogramming differentially modulates neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment...|$|E

Only two out of 10 rats receiving repeated intraperitoneal injections of an extract of Capillaria hepatica-infected mouse liver presented septal hepatic fibrosis (20 %). Under the same experimental conditions, 4 out of 9 rats (44. 4 %) developed septal fibrosis following whole pig-serum administration. Injections of normal mouse liver extracts did not result in hepatic fibrosis. Since a 100 % septal fibrosis rate is observed in experimentally Capillaria hepatica-infected rats, it appeared that Capillaria hepatica products continuously released from inside the liver creates a much more effective fibrosis inducing mechanism than the parenteral administration of such factors.

TGF-β and fibronectin released by alveolar macrophages possess a <b>fibrogenic</b> potency. The <b>potential</b> role of alveolar macrophages in airway remodelling was studied in asthma and chronic bronchitis by the release of TGF-β and fibronectin. Alveolar macrophages were isolated by bronchoalveolar lavage in 14 control subjects, 14 asthmatics and 14 chronic bronchitics. The spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - or concanavalin A (Con A) -induced release of TGF-β and fibronectin was measured by ELISA. Alveolar macrophages from chronic bronchitics spontaneously release greater amounts of TGF-β and fibronectin than those from asthmatic and control subjects. Alveolar macrophages from asthmatics release greater amounts of TGF-β and fibronectin than those from control subjects. The spontaneous release of TGF-β is significantly correlated with that of fibronectin. Fibronectin release was significantly reduced after LPS stimulation, and TGF-β release was significantly increased after LPS stimulation, except in chronic bronchitis patients. Con A increased the release of TGF-β in cells from normal subjects.

BackgroundTubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis are pathologic hallmarks of {{end-stage renal disease}} (ESRD). Here we have used DNA microarray technology to monitor the transcriptomic responses to murine unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) {{with a view to}} identifying molecular modulators of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. MethodsUsing Affymetrix Mu 74 Av 2 microarrays, gene expression 4 and 10 days postobstruction was investigated relative to control contralateral kidneys. Candidate profibrogenic genes were further investigated in epithelial cells undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro. ResultsmRNA levels for 1091 gene/EST sequences, of a total of 12, 488 displayed on the microarray, were altered twofold or greater by days 4 and 10 postobstruction compared to contralateral control kidneys. Genes were categorised into functional groups, including modulators of cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix metabolism, cell growth, signalling, and transcription/translational events. Among the potentially profibrogenic genes, whose mRNA levels were increased after UUO, were fibroblast-inducible secreted protein (fisp- 12), the murine homologue of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen XVIIIα 1, secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), and src-suppressed C-kinase substrate (SSeCKS). A sustained increase in fisp- 12 mRNA level was observed during EMT induced by transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). ConclusionAltered gene expression in murine UUO has been demonstrated.

40|$|International audienceHepatic fibrosis, {{the major}} {{complication}} {{of virtually all}} types of chronic liver damage, usually begins in portal areas, and its severity has been correlated to liver progenitor cells (LPC) expansion from periportal areas, even if the primary targets of injury are intralobular hepatocytes. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the <b>potential</b> <b>fibrogenic</b> role of LPC, using a new experimental model in which rat liver fibrosis was induced by chronic carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) administration for 6 weeks, in combination with chronic acetylaminofluorene treatment (AAF), which promotes activation of LPC compartment. Treatment with CCl(4) alone caused a significant increase in serum transaminase activity as well as liver fibrosis initiating around central veins and leading to formation of incomplete centro-central septa with sparse fibrogenic cells expressing α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA). In AAF/CCl(4) -treated animals, the fibrogenic response was profoundly worsened, with formation of multiple porto-central bridging septa leading to cirrhosis, whereas hepatocellular necrosis and inflammation were similar to those observed in CCl(4) -treated animals. Enhanced fibrosis in AAF/CCl(4) group was accompanied by ductule forming LPC expanding from portal areas, αSMA-positive cells accumulation in the fibrotic areas and increased expression of hepatic collagen type 1, 3 and 4 mRNA. Moreover, CK 19 -positive LPC expressed the most potent fibrogenic cytokine transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) without any expression of αSMA, desmin or fibroblast-specific protein- 1, demonstrating that LPC did not undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In this new experimental model, LPC, by expressing TGFβ, contributed to the accumulation of αSMA-positive myofibroblasts in the ductular reaction leading to enhanced fibrosis but also to disease progression and to a fibrotic pattern similar to that observed in humans...|$|R

Here {{we show that}} expression of cathepsin B (CtsB) and cathepsin D (CtsD) is negligible in quiescent HSC but parallels the increase of α-SMA and TGF-β during in vitro mouse HSC activation. Both cathepsins are necessary for HSC transdifferentiation into myofibroblasts, as their silencing or inhibition decreased HSC proliferation and the expression of phenotypic markers of HSC activation, with similar results observed with the human HSC cell line LX 2. CtsB inhibition blunted AKT phosphorylation in activated HSC in response to PDGF. Moreover, during in vivo liver fibrogenesis by CCl 4 administration, CtsB expression increased in HSC but not in hepatocytes, and its inactivation mitigated CCl 4 -induced inflammation, HSC activation and collagen deposition. Altogether, these findings support a critical role for cathepsins in HSC activation, suggesting that the antagonism of cathepsins in HSC may be of relevance {{for the treatment of}} liver fibrosis.

Upon stimulation with 10,g/ml lIpopolysaccharide (LPS), resident peritoneal macrophages from CBA/J mice released MDGF activity into media rapidly, reaching maximal levels in approximately 1 h. Lysates of these stimulated cells also revealed significantly increased cell-associated MDGF activity, composing 45 % of the total assayable activity. This activity, as assayed by radioactive thymidine incorpo-ration by primary cultures of rat lung fibroblasts, was separable from Interleukin- 1 (IL-i) activity by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLc). Furthermore, purified murine IL-i had no MDGF activity in this assay system.

The present study aimed to determine the primary cause of this inflammation using an experimental model. Wistar rats were exposed for 5 days (4 h/d) to air containing 100 mg/m 3 volcanic ash (mass median aerodynamic diameter, 4. 3 µm; geometric standard deviation, 1. 7) with or without 1. 5 ppm sulfur dioxide (SO 2). The lungs were then lavaged, and mRNA was extracted from alveolar macrophages and assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the lavage fluid, no change in cellularity or increase in the content of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α was detected. However, at 1 h following exposure, 80 % of macrophages were seen to have phagocytosed the volcanic ash. This percentage was unchanged at 24 h after exposure. Profilin mRNA content of the macrophages was elevated, and c-jun mRNA was expressed.

40|$|The nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor α 1 (nAChRα 1) was investigated as a <b>potential</b> <b>fibrogenic</b> molecule in the kidney, given reports {{that it may be}} an alternative urokinase (urokinase plasminogen activator; uPA) receptor in addition to the classical receptor uPAR. In a mouse obstructive uropathy model of chronic kidney disease, interstitial fibroblasts were identified as the primary cell type that bears nAChRα 1 during fibrogenesis. Silencing of the nAChRα 1 gene led to significantly fewer interstitial αSMA+ myofibroblasts (2. 8 times decreased), reduced interstitial cell proliferation (2. 6 times decreased), better tubular cell preservation (E-cadherin 14 times increased), and reduced fibrosis severity (24 % decrease in total collagen). The myofibroblast-inhibiting effect of nAChRα 1 silencing in uPA-sufficient mice disappeared in uPA-null mice, suggesting that a uPA-dependent fibroblastic nAChRα 1 pathway promotes renal fibrosis. To further establish this possible ligand-receptor relationship and to identify downstream signaling pathways, in vitro studies were performed using primary cultures of renal fibroblasts. 35 S-Labeled uPA bound to nAChRα 1 with a Kd of 1. 6 × 10 − 8 m, which was displaced by the specific nAChRα 1 inhibitor d-tubocurarine in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-exposure of uPA to the fibroblasts inhibited [3 H]nicotine binding. The uPA binding induced a cellular calcium influx and an inward membrane current that was entirely prevented by d-tubocurarine preincubation or nAChRα 1 silencing. By mass spectrometry phosphoproteome analyses, uPA stimulation phosphorylated nAChRα 1 and a complex of signaling proteins, including calcium-binding proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and a nucleoprotein. This signaling pathway appears to regulate the expression of a group of genes that transform renal fibroblasts into more active myofibroblasts characterized by enhanced proliferation and contractility. This new fibrosis-promoting pathway may also be relevant to disorders that extend beyond chronic kidney disease...|$|R

Previously we reported enhanced proliferation {{in response to}} fibrogenic growth factors and selective activation of latent transforming growth factor (TGF) -beta in fibroblasts lacking cell surface expression of Thy- 1 glycoprotein, suggesting that Thy- 1 modulates the <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> of fibroblasts. Here we report that compared to controls Thy- 1 -/- C 57 BL/ 6 mice displayed more severe histopathological lung fibrosis, greater accumulation of lung collagen, and increased TGF-beta activation in the lungs 14 days after intratracheal bleomycin. The majority of cells demonstrating TGF-beta activation and myofibroblast differentiation in bleomycin-induced lesions were Thy-l-negative. Histological sections from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis demonstrated absent Thy- 1 staining within fibroblastic foci. Normal lung fibroblasts, in both mice and humans, were predominantly Thy- 1 -positive. The fibrogenic cytokines interleukin- 1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha induced loss of fibroblast Thy- 1 surface expression in vitro, which was associated with Thy- 1 shedding, Smad phosphorylation, and myofibroblast differentiation.

We investigated the direct and indirect cellular mechanisms mediating the fibrogenic activity of multi-wall (MW) CNT on fibroblasts. We showed that MWCNT indirectly stimulate lung fibroblast (MLg) differentiation, via epithelial cells and macrophages, whereas no direct effect of MWCNT on fibroblast differentiation or collagen production was detected. MWCNT directly stimulated the proliferation of fibroblasts primed with low concentrations of growth factors, such as PDGF, TGF-β or EGF. MWCNT prolonged ERK 1 / 2 phosphorylation induced by low concentrations of PDGF or TGF-β in fibroblasts. This phenomenon and the proliferative activity of MWCNT on fibroblasts was abrogated by the inhibitors of ERK 1 / 2, PDGF-, TGF-β- and EGF-receptors. This activity was also reduced by amiloride, an endocytosis inhibitor. Finally, the lung fibrotic response to several MWCNT samples (different in length and diameter) correlated with their in vitro capacity to stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and to prolong ERK 1 / 2 signaling in these cells.

Survanta, a natural lung surfactant, showed effectiveness in dispersing agglomerates of MWCNT to fine structures similar in size to aerosolized one. At relevant low doses (0. 002 – 0. 2 [*]μg/cm 2), MWCNT exhibited a dose-dependent bio-effect on the human lung epithelial cells which is more pronounced in dispersed-MWCNT compared to non-dispersed form. Significantly elevated levels of fibrogenic mediators, such as transforming growth factor-β 1 and matrix metalloprotienases- 9 were observed in the dispersed-MWCNT treated lung epithelial cells. Based on previous in vivo studies showing that dispersed-MWCNT penetrated the interstitium and caused rapid interstitial fibrosis, we evaluated the potential direct interaction between lung fibroblasts and MWCNT. Direct stimulation of human lung fibroblast cell proliferation, collagen expression and fibroblast growth factor- 2 were observed which suggests novel mechanisms of MWCNT-induced lung fibrosis.

We designed an experimentally validated in vitro fibroblast culture model aimed at investigating the effect of fiber length on single-walled CNT (SWCNT) -induced pulmonary fibrosis. The fibrogenic response to short and long SWCNTs was assessed via oxidative stress generation, collagen expression and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF- 2) production as potential fibrosis biomarkers. Long SWCNTs were significantly more potent than short SWCNTs in terms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) response, collagen production and TGF- 2 release. Furthermore, our finding on the length-dependent in vitro fibrogenic response was validated by the in vivo lung fibrosis outcome, thus supporting the predictive value of the in vitro model. Our results also demonstrated the key role of ROS in SWCNT-induced collagen expression and TGF- 2 activation, indicating the potential mechanisms of length-dependent SWCNT-induced fibrosis. Together, our study provides new evidence for the role of fiber length in SWCNT-induced lung fibrosis and offers a rapid cell-based assay for fibrogenicity testing of nanomaterials with the ability to predict pulmonary fibrogenic response in vivo.

Microarray data of rat PCLS exposed to APAP andCCl 4 was generated using a toxic dose based on decrease in ATP levels. Toxicity pathway analysis using a custom made fibrosis-related gene list showed fibrosis as one of the predominant toxic endpoints in CCl 4 -treated, but not in APAP-treated PCLS. Moreover, genes which have a role in fibrosis such as alpha-B crystallin, jun proto-oncogene, mitogen-activated protein kinase 6, serpin peptidase inhibitor and also the transcription factor Kruppel-like-factor- 6 were up-regulated by CCl 4, but not by APAP. Predicted activation or inhibition of several upstream regulators due to CCl 4 is in accordance with their role in fibrosis.

DESIGN: The {{study was designed to}} examine rat pleural mesothelial changes by three independent observers at timed intervals, ranging from 1 to 480 days postinoculation using erionite from the Pine Valley, Nevada (USA) area. The mean length and width of the erionite fibers were 2. 29 and 0. 48 microns, respectively. Only microscopic observations made by majority (2 / 3) or unanimity (3 / 3) were accepted for final diagnosis. RESULTS: Pleural and lung tissue were available for examination in 21 of the 24 rats. Fibrosis, chronic inflammation, and foreign body reaction occurred in 6 of 21 rats. Mesothelial hyperplasia and dysplasia occurred in 9 and 3 of the 21 rats, respectively.

Here, {{we show that}} expression of cathepsin B (CtsB) and cathepsin D (CtsD) is negligible in quiescent HSCs but parallels the increase of -smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor- during in vitro mouse HSC activation. Both cathepsins are necessary for HSC transdifferentiation into myoﬁbroblasts, because their silencing or inhibition decreasedHSC proliferation and the expression of phenotypicmarkers ofHSC activation, with similar results observed with the human HSC cell line LX 2. CtsB inhibition blunted AKT phosphorylation in activated HSCs in response to platelet-derived growth factor. Moreover, during in vivo liver ﬁbrogenesis caused by CCl 4 administration, CtsB expression increased in HSCs but not in hepatocytes, and its inactivation mitigated CCl 4 -induced inﬂammation, HSC activation, and collagen deposition. Conclusion: These ﬁndings support a critical role for cathepsins inHSC activation, suggesting that the antagonismof cathepsins inHSCsmay be of relevance {{for the treatment of}} liver ﬁbrosis.

40|$|Aims: Oxidative {{stress is}} {{involved}} in cholestasis-induced hepatic damage. Therefore, antioxidant therapy is a recommended therapeutic strategy. Studies have illustrated that chromium can enhance antioxidative capacity leading to a resolution of oxidative stress. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether chromium has protective effects against cholestasis-related liver damage. Main methods: Cholestasis was produced by bile duct ligation (BDL) in male Sprague-Dawley rats for 3 weeks. Rats were randomly divided into four groups. Control and BDL groups were subjected to sham and BDL operation, respectively, and were supplemented with placebo for 3 weeks. The BDL-post Cr group was supplemented with chromium chloride for 3 weeks after BDL operation. The BDL-pre Cr group was supplemented with chromium chloride for 6 weeks starting from 3 weeks before BDL operation. Key findings: In comparison with the control group, the BDL group showed hepatic damage as evidenced by elevation in serum biochemicals, ductular reaction, and fibrosis. These pathophysiological changes were attenuated in the BDL-Pre Cr and BDL-Post Cr groups. However, there was no significant difference between these two groups. The anti-fibrotic effect of chromium was accompanied by reductions in alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive matrix-producing cells and Smad 2 / 3 activity critical to the <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1). In addition, chromium effectively attenuated BDL-induced hepatic oxidative stress. Significance: The data indicate that chromium attenuates BIDL-induced cholestatic liver injury, bile duct proliferation, and fibrosis. The hepatoprotective effect of chromium is associated with antioxidative potential. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In modern toxicology, {{substantial}} {{efforts are}} undertaken to develop alternative solutions for in vivo toxicity testing. The {{adverse outcome pathway}} (AOP) concept could facilitate knowledge-based safety assessment of chemicals that does not rely exclusively on in vivo toxicity testing. The construction of an AOP is based on understanding toxicological processes {{at different levels of}} biological organisation. Here, we present the developed AOP for liver fibrosis and demonstrate a linkage between hepatic injury caused by chemical protein alkylation and the formation of liver fibrosis, supported by coherent and consistent scientific data. This long-term process, in which inflammation, tissue destruction, and repair occur simultaneously, results from the complex interplay between various hepatic cell types, receptors, and signalling pathways. Due to the complexity of the process, an adequate liver fibrosis cell model for in vitro evaluation of a chemical’s <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> is not yet available. Liver fibrosis poses an important human health issue that is also relevant for regulatory purposes. An AOP described with enough mechanistic detail might support chemical risk assessment by indicating early markers for downstream events and thus facilitating the development of an in vitro testing strategy. With this work, we demonstrate how the AOP framework can support the assembly and coherent display of distributed mechanistic information from the literature to support the use of alternative approaches for prediction of toxicity. This AOP was developed according to the guidance document on developing and assessing AOPs and its supplement, the users’ handbook, issued by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) {{in consumer}} products and their potential to induce adverse lung effects following inhalation has lead to much interest in better understanding the hazard associated with these nanomaterials (NMs). While the current regulatory requirement for substances of concern, such as MWCNTs, in many jurisdictions is a 90 -day rodent inhalation test, the monetary, ethical, and scientific concerns associated with this test led an international expert group to convene in Washington, DC, USA, to discuss alternative approaches to evaluate the inhalation toxicity of MWCNTs. Pulmonary fibrosis {{was identified as a}} key adverse outcome linked to MWCNT exposure, and recommendations were made on the design of an in vitro assay that is predictive of the fibrotic potential of MWCNTs. While fibrosis takes weeks or months to develop in vivo, an in vitro test system may more rapidly predict <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> by monitoring pro-fibrotic mediators (e. g., cytokines and growth factors). Therefore, the workshop discussions focused on the necessary specifications related to the development and evaluation of such an in vitro system. Recommendations were made for designing a system using lung-relevant cells co-cultured at the air–liquid interface to assess the pro-fibrogenic potential of aerosolized MWCNTs, while considering human-relevant dosimetry and NM life cycle transformations. The workshop discussions provided the fundamental design components of an air–liquid interface in vitro test system that will be subsequently expanded to the development of an alternative testing strategy to predict pulmonary toxicity and to generate data that will enable effective risk assessment of NMs...|$|E

Only two out of 10 rats receiving repeated intraperitoneal injections of an extract of Capillaria hepatica-infected mouse liver presented septal hepatic fibrosis (20 %). Under the same experimental conditions, 4 out of 9 rats (44. 4 %) developed septal fibrosis following whole pig-serum administration. Injections of normal mouse liver extracts did not result in hepatic fibrosis. Since a 100 % septal fibrosis rate is observed in experimentally Capillaria hepatica-infected rats, it appeared that Capillaria hepatica products continuously released from inside the liver creates a much more effective fibrosis inducing mechanism than the parenteral administration of such factors. Thus, repeated peritoneal administration of a foreign protein to rats would not reveal the full <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> it may have under natural conditions...|$|E
40|$|Iron is an {{essential}} micronutrient. However, because human beings have no means to control iron excretion, excess iron, regardless of the route of entry, accumulates in parenchymal organs and threatens cell viability. Indeed, when iron-buffering capability is overwhelmed, oxidative stress-induced cell damage and fibrogenesis may arise, mainly in the liver, the main storage site for iron in the body. Results of recent studies have clearly shown that these pathologic events are induced by iron-generated reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation by-products. Hepatic fibrosis, characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix components in the liver, is a dynamic process, from chronic liver damage to end-stage liver cirrhosis. Iron-induced oxidant stress is involved in this process (1) as {{the primary cause of}} parenchymal cell necrosis or (2) as activator of cells that are effectors [e. g., hepatic stellate cells, (myo) fibroblasts] or key mediators (e. g., Kupffer cells) of hepatic fibrogenesis (or through both mechanisms). Beyond their effect as direct cytotoxic agents, iron and free radicals may trigger increased synthesis of collagen in myofibroblast-like cells as well as activate granulocytes and Kupffer cells, resulting in an increased formation of cytokines and eicosanoids and further reactive oxygen species. This may constitute a cascade of amplifying loops, which perpetuate the fibrogenic process. The <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> of iron is even more dramatic when iron acts in concert with other hepatotoxins such as alcohol. In this instance, even if tissue iron levels are only slightly elevated, the toxic effect of alcohol or its metabolites may be amplified and propagated with rapid acceleration of the liver disease. At the molecular level, the presence of catalytically active free iron may (1) contribute directly to the hepatotoxicity of alcohol or (2) enhance the generation of cytokine and fibrogenic mediators from resident Kupffer cells (or be involved in both ways). A challenge for future research is to develop therapeutic tools able to block redox-active free iron in the cell...|$|E

The aims of this study were to develop a simple and rapid method of nanoparticle dispersion using a natural lung surfactant and to evaluate the effect of dispersion status of SWCNT on cytotoxicity and fibrogenicity in vitro and in vivo. ResultsThe natural lung surfactant Survanta 2 was used to disperse single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) in a biological medium. At physiologically relevant concentrations, Survanta 2 produced well dispersed SWCNT without causing a cytotoxic or fibrogenic effect. In vitro studies show that Survanta 2 -dispersed SWCNT (SD-SWCNT) stimulated proliferation of lung epithelial cells at low doses (0. 04 - 0. 12 /ml or 0. 02 - 0. 06 /cm 2 exposed surface area) but had a suppressive effect at high doses. Non-dispersed SWCNT (ND-SWCNT) did not exhibit these effects, suggesting the importance of dispersion status of SWCNT on bioactivities. Studies using cultured human lung fibroblasts show that SD-SWCNT stimulated collagen production of the cells. This result is supported by a similar observation using Acetone/sonication dispersed SWCNT (AD-SWCNT), suggesting that Survanta 2 did not mask the bioactivity of SWCNT. Likewise, in vivo studies show that both SD-SWCNT and AD-SWCNT induced lung fibrosis in mice, whereas the dispersing agent Survanta 2 alone or Survanta 2 -dispersed control ultrafine carbon black had no effect. ConclusionsThe results indicate that Survanta 2 was effective in dispersing SWCNT in biological media without causing cytotoxic effects at the test concentrations used in this study. SD-SWCNT stimulated collagen production of lung fibroblasts in vitro and induced lung fibrosis in vivo. Similar results were observed with AD-SWCNT, supporting the conclusion that Survanta 2 did not mask the bioactivities of SWCNT and thus can be used as an effective dispersing agent.

40|$|Abstract Background Nanotechnology is {{a rapidly}} {{advancing}} industry with many new products already {{available to the}} public. Therefore, {{it is essential to}} gain an understanding of the possible health risks associated with exposure to nanomaterials and to identify biomarkers of exposure. In this study, we investigated the <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> of SWCNT synthesized by chemical vapor deposition using cobalt (Co) and molybdenum (Mo) as catalysts. Following a single oropharyngeal aspiration of SWCNT in rats, we evaluated lung histopathology, cell proliferation, and growth factor mRNAs at 1 and 21 days post-exposure. Comparisons were made to vehicle alone (saline containing a biocompatible nonionic surfactant), inert carbon black (CB) nanoparticles, or vanadium pentoxide (V 2 O 5) as a known inducer of fibrosis. Results SWCNT or CB caused no overt inflammatory response at 1 or 21 days post-exposure as determined by histopathology and evaluation of cells (> 95 % macrophages) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. However, SWCNT induced the formation of small, focal interstitial fibrotic lesions within the alveolar region of the lung at 21 days. A small fraction of alveolar macrophages harvested by BAL from the lungs of SWCNT-exposed rats at 21 days were bridged by unique intercellular carbon structures that extended into the cytoplasm of each macrophage. These "carbon bridge" structures between macrophages were also observed in situ in the lungs of SWCNT-exposed rats. No carbon bridges were observed in CB-exposed rats. SWCNT caused cell proliferation only at sites of fibrotic lesion formation as measured by bromodeoxyuridine uptake into alveolar cells. SWCNT increased platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -A, PDGF-B, and PDGF-C mRNA levels significantly at 1 day as measured by Taqman quantitative real-time RT-PCR. At 21 days, SWCNT did not increase any mRNAs evaluated, while V 2 O 5 significantly increased mRNAs encoding PDGF-A, -B, and -C chains, PDGF-Rα, osteopontin (OPN), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1. Conclusion Our findings indicate that SWCNT do not cause lung inflammation and yet induce the formation of small, focal interstital fibrotic lesioins in the alveolar region of the lungs of rats. Of greatest interest was the discovery of unique intercellular carbon structures composed of SWCNT that bridged lung macrophages. These "carbon bridges" offer a novel and easily identifiable biomarker of exposure. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} epidemiological {{evaluation of}} mortality and short-term morbidity associated with explosive volcanic activity {{was carried out}} by the Centers for Disease Control in collaboration with affected state and local health departments, clinicians, and private institutions. Following the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, a series of public health actions were rapidly instituted to develop accurate information about volcanic hazards and to recommend methods for prevention or control of adverse effects on safety and health. These public health actions included: establishing a system of active surveillance of cause-specific emergency room (ER) visits and hospital admissions in affected and unaffected communities for comparison; assessing the causes of death and factors associated with survival or death among persons located near the crater; analyzing the mineralogy and toxicology of sedimented ash and the airborne concentration of resuspended dusts; investigating reported excesses of ash-related adverse respiratory effects by epidemiological methods such as cross-sectional and case-control studies; and controlling rumors and disseminating accurate, timely information about volcanic hazards and recommended preventive or control measures by means of press briefings and health bulletins. Surveillance and observational studies indicated that: excess in morbidity were limited to transient increases in ER visits and hospital admissions for traumatic injuries and respiratory problems (but not for communicable disease or mental health problems) which were associated in time, place, and person with exposures to volcanic ash; excessive mortality due to suffocation (76 per cent), thermal injuries (12 per cent), or trauma (12 per cent) by ash and other volcanic hazards was directly proportional to the degree of environmental damage [...] that is, it was more pronounced among those persons (48 / 65, or about 74 per cent) who, {{at the time of the}} eruption, were residing, camping, or sightseeing (despite restrictions) or working (with permission) closer to the crater in areas affected by the explosive blast, pyroclastic and mud flows, and heavy ashfall; and de novo appearance of ash-related asthma was not observed, but transient excesses in adverse respiratory effects occurred in two high-risk groups [...] hypersusceptibles (with preexisting asthma or chronic bronchitis) and heavily exposed workers.

40|$|This 3 -mo {{inhalation}} {{study investigated}} the biological effects of a special-purpose glass microfiber (E-glass microfiber), the stone wool fiber MMVF 21, and a new high-temperature application fiber (calcium-magnesium-silicate fiber, CMS) in Wistar rats. Rats were exposed 6 h/day, 5 days/wk for 3 mo to fiber aerosol concentrations of approximately 15, 50, and 150 fibers/ml (fiber length > 20 µm) for E-glass microfiber and MMVF 21. For the CMS fiber only the highest exposure concentration was used. During a 3 -mo postexposure period, recovery effects were studied. In the highest exposure concentration groups, gravimetric concentrations were 17. 2 mg/m 3 for E-glass microfiber, 37 mg/m 3 for MMVF 21, and 49. 5 mg/m 3 for the CMS fiber. After 3 mo of exposure, lung retention of fibers longer than 20 µm per lung was 17 2 106 for E-glass microfiber, 5. 7 2 106 for MMVF 21, and 0. 88 2 106 for CMS. After 3 mo of recovery the concentration of the long fiber fraction was decreased to 38. 4 %, 63. 9 %, and 3. 0 % compared to original lung burden for the E-glass microfiber, MMVF 21, and CMS, respectively. Biological effects measured included inflammatory and proliferative potential, histopathology lesions, and the persistence of these effects over a recovery period of 3 mo. Generally, observed effects were higher for E-glass microfiber when compared to MMVF 21. The following clear dose-dependent effects on E-glass microfiber and MMVF 21 exposure were observed as main findings of the study: increase in lung weight, in measured biochemical parameters and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), in cell proliferation (BrdU-response) of terminal bronchiolar epithelium, and in interstitial fibrosis. The values observed in the proliferation assay on the carcinogenic E-glass microfiber indicate that this assay has an important predictive value with regards to potential carcinogenicity. Surprisingly, for the biosoluble CMS fiber, <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> was detected in this study. The results of the CMS exposure group indicate that effects may be dominated {{by the presence of}} nonfibrous particles and that fibrosis may not be a predictor of carcinogenic activity of fiber samples, if the fiber preparation contains a significant fraction of nonfibrous particles. In summary, this study demonstrates the importance of fiber dust contamination by granular components.

40|$|Póster presentado en el 61 th Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (2010), celebrado del 29 de octubre al 2 de noviembre de 2010 en Boston (Estados Unidos) Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) {{undergo a}} {{phenotypic}} transformation during their activation, {{and play a}} key role in liver pathologies and fibrosis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) participate in liver fibrogenesis and it is known that TNF-α can regulate their expression, but the signaling mechanism remains still unclear. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of TNFR 1 or TNFR 2 on the activation and <b>fibrogenic</b> <b>potential</b> of HSC using knockout mice for TNFR 1, TNFR 2 or both (TNFRDKO). Methods: Primary mouse HSC from wild type and KO mice were isolated and cultured for up to 14 days. Cell proliferation was determined by H 3 -thymidine incorporation into DNA. AKT, p-AKT, MMP- 9 and PDGFβR were detected by western blot. TNFR 1 and TNFR 2 antagonism in the human HSC cell line LX 2 was achieved using commercially available siRNAs and neutralizing antibodies. mRNA levels were assessed by quantitative real time RT-PCR. Gelatinolytic MMP- 9 activity was detected by zymography assay. Results: While the absence of TNFR 1 and TNFR 2, as in TNFRDKO HSC, did not affect the expression of α-SMA or TGF-β during the activaction process, the levels of collagen type I mRNA and the global proliferation rate decreased in TNFRDKO as compared to wild type. In addition, activated TNFRDKO HSCs were unable to phosphorylate AKT in response to PDGF despite of similar PDGFβR expression compared to wild type HSC, indicating potential cross-talk between PDGFβR signaling and TNF receptors. Moreover, the role that MMP- 9 plays in matrix replacement during the fibrogenic process is well established. Using HSC from knockout mice (TNFR 1 KO, TNFR 2 KO and TNFRDKO) we observed that while MMP- 9 expression and gelatinolytic activity in WT and TNFR 2 KO HSC increased upon TNF-α stimualtion, this response was blunted in TNFRDKO and TNFR 1 KO HSC after TNF stimulation. These results where further confirmed in the human HSC cell line LX 2 by using neutralizing antibodies against TNFR 1, while TNFR 2 antagonism did not prevent MMP- 6 activation following TNF exposure. Conclusion: All together, these results point to TNFR 1 as the key receptor for the profibrogenic action of TNF through MMP- 9 activation, and suggest that TNF acts as a profibrogenic mediator in HSCs.
