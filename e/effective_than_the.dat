5|$|At the 1943 Tehran Conference, the Allied powers {{agreed to}} create a new body to replace the League: the United Nations. Many League bodies, such as the International Labour Organisation, {{continued}} to function and eventually became affiliated with the UN. The designers of the structures of the United Nations intended to make it more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> League.|$|E
5|$|When the B1 {{canonical}} labeling is lost {{through a}} transformation, {{the result is}} relabeled to the canonical B1 usage and then catalogued under this ID. This approach generated 416 equivalence classes, somewhat less <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> theoretical 336 minimum limit for a full reduction. Application of counting symmetry patterns for duplicate paired digits achieved reduction to 174 and then to 71 equivalence classes. The introduction of equivalence classes based on band counting symmetry (subsequent to Felgenhauer/Jarvis by Russell) reduced the equivalence classes to a minimum generating set of 44.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block may be more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which {{is more effective than}} a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
40|$|The microagglutination {{technique}} without centrifugation {{was more}} <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> centrifugation of <b>the</b> standard tube test for increasing Brucella agglutinin titers of specimens with a titer {{greater than or}} equal to 160 but was less <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> centrifugation of <b>the</b> standard tube test for specimens with a titer less than 160...|$|R
30|$|As {{a result}} shown in Tables  4 and 5, {{in the case}} of the small (no) view angle difference, the {{accuracy}} of LB and MT is higher than that of Siamese since leveraging the inter-subject difference is more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> mitigating <b>the</b> intra-subject difference due to view angle differences in such a case. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} a larger view angle difference, Siamese is better than LB and MT, since mitigating the intra-subject difference due to view angle difference is more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> leveraging <b>the</b> inter-subject difference.|$|R

5|$|Three main {{modalities}} of RRT are available: hemodialysis, continuous hemofiltration and peritoneal dialysis. The former two require {{access to}} the bloodstream (a dialysis catheter), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done {{several times a week}} in chronic kidney disease, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of anticoagulant drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other modalities.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery with Counter battery fire. British Army researchers under Lieutenant William Lawrence Bragg developed sound ranging, a method of determining the location of hostile artillery from the sound of its guns firing. A Counter Battery Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the counter battery effort, collating reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers. By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916.|$|E

25|$|The {{infantry}} of {{the newly}} formed state was composed mainly of Slavs, who were generally lightly armed soldiers, although their chieftains usually had small cavalry retinues.

25|$|Compared with {{protest and}} noncooperation, nonviolent {{intervention}} {{is a more}} direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other two methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved.|$|E
25|$|Hypnodelic therapy, as {{the name}} suggests, was {{developed}} with the goal to maximize the power of hypnotic suggestion by combining it with the psychedelic experience. After training the patient to respond to hypnosis, LSD would be administered, and during the onset phase of the drug the patient would be placed {{into a state of}} trance. Levine and Ludwig found the combination of these techniques to be more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> use of either of these two components separately.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{requirements}} set for {{the system}} were to achieve twice the performance in terms of range, altitude and combat effectiveness of the ZSU-23-4, additionally the system should have a reaction time no greater than 10 seconds. Due to the similarities in the fire control of artillery and missiles, {{it was decided that}} the Tunguska would be a combined gun and missile system. A combined system is more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> ZSU-23-4, engaging targets at long-range with missiles, and shorter range targets with guns.|$|E
25|$|Windows 9x is {{designed}} as a single-user system. Thus, the security model is much less <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> one in Windows NT. One {{reason for this is}} the FAT file systems (including FAT12/FAT16/FAT32), which are the only ones that Windows 9x supports officially, though Windows NT also supports FAT12 and FAT16 (but not FAT32) and Windows 9x can be extended to read and write NTFS volumes using third-party Installable File System drivers. FAT systems have very limited security; every user that has access to a FAT drive also has access to all files on that drive. The FAT file systems provide no access control lists and file-system level encryption like NTFS.|$|E
25|$|German armour-piercing shells {{were far}} more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> British ones, which often failed to {{penetrate}} heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range. Germany had adopted trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a picric acid mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of fuze function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate.|$|E

25|$|The other {{approach}} is to construct a whole new system of EU company law, that co-exists with the individual company laws of the member states. Companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the EU-wide system. However, this approach has been only somewhat more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> harmonization approach: while states are not as concerned about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies, which the harmonization approach could well entail; they also wish {{to ensure that the}} EU-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies, so {{that they will not be}} put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.|$|E
25|$|The {{recommended}} {{standard for}} fungicide application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya {{for a season}} is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3–4 weeks. However, the adoption of recommended application was very low among farmers in Ghana. Therefore, an experiment with a reduced number of fungicide applications demonstrated that there was 25 to 45% reduction in disease incidence. In terms of disease control and yields, sanitation and three applications of Ridomil 72 plus (12% metalaxyl + 60% copper-1-oxide) fungicide showed a better control compared to sanitation alone and sanitation {{with one or two}} fungicide applications. However, reduced in fungicide application was shown to be significantly less <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> recommended standard fungicide application.|$|E
25|$|Aside from antipsychotics, {{there is}} scant {{reliable}} research {{about the effectiveness}} or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. Results of the handful of randomized controlled trials that have been performed suggest that risperidone, the SSRI fluvoxamine, and the typical antipsychotic haloperidol may be effective in reducing some behaviors, that haloperidol may be more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine, and that the opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride is not effective. In small studies, memantine {{has been shown to}} significantly improve language function and social behavior in children with autism. Research is underway on the effects of memantine in adults with autism spectrum disorders. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications and the medications can have adverse side effects.|$|E
