40|$|Loss of {{heterozygosity}} (LOH) of {{the distal}} {{part of the}} short arm of chromosome I in neuroblastoma is a well characterised phenomenon. In addition, previous reports have described <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> outside the common region of loss on chromosome 1 p 36. suggesting additional tumour suppressor loci. In this study, we have searched extensively for <b>interstitial</b> 1 p <b>deletions</b> in a panel of 67 neuroblastoma samples from clinically-detected cases. We used three VNTR probes and 10 dinucleotide markers from the 1 p 32 - 36 regions reported to show <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions.</b> Fifteen (22 %) tumours showed telomeric LOH without evidence for more proximal <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions,</b> Forty-five tumours showed no LOH or allelic imbalance. Seven (10 %) tumours demonstrated allelic imbalance for one or more markers, These tumours were subsequently analysed by fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and flow cytometry, The patterns found in all seven tumours were consistent with copy number changes of the entire chromosome 1, without evidence for <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions.</b> This Study indicates that <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> of chromosome I p are rare in clinically-detected neuroblastoma when analysed {{by a combination of}} molecular and cytogenetic techniques.

40|$|We have {{generated}} a nested series of <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> in {{a fragment of}} human X chromosome-derived DNA cloned into a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) vector. A yeast strain carrying the YAC was transformed with a linear recombination substrate containing at one end a sequence that is uniquely represented on the YAC and {{at the other end}} a truncated long interspersed repetitive element (LINE 1, or L 1). Homologous recombination between the YAC and the input DNA resulted in a nested series of <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions,</b> the largest of which was 500 kilobases. In combination with terminal deletions that can be generated through homologous recombination, the <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> are useful for mapping and studying gene structure-function relationships...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} parental origin, and where {{possible}} the chromosomal origin of 115 de novo unbalanced structural chromosome abnormalities detectable by light microscopy. These consisted of 39 terminal <b>deletions,</b> 35 <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions,</b> 8 rings, 12 duplications and 21 unbalanced translocations. In all categories {{the majority of}} abnormalities were of paternal origin, although the proportions varied {{from a high of}} 84 % in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> and rings to a low of 58 % in the duplications. Among the <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> and duplications, there were approximately equal numbers of intra- and interchromosomal abnormalities, while the majority of unbalanced translocations were isodisomic for the duplicated chromosome. The examination of the parental ages in the four main classes of abnormality showed terminal deletions of maternal origin to be associated with a significantly reduced maternal age. Thus, there is a clear propensity for structural chromosome abnormalities to occur in male germ cells, although the chromosomal origin seems similar irrespective of the parental origin...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Class II marker {{chromosomes}} {{result from the}} second most common type of rearrangement: interstitial deletions. A chromosome is rearranged to give a ring chromosome, and a linear chromosome. Hence, in hindsight, the first observation of neocentromeres made by Andy Choo in 1997 was most likely an example of a Class II pericentric <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletion,</b> followed by a complex rearrangement. The neocentromere can either appear on the linear chromosome or on the ring chromosome, depending on which ever one lacks a centromere.|$|E
50|$|ZIC1 is {{classified}} as a ZIC protein due to conservation of the five C2H2 zinc fingers, which enables the protein to interact with DNA and proteins. ZIC1 is found in close genomic configuration in another member of this protein family, ZIC4. Correct function of these proteins in critical for early development, and as such mutations of the genes encoding these proteins is known to result in various congenital defects. For example, if function of both ZIC1 and ZIC4 is lost (which can occur via an <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletion</b> due to their adjacent location) then this may result in the Dandy-Walker malformation.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} known for 30 years that the {{corresponding}} gene fusion {{plays an important role in}} tumorgenesis. [...] Fusion genes can contribute to tumor formation because fusion genes can produce much more active abnormal protein than non-fusion genes. Often, fusion genes are oncogenes that cause cancer; these include BCR-ABL, TEL-AML1 (ALL with t(12 21)), AML1-ETO (M2 AML with t(8 21)), and TMPRSS2-ERG with an <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletion</b> on chromosome 21, often occurring in prostate cancer. In the case of TMPRSS2-ERG, by disrupting androgen receptor (AR) signaling and inhibiting AR expression by oncogenic ETS transcription factor, the fusion product regulate the prostate cancer. Most fusion genes are found from hematological cancers, sarcomas, and prostate cancer.BCAM-AKT2 is a fusion gene that is specific and unique to high-grade serous ovarian cancer.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sensorineural hearing {{impairment}} {{is a common}} pathological manifestation in patients affected by X-linked intellectual disability. A few cases of <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> at Xq 21 with several different phenotypic characteristics have been described, but to date, a complete molecular characterization of the deletions harboring disease-causing genes is still missing. Thus, {{the aim of this}} study is to realize a detailed clinical and molecular analysis of a family affected by syndromic X-linked hearing loss with intellectual disability. RESULTS: Clinical analyses revealed a very complex phenotype that included inner ear malformations, vestibular problems, choroideremia and hypotonia with a peculiar pattern of phenotypic variability. Genomic analysis revealed, for the first time, the presence of two close <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> in the Xq 21. 1 - 21. 3, harboring 11 protein coding, 9 non-coding genes and 19 pseudogenes. Among these, 3 protein coding genes have already been associated with X-linked hearing loss, intellectual disability and choroideremia. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we highlighted the presence of peculiar genotypic and phenotypic details in a family affected by syndromic X-linked hearing loss with intellectual disability. We identified two, previously unreported, Xq 21. 1 - 21. 3 <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions.</b> The two rearrangements, containing several genes, segregate with the clinical features, suggesting their role in the pathogenicity. However, not all the observed phenotypic features can be clearly associated with the known genes thus, further study is necessary to determine regions involved...|$|R

50|$|HOXB6 is a {{structural}} protein {{that has been}} shown to influence the growth and differentiation of the different blood lineages. This gene has also been shown to encourage the growth of granulocytes and monocytes, but at the cost of other blood cells. HOXB6 has the ability to cause the indefinite proliferation of murine marrow cells, as well as expand hematopoietic stem cells. When expressed abnormally, HOXB6 displays many characteristics of a potent oncoprotein. An oncoprotein can cause the transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell. Overexpression of HOXB6, along with the addition of MEIS1 protein, has been implicated in the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Acute myeloid leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells, specifically the leukocytes. The chromosomal irregularity most frequently seen in HOXB6 AML is a reappearing <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletion</b> of chromosome 2. Fundamental HOXB6 expression stops myeloid differentiation and debilitates erythropoiesis, megakaryopoiesis, and lymphopoiesis.|$|E
50|$|A study {{published}} by the American Journal of Human Genetics performed an EHMT1 mutation analysis on 23 patients that showed symptoms of q934 syndrome. The patients all varied in age. With respect to all the analyses, however, the clinical data focused on five patients, the majority being children. The first patient developed epilepsy early on in childhood, and had speech problems past age 8. He suffered from hypoplasia and had prominent facial features, such as lips and mouth. The second patient had no trace of mitral regurgitation (MR) in her family history, but had slight hypotonia. Patient three was the oldest at 36 who began to walk at age 3. She later gained weight at eleven and developed epilepsy in her late twenty's. The fourth patient had problems associated with eating {{as a young child}} and was diagnosed with slowed development. Patient five had behavioural issues and struggled with MR in addition to being overweight. The geneticists discovered three new mutations within the EHMT1 gene. The first was an <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletion,</b> while the second and third were a nonsense and frameshift. Their findings supported the notion that a disruption in the EHMT1 gene contributes to the pathogenesis of Kleefstra syndrome.|$|E

40|$|Twenty nine {{patients}} with gliomas were investigated for loss of heterozygosity for 40 DNA polymorphisms in tumour DNA, particularly concentrating on those mapping to chromosomes 10 and 17. Eight of 18 grade IV gliomas showed loss of sequences from chromosomes 10, 17, or both. The data suggested total loss of one copy of chromosome 10, {{but there were}} <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> of the short arm of chromosome 17 in three of five tumours. Heterogeneous <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> of chromosome 17 were also found in two lower grade astrocytomas and one benign oligodendroglioma. The striking {{finding of this study}} was that {{patients with}} high grade gliomas whose tumours exhibited loss of heterozygosity for chromosomes 10, 17, or both survived significantly longer after surgery (median 17. 4 months) than those whose tumours did not show loss of these chromosomes (median 6. 7 months).

40|$|<b>Interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> of {{chromosome}} 12 q are rare, {{with only}} 11 reported {{cases in the}} literature. We recently described two cases with cyto-genetically identical <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> of the long arm of chromosome 12. Here, we report on a third patient, a 26 -month-old male with a cytogenetically-identical interstitial deletion: 46,XY,del(12) (q 21. 2 q 22). Phenotypic features of this male proband included craniofacial and ectodermal anomalies, genitourinary anomalies, minor cardiac abnormalities, mild ventriculome-galy on brain MRI, hyperopia, and developmental delay. To further define {{the extent of the}} chromo-somal aberration, microarray-based compara-tive genomic hybridization (array CGH) analysis was performed and the array data was compared to one of our previously reported cases. Although cytogenetic analysis of the two patients was concordant, molecular analysis by array CGH revealed that the patients had discordant distal breakpoints. The determination of molecular breakpoints and phenotypic analyses in these two patients, in conjunction with previously reported cases, leads us to propose a 12 q deletion phenotype and a possible genetic locus for hyper-keratosis pilaris/ulerythema ophryogenes. 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

40|$|The {{breakpoints}} {{of seven}} <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> {{of the long}} arm of chromosome 16 and two ring chromosomes of this chromosome were mapped by in situ hybridisation or by analysis of mouse/human somatic cell hybrids containing the deleted chromosome 16. Use of a high resolution cytogenetic based physical map of chromosome 16 enabled breakpoints to be assigned to an average resolution of at least 1. 6 Mb. In general, <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> involving q 12 or q 22. 1 have broadly similar phenotypes though {{there are differences in}} specific abnormalities. Deletions involving regions more distal, from 16 q 22. 1 to 16 q 24. 1, were associated with relatively mild dysmorphism. One region of the long arm, q 24. 2 to q 24. 3, was not involved in any deletion, either in this study or in any previous report. Presumably, monosomy for this region is lethal. In contrast, patients with deletions of 16 q 21 have a normal phenotype. These results are consistent with the proposed distribution of genes, frequent in telomeric Giesma light band regions but infrequent in G positive bands...|$|R

40|$|Wolf-Hirschhorn {{syndrome}} (WHS) {{caused by}} 4 p 16. 3 deletions comprises growth and mental retardation, distinct facial appearance and seizures. This study characterized a subtle <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletion</b> of 4 p 16. 3 in {{a girl with}} mild retardation and possessing facial traits characteristic of WHS. The patient had generalized seizures in conjunction with fever at 3 and 5 years of age.

40|$|Structural rearrangements of {{the short}} arm of {{chromosome}} 12 are frequent cytogenetic findings in various hematologic malignancies. The ETV 6 gene {{is the most common}} target for rearrangements in 12 p 13. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) investigations have shown that translocations of 12 p other than t(12; 21) are frequently accompanied by small <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> that include ETV 6. Unbalanced translocations involving ETV 6 have rarely been described, and breakpoints outside ETV 6 appear to be strongly associated with complex karyotypes. We studied bone marrow samples from 19 patients known to have 12 p unbalanced translocations and complex karyotypes, using FISH and spectral karyotyping. FISH analysis confirmed the hemizygous deletion of the ETV 6 and CDKN 1 B genes in 74 % of cases. We found four cases with <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions.</b> In these four cases and in two others (6 / 19, 31. 5 %), the fusion with the partner chromosome was in the subtelomeric region of 12 p 13. 3, confirming that there is a recurrent breakpoint in this region...|$|R

40|$|<b>Interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> of tumour {{suppressor}} {{genes and}} amplification of oncogenes {{are two major}} manifestations of chromosomal instability in tumour cells. The development of model systems allowing {{the study of the}} events triggering these processes is of major clinical importance. Using the properties of the I-SceI nuclease to introduce a localized double-strand break (DSB) in a mammalian chromosome carrying its target sequence, we demonstrate here that both types of mutations can be initiated by non-conservative DSB repair pathways. In our system, I-SceI activity dissociates a transfected gpt gene from its promoter, allowing the isolation of gpt- clones. Our results show that intrachromatid single-strand annealing events occur frequently, giving rise to <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> not accompanied by other chromosomal rearrangements. We also observed that, when present in the cells, extrachromosomal DNA molecules are integrated preferentially at the broken locus. Taking advantage of the insertion of the I-SceI recognition sequence telomeric to and close to the dihydrofolate reductase gene, we show that a less frequent outcome of I-SceI activity is the initiation of cycles of intrachromosomal amplification of this marker, from breaks at a site merging with the enzyme target...|$|R

40|$|IKZF 1 {{deletion}} (ΔIKZF 1) is {{an important}} predictor of relapse in childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Because of its clinical importance, we previously mapped breakpoints of intragenic deletions and developed a multiplex PCR assay to detect recurrent intragenic ΔIKZF 1. Since the multiplex PCR {{was not able to}} detect complete deletions (IKZF 1 Δ 1 - 8), which account for ~ 30 % of all ΔIKZF 1, we aimed at investigating the genomic scenery of IKZF 1 Δ 1 - 8. Six samples of cases with IKZF 1 Δ 1 - 8 were analyzed by microarray assay, which identified monosomy 7, isochromosome 7 q, and large <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> presenting breakpoints within COBL gene. Then, we established a multiplex ligation-probe amplification (MLPA) assay and screened copy number alterations within chromosome 7 in 43 diagnostic samples with IKZF 1 Δ 1 - 8. Our results revealed that monosomy and large <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> within chromosome 7 are the main causes of IKZF 1 Δ 1 - 8. Detailed analysis using long distance inverse PCR showed that six patients (16 %) had large <b>interstitial</b> <b>deletions</b> starting within intronic regions of COBL at diagnosis, which is ~ 611 Kb downstream of IKZF 1, suggesting that COBL is a hotspot for ΔIKZF 1. We also investigated a series of 25 intragenic deletions (Δ 2 - 8, Δ 3 - 8 or Δ 4 - 8) and 24 relapsed samples, and found one IKZF 1 -COBL tail-to-tail fusion, thus supporting that COBL is a novel hotspot for ΔIKZF 1. Finally, using RIC score methodology, we show that breakpoint sequences of IKZF 1 Δ 1 - 8 are not analog to RAG-recognition sites, suggesting a different mechanism of error promotion than that suggested for intragenic ΔIKZF 1.
