40|$|Efforts {{are being}} made {{to develop a new}} {{generation}} of communication networks, based on ultrafast optical communication. This is likely to result in {{a significant increase in the}} speed and volume of information transfer on communication networks such as the Internet. However, the introduction of these new types of networks also requires more from its users. Because these new networks are more sophisticated, there are likely to be more costs involved and users have to be more knowledgeable about the new technologies in order to be able to use them. Such requirements in both costs and knowledge may prevent groups of people from access to the networks. If larger groups of people are excluded from the networks, social polarization may result. Another effect of <b>exclusive</b> <b>networks</b> may be the limited number of providers of structure and content, which might lead to manipulation of the information provided. In this contribution, the effects of <b>exclusive</b> ultrafast communication <b>networks</b> are discussed and some suggestions are made on how to deal with this...|$|R

50|$|In May 1970, WAPI-TV {{became the}} {{exclusive}} NBC affiliate for Birmingham, simultaneously {{resulting in the}} CBS programs not already carried by that station moving to WBMG. The switch to an exclusive NBC affiliation was because two of Newhouse Broadcasting's other stations, WSTM-TV in Syracuse and WETM-TV in Elmira, New York, were already affiliated with the network; in addition, the company's chairman {{did not have a}} great personal relationship with CBS's president William S. Paley. At the same time that WAPI and WBMG aligned with the respective networks, WCFT-TV (channel 33, now Heroes & Icons affiliate WSES) in Tuscaloosa and WHMA-TV (channel 40, later WJSU-TV and now Heroes & Icons affiliate WGWW) in Anniston, two UHF stations respectively serving the western and eastern portions of Central Alabama, also became full-time affiliates of CBS; like WBMG and WAPI prior to becoming <b>exclusive</b> <b>network</b> affiliates, WCFT and WHMA - both of which signed on the air in the late 1960s - started as affiliates of both CBS and NBC.|$|E

However, NBC kept a postseason-only (with the exception of even-numbered years when NBC had the rights to the All-Star Game) deal in the end, signing a deal to carry three Division Series games, one half of the League Championship Series (the ALCS in even numbered years and the NLCS in odd numbered years; Fox would televise the other LCS in said years), and the 1997 and 1999 World Series respectively (Fox had exclusive rights to the 1996, 1998 and 2000 World Series). Beginning in 2001, Fox would become the exclusive broadcast network for the World Series, although it still alternates LCS series with ESPN each year (so that any LCS that is not televised by Fox in a given year is then broadcast on ESPN, and vice versa).|$|E

50|$|This was {{the first}} World Series {{televised}} by the ABC network since 1949, and the first since television of the Series started in 1947 not to be televised, at least in part, by rival network NBC.

50|$|In 1954, 1960 and 1961, {{and then}} from 1966 through 1981, ABC was the <b>exclusive</b> <b>network</b> home for regular season NCAA {{football}} telecasts. In 1982 and 1983, ABC and CBS split the package. In 1984, after the NCAA television contract was invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court, ABC began a three-year deal televising CFA games, featuring most major college teams except members of the Big Ten and Pacific-10, the Atlantic Coast Conference and the University of Miami, the games of which were televised by CBS. From 1987 to 1990, ABC televised Big Ten and Pacific-10 games. Since 1991, ABC has had contracts {{with most of the}} major BCS conferences, which leads it to broadcast many of its games regionally. ABC began airing a weekly Saturday night primetime football game in the fall of 2006, when the network's sports division converted to ESPN on ABC. Nearly all regional ABC games that air on a given Saturday (and {{a very large number of}} other, exclusive games) are also available as part of a pay-per-view package called ESPN GamePlan, and online via ESPN3.|$|E
5000|$|In 1987, CBS {{took over}} the CFA contract, which it would hold until 1990. CBS' {{tendency}} during this period was to air one marquee game each week, such as the legendary 1988 [...] "Catholics vs Convicts" [...] matchup between Notre Dame and Miami, though regional telecasts would occasionally be aired. For 1987 and 1988, Pat Haden joined Musburger in the booth, with John Dockery manning the sidelines. Nantz hosted what was {{now known as the}} [...] "Prudential College Football Report", which was mostly a roundup of the day's scores (not always limited to college football) and top headlines, though sometimes key figures in the sport would be interviewed. Verne Lundquist, Tim Brant, Dick Stockton, Steve Zabriskie and Brad Nessler also called games for CBS during the CFA period. In 1989, Nantz became lead play-by-play announcer, but Haden remained the lead analyst for that year, being replaced by Brant in 1990. After 1990, ABC obtained <b>exclusive</b> <b>network</b> coverage of regular season college football, as it won back the CFA and retained the Pac-10/Big Ten rights.|$|E
5000|$|Fox {{has certain}} rights for {{afternoon}} MLB games on Saturdays, and ESPN {{has the same}} rights for night games on Sundays. Broadcasters cannot show games of in-market teams, {{regardless of whether the}} game is home or away, if the game of the local team has a certain start time (usually there are no other games scheduled at these times). This, at least theoretically, is to make people watch the out-of-market game on ESPN or Fox. The reasoning is that since people {{will not be able to}} watch their favorite team, they may be willing to settle for some baseball, even if it involves teams they are not as excited about. This results in higher ratings for the national broadcaster by pulling baseball fans away from watching their own team. The Braves and the Texas Rangers (and Miami Marlins before they moved into their retractable roof stadium) have traditionally been allowed to play (and televise locally) Sunday night home games during the summer to avoid the extreme heat often found in their home markets. Otherwise, teams avoid scheduling home games within the broadcast windows of the <b>exclusive</b> <b>network</b> broadcasts (i.e. teams will play at 1:00 Eastern or 7:00 local time on Saturdays). Teams are also able to play (and televise locally) makeup games in the same window.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} PSpice programs, five types of the GaAs FET model have been implemented. However, {{some of them}} are too {{sophisticated}} and therefore difficult to measure and identify afterwards, especially the realistic model of Parker and Skellern. In the paper, simple enhancements of one of the classical models are proposed first. The resulting modification is usable for reliable modeling of both GaAs FETs and pHEMTs. Moreover, its adjusted capacitance function can effectively serve as a convenient representation of microwave varactors. The accuracy of these models can be strongly enhanced using the artificial neural networks – both using an <b>exclusive</b> neural <b>network</b> without an analytic model and co-operating a corrective neural network with the updated analytic model are discussed. The accuracy of the updated analytic models, the models based on the <b>exclusive</b> neural <b>network,</b> and the models created as a combination of the updated analytic model and the corrective neural network is compared.

40|$|Cholescystokinin (CCK) - or parvalbumin (PV) -containing interneurons are {{the major}} perisomatic-targeting interneurons in the {{cerebral}} cortex, including hippocampus, and are thought to form mutually <b>exclusive</b> <b>networks.</b> We used several techniques to test the alternative hypothesis that CCK and PV cells are coupled by chemical synapses. Triple immunofluorescence confocal microscopy revealed numerous axosomatic, axodendritic, and axoaxonic contacts stained for CCK, PV, and the presynaptic marker synaptophysin. The existence of mutual CCK and PV synapses was supported by dual EM immunolabeling. Paired whole-cell recordings detected unitary GABA Aergic synaptic transmission between identified CCK and PV cells, and single CCK cells could transiently inhibit action potential firing of synaptically coupled PV cells. We conclude that the major hippocampal perisomatic-targeting interneurons communicate synaptically. This communication should affect neuronal network activity, including neuronal oscillations, in which the CCK and PV cells have well established roles. The prevalence of CCK and PV networks in other brain regions suggests that internetwork interactions could be generally important...|$|R
