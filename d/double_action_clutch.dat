Subsequent shots are fired in single action mode with a lighter trigger pressure of approximately 20 N. As with other DA/SA pistols such as the HK USP and Beretta 92F, some training is required to minimize the difference in point of aim caused by the different trigger pressure between a first <b>double</b> <b>action</b> shot and subsequent single action shots. The hammer may also be manually cocked at any time by the user to fire in single action mode.|$|R
