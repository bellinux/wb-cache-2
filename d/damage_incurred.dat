5|$|In March 1244, the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II {{threatened}} {{conflict with}} the Omišani over <b>damage</b> <b>incurred</b> along the Apulian coast. In March 1245, knez Nikola of Hodimir, with 100 Omiš citizens and knezes Pribislav, Osor, Juraj, Radoš (son of Bogdan), Slomir, and Prodan (son of Dragan), made a treaty with Dubrovnik. According to the 1245 treaty, if the king called upon the Kačićs and Omišani to help in an attack on Dubrovnik, they would respond with the least possible forces.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the destructive tornadoes, Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour {{declared a state}} of emergency for 39counties. On April29, President Barack Obama signed a major disaster declaration for 29Mississippi counties in the wake of the Super Outbreak and another deadly outbreak on April15. This allowed residents and some local governments to sign up to receive federal funding to repair <b>damage</b> <b>incurred</b> from the storms. More than 60members of the Longino Baptist Church assisted residents of Neshoba County with debris removal and cleaning; also providing refreshments. The Salvation Army established a feeding center at the Coy Methodist Church. Disaster unemployment assistance was made available for people who lost their jobs due to storms and flooding, starting on May17. By July, a total of $15,734,072 in federal funding was approved through the Federal Emergency Management Agency for victims of the April15–28 storms.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, and Lützow steamed to Altafjord {{for repairs}} to <b>damage</b> <b>incurred</b> in heavy storms. In early April, Scharnhorst, Tirpitz, and nine destroyers {{conducted}} a training mission to Bear Island in the Arctic Ocean. On the 8th, a serious internal explosion {{occurred in the}} aft auxiliary machinery space above the armor deck. The explosion killed or injured 34 men and prompted the crew to flood the magazines for turret Caesar as a precaution against a magazine explosion. A repair ship completed work on the vessel in two weeks. Fuel shortages prevented major operations {{for the next six}} months, during which Scharnhorst was able to conduct only short training maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|The British fleet was {{anchored}} off The Rock on 10December 1796 when a storm blew up. Culloden {{was obliged}} {{to get under way}} when her anchors failed to hold, narrowly missing Pearl Rock in the process, and at 21:00, Gibraltar was forced to cut her cable. As she was attempting to get clear of Cabrita Point at 22:00, her fore topmast snapped and her foresail, mainsail, main topmast staysail, and mizzen staysail tore. Having already lost her main topsail, she became difficult to handle and struck the sandbank several times before being blown across it. By midnight Gibraltar was out of danger and able to ride out the storm, and the next day at noon she anchored in Tangier Bay. The <b>damage</b> <b>incurred</b> during the storm necessitated her being sent to Plymouth in January 1797. During the repairs, which took until April and cost £12,818, a large piece of rock was removed from her hull. Gibraltar returned to the Mediterranean in July 1797 under Captain William Hancock Kelly.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{are known}} to {{eliminate}} three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it. These mechanisms do not require a template, since the types of damage they counteract can occur in {{only one of the}} four bases. Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of <b>damage</b> <b>incurred</b> and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone. The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases. The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase, whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue/UV light (300–500nm wavelength) to promote catalysis. Photolyase, an old enzyme present in bacteria, fungi, and most animals no longer functions in humans, who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation. Another type of damage, methylation of guanine bases, is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT), the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt. This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once; that is, the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic. A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes. The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine.|$|E
5|$|Between May 1367 and September 1370 repairs costing £2,262 {{were carried}} out. Records show that {{sections}} of the curtain wall were repaired and two mural towers built, one of them replacing a tower on the same site. The towers were positioned north-east of the keep and still stand. Although more work was undertaken between 1370 and 1377, the year of Edward's death, what it consisted of is unknown. The royal apartments built during HenryIII's reign were never repaired; {{it has been suggested}} this was because by the 14thcentury, when considerable sums were being spent on repairs elsewhere in the castle, Rochester had fallen out of favour as a royal residence. As the castle's importance as a high-status residence waned, its role as a barracks and administrative centre came to the fore. The reign of RichardII (1377–1400) saw the investment of £500 in repairing the castle. This was in part in response to French raids on England's southern coast during the Hundred Years' War as England's fortunes in the conflict worsened. The most significant of these works was the construction of a tower {{at the north end of}} the castle, overlooking the bridge over the Medway. Records document the sum of £350 spent on a new tower between 1378 and 1383, and it mostly likely refers to the one guarding the bridge. Rochester Castle saw fighting for the final time during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. It was besieged and captured by a group of rebels who plundered the castle and released a prisoner. It has been suggested that the £66 10s spent in 1384–1388 and the £91 13s spent in 1395–1397 may have been partially in response to <b>damage</b> <b>incurred</b> during the revolt.|$|E

5|$|John died in 1216 and was {{succeeded by}} his nine-year-old son, Henry, {{with the support}} of the barons. With no {{prospect}} of becoming King of England, Louis returned to France. Rochester Castle was returned to royal control in 1217. Given the <b>damage</b> <b>incurred</b> during John's siege, the castle was in dire need of repairs. Between 1217 and 1237 around £680 were spent on repairs, of which £530 were taken up by work on the keep. In 1225 and 1226 the town walls were enhanced by the addition of a ditch at the cost of £300. The new ditch enclosed Boley Hill, possibly to deny the position to future aggressors who might attack the castle. Repairs began with the castle's outer curtain wall. At the same time a chapel was built within the castle. In 1226 the hall, buttery, and dispensary were repaired. Work probably did not begin on the keep until 1226. It was mostly repaired by 1227, but work continued on it until 1232. During 1230 and 1231 a stone wall dividing the castle's enclosure into two parts was built which no longer survives. While attention was paid to making the castle a working fortification, Henry III also funded construction of residential and other buildings. In 1244, £132 was spent on building a second chapel next to the royal apartments. Stables and an almonry were added in 1248. The main gatehouse was rebuilt between 1249 and 1250 at a cost of over £120. Further repairs were carried out on the keep in 1256, this time costing more than £120. Later in the decade further attention was paid to the castle's defences, possibly in response to HenryIII's worsening relations with his barons.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the {{previously}} fought wars, which had affected mostly the peripheries {{of the huge}} state, from the mid-17th century onward central Poland was being ravaged by warfare as well.

The protracted role of the country as a battlefield, the quartering of troops and armies, combined with the policy of exacting contributions and pillage during the Great Northern War, greatly deteriorated the economy of the country which had not yet recovered from the <b>damage</b> <b>incurred</b> two generations earlier.
