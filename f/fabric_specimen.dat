40|$|Previous {{experimental}} {{work on the}} determination of fabric tensile properties has usually considered the uniaxial-extension deformation. However, in their practical use, fabrics are subjected to biaxial-extension deformation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to provide a clear picture of tensile and elongation properties of plain-weave suiting materials. The KES G- 2 strip biaxial tester was used in order to eliminate the propensity of “waisting” effect of the <b>fabric</b> <b>specimen</b> under load. When <b>fabric</b> <b>specimen</b> is stretched in the tensile direction, the biaxial clamps prevent the structure from collapsing inward. The clamps are free to move along the track following the elongation in the tensile direction, therefore not inhibiting any elongation in the tensile direction. In this study, a total of 8 plain-weave suiting materials were examined. The results revealed that fabric constraint stress could be significantly predicted.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to use a}} fuzzy expert system with gradient descent optimization for prediction of fabric specimens in fashion product development. Compared with the traditional methods used fabric mechanical properties to predict fabric specimens, our advisory system accepts fabric hand descriptors which are {{more closely related to}} the sensory judgments made by individuals during fabric selection. Fifty participants were selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed fuzzy fabric advisory system. They were asked to express their preferred <b>fabric</b> <b>specimen</b> on inputs of the 14 bipolar fabric hand descriptors in the system. The fuzzy prediction rules associated with the membership functions of each <b>fabric</b> <b>specimen</b> were developed from a survey.

This paper applies the methodology to predict damage locations and laminate strains for failure of plain weave <b>fabric</b> <b>specimens</b> manufactured from two material systems – HTS 40 /RTM 6 and T 300 /CYCOM 970. The laminate strains are first dehomogenised to define local strains in the tow architecture of the fabric. This is achieved using meso-mechanical unit cell analysis in which the resin and tows are modelled as continua. For a selection of predefined critical locations in the tow bundles, the strains are further dehomogenised using an identical procedure as the one defined for the uni-directional specimens in the previous applications. The influence of matrix plasticity and temperature dependent mechanical and thermal properties of the RTM 6 resin are applied in the dehomogenisation procedure.

40|$|Abstract: Current global {{textiles}} and fashion industries have gradually shifted focus to high value-added, high sensibility, and multi-functional products based on new human-friendliness and sustainable growth technologies. Textile design CAD {{systems have been}} developed in conjunction with computer hardware and software sector advances. This study compares the patterns or images of actual woven fabrics and virtual fabrics prepared with a textile design CAD system. In this study, several weave structures (such as fancy yarn weave and patterns) were prepared with a shuttle loom. The woven textile images were taken using a CCD camera. The same weave structure data and yarn data were fed into a textile design CAD system in order to simulate fabric images as similarly as possible. Similarity Index analysis methods allowed for an anal-ysis of the index between the actual <b>fabric</b> <b>specimen</b> and the simulated image of the corresponding fabric. The results showed that repeated small pattern weaves provide superior similarity index values than those of a fancy yarn weave that indicate some irregularities due to fancy yarn attributes. A Complex Wavelet Structural Similarity(CW-SSIM) index resulted in a better index than other methods such as Multi-Scale(MS) SSIM, and Feature Similarity(FS) SSIM, across <b>fabric</b> <b>specimen</b> images.

Prior research works have studied the prediction of <b>fabric</b> <b>specimens</b> based on the fabric hand descriptors via either traditional statistical methods or artificial intelligence methods.

40|$|Fabric hand {{refers to}} the {{subjective}} perception of fabric mechanical properties. It {{is an important factor}} in fabric selection. In the literature, various instruments and tools have been developed to evaluate fabric hand by means of the related physical and mechanical properties. These works have studied the prediction of <b>fabric</b> <b>specimens</b> based on the fabric hand descriptors via either traditional statistical methods or artificial intelligence methods. The artificial neural network (ANN) model and its variation, the fuzzy neural network (FNN) -based intelligent fabric hand prediction system have been studied previously, and they show good accuracy in the forecasting task. The FNN model is especially useful as it provides good prediction accuracy and understandable rule-set at the same time. However, real-world application of the FNN model is restricted because of the great burden of required computation. In this paper, a nearest neighbor algorithm is used for feature selection to reduce computation burden. An improved FNN-based fabric hand prediction model is devised.

Two groups of experiments were conducted to investigate the influences of {{the configuration of the}} <b>fabric</b> <b>specimen</b> and the loading speed on the multiaxial tensile properties of the fabrics. The configuration of the specimen for the multiaxial tensile tests is identified as gear-shape with large arm widths. A loading speed of lower than 20 mm/min is suggested to obtain the tensile properties of the coated woven fabrics under multiaxial loads. The tensile performances of coated woven fabrics under uni-, bi-, and multiaxial loads were compared. We found that the tensile performances under bi- and multiaxial loads are much better than those under uniaxial loads. Therefore, for the application of the coated woven fabrics in lightweight structures, biaxial or multiaxial loading conditions will be necessary. Experiments on the specimens with an initial crack in the center under multiaxial loads show that, by comparison with other loading directions, the tensile properties in warp direction of the coated woven fabrics {{play an important role in}} the failure performance and crack propagation under multiaxial loads.

One of the collaboration examples is the recent research projects on 3 D virtual clothing systems based on the 3 D CAD software. The 3 D virtual clothing systems provide simulated apparels with high degrees of fidelity in terms of color, texture, and structural details. However, since real fabrics exhibit strong nonlinearity, anisotropy, viscoelasticity, and hysteresis, the 3 D virtual clothing systems need fine tuning parameters for the simulation process. In this study, characteristics of silk fabrics, which are woven by using degummed silk and raw silk yarns, are being analyzed and compared.

However {{during most of}} their missions on board the Space Shuttle or International Space Station, astronauts wear ordinary clothing, such as cotton shirts and pants. As the behaviour of flames is considerably different in microgravity than under earth s gravity, fabrics are expected to burn in a different fashion in microgravity than when tested on earth. There is interest in determining how this change in burning behaviour may affect times to second and third degree burn of human skin, and how the results of standard fabric flammability tests conducted under earth s gravity correlate with the expected fire behaviour of textiles in microgravity.

At the moment, there is no testing technique available that would allow a cost-efficient full-depth inspection of the (multi-layered) textile base materials, the 3 -dimensional preforms, and the cured composites. The high-frequency eddy current measurement technique developed at the IKTS-MD Dresden {{is based on the}} induction of high frequency eddy currents in the electrically conductive carbon fibres. In order to assess the detectability of typical quality faults both in the textile and in the cured composite, defined defects were introduced into the carbon fibre biaxial non-crimp fabrics (layer orientation ± 45 ° and 0 °/ 90 °, yarn count 800 tex), which correspond to typical production defects. After generation of the defects, one group of the non-crimp <b>fabric</b> <b>specimen</b> was analyzed by high frequency eddy current testing, while the other group was further processed to composite sheets by vacuum infusion technique and subsequently analyzed as well. Bright regions in the measurement scans represent areas of high conductivity (high fibre content), whereas dark regions indicate zones of low conductivity (local reduction of fibre content). From the scan images, the correct fibre orientation of the different layers and the presence of gaps, as well as the missing of individual reinforcement ravings can be clearly detected. Since these parameters have a crucial influence on the mechanical properties and the infiltration behaviour, the eddy current technique can be used for the quality control of textile base material. Wrinkles and dry spots in the composite sheets can also be identified due to meet precisely stipulated parameters. It was shown that with high-frequency eddy current technique, quality defects could be detected both in carbon fibre non-crimp fabrics as well as in cured CFRP composite sheets. It was further shown that the detection was possible even in the inner, optically non-visible layers of the CFRP. The results therefore prove the high potential of the high-frequency eddy current technology as a technique for the quality control for the manufacturing of textiles, preforms and composites based on carbon fibres.

The effect of four variables in the removal of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria from cotton <b>fabric</b> <b>specimens</b> during washing was investigated. More specifically, the objectives were to determine: (1) the percentage of bacteria removed in each stage of the multiple-cycle washing process and that which remained on the fabric after laundering; (2) any differences between hot water washing with a detergent and cold water washing with a cold water detergent on the removal of bacteria from cotton fabric; (2) any differences between hot and cold water washing without detergent on bacterial removal; (4) the effect of washing with detergent compared to washing without detergent for both hot and cold water; (5) any differences in residual bacterial content on fabrics washed immediately after inoculation compared with those washed 24 hours after inoculation and subsequent incubation; (6) any differences in the survival of two bacteria, one a Gram positive and the other a Gram negative, throughout the washing process.

40|$|The paper {{defines the}} {{experimental}} phase of an objective {{to obtain the}} mechanical characteristics and coefficients required by the generalized form of Hooke's law for nylon-polyurethane-coated <b>fabric.</b> Test <b>specimens</b> were cylindrical <b>fabric</b> sleeves and were loaded in axial tension by an Instron, in hoop tension by pressurizing, and in shear by a torquing fixture. An extensive amount of strain data is included for a wide combination of the three membrane loads. The tests indicate highly nonlinear stress-strain characteristics of the fabric and a strong dependency on all three membrane loads...|$|R
