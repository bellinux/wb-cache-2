5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has one up on Shane as opposed to one up on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

5|$|One {{year since}} the {{documentary}} has aired, the crew has returned to gain more footage for the DVD bonus features. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) are about to get married. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms), after being humiliated with his talent show audition tape going viral on the internet, has found a job at his alma mater Cornell University in the Admissions Office. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) has helped expand Athlead, now named Athleap, opening a branch in Austin, Texas. Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) is enjoying retirement in Florida and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) tries to get Stanley's replacement Malcolm (Malcolm Barrett) fat on chocolates to make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Stanley. After being fired by Dwight, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) bought a bar and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) started a career as an author in New York City. Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) has moved to Poland. Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) had faked his death but was then revealed to be a wanted fugitive, so Dwight replaced him with former employee Devon White (Devon Abner). Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) is preparing to run for a State Senate seat and is now Phillip's godfather. Andy, Darryl, Stanley, Toby, and Nellie return to Scranton for the wedding {{as well as a}} panel for the documentary.|$|E
5|$|Todd's {{identical}} twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), {{whom he had}} never known, is physically altered and brainwashed {{to believe that he}} is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that he could get his share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E

Although he once {{said that if he}} was ever to get a short hair cut that he'd remove it, as he was concerned it would leave <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> a member of the Village People. Blunos lives in Bath with his wife Siân, his two sons Leon and Max and his daughter Coco.|$|R

25|$|Jerry Springer debuted on September 30, 1991. It was {{developed}} by WLWT to mimic the format and look of fellow talk show The Phil Donahue Show, {{all the way down}} to Jerry's haircut and glasses, making <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Phil Donahue (both were produced by Multimedia Entertainment). It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests included Oliver North and Jesse Jackson, and topics included homelessness and gun politics.|$|E
25|$|According to NBC, the set for {{the show}} has had two major changes over the years. When the show first started in 1991, it was very basic with white walls, {{in an effort to}} capture the feel of fellow talk show Donahue, Jerry's haircut and glasses even seeming to make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Phil Donahue. The general look of this set was carried over when the series first moved to Chicago in September 1992, with an unpolished, open air look and bright colored shapes.|$|E
25|$|Toradora! is an anime {{television}} series {{adapted from the}} light novel series of the same title written by Yuyuko Takemiya and illustrated by Yasu. The series was directed by Tatsuyuki Nagai and produced by J.C.Staff, Masayoshi Tanaka serving as the character designer and Mari Okada serving as the primary scriptwriter. The series follows Ryūji Takasu, {{a high school student}} whose eyes make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> an intimidating delinquent, and Taiga Aisaka, a diminutive girl in his class who is known for her negative attitude towards nearly everyone. The two of them spend their days of high school with their three close friends named Minori Kushieda, Yūsaku Kitamura and Ami Kawashima.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1850s, {{the names}} Brother Jonathan and Uncle Sam {{were being used}} nearly interchangeably, {{to the point that}} images of what had {{previously}} been called [...] "Brother Jonathan" [...] were being called [...] "Uncle Sam". Similarly, the appearance of both personifications varied wildly. For example, one depiction of Uncle Sam in 1860 showed <b>him</b> <b>looking</b> <b>like</b> Benjamin Franklin, while a contemporaneous depiction of Brother Jonathan <b>looks</b> more <b>like</b> the modern version of Uncle Sam, though without a goatee.|$|R

That was the {{remarkable}} part of this afternoon of sensations...one would not expect him to run through a first-class side of batsman, yet here was {{his name on the}} board with three Test batsman to his credit at a very small cost and at a very vital stage of the game. With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and an ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the original Farmer Brown.|$|E
25|$|An {{unintended}} {{consequence of the}} attack on Melo was that Paraguay declared war on Brazil in late 1864. The Paraguayans invaded the provinces of Mato Grosso (present-day Mato Grosso do Sul) and Rio Grande do Sul. José Luís served in the Siege of Uruguaiana which resulted, in September 1865, in the surrender of an entire Paraguayan army which had taken the Brazilian town of Uruguaiana. On 22 March 1866, José Luís was given command of the 2nd cavalry division, a part of the 1st army corps. He fought in the Battle of Estero Bellaco on 2 May and in the First Battle of Tuyutí on 24 May. At Tuyutí José Luís was shot in the face with the bullet's trajectory entering one cheek and exiting through the other. He was left with hideous scars that made <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> he had a grim smile in his face. Tall and lean, José Luís seemed unpleasant at first glance, an impression that the disfigurement only worsened. He was actually a kind and warm person, according to historian Gustavo Barroso, who as commander knew how to impose a strict discipline without hurting the pride of his subordinates.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Greeley's {{effectiveness}} as {{a reformer}} was undermined by his idiosyncrasies: according to Williams, he [...] "must {{have looked like}} an apparition, a man of eccentric habits dressed in an old linen coat that made <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a farmer who came into town for supplies". [...] Van Deusen wrote, [...] "Greeley's effectiveness as a crusader was limited by some of his traits and characteristics. [...] Culturally deficient, he was to the end ignorant of his own limitations, and this ignorance was a great handicap." ...|$|E

It’s a shame he was asked to do what he couldn’t." [...] Sports blog Deadspin ranked Timberlake the 2nd-worst player to ever play in the NFL, only behind quarterback Rusty Lisch.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Simon Blackquill, the new rival prosecutor character, Fuse initially {{intended to}} make him different from all previous Ace Attorney prosecutors and focusing almost entirely on the convict aspect of Blackquill, making <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "total criminal". At this point in development, Blackquill {{was intended to be}} the character who could analyze emotions based on voices, so he was given a headgear to wear. Next, Fuse put more focus on the prosecutor aspect, but ended up with a design that he described as [...] "just another prosecutor"; he realized that the prosecutor and convict aspects were opposites, with one decreasing as the other increases.|$|E
500|$|Meeting {{the rest}} of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress the family, Greg's {{inadvertent}} actions make him {{an easy target for}} ridicule, disdain and anger: He accidentally breaks Debbie's nose during a volleyball mishap; uses a malfunctioning toilet that floods the Byrnes' back yard with sewage; sets the wedding altar on fire and inadvertently leads Jack to think he is a marijuana user. He also feels inferior to Kevin, Pam's ex-fiance who, unlike him, receives nothing but warmth and friendliness from Jack. Later, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a feral cat whose tail he spray paints to make <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Mr. Jinx while desperately seeking Jack's approval.|$|E
5000|$|Hans Kraay {{was a tough}} defender in Feyenoord {{in those}} days. “Coen was unique. Coaches tried {{to tell him how}} to play but he’d shrug and do his own thing. Like Messi.

500|$|Sheridan's {{performance}} was generally well received. Entertainment Weekly’s Ken Tucker {{wrote that the}} best acting came from Sheridan, who gave the character a [...] "grim intensity". He commented that Sheridan had [...] "leading-man looks" [...] with the hair of a [...] "dissolute heavy metal star", making him [...] "unsettling" [...] even when not wearing makeup that makes <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a devil. Douglas E. Winter of Fangoria magazine believed that Sheridan {{might have been a}} bit young and [...] "zany" [...] for the part, but gave a credible performance; he said that Sheridan attacked the role [...] "with the swagger of Elvis, the sway of David Koresh and as much craziness as your heart desires (and network TV allows)".|$|E
500|$|As each {{episode of}} Inside No. 9 {{features}} new characters, the writers {{were able to}} attract actors {{who might have been}} unwilling to commit to an entire series.

She was one of several members of the cast of the film Life Is Sweet (others being Alison Steadman and Jane Horrocks) who have starred in Inside No. 9. Skinner enjoyed the [...] "funny" [...] script and her [...] "nice" [...] character. Eve Gordon (trained at the Nottingham Television Workshop) starred as Angela's daughter Katie, and Pemberton starred as Angela's husband Jim. Pemberton and Shearsmith suggested that Pemberton's costume made <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> Mr Chow Mein, a Benny Hill character.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Infamous 2, Sucker Punch {{decided to}} look at everything that could be improved, saying [...] "everything was on the table". Due to negative feedback from fans, they redesigned the main character, Cole. Cole initially underwent many changes, {{to the extent of}} making <b>him</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> a different character. However, after being [...] "taken aback by the uproar of fan support for the original Cole," [...] Sucker Punch combined elements of the original with the new design. Some of Cole's clothing was changed to suit the new setting of the game. Eric Ladin was also brought in to replace Jason Cottle as the voice of Cole because Sucker Punch felt that they needed someone who could perform Cole's physical reactions as well as his voice with the use of their new motion capture technology.|$|E

60|$|There {{seemed to}} be an unnatural stillness everywhere, amid which the {{crunching}} of the dry snow sounded with a distinctness that almost frightened the boy, who was simply going to his uncle Robert's to spend a day or two.
