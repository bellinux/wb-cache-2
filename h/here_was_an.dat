500|$|Upon {{receiving}} contact reports {{early on}} 7 April, U.S. 5th Fleet commander Admiral Raymond Spruance ordered Task Force 54, which consisted mostly of modernized Standard-type battleships {{under the command}} of Admiral Morton Deyo (which were engaged in shore bombardment), to intercept and destroy the Japanese sortie. Deyo moved to execute his orders, but Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher, who commanded Task Force 58 (TF58), preempted Spruance and Deyo by launching a massive air strike from his carriers, without informing Spruance until after the launches were completed. As a senior naval aviation officer, [...] "Mitscher had spent a career fighting the battleship admirals who had steered the navy’s thinking for most of the current century. One of those was his immediate superior, Raymond Spruance. Mitscher felt a stirring of battleship versus aircraft carrier rivalry. Though the carriers had mostly fought the great battles of the Pacific, whether air power alone could prevail over a surface force had not been proven beyond all doubt. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to end the debate forever".|$|E

2500|$|A {{specially}} interesting climatic {{change during}} glacial times {{has taken place}} in the semi-arid Andes. Beside the expected cooling down in comparison with the current climate, a significant precipitation change happened here. So, researches in the presently semiarid subtropic Aconcagua-massif (6,962m) have shown an unexpectedly extensive glacial glaciation of the type [...] "ice stream network". The connected valley glaciers exceeding 100km in length, flowed down on the East-side of this section of the Andes at 32–34°S and 69–71°W as far as a height of 2,060m and on the western luff-side still clearly deeper. Where current glaciers scarcely reach 10km in length, the snowline (ELA) runs at a height of 4,600m and at that time was lowered to 3,200m asl, i.e. about 1,400m. From this follows that—beside of an annual depression of temperature about c. 8.4°C— <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> increase in precipitation. Accordingly, at glacial times the humid climatic belt that today is situated several latitude degrees further to the S, was shifted much further to the N.|$|E
