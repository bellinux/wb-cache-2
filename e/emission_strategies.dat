40|$|Combining {{policies}} to remove carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{from the atmosphere}} with {{policies to}} reduce emissions could decrease CO 2 concentrations faster than possible via natural processes. We model the optimal selection of a dynamic portfolio of abatement, research and development (R&D), and negative emission policies under an exogenous CO 2 constraint and with stochastic technological change. We find that near-term abatement is not sensitive to the availability of R&D policies, but the anticipated availability of negative <b>emission</b> <b>strategies</b> can reduce the near-term abatement optimally undertaken to meet 2 degrees C temperature limits. Further, planning to deploy negative emission technologies shifts optimal R&D funding from "carbon-free" technologies into "emission intensity" technologies. Making negative <b>emission</b> <b>strategies</b> available enables an 80 % reduction {{in the cost of}} keeping year 2100 CO 2 concentrations near their current level.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the use of}} critical loads in optimized emission abatement strategies. As deposition targets, critical loads can not be satisfied at all receptors. In Europe, consequently, {{there is a need}} for alternative criteria which still relate to ecological indicators, yet which are feasible, consistent and equitable. Two criteria are suggested: the relative critical load coverage and the relative deposition reduction. These criteria permit deposition goals to be set which guarantee that a specified fraction of ecosystems will attain critical loads, and thus be protected from adverse environmental impacts. In areas which can not achieve critical loads with the best available control measures, deposition is reduced to a specified fraction of the unabated level. After presenting examples which demonstrate their derivation, strengths and weakness of these criteria are discussed. The criteria have been implemented in the RAINS optimization model. Some preliminary examples show the sensitivity, interactions and utility of the criteria. Results obtained indicate that optimized <b>emission</b> <b>strategies</b> based on critical loads are similar to <b>emission</b> <b>strategies</b> based on deposition reductions, at certain levels of the criteria. This suggests that it may not be necessary to utilize critical loads to formulate deposition targets. A second example shows the effect of excluding countries from European cost minimization. A country's participation can save costs with moderate deposition targets, however, significant costs can be imposed with low (stringent) deposition targets. These preliminary results have significant implications for negotiations and multilateral negotiations. Suggestions for future analyses conclude the paper...|$|E

40|$|In {{a series}} of {{simulations}} with the global ECHAM 5 -HAM aerosol-climate model, the response to changes in anthropogenic emissions is analyzed. Traditionally, additivity is assumed {{in the assessment of}} the aerosol climate impact, as the underlying bulk aerosol models are largely constrained to linearity. The microphysical aerosol module HAM establishes degrees of freedom for nonlinear responses of the aerosol system. In this studyâs results, aerosol column mass burdens respond nonlinearly to changes in anthropogenic emissions, manifested in alterations of the aerosol lifetimes. Specific emission changes induce modifications of aerosol cycles with unaltered emissions, indicating a microphysical coupling of the aerosol cycles. Anthropogenic carbonaceous emissions disproportionately contribute to the accumulation mode numbers close to the source regions. In contrast, anthropogenic sulfuric emissions less than proportionally contribute to the accumulation mode numbers close to the source regions and disproportionately contribute in remote regions. The additivity of the aerosol system is analyzed by comparing the changes from a simulation with emission changes for several compounds with the sum of changes of single simulations, in each of which one of the emission changes was introduced. Close to the anthropogenic source regions, deviations from addi-tivity are found at up to 30 % and 15 % for the accumulation mode number burden and aerosol optical thickness, respectively.

In response, California is implementing policies for reducing GHG emissions from the electricity and transportation sectors, such as renewable and zero emission vehicle (ZEV) targets. Electricity and transportation {{have historically been}} treated as independent. However, <b>emission</b> <b>strategies</b> applied to either can affect both, as well as water resources, either aiding or hindering the advancement of mutual sustainability goals. Expanding renewable utilization is increasing the need for stationary energy storage (SES) to manage renewable dynamics and shift energy to resolve the misalignment of supply and demand. The deployment of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) to meet ZEV targets introduces a new variable load and, at the same time, an alternative grid resource that, with intelligent charging, can be utilized as to manage grid dynamics, thereby achieving high renewable integration and reducing both electricity and transportation emissions. This research employs an integrated platform to evaluate SES and PEV strategies to meet sustainability goals. The role of SES to facilitate renewable integration and meet emission targets under different scenarios is investigated. This is accomplished by (1) evaluating the effectiveness of SES to reduce emissions at high renewables, and (2) examining the impact of intelligent PEV deployment on SES requirements to reach renewable targets. The impact of water-intensive renewable technologies is also discussed.

40|$|Biofuels {{have been}} {{identified}} as one of several GHG <b>emission</b> <b>strategies</b> to reduce the use of fossil fuels in the transport sector. Fast pyrolysis of biomass is one approach to producing second generation biofuels. The bio-oil product of fast pyrolysis can be upgraded into essential gasoline and diesel range products with conventional refinery technologies. Thus, it is important to assess their techno- economic and environmental performance at an early stage prior to commercialisation. This research was conducted with the goal of evaluating and comparing the techno-economic and environmental viability of the production of biofuels from fast pyrolysis of biomass and upgrading of bio-oil via two refinery technologies, viz. hydroprocessing and zeolite cracking. In order to achieve this aim, process models of fast pyrolysis of biomass and bio-oil upgrading via hydroprocessing and zeolite cracking were developed. The fast pyrolysis model was based on multi-step kinetic models. In addition, lumped kinetic models of the hydrodeoxygenation reactions of bio-oil were implemented. The models were verified against experimental measurements with good prediction and formed the foundation {{for the development of a}} 72 t/day fast pyrolysis plant model in Aspen PlusÂ®. Several strategies were proposed for the two pathways to enhance energy efficiency and profitability. All in all, the results revealed that the hydroprocessing route is 16 % more efficient than the zeolite cracking pathway. Moreover, the hydroprocessing route resulted in a minimum fuel selling price of 15 % lower than that from the zeolite cracking pathway. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the techno-economic and environmental performance of the both pathways depends on several process, economic and environmental parameters. In particular, biofuel yield, operating cost and income tax were identified as the most sensitive techno-economic parameters, while changes in nitrogen feed gas to the pyrolysis reactor and fuel yield had the most environmental impact. It was concluded that hydroprocessing is a more suitable upgrading pathway than zeolite cracking in terms of economic viability, energy efficiency, and GHG emissions per energy content of fuel produced...|$|E

Objectives {{of this study were}} to estimate the current level of GHG emissions and land use of dairy farms in Lembang District, West Java, and evaluate the potential effects of feeding and manure management interventions on GHG emissions and land use. A life cycle assessment was used to estimate cradle-to-farm gate GHG emissions and land use of an average dairy farm in Lembang District, using data from a survey of 300 dairy farmers in Lembang in 2016. Total GHG emissions were 33 ton CO 2 e. per farm/year, and emission intensity was 1. 9 kg CO 2 e per kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) and 8. 8 kg CO 2 e per kg live weight. Total estimated land use was 2. 1 ha per dairy farm, which was equal to 1. 2 m 2 per kg FPCM and 5. 6 m 2 per kg live weight. Hotspots of GHG emissions were rumen enteric fermentation (CH 4), manure management (CH 4 and N 2 O; especially discharged manure), and off-farm feed production (CH 4, N 2 O and CO 2; especially rice straw). Feeding and manure management interventions evaluated in a scenario analysis in this study changed total GHG emissions by - 12 to + 24 %, and GHG emission intensity by - 1 to - 14 %. Total land use changed by - 6 to + 22 %, and land use intensity (i. e., land use per kg FPCM or life weight) by 0 to - 11 %. Largest reductions in GHG emission intensity were found in the scenarios with maize silage feeding, improved manure management, and an increased amount of roughage in the diet. We concluded that improvement of feeding and manure management can reduce GHG emissions and land use of dairy farms in Lembang District.
