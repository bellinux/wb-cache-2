Polls in battleground midwestern states, and word from activists there, showed that Bryan had made deep inroads into Republican support. One survey in August showed that of the midwestern states, only Wisconsin was safe for the Republicans.|$|E

However, other tribes on the list oppose this request as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> harder to obtain the few positions already set aside.|$|E

25|$|Larger {{trees are}} more likely to support more Orthalicus reses reses snails than smaller trees, {{probably}} because they provide the snails with an increased surface area for foraging. It is not known if Orthalicus reses reses prefer certain tree types or species; however, Voss (1976) suggested tree snails generally prefer trees with smooth bark rather than trees with rough bark, because it would require less energy to crawl over smooth bark. Voss also believed Orthalicus reses reses would prefer smooth bark because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for them to form a secure mucous seal when they were aestivating, resulting in lower mortalities from dehydration or accidental dislodgement.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{the case of}} UK stamp duty reserve tax shows that {{provided}} exemptions are given to market makers and banks, that FTT can generate modest revenues, {{at the expense of}} pensioners and savers. Despite the low tax rate of 0.5% on the purchase of shares, the UK managed to generate between €3.7 and €7.4 billion in revenues from stamp duties per year throughout the last decade. Also the cases of Japan, Taiwan and Switzerland suggest that countries may generate sizable amounts of income by introducing FTT on a national scale. If implemented on an international scale, revenues may be even considerably higher, since <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more difficult for traders to avoid the tax by moving to other locations.|$|E

This move would close the diagonal of the Ba7. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> harder for Black to develop the Bc8 as pawn pushes like b7–b6 or d7–d6 may be answered respectively by cxb6 or cxd6, creating a weak pawn for Black.

500|$|Hetreed {{worked closely}} with Tucker and Webber to adapt the book, {{explaining}} that [...] "... working with them on drafts helped me to concentrate on what the film would be, rather than how beautifully I could make a line work." [...] Her first draft was closest to the source material and it slowly [...] "... developed its own character ..." [...] through rewrites. She avoided using a voiceover, which was present in the novel, [...] "... partly because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> very literary." [...] Instead, she focused on conveying Griet's thoughts visually– for example, in her adaptation Griet and Vermeer inspect the camera obscura together under his cloak amidst sexual tension; whereas, in the novel Griet views it alone immediately after him and enjoys the lasting warmth and scent he leaves.|$|E
500|$|Although Ann Perkins was {{initially}} {{conceived as a}} character outside of city hall who became involved with Leslie and her political world, series co-creator Michael Schur said he believed it made sense that she would take a city hall job because [...] "we just decided that Leslie’s pull would {{be strong enough to}} get her to make a move, career-wise". Schur also said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for the character to become involved in stories with the others. [...] "The Fight" [...] featured several appearances by actors who had appeared in previous Parks and Recreation episodes, including Ben Schwartz as Tom's friend Jean-Ralphio, who helps him promote Snake Juice throughout the night. Andy Forrest appeared as Andy's shoeshine customer Kyle, who is often insulted and mocked by Andy and the other characters during his shoeshines. Nick Kroll also appeared as [...] "The Douche", the host of the Pawnee morning zoo-style radio show [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche", which was previously featured in the episode [...] "Media Blitz".|$|E
500|$|With Sinclair's new {{specifications}} in hand, Ogle {{worked on}} a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled Bond Bug – another Ogle design. The vehicle's handlebar steering {{was the brainchild of}} Wood Rogers, who decided at the outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> impossible for a driver {{to get in and out}} easily – a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that [...] "putting the bars at the driver's sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural". A prototype was presented to 63 families in the A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5. In the autumn of 1983, Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle's detailing, build prototypes and test rigs, carry out testing and take forward the programme to production. The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving ground in Leicestershire.|$|E

500|$|Crane {{decided to}} publish it privately, with money he had {{inherited}} from his mother. The novel was published in late February or early March 1893 by a small printing shop that usually printed medical books and religious tracts. [...] The typewritten title page for the Library of Congress copyright application read simply: [...] "A Girl of the Streets, / A Story of New York. / —By—/Stephen Crane." [...] The name [...] "Maggie" [...] {{was added to the}} title later. Crane used the pseudonym [...] "Johnston Smith" [...] for the novel's initial publication, later telling friend and artist Corwin Knapp Linson that the nom de plume was the [...] "commonest name I could think of. [...] I had an editor friend named Johnson, and put in the [...] "t", and no one could find me in the mob of Smiths." [...] Hamlin Garland reviewed the work in the June 1893 issue of The Arena, calling it [...] "the most truthful and unhackneyed study of the slums I have yet read, fragment though it is." [...] Despite this early praise, Crane became depressed and destitute from having spent $869 for 1,100copies of a novel that did not sell; he ended up giving a hundred copies away. [...] He would later remember [...] "how I looked forward to publication and pictured the sensation I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make.</b> <b>It</b> fell flat. Nobody seemed to notice it or care for it... Poor Maggie! She was one of my first loves." ...|$|E
500|$|Mario Bros. {{was created}} by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead {{developers}} for the video game Donkey Kong. In Donkey Kong, Mario dies if he falls too far. Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto {{that he should be}} able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> [...] "not much of a game." [...] He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario [...] "jumping and bouncing around", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below. Because of Mario's appearance in Donkey Kong with overalls, a hat, and a thick moustache, Shigeru Miyamoto thought that he should be a plumber as opposed to a carpenter, and designed this game to reflect that. Another contributing factor was the game's setting: it was a large network of giant pipes, so they felt a change in occupation was necessary for him.|$|E
500|$|The album's earlier {{sessions}} {{produced a}} little material {{that has made}} the final cut. West had brought a majority of his usual production crew onto the project, the same crew that had assisted in the creation of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. One of the main exceptions was producer No I.D., who felt that the two artists weren't pushing forward enough with the music. In an interview with Complex, No I.D. commented about the project that [...] "you're going to sell, because you're already big. But you guys are important to push this forward. Push intelligence and decadence and all of the above forward in a creative manner." [...] While his advice was acknowledged to a degree, he ultimately had very little part in the finished project. In January 2011, they regrouped and rented a block of rooms at the Mercer Hotel in New York City and invited a select group of producers and recording artists. Chauncey [...] "Hit-Boy" [...] Hollis, who produced the track [...] "Niggas in Paris", said of recording at the hotel, [...] "There was music going on in every room. I had a room where I was cranking out beats, and then I'd go into the main room with Jay and [...] and play beats for them. Kanye is really hands-on. I would come in with a beat and he'd be like, 'Take this out, slow it down.' <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> sound 100 times better. Jay would then mumble different flows to the beat".|$|E

50|$|In June 1911, Arthur Lawley had {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} a railway bridge connecting Pamban Island with the Indian mainland. The existing railway line ended with the town of Ramanathapuram and it was felt that its extension to Pamban island would boost trade and tourism. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> also <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier for pilgrims to travel to the sacred Hindu shrine of Rameswaram.|$|R

2500|$|Some {{international}} broadcasts, including BBC America, {{contained an}} introduction by Amy {{before the opening}} credits. Moffat was asked to write the sequence; he called it a [...] "bloody good idea" [...] because <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> accessible to new audiences, despite noting that diehard fans would not like it.

2500|$|Ip, who had {{previously}} been maintaining a [...] "pragmatic" [...] defense of universal suffrage for the chief executive and Legislative Council elections in 2017, said {{that it could be}} achieved by 2012 under her proposal unveiled her platform on 23 October. She emphasised her fallback plan was to delay universal Legco polls to 2016 at the latest, and 2017 for the chief executive election. Chan declared Ip's new proposal on the chief executive election a step backwards, saying <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> harder for potential candidates.|$|E
2500|$|The 2011 World Energy Outlook {{report by}} the International Energy Agency stated that having [...] "second {{thoughts}} on nuclear would have far-reaching consequences" [...] and that a substantial shift away from nuclear power would boost demand for fossil fuels, putting additional upward pressure {{on the price of}} energy, raising additional concerns about energy security, and making it more difficult and expensive to combat climate change. The reports suggests that the consequences would be most severe for nations with limited local energy resources and which have been planning to rely heavily on nuclear power for future energy security, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> substantially more challenging for developing economies to satisfy their rapidly increasing demand for electricity.|$|E
5000|$|Rush {{introduced}} the [...] "Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009" [...] on January 6, 2009.

2500|$|On 18 February 2017, Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin {{signed a}} decree whereby the Russian authorities would recognise personal and vehicle-registration documents {{issued by the}} DPR and LPR.

Ukrainian authorities decried the decree as being directly contradictory to the Minsk II agreement and that it [...] "legally recognised the quasi-state terrorist groups which cover Russia's occupation of part of Donbas." [...] Secretary General of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Lamberto Zannier stated on 19 February the decree [...] "implies…recognition of those who issue the documents, of course" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more difficult to hold a ceasefire.|$|E
2500|$|One way {{to improve}} the {{survival}} of the ICBM force would be to actively defend it with an ABM system. However, the 1972 ABM treaty greatly limited the number and geographical deployment of any ABM, with the aim of preventing whole-country protection and thus ensuring MAD. LoADS addressed these limitations by being deployed along with the radars and engagement computers needed to make a successful attack at only very short ranges, [...] or less. The entire system was packed into a cylinder that looked like an MX and would be shuffled between the silos. As the LoADS could be in any of the silos at a particular missile site, the enemy would have to expend two warheads on every silo to ensure a hit, as one would be assumed lost to LoADS. This would not stop a successful counterforce attack, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> significantly more expensive {{in terms of the number}} of warheads used, potentially requiring more warheads than the Soviets had.|$|E

He credits his father for his love of football. His father gave him a football when he was 16 months old and as a child, {{he was able to}} practice with brothers and friends on a large field near his home in Helsingborg.
