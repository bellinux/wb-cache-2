5|$|Organised {{water supply}} in the town began at least by 1883 when it was {{reported}} being carted from the millrace. The river's water was used as wells in the town were deemed too brackish. Five years later Thomas Monds installed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> and began pumping water from the river to three iron tanks in the town. He on-sold the water to townspeople, though the mill had priority over river water; this was a particular problem during droughts when the Liffey slowed to a trickle. Westbury Council—local government of the time—called for tenders for Carrick's water supply in 1889. This water supply system was completed in 1890. Water was again pumped from the river near the mill, again by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams,</b> to a tank near {{the centre of the}} town which supplied another tank on the main road and some houses on the same road. Both tanks had troughs and hoses for public use.|$|E
5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other {{studies have suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
5|$|The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) {{justified}} the {{continued use of}} tolls by suggesting they were necessary to fund maintenance and improvement works. These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers {{in the event of}} collision in the Firth. The main towers were also strengthened with internal steel columns (the original tower structure was hollow) and had <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork. Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was {{primarily}} to promote the wider deployment of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump, and secondarily to provide the technical input into a programme aimed at using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump technologies for third world development. Hitherto <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump technologies have been restricted by poor understanding of operational parameters, poor performance prediction, and poor design of pumps and installations. In pursuit of greater understanding the work utilised a computer simulation developed by the author as part of a previous research programme. This simulation was then greatly enhanced to provide improved accuracy and functionality. The enhanced simulation was then used to provide significant insight into the operation of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump and subsequently used to identify design improvements for the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump. The simulation was used to investigate operational restrictions on the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram,</b> and was ultimately use to develop a model of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump operation. The model of operation developed by the use of the simulation was computerised and used to predict the performance of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump installations. This computerised model was then used to provide the most comprehensive design charts yet created for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump, and was also used in the investigation of operational limits for the device. The study represents: the development of the first detailed simulation of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump and the most significant insight to date into the detail of operation of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump. The result of the study is the provision of an accurate method of pump calibration, an accurate method of pump performance prediction, and the first comprehensive design charts to be produced for the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> pump...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCatastrophic {{failure of a}} partially filled aircraft fuel cell due to impact and penetration by a high speed projectile often occurs due to a phenomenon known as <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram.</b> The structural response of the fuel tank walls to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> should be of vital concern to the designers of aircraft fuel cells. Considerable {{research has been conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> on metallic fuel cells, but very little attention has been given to fuel cells' made with the new advanced composite materials. The purpose of this research is to examine the various effects of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> on a graph ite/epoxy wall when subjected to penetration by a. 222 caliber projectile. Eight <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> tests are made on a clamped 11 -inch square plate 0. 06 ? inches thick at projectile velocities between 2600 and 2800 fps. The engineering properties of the laminate are determined both analytically and experimentally. The low velocity shots caused only slight damage to the plate. At the higher velocities, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>ram</b> caused considerable damage, including total severance of the plate from its clamped support over much of the outer perimeter. The results of this research illustrate the importance of the method of attachment of the com. posite wall at its boundaries. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
5|$|Scott Street bridge had {{gradually}} deteriorated, and {{a public}} consultation was held in 1986, to determine its future. By that time a 10-ton weight limit had been imposed on traffic using the bridge, because of its poor structural state. Three suggestions were made as to its future. These were to close and demolish it, to refurbish it at an estimated cost of £1.6million, and {{to build a new}} bridge on the same site but a different alignment, to eliminate the awkward turn at the west end, which was costed at £2million. None of these actions have been taken, as the bridge leaves were raised in 1994, and have remained raised ever since. Consideration was given in 2007 to preserving two of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> which operated the bridge, during planning to demolish the structure. The Hull Hydraulic Power Company was set up in 1872, and by 1876 was operating a pumping station on Machell Street. This supplied water to a high pressure main which ran from Wellington Street to Sculcoates Bridge, and was used by local industries to power machinery, including the bridge when it was constructed. Although the power company closed in the 1940s, it made Hull the first city in the world to have a public system of power distribution.|$|E
5|$|Warrior {{was ordered}} on 11 May 1859 from Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company in Blackwall, London. The ship was laid down {{some time after}} 6 June 1859 on the West Ham side of Bow Creek when the P ocean liner Seine was launched, and the slipway was {{reinforced}} to support Warriors weight. Full-scale production of the ship's iron began in August, and the construction probably began in mid-August. Indecision by the Admiralty and frequent design changes caused many delays and nearly drove her builders bankrupt before a grant of £50,000 was awarded to keep them solvent. Her launching on 29 December 1860 was during the coldest winter for 50 years. She was frozen to her slipway and required the use of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams,</b> additional tugs, and dockworkers running {{from side to side}} on the upper deck to rock her free. Warrior was commissioned in August 1861 to conduct her sea trials; she was completed on 24 October for £377,292, almost twice the cost of a contemporary wooden ship of the line. Between March and June 1862, defects exposed during her trials were rectified, and damage repaired. Changes included the fitting of a lighter bowsprit and a shorter jib boom, along with the provision of extra heads amidships.|$|E

25|$|During 1941 and 1942 the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> of the {{original}} lift, which had been left in place in a shaft beneath the dry dock, were removed to salvage the iron. During the 1950s and 1960s commercial traffic on British canals declined. By the 1970s the lift's traffic was almost entirely recreational and the lift was hardly used during winter months.|$|E
25|$|The Trustees {{asked their}} Chief Engineer, Edward Leader Williams, {{to draw up}} plans for a boat lift. He settled on a design {{involving}} a pair of water-filled caissons that would counterbalance one another and require relatively little power to lift boats up and down. A similar boat lift on the Grand Western Canal, completed in 1835, used chains to connect the caissons via an overhead balance wheel. It had a solid masonry superstructure to support {{the weight of the}} loaded caissons. Leader Williams realised that if he used water-filled <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> to support the caissons their weight would be borne by the rams and their cylinders, buried underground and a much lighter superstructure could be used. He may have been inspired by inspecting a hydraulic ship lift and graving dock at the Royal Victoria Dock in London, designed by experienced hydraulic engineer Edwin Clark.|$|E
25|$|By 1904 the Weaver Navigation Trustees {{faced the}} {{prospect}} of closing the boat lift for a considerable period to repair the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams.</b> They asked their Chief Engineer Colonel J. A. Saner, to investigate alternatives to hydraulic operation. Saner proposed electric motors and a system of counterweights and overhead pulleys {{that would allow the}} caissons to operate independently of each other. Although this solution involved many more moving parts than the hydraulic system, these would be above ground and accessible thus making maintenance easier and cheaper and having a longer working life. Other advantages of the conversion listed by Saner included a {{reduction in the number of}} operating attendants by one and the avoidance of costly boiler repairs. Saner promised to achieve the conversion with only three short periods of closure to traffic. This was important because it minimised disruption to traffic and the loss of revenue during conversion.|$|E

25|$|The spars are {{designed}} by C and fabricated by Offshore Spars. The standard boat has a keel stepped non-tapered double spreader masthead sloop rig, with rod rigging and a hydraulic backstay adjuster. the R and XL variants have a tapered triple-spreader mast with all rod rigging, plus runners, checkstays, and an adjustable babystay for mast bend control. The backstay is split, with two <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams,</b> on the boats with walk through transom (37+ and XL). The masthead, gooseneck and boom end are custom machined aluminum, welded {{to the one}} piece extrusion. The aerodynamic spreaders are secured to the mast via machined, continuous aluminum spreader bars. They precisely fit the spreader bases and traverse the mast and along with separate support bars carry the compression loads exerted by the shrouds. On the 37R (and 37XL) mast the middle and lower spreaders are slightly swept back, 2° for the middle spreaders, 4° for the lowers.|$|E
25|$|This updated and {{improved}} version was the Model B200, which entered production in 1981. It was fitted with PT6A-42 engines, still rated at , but with improvements {{that resulted in}} greater aircraft performance. Other changes included increased maximum pressurization (to 6.5 psi differential) and changes to the cockpit layout. The Model 200C {{gave way to the}} Model B200C the same year, with the first Model B200T and Model B200CT being modified from a B200 and B200C respectively, the following year. Commencing in 1984 the B200, B200C and their derivatives were fitted with a revised landing gear retraction mechanism, actuated by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>rams</b> powered by an electric pump installed in the LH wing. This replaced the earlier electro-mechanical retraction system of gearboxes, driveshafts and chains and sprockets that was a throwback to the Twin Bonanza. At the same time the propellers fitted were changed from 3-bladed Hartzells to 3-bladed McCauleys. Forty-seven B200Cs built that year were delivered to the U.S. military, with dozens more of a similar standard ordered in subsequent years, but not given official civil model designations.|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} with a movable floating pontoon. [...] Steel transition spans connect the two {{ends of the}} fixed bridge to the pontoon.

[...] The transition spans accommodate [...] of tide movement and [...] of pontoon movement. [...] In addition, the spans sit on a central pivot that assists with the movement caused by waves. [...] In the event that the transition spans are unable to bear the stress of movement of the pontoon, specifically in the case of seismic activity, the bridge has a breakaway feature that can be easily repaired.|$|E
