40|$|Surface waves methods {{exploit the}} {{dispersive}} properties of Rayleigh and Love waves {{to estimate the}} shear wave velocity profiles in vertically heterogeneous subsurfaces. Typically, they rely on a simplified one-dimensional (1 -D) analytical forward model where the lateral variation of the layer thickness is neglected {{and so is the}} fraction of the incident energy of the fundamental mode that is reflected or converted to higher modes. In this paper, we present a theoretical study that attempts to define an analytical model that overcomes the limitations of 1 -D forward models. In particular, we revisit properties of semi-analytical approaches that aim at solving the dynamics of Love waves in laterally heterogeneous media made of a soft upper layer of varying thickness lying over an infinitely deep hard layer. The novel analytical model stems from a local-mode <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> <b>waves</b> with laterally varying amplitudes, which allows for both reflections of the incident modes and coupling to higher modes. The best wave approximation stems from an Action principle that leads to a coupled system of second order ordinary differential equations for the wave amplitudes.
