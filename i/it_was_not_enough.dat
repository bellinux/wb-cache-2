Karthik scored 183 and 150 in the Duleep Trophy final against West Zone, becoming the third player after Lalchand Rajput and Yuvraj Singh to score centuries in both innings of a Duleep Trophy final. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> as Yusuf Pathan scored an unbeaten 210 from only 190 balls to set a new world record for a successful run-chase.|$|E

He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough,</b> calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
5|$|At the Portuguese Grand Prix Hill charged {{from the}} back of the grid to third, having stalled on the warm up lap from pole.

Prost finished the season as champion. Hill ended the season in Australia by setting the lap record for the Adelaide Street Circuit.

5|$|In the quarter-finals, Barcelona {{were drawn}} against their fellow leading-scorers in the competition, Bayern Munich, who had beaten Barcelona's group stage opposition, Sporting CP, 12–1 on {{aggregate}} {{in the previous}} round. However, despite Bayern's impressive scoring record, goals from Messi and Eto'o gave Barcelona a 2–0 lead within the first 12minutes. Messi and Henry also scored to seal a 4–0 home victory before half-time. The lack of an away goal meant Bayern Munich would have to win by five clear goals {{to qualify for the}} semi-finals. After a goalless first half, they took the lead through Franck Ribéry in the 47thminute, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> for Bayern as Keita equalised in the 73rdminute to clinch a 5–1 aggregate win for the Spanish side.|$|E
5|$|Iowa State {{took some}} {{outstanding}} players to Norman, {{but in the}} end <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to win. Quarterback Brent Meyer was the all-time leader in passing yards and total offense at ISU. He finished the season with the Cyclone record for career touchdowns as well. Meyer was complemented by wide receiver Todd Blythe who led the nation in career yards per catch (19.0) and was fifth on the career touchdown receptions list (25) before the game. ISU linebacker Alvin Bowen also led the nation in tackles per game this season and had 17against Nebraska. The special teams of the Cyclones was led by Ryan Baum who was averaging 18.0yards per punt return and had scored one touchdown.|$|E

He broke through for his first first-class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent an innings defeat. He scored 60 and took a match total of 5/102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season, {{but this was not}} enough for him to regain his Test position. He bowled with steady results throughout the season, never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match.|$|E

He made 107 in an innings triumph over Queensland and 106 in a drawn match against South Australia. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> for him to win a third Sheffield Shield title; New South Wales won for the fifth successive time, defeating Victoria in both of their matches. Loxton made little impact in his final match; although the Victorians defeated Queensland, his only participation was to score five runs in the first innings. His highest score remained the 232 not out he had made on his first-class debut.|$|E
5|$|Stan Collymore, Fowler's strike partner from 1995–97, {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside.

In the same season he scored twice in a 4–3 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> for Liverpool to clinch the title; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions.

A frustrated Emma slapped Paige, who retaliated with her signature Paige Turner. Yet, Emma became {{the first person to}} kick out of the Paige Turner. Paige responded by applying the Paige Tapout submission hold, which was enough for the victory when Emma submitted. Paige embraced Emma after the match.|$|E

Perhaps {{because there was no}} one to replace him and perhaps because he absorbed shafts that were aimed at the president, Davis retained him in the cabinet until the end of the war. After the surrender of Lee's army at Appomattox, Mallory remained with Davis and the other cabinet members as they fled deeper into the South, first to Danville, Virginia, then to Greensboro, North Carolina, Charlotte, Abbeville, South Carolina, and finally Washington, Georgia. There, Mallory submitted his resignation and went to La Grange, Georgia, where he was temporarily reunited with his wife and children.|$|E
5|$|Windle later {{combined}} with Wood, Ryan and Dickson in the 4×200m freestyle relay final. Having rested their two individual medalists—Wood and Windle—in the heats, Australia struggled to fourth place {{and were the}} slowest qualifier for the final. In the decider, Australia were fourth when Windle dived in for the anchor leg, 3.7s behind the third-placed Japan. Windle posted a time of 1min 58.7s, the sixth fastest split in the race and the fastest Australian leg by 3.0s. Although he made up 1.8s on the Japanese anchor swimmer, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> and Australia finished fourth, 1.9s out of the medals.|$|E

5|$|An {{increase}} in the trade union movement was an inevitable corollary of this and {{during the war years}} there was a considerable {{increase in}} the membership of the various unions. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to maintain wages largely as they were. Although the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8–12 per cent, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that industrial action followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and {{it has been estimated that}} between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and £4,785,607 in lost wages.|$|E
5|$|Doug Flutie {{made his}} NFL {{debut in the}} fourth quarter for the Chicago Bears. The Bears took an early 14–0 lead after Mike Tomczak's 37-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Willie Gault. The play occurred after Ervin Randle's recovery of a Calvin Thomas fumble was nullified due to an offsides penalty on Craig Swoope. While the Buccaneers' defense improved later in the game, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to overcome the problems of the injury-battered offense. Nathan Wonsley suffered a broken neck while making a tackle on the opening kickoff. This was followed by injuries to Jerry Bell, Phil Freeman, Craig Swoope, and Willie Gillespie. Calvin Magee played with a prior injury, as did James Wilder and Leonard Harris, though both were forced to leave the game. With Gerald Carter left as the only experienced receiver, the Bears keyed on him, and with Bell, Wonsley and Wilder out, the Buccaneers could not run.|$|E

Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly {{on the final day of}} the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he had thrown the match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>enough</b> to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.|$|E
