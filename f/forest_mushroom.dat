Beef, pork {{or a combination}} of both are most commonly used, with brisket, ribs, shank and chuck considered to give the most flavorful results, especially if cooked on a high flame.

Meat and bones are usually removed afterwards and the meat is only added back into the soup about 10–15 minutes before the borscht is done. Some recipes call for smoked meats, resulting in a distinctively smoky borscht, while others use poultry or mutton stock.

40|$|Ten {{agricultural}} wastes were tested for their suitability as substrates {{for the growth}} of cabbage seedlings. Spent <b>forest</b> <b>mushroom</b> compost (SFMC) and spent golden mushroom compost (SGMC) were found to be more suitable than raw spent <b>forest</b> <b>mushroom</b> growth medium (RFM), raw spent golden mushroom growth medium (RGM), rice hull, carbonized rice hull, peanut husk, coconut fiber, bagasse meal or wasted cotton. The optimum composting period for SFMC and SGMC was 10 and 6 weeks, respectively. A new container medium (SSC- 06) was formulated using SFMC, carbonized rice hull, shrimp and crab shell meal, blood waste, and lime. The SSC- 06 medium was suitable for growth of cabbage seedlings and was suppressive to Rhizoctonia solani AG- 4. The suppressive effect of 20 -day-old SSC- 06 medium on colonization of cabbage seeds by R. solani AG- 4 was reduced after it was steamed in 100 degrees C hot air for 15 similar to 30 min. However, the inhibitory effect was restored to the steamed SSC- 06 medium by inoculation with Trichoderma harzianum isolate TH- 05 at a concentration of 10 (5) cfu/g dry medium. After the medium was steamed for 5, 10, 15, 25 or 30 min, no fungal colonies were recovered, but the colony-forming units of the bacterial population were maintained at > 10 (6) /g dry medium.

In this study, the mycorrhizae of Craterellus tubaeformis in western Oregon is identified by DNA analysis using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) typing, and the mantle morphology is described. Host associations with western hemlock, Douglas-fir, and Sitka spruce are identified using the same molecular techniques, with Craterellus tubaeformis most commonly associated with western hemlock. Differences in genetic sequences and host associations between western North America, eastern North America, and. Europe are presented, and the possibility that variants of Craterellus. tubaeformis from the different geographies might deserve their own species epithets is discussed. The dependency of Craterellus tubaeformis on late seral stands and abundance of coarse woody debris was quantified by surveying 64 plots in the Coast and Cascade ranges of western Oregon. Logistic regression showed that the odds of Craterellus tubaeformis occurrence increased with stand age and coarse woody debris (CWD) volumes, however it is often found in younger stands. The likelihood of Craterellus tubaeformis occurrence in a stand was highly correlated to the presence of western hemlock. Linear regression analysis showed no significant relationships between stand age, CWD volume, slope, elevation, or aspect on Craterellus tubaeformis biomass productivity, though well-decayed CWD was the substrate for 88...|$|E
40|$|Mushrooms {{and fungi}} not only present a {{fascinating}} world of shapes, both macro- and microscopic, {{but they are}} also an interesting source of flavours, fragrances and odours, e. g. garlic, coconut, flour-like, cucumber or fruit-like, as well as the most characteristic for this kingdom of living organisms mushroom-like flavour and aroma. Fungi can possess many different and interesting flavours and fragrances - starting from nice anise-like, fruit-like, cucumber, garlic, to cheese-garlic, and ending with potato or flour-like smells. Some mushrooms emit carbide or distinctly faecal-like odour. The taste of mushrooms is frequently correlated with their aroma. What components does the core of a mushroom flavour consist of? Chemical analysis of specimens reveals compounds responsible for characteristic flavour and odour. It was found that the most characteristic flavour compound is defined mainly by C 8 volatiles. Between all C 8 compounds the most important for mushroom flavour are oct- 1 -en- 3 -ol, octan- 3 -ol, octan- 3 -on and oct- 1 -en- 3 -on. Fungi and mushrooms can enable biotechnological production of some flavour components, for instance the Nidula niveotomentosa produces a characteristic raspberries compound - raspberry ketone in submerged cultures; the biotechnological production can also provide rare and tasty <b>forest</b> <b>mushroom</b> biomass e. g. edible boletus.

40|$|Millions {{of tons of}} fungal spores are {{dispersed}} in {{the atmosphere}} every year. These living cells, along with plant spores and pollen grains, may act as nuclei for condensation of water in clouds. Basidiospores released by mushrooms form {{a significant proportion of}} these aerosols, particularly above tropical <b>forests.</b> <b>Mushroom</b> spores are discharged from gills by the rapid displacement of a droplet of fluid on the cell surface. This droplet is formed by the condensation of water on the spore surface stimulated by the secretion of mannitol and other hygroscopic sugars. This fluid is carried with the spore during discharge, but evaporates once the spore is airborne. Using environmental electron microscopy, we have demonstrated that droplets reform on spores in humid air. The kinetics of this process suggest that basidiospores are especially effective as nuclei for the formation of large water drops in clouds. Through this mechanism, mushroom spores may promote rainfall in ecosystems that support large populations of ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic basidiomycetes.
