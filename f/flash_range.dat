50|$|Artillery {{sound and}} <b>flash</b> <b>ranging</b> {{remained}} in use through World War II {{and in its}} latest forms until the present day, although flash spotting generally ceased in the 1950s due to the widespread adoption of flashless propellants and the increasing range of artillery. Mobile counterbattery radars able to detect guns, itself a MASINT radar sensor, became available in the late 1970s, although countermortar radars appeared in World War II. These techniques paralleled radio direction finding in SIGINT that started in World War I, using graphical bearing plotting and now, with the precision time synchronization from GPS, is often time-of-arrival.|$|R
50|$|While now {{primarily}} of historical interest, {{one of the}} first applications of acoustic and optical MASINT was locating enemy artillery by the sound of their firing and flashes respectively during World War I. Effective sound ranging was pioneered by the British Army under the leadership of the Nobel Lauriate William Bragg. Flash spotting developed in parallel in the British, French and German armies. The combination of sound ranging (i.e., acoustic MASINT) and <b>flash</b> <b>ranging</b> (i.e., before modern optoelectronics) gave information unprecedented for the time, in both accuracy and timeliness. Enemy gun positions were located within 25 to 100 yards, with the information coming in three minutes or less.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this series of {{experiments}} was to test methods available to the field army for tactical determination of atomic burst location and yield over enemy-held terrain. Preliminary analysis indicated that the systems that should be tested were sound ranging, seismic height of burst determination, photographic <b>flash</b> <b>ranging,</b> and Bhangmeter type systems for yield determination. Sound ranging was accomplished using standard equipment with modified techniques. Microphone arrays of dimensions which were small compared to the range were used to eliminate hyperbolic curvature corrections and to simplify meteorological corrections. A new system of meteorological corrections was employed. This system was based on approximating the maximum height reached "by the sound vhich ultimately passes across the microphone array. It was determined that this technique gave far greater accuracy than conventional techniques at these long ranges. Most accurate locations were obtained on air bursts. For air bursts at ranges from 20, 000 to 60, 000 meters, angular standard deviations of 13. 8 minutes of arc were obtained. For air bursts, the average radial location error expressed as per cent of range was 0. 61 per cent. It was estimated that in a tactical situation these locations could he computed in less than 30 minutes. Seismic height of burst determinations were attempted hy the heat seismic and the seismic velocity methods. Both methods depended upon the travel time of the shock wave {{from the point of}} origin to ground zero. The heat seismic method used in addition a seismic signal generated hy the heat radiated from the nuclear detonation, as postulated hy earlier investigators. The velocity seismic method utilized additional seismic shocks for a determination of seismic propagation constants. Conclusive evidence as to the feasibility of either seismic method was not obtained. Photographic <b>flash</b> <b>ranging</b> was accomplished using pinhole cameras and Polaroid film. The tactical requirement for speed in processing required the use of this film. The camera used was a modification of an experimental <b>flash</b> <b>ranging</b> camera /part of <b>Flash</b> <b>Ranging</b> Set AN/TVS- 1 (XE- 2) _ 7 with the conventional refractive optics replaced by a pinhole. A high speed shutter tripped hy a blue box was employed. It was determined experimentally that a given pinhole aperture with a fixed delay time provided photographs of the fireball with adequate resolution for accurate angular measurements over a wide range of yields and distances. Average angular accuracies of 0. 73 mils were obtained. It was estimated that ground zero locations and burst heights could be provided by this method under tactical conditions in 5 to 10 minutes. Conventional Bhangpeters furnished yield determinations under non-line-of-sight conditions at ranges out to UO miles with an accuracy of the order of 20 per cent or better. Attempts to utilize a Bhangmeter type instrument with a lead sulfide cell detector indicated that extensive investigation would be required to establish the correlation between yield and time to minimum in the light intensity-time curve for the spectral response of the lead sulfide cell. Attempts to modify a Mark III Type Bhangmeter by substituting a lead sulfide cell for the photo cell made possible successful time of flight measurements on the 260 mm gun when firing conventional ammunition. Design parameters were established for such a time of flight measuring equipment...|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, the Olympus OM-4T (Japan) {{introduced}} {{a system that}} could synchronize a specially dedicated accessory Olympus F280 Full Synchro electronic flash to pulse its light at a 20 kilohertz rate for up to 40 ms, to illuminate its horizontal FP shutter's slit as it crossed the entire film gate - in effect, simulating long-burn FP flashbulbs - allowing flash exposure at shutter speeds as fast as 1/2000 s.

The OM-4Ti also introduced a new electronic flash-control system. Normally focal-plane shutters are limited in their maximum flash synchronization speed, {{because of the way}} they provide fast shutter speeds - timing the second shutter curtain to close more quickly after the first shutter curtain opens. This causes a narrowing of the slit [...] "wiping" [...] the exposure on the film. In effect, a horizontal focal-plane shutter made of cloth is only fully open and usable for flash exposure up to 1/60s. Any faster and a typical one-millisecond flash burst would only partially expose the film - the part open to the slit. The OM-4Ti overcame this problem by having the new Olympus F280 Full Synchro flash pulse its light continuously over 40 milliseconds, long enough to illuminate the slit as it crossed the entire focal plane, even at shutter speeds as fast as 1/2000s. There is, however, a concomitant loss of <b>flash</b> <b>range.</b> [...] A black-finished version of the OM-4T came out in 1990, listing for $1250 (the natural finished body remained available for $1200).|$|E

Test results revealed that the antiscalant was successful in controlling scale formation at these conditions. It was noticed that a test period of only three months was too short to observe the impact of variation in seawater temperature and suspended solids on the effectiveness of the antiscalant. Accordingly an evaluation test was planned and carried out in one of Al-Jubail Phase II distillers to investigate the antiscalant effectiveness for a prolonged test period at a TBT of 90. 6 oC and a dose rate of 0. 8 PPM.

40|$|Intensive energy {{consumption}} and concentrate management are major issues for desalination at inland areas. This work addresses these issues by examining a systems approach for desalination. The systems approach, called zero discharge desalination, combines multiple desalination processes and brine concentration with salinity gradient solar pond (SGSP) technology. In the zero discharge system, the concentrate from desalination processes is reused by solar ponds thereby negating brine disposal, and the solar ponds provide renewable {{energy to the}} desalination and brine concentration processes. ^ A multi-effect multi stage (MEMS) desalination unit, a membrane distillation (MD) unit, and a brine concentration and recovery system (BCRS) were tested with the heat generated from the El Paso Solar Pond. The MEMS unit with three-effects and four stages was effectively operated at a first stage vapor temperature range of 60 ∼ 75 °C, and at high concentration ratio. This unit produced high quality distillate with a total dissolved solids level of less than 5 mg/liter. Its distillate production rate ranged from 1. 6 to 5. 0 liter/min, and was significantly affected by <b>flash</b> <b>range,</b> concentration of reject brine, and first effect circulation rate. No significant scaling and fouling were found during the tests. ^ An air gap MD unit with a membrane area of 2. 94 m 2 was tested with feedwaters in which salinity ranged from 0 to 19 %, and operated with variable warm side temperature, transmembrane temperature drop, and circulation flow rate. The distillate flux ranged from 1 to 6 kg/m 2 -hr, and was strongly affected by the transmembrane temperature drop, instead of the warm side temperature. This observation suggests that heat transfer is the limiting factor for the flux rather than vapor diffusion. The MD unit can produce high quality distillate, however, membrane wetting has {{a major impact on}} the quality of product water. ^ The BCRS uses moderate temperature heat to drive evaporative concentration of saline water, and recovers some fresh water. Slurry salt was produced by the BCRS unit, and recharged into the solar pond along with saturated brine. ^ The operational experience and technical advancements of salinity gradient solar pond technology are also presented in this work. ...|$|E

When the ISI was 240 ms, this interaction was weak. These results suggest two hypotheses. Firstly, the relation of retinal locations of flashes is a strong cue for perceiving the flash locations when the ISI is shorter than about 120 ms. Secondly, the process of perceiving or memorizing a flash location requires some time. Therefore, the perceived location of the succeeding flash affects that of the preceding flash when the ISI as shorter than about 120 ms...|$|R

40|$|Scale {{formation}} {{represents a}} major operational problem encountered in thermal desalination plants. In current installed plants, {{and to allow}} for a reasonable safety margin, sulfate scale deposition limits the top brine temperature (TBT) in multi-stage flash (MSF) distillers up to 110 - 112 oC. This has significant effect on the unit capital, operational and water production cost. In this work, the influence of nanofiltration (NF) pretreatment on the scale deposition potential and increasing TBT in MSF thermal desalination plants is modeled on the basis of mass transfer with chemical reaction of solutes in the brine. Full and partial NF-pretreatment of the feed water were investigated. TBT can be increased in MSF by increasing the percentage of NF-treated feed. Full NF pretreatment of the make-up allows TBT in the MSF plant to be raised up to 175 oC in the case of di hybrid NF-MSF and up to 165 oC in the case of tri hybrid NF-RO-MSF.

The KSC Lightning Research Database (KLRD) was created to reduce manual data entry time and aid research by combining information from various data sources into a single record for each unique lightning event of interest. The KLRD uses automatic data handling functions to import data from a lightning detection network and identify and record lighting events of interest. Additional automatic functions import data from the NASA Buoy 41009 (located approximately 20 miles off the coast) and the KSC Electric Field Mill network, then match these electric field mill values to the corresponding lightning events.

The National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) has been in operation since 1989. The NLDN is currently composed of a mixture of magnetic direction finders (DFs) and time-of-arrival (TOA) sensors which locate cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes as well as measure their polarity, peak current, and multiplicity. A monthly climatology for the contiguous United States was created for the six years of data to establish an "average year". Analysis was completed for the mean values and interannual variability of several lightning parameters: ground flash density, positive ground flash density, percentage positive lightning, multiplicity, and median first-stroke peak currents. In addition to these lightning characteristics, correlation between monthly lightning and precipitation was analyzed in different areas throughout the country. The 1989 - 1994 mean monthly maximum values were analyzed. Maximum monthly ground <b>flash</b> density values <b>ranged</b> from 0. 050 km- 2 in December along the southern Mississippi Valley to 2. 96 km- 2 in July in central Florida. Similarly, positive ground <b>flash</b> density values <b>ranged</b> from 0. 0068 km- 2 in December in eastern Texas to 0. 12 km- 2 in July in northern Kansas. In the percentage positive lightning field a persistent protrusion, with locally higher values, appeared from Minnesota southwestward into Colorado from April through August. Mean monthly percentage positive lightning was highest in December at 16. 0 % and lowest in August at 3. 0 %. The mean monthly negative multiplicity ranged from 2. 32 in February to 2. 78 in June. The mean monthly positive multiplicity ranged from 1. 26 in December to 1. 35 in July. Geographically, the monthly maxima for the negative multiplicity field were generally found along the Gulf Coastal states, especially in Florida during the summer months.
