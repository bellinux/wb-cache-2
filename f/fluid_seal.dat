In {{order to meet the}} static seal requirements of large gap in aviation, aerospace, metallurgy, and so on, we set up the experimental rig of magnetic fluid static seal and designed the static seal of magnetic fluid. In the experimental rig, we studied the static seal of magnetic fluid and obtained the relationships among the burst pressure and the amount of injection of magnetic <b>fluid,</b> <b>seal</b> gap, temperature and magnetization in the experimental rig.

40|$|AbstractDemands of ultra-precision {{machining}} {{systems have}} recently increased for machining three dimensional nano-geometries. Such systems require not only horizontal positioning systems but also vertical positioning systems with a nanometer positioning accuracy. However, the gravity load of moving mass negatively affects the positioning accuracy {{especially in a}} vertical positioning system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} compensate the influence of the gravity load for vertical ultra-precision positioning. Although the gravity compensation method using a non-contact vacuum cylinder has been proposed, it is difficult to improve the sealing performance of the non-contact seal. Thus, this study proposes the magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> for linear motion system with a gravity compensator. In general, magnetic fluid seals have been applied to rotary motion systems, however there are few studies on linear motion systems so far. When a magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is applied to linear motion systems, the magnetic fluid leaks out of the seal clearance due to the movement, and it cannot keep the performance as a seal. In this study, it is possible to prevent leaking the magnetic fluid from the seal clearance and also to maintain the performance of the seal by holding a magnetic fluid by the two pole pieces shaped tapered tip and putting it near the piston made of non-magnetic material and coated with oil repellent layer. The proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> performance has been evaluated. As a result, the result confirmed that the proposed magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> is useful as a linear motion seal, and the oil repellent layer on the piston surface can largely improve the sealing performance...|$|E

A magnetic <b>fluid</b> secondary <b>seal</b> traps any vapors that leak past the primary mechanical seal. This arrangement requires no external support equipment other than venting the vapors to a suitable disposal or recovery system. Magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> have provided hermetic sealing for various gas applications over the last 20 years. One common use is as exclusion seals for magnetic disk drives. Adaptation of this technology to centrifugal pump applications required an extensive development effort. Laboratory tests show maximum emission rates of less than 3. 0 ppm of organic vapors.

40|$|In the paper, {{a motion}} of {{magnetic}} nanoparticles {{in a high}} gradient magnetic field and its correlation with {{the characteristics of the}} magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> are numerically studied. The neutral curve defining a range of parameters, where the liquid keeps fluidity, is found.

It is found that at a high enough value of magnetic field the area of close-packed particles is formed under the pole tip. Numerical simulation has shown that with some values of the parameters it is possible to decrease the magnetic particles' concentration essentially so that the basic fluid leaks out from the seal under gravity, i. e. the magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> fails.

40|$|Background: The <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> of supraglottic airway devices (SGA) {{protects the}} airway from fluid contamination. We {{evaluated}} {{the suitability of}} indicator dye placement in the upper digestive tract of anesthetized patients combined with fiberoptical tracing to investigate the <b>fluid</b> <b>seal</b> of SGA. Methods: Patients swallowed a capsule of indigo carmine green (ICG) prior to induction of anaesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, one of two different SGA (either an i-Gel™ or an LMA-Supreme ™ (LMA-S)) was inserted after randomization. Methylene blue stained normal saline was injected through the proximal opening of drainage tube during mechanical ventilation as well as spontaneous breathing. We monitored regurgitation of ICG with a flexible fiberscope (FO) inserted through the drainage tube and checked for the appearance of methylene blue in the mask bowl with the FO inserted through the airway tube. Results: In thirty-six patients with an i-Gel ™ and 37 with a LMA-S no regurgitation of ICG was observed {{at the level of}} the upper oeso-phageal sphincter (UES). Methylene blue stained saline was not visible in any patient during pressure-controlled venti-lation, but was detected in two of the 36 patients with the i-Gel ™ during spontaneous breathing.

40|$|For the {{low-speed}} magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals,</b> {{the influence}} of the meridional flow, induced by the shaft rotation, on the distribution of magnetic particles concentration, is studied.

It is discovered that even very slow rotation of the shaft homogenises distribution of the magnetic particles concentration in the seal and thereby enlarges its operation life.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{properties of}} magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> installed in rotary sealing nodes which {{operate in the}} utility water environment. Seals of this type have been examined as a possible {{solution to the problem}} with ship manoeuvring propulsion sealing. The present analysis bases on laboratory durability tests of magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> exposed to longterm utility water loads, at different water pressures and shaft revolutions. The basic seal durability criterion was the number of revolutions made by the sealing node shaft until the appearance of water tightness loss (leakage). It was found that the main factor leading to the wear of the seal is the relative speed of the magnetic fluid with respect to that of the utility water, and this process is heavily affected by the pressure acting on the seal. The reported test results are presented in the form of diagrams showing the seal durability (time until water tightness loss) as a function of rotational speed. The curves shown in the diagrams are regular, with two different rotational speed ranges: the highspeed range, when the tightness loss is relatively fast, and the low-speed range, with a clear tendency to prolong the seal lifetime. These diagrams were given the name of durability curves of the MF seal operating in water. The results of the performed tests suggest formal similarity between the experimental data distribution concerning tightness loss processes occurring in magnetic <b>fluid</b> <b>seals</b> operating in water environment and metal fatigue processes.
