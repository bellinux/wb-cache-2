The sexes are very similar in appearance. Some males have a dark brown iris and some females have a reddish-brown iris, but this small difference is not always reliable as a <b>gender</b> <b>indicator.</b> The blue-eyed cockatoo is easily mistaken for the yellow-crested and sulphur-crested cockatoos, but has a more rounded crest with more white to the frontal part, and a brighter blue eye-ring. The Blue-eyed cockatoo reaches full maturity after 4 years and lives an average of 50 years.|$|E

These results are robust to the inclusion of household-level unobservables. However, productivity differences depend on the type of <b>gender</b> <b>indicator</b> used, crop-specific samples, agroecological region, and inclusion of biophysical characteristics. More nuanced gender data collection and analysis in agricultural research spanning diverse regions are encouraged to identify interventions that will increase productivity and program effectiveness for male and female farmers.

As stimuli we used images of morphs created between pairs of male/female 3 -D head laser scans. In experiment 1, texture and shape were morphed between both faces. In experiment 2, either the average texture of all faces was mapped onto the shape continuum between the two faces or we mapped the texture continuum between each face pair onto an average shape face. Thus, either the shape or the texture remained constant in any one condition. The subjects viewed these morphs first in a discrimination task (XAB) {{and then in a}} categorisation task which was used to locate the subjective gender boundary between each male/female face pair. Although we found that subjects could categorise the face images by their gender in the categorisation task and that texture alone is a better <b>gender</b> <b>indicator</b> than shape alone, the subjects did not discriminate more easily between face images situated at the category boundary in any of our discrimination experiments.

40|$|The sex {{differential}} in health-related behaviors is well established. What is {{less clear}} is precisely how health behavioral differences vary within sex groups. This dissertation looked {{through the lens of}} gender to explore within-sex health behavior differentials. Taking a social constructionist position, I argued that health behaviors are gendered enactments. Due to a combination of individual agency, structural opportunities and constraints, people construct gender in myriad ways. I therefore expected to find gendered health behavior variation among men and among women, perhaps as much as has been found between the sexes. ^ In this cross-sectional analysis (1995 - 6 National Survey of Mid-life in the U. S., N= 3, 690), a number of different <b>gender</b> <b>indicators</b> were used to interrogate this idea. I examined two individual level indicators: attitudes about gender and gendered personality traits. And since people use gender to guide social interactions within institutions, I looked within two highly gendered institutions, paid employment and the family. I also examined how the intersection between my individual level and institutional <b>gender</b> <b>indicators</b> affected health-related behaviors. The health behaviors in this study included self-care and medical check-ups, and the risk behaviors included risky sexual behavior and several substance abuse measures. ^ The findings showed that my four measures of gender were far more widely associated with risk behavior than health behavior, especially among women. Additionally, the gendered institutions were more widely associated with the health-related behaviors than the individual level gender measures. Not only were the health-related relationships to the family and paid employment more widespread than those to attitudes about gender and gendered personality traits, but the strength of these associations were often relatively strong. ^ As expected, the individual level <b>gender</b> <b>indicators</b> showed that nontraditionally oriented women were more likely than traditionally oriented women to engage in a variety of risk behaviors, such as cigarette smoking, risky alcohol and drug use, risky sexual behavior, and leading an overall riskier health lifestyle. But the interactions between attitudes about gender and family structure indicated these associations to risk behavior were exacerbated when nontraditionally oriented women also had family responsibilities. Under these circumstances, nontraditional women 2 ̆ 7 s engagement in physical activity was also diminished. ^ Nontraditionally oriented men on the whole did not behave quite as healthily as traditional men in this study. However, in circumstances where men with egalitarian attitudes hold occupations that are feminine or sex-balanced, their engagement in health-positive behavior was greater than that of men with traditional attitudes about gender doing the same type of work. One possible explanation for these findings is that when a misalignment occurs between an individual 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes about gender and her or his involvement in gendered institutions, role strain is the result. This tension may manifest itself in less engagement in health-positive behaviors. ...|$|R

This distinction leads to the conclusion that in addition to the recognised markers for gender - genitalia, gonads and chromosomes - we may need to also include the BSTc, given that this current research seems to substantiate what transsexuals are saying about their gender.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} {{contribute}} to the debate on gender equality and water within the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs 5 and 6. Farmers organizations are often considered key stakeholders whose participation should be fostered to achieve a good water governance in agriculture and irrigation programs. Nonetheless, many water management interventions tackle participation as an instrumental and formal process. A common assumption is that granting sufficient space for women in water management will automatically ensure a greater gender empowerment. Nevertheless, often low importance is given to assessing who really actively participates and benefits from water development projects, favoring the technical aspects. This paper addresses the articulation between gender, water management and indicators, using male, female and mixed farmer organizations as touchstones in three regions of Senegal. The authors defines a system of water <b>gender</b> <b>indicators</b> grouped into five sections. The first results show more similarities between mixed and female organizations, while the main gender inequalities are visible in the water technique and economic domains. Thanks to this study, we can see how a gender-based analysis may allow to more deeply understand some more or less “hidden” water governance mechanisms and their related implications in terms of project management and policy making...|$|R

Over {{fifty percent of the}} dietary protein requirements of coastal communities are derived from municipal fisheries and shallow coastal habitats (reef fishes, marine plants and mangroves). Coastal populations are young and expanding at rates that exceed regional and national averages. Expanding human pressures and man-made disturbances (over harvesting, destructive fishing, siltation etc.) that offset natural processes are destroying habitats and creating protein food security crises and increasing malnutrition. At the same time conflicts among users of coastal resources are escalating. Access constraints, gender inequities and cultural barriers stymie options for women and men to plan their families and create alternative livelihoods. National and local government agencies are addressing food security concerns through vertical policies and programs (e. g., fisheries management, integrated coastal management).
