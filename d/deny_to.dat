25|$|Iconodules further {{argued that}} {{decisions}} {{such as whether}} icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved {{the issue of the}} proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to <b>deny</b> <b>to</b> God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor, since portraits of the emperor were common and the iconoclasts did not oppose them.|$|E

Peace negotiations went on {{at the same time as}} these minor events until Parliament issued an aggressive ultimatum. That ultimatum fixed the war-like purpose of the still vacillating court at Nottingham, and in the country at large, to convert many thousands of waverers to active Royalism.|$|E

25|$|The cost of {{insurance}} has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for healthcare reform has been {{the development of the}} medical–industrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to <b>deny</b> <b>to</b> people based on economic status. The motivation behind healthcare reform in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care. The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and a fine line between government and industry within it. Likewise, critiques {{of insurance}} markets being conducted under a capitalistic, free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare.|$|E

500|$|For {{much of the}} {{sixty years}} {{preceding}} the Brown case, race relations in the United States had been dominated by racial segregation. This policy had been endorsed in 1896 by the United States Supreme Court case of Plessy v.

500|$|In construing {{the concept}} of {{equality}} in Article 12, the Court held that equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Chief Justice Yong Pung How arrived at this conclusion by considering the history that underpinned the notion of equality. The Court traced the origin of Article 12 back to the 40th article of the Magna Carta which reads, [...] "To none will we sell, to none will we <b>deny,</b> <b>to</b> none will we delay right or justice." ...|$|E

Julian Goodman, president of NBC, stated that Agnew had made an [...] "appeal to prejudice... it is regrettable that the Vice President of the United States should <b>deny</b> <b>to</b> TV freedom of the press". Frank Stanton, head of CBS, accused Agnew of trying to intimidate the news media, and his news anchor, Walter Cronkite, agreed. The speech was praised by conservatives from both parties, and gave Agnew a following among the right. Agnew deemed the Des Moines speech one of his finest moments.|$|E

[...] In the letter, {{the word is}} underlined, {{and at the top}} of the document is written: [...] "SS-Untersturmführer Kirschnek!" [...] There was a very clear policy in the architecture office that words such as [...] "gas chamber" [...] should not be used; Second Lieutenant Kirschnek should be informed of this slip. Citing this unique letter, Robert Jan van Pelt states that in using [...] "special action" [...] or [...] "special treatment" [...] in place of extermination and killing, the first Holocaust deniers were the Nazis themselves, in that they attempted to <b>deny</b> <b>to</b> themselves what they were doing.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was addressed by Justice Field in Wong Wing v. United States (1896). He observed {{with respect to the}} phrase [...] "within its jurisdiction": [...] "The term 'person,' used in the Fifth Amendment, is broad enough to include any and every human being within the jurisdiction of the republic. A resident, alien born, is entitled to the same protection under the laws that a citizen is entitled to. He owes obedience to the laws of the country in which he is domiciled, and, as a consequence, he is entitled to the equal protection of those laws. ... The contention that persons within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the bar—in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that no State shall <b>deny</b> <b>to</b> any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1998 {{decision}} Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong, the Court of Appeal {{regarded the}} concept of equality {{as a component of}} the wider doctrine of the rule of law, and traced its origin to the 40th article of the Magna Carta of 1215 which states: [...] "To none will we sell, to none will we <b>deny,</b> <b>to</b> none will we delay right or justice." [...] Article 12(1) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying [...] "to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws", and to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which bars the state from denying [...] "to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India". Article 12(1) is identical to Article 8(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia, from which it was adopted following Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965.|$|E
500|$|Vindication {{of federal}} {{constitutional}} rights {{are limited to}} those situations where there is [...] "state action" [...] meaning action of government officials who are exercising their governmental power. In Ex parte Virginia (1880), the Supreme Court found that the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment [...] "have reference to actions of the political body denominated by a State, by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken. A State acts by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in no other way. The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that no agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall <b>deny</b> <b>to</b> any person within its jurisdiction the {{equal protection of the}} laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State." ...|$|E

[...] At that time, the meaning of equality varied from one state to another.|$|E
