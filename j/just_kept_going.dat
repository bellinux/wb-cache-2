25|$|Kent, as expected, beat Glamorgan, {{but were}} worried on occasion. Having been shaken early on as Glamorgan dug out four early wickets, Kent were lifted by a 267-run {{partnership}} between Darren Stevens (who made 208) and Andrew Hall (133) which helped them {{along the way}} to a final first-innings score of 587, with Min Patel taking 55 balls for a 64 from number nine. Six Glamorgan players were then out in single figures, Amjad Khan taking three for 68, but number three David Hemp stood tall with an unbeaten 171. Glamorgan were 188 for 9 at one point on day two, but survived to stumps to 236 for 9, and <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going</b> - their number 11, Huw Waters, made 34 from 192 balls, and he added 118 with Hemp, for the second-highest stand of the match.|$|E
500|$|Fossett's {{interest}} in adventure began early. As a Boy Scout, {{he grew up}} climbing the mountains of California, beginning with the San Jacinto Mountains. [...] "When I was 12 years old I climbed my first mountain, and I <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going,</b> taking on more diverse and grander projects." [...] Fossett {{said that he did}} not have a natural gift for athletics or team sports, so he focused on activities that required persistence and endurance. His father, an Eagle Scout, encouraged Fossett to pursue these types of adventures and encouraged him to become involved with the Boy Scouts early. He became an active member of Troop 170 in Orange, California. At age 13, Fossett earned the Boy Scouts' highest rank of Eagle Scout. He was a Vigil Honor member of the Order of the Arrow, the Boy Scouts' honor society, where he served as lodge chief. He also worked as a Ranger at Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico during the summer of 1961. Fossett said in 2006 that Scouting was the most important activity of his youth.|$|E

While a student at FGC Warri, he engaged himself in rap battles and developed a friendlier relationship with like-minded students, which led to the formation of the hip hop group G-Squad. The group soon began performing at various talent shows in Delta State. Music remained their unmatched and true passion. In a 2012 interview with Thisday news, Yung6ix recalled, [...] "My love for music was so deep and I <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> on <b>going</b> till it got to a level they had to accept me for who I am. Funny though, the first song I recorded at school was used with my WAEC lesson fee to pay for the instrumentals and remember always having to trek from school to studio for close to 2 hours or more.

I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they <b>just</b> <b>kept</b> <b>going.</b> If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, it was something to remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E

On 2 February, flying his ninth assigned aircraft in eight months duty, Hartney destroyed a Halberstadt D.II over Lille. Twelve days later, Hartney was tasked with a photographic reconnaissance mission near Passchendaele. With observer W. T. Jourdan aboard, and escorted by another FE.2, Hartney found himself under attack by seven German Albatros D.III fighter planes. Then, as Hartney later wrote, [...] "...the right rear enemy ship...took a swoop at us. His tracer bullets were playing about us for fully two seconds before Jourdan finally let him have both guns right in the face.

Other responses (31 %) described certain activities and topics during which the students felt successful, including when they worked on the solar cars, solar panels, motors, pulling up a basket with cubes, and measuring voltage and amps with multi-meters. Finally, three students explained that they felt successful because they were very interested in science and held high science competence beliefs, or had been successful on similar tasks in the past. For example, when asked to describe what made him feel successful, one student responded that he already felt confident on task components: “I like building Legos.

40|$|Due to a rapid {{increase}} in aging population, demand for personalized health care increases proportionally. Personalized patient data can be a helpful way of catering the needs and requirements of elderly people staying at home. Indirectly, {{it can be a}} manner of providing better eHealth services according to their needs. Another interesting aspect of providing better personalized eHealth services is to make patient information systems interoperable. Interoperability of eHealth systems is an issue of great concern to current research and development but in this study, we focus on patient information systems. Like in some other European countries, introduction of open source platform to achieve interoperability and personalization of patient information system could save money for health care organizations and make the procedure easier in Sweden also. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify what standards are available for interoperability and what are the benefits and challenges of introducing open source systems for achieving personalized interoperable patient information systems (PIPIS). In light of this investigation, author has identified the benefits and challenges of introducing OSS for achieving PIPIS. Author has also made several recommendations regarding the challenges identified. In the name of ALLAH, the most gracious and merciful.
