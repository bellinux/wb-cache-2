Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. <b>I</b> <b>stuck</b> to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E

500|$|In {{his early}} years, Russell {{struggled}} {{to develop his}} skills as a basketball player. Although Russell was a good runner and jumper and had large hands, he simply {{did not understand the}} game and was cut from the team in junior high school. As a freshman at McClymonds High School in Oakland, California, Russell was almost cut again. However, coach George Powles saw Russell's raw athletic potential and encouraged him to work on his fundamentals. Since Russell's previous experiences with white authority figures were often negative, he was delighted to receive warm words from his white coach. He worked hard and used the benefits of a growth spurt to become a decent basketball player, {{but it was not until}} his junior and senior years that he began to excel, winning back to back high school state championships. Russell soon became noted for his unusual style of defense. He later recalled, [...] "To play good defense... it was told back then that you had to stay flatfooted at all times to react quickly. When I started to jump to make defensive plays and to block shots, I was initially corrected, but <b>I</b> <b>stuck</b> with it, and it paid off." [...] Russell, in an autobiographical account, notes while on a California High School All-Stars tour, he became obsessed with studying and memorizing other players’ moves (e.g., footwork such as which foot they moved first on which play) as preparation for defending against them, which including practicing in front of a mirror at night. Russell further described himself as an avid reader of Dell Magazines' 1950s sports publications, which he used to scout opponents' moves for the purpose defending against them.|$|E

I have always had a 'thing' for princesses (my parents used to joke that when I was smaller, I did a lot of insisting that my 'real' parents, the king and queen, were going to come get me soon, and that everyone had better start being a LOT nicer to me) so <b>I</b> <b>stuck</b> a princess in the book just for kicks... and VOILÀ!

Don Rosa, a subsequent cartoonist of Donald Duck, described his placement of the imaginary town: [...] "I won't bother to say precisely where I situated Duckburg and Calisota on America's west coast... but if you get out a good map and compare the coastline, you'll see that <b>I</b> <b>stuck</b> the old gold-prospector's adopted hometown directly across the bay from a very appropriately named actual city." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 2, 2015, Gunn {{announced}} {{on social media}} that he had completed {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, and that the film's title would not simply be Guardians of the Galaxy 2. The same week, he confirmed the return of Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, and Cooper as Gamora, Drax, and Rocket, respectively. At the end of the month, Gunn announced the film's title as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, saying he [...] "came up with a LOT of titles for Vol. 2.

2500|$|The {{partnership}} {{ended in}} 1955 with {{the comic book}} industry beset by self-imposed censorship, negative publicity, and a slump in sales. Simon [...] "wanted {{to do other things}} and <b>I</b> <b>stuck</b> with comics," [...] Kirby recalled in 1971. [...] "It was fine. There was no reason to continue the partnership and we parted friends." [...] Simon turned primarily to advertising and commercial art, while dipping back into comics on occasion. The Simon and Kirby team reunited briefly in 1959 with Simon writing and collaborating on art for Archie Comics, where the duo updated the superhero the Shield in the two-issue The Double Life of Private Strong (June–Aug. 1959), and Simon created the superhero the Fly; they went on to collaborate on the first two issues of The Adventures of the Fly (Aug.–Sept. 1959), and Simon and other artists, including Al Williamson, Jack Davis, and Carl Burgos, did four issues before Simon moved on to work in commercial art.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the urging}} of a Crestwood salesman, Kirby and Simon {{launched}} their own comics company, Mainline Publications, securing a distribution deal with Leader News in late 1953 or early 1954, subletting space from their friend Al Harvey's Harvey Publications at 1860 Broadway. Mainline, which existed from 1954 to 1955, published four titles: the Western Bullseye: Western Scout; the war comic Foxhole, since EC Comics and Atlas Comics were having success with war comics, but promoting theirs as being written and drawn by actual veterans; In Love, since their earlier romance comic Young Love was still being widely imitated; and the crime comic Police Trap, which claimed {{to be based on}} genuine accounts by [...] law-enforcement officials. After the duo rearranged and republished artwork from an old Crestwood story in In Love, Crestwood refused to pay the team, who sought an audit of Crestwood's finances. Upon review, the pair's attorney's stated the company owed them $130,000 for work done over the past seven years. Crestwood paid them $10,000 in addition to their recent delayed payments. The partnership between Kirby and Simon had become strained. Simon left the industry for a career in advertising, while Kirby continued to freelance.
