5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started but <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
500|$|The fact is, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> very involved, six {{or seven}} years ago, and before that, in {{questions}} of taxonomy of genre, and in the idea—which is ultimately a political idea—that a given writer, perhaps me, could in some objective way alter or reorganize the boundaries between genres.... Nowadays, I've come to feel that talking about categories, about [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", about genre and their boundaries and the blurring of those boundaries, all consists only of an elaborate way to avoid actually discussing what moves and interests me about books—my own, and others'. What I like are books in their homely actuality—the insides of the books, the mysterious movements of characters and situations and the emotions that accompany those movements. The play of sentences, their infinite variety.|$|E
500|$|Following {{completion}} of the album, Fagen entered therapy and more-or-less dropped out of public sight. In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, he writes that [...] "the panic attacks <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as a kid returned, only now accompanied by morbid thoughts and paranoia, big-time." [...] He remained paralyzed {{for much of the}} rest of the 1980s, [...] "gobbling antidepressants" [...] and nearly unable to get through each day. He came to view The Nightfly as the culmination of [...] "whatever kind of energy was behind the writing I had been doing in the '70s." [...] He turned down requests for television performances, opting only for radio and press interviews. Though he suggested he may do smaller concerts in New York, Fagen did not tour behind The Nightfly. He expounded upon his mental state after the album's completion: ...|$|E

500|$|I don't {{want people}} being crushed. I want the joy that <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> seeing Godzilla toss a tank {{without having to}} think there are guys in the tank… What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] In my case, I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
2500|$|Mark E. Smith was a Glitter fan. [...] "I {{was really}} into Gary Glitter, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> bad-mouthed for it. It was like 'You've {{got to be}} into David Bowie or Yes– Gary Glitter's just tripe'. And I was going 'It's fuckin' great. It's avant-garde... Well, two drummers and all that– it was really percussive. It was the only decent thing around", the Fall {{frontman}} said in 1993, speaking to NME.|$|E
2500|$|Parker was {{inspired}} to take up various creative endeavours at a young age, [...] "I used to draw a lot when I was very young, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the most immense feeling of satisfaction from finishing a picture and looking back at it, even though I wasn't actually that good. When I started playing music I got the same feeling from making a song, {{even if it was}} just a few noises or drum patterns put together. It was all about the buzz from making something from nothing. Music always affected me greatly as a listener anyway, usually from listening to music in my dad's car or listening to him play guitar." ...|$|E
2500|$|Courtneidge later {{recalled}} {{of her first}} years on the halls, [...] "When I started, my name was in such small print you could hardly read it. Music hall is the toughest thing in the world. ... <b>I</b> often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the bird, and I've had pennies thrown at me many a time."

2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} legal hearings, residents testified how: [...] "If {{you walked}} {{right behind the}} factory it was like cotton. It was in {{the cracks in the}} pavement behind the factory;" [...] and: [...] "It used to be blue-white. We used to sweep this blue dust up. It was blue fluffy stuff... <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{up in the morning and}} the other side of the street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers." [...] Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: [...] "The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was like snow fall." [...] Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: [...] "Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust." [...] During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Butler told Mojo {{magazine}} that the song [...] "Paranoid" [...] was [...] "about depression, because I didn't {{really know the}} difference between depression and paranoia. It's a drug thing; when you're smoking a joint you get totally paranoid about people, you can't relate to people. There's that crossover between the paranoia you get when you're smoking dope and the depression afterwards." [...] In 2015 Butler elaborated further to Dave Everly of Classic Rock: [...] "I used to be a cutter. I'd cut my arms, stick pins through my fingers, that kind of thing. [...] <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> really depressed and {{it was the only thing}} that could bring me out of it. If Sabbath hadn't made it, I'd have been long dead. I'd have killed myself." [...] According to Mick Wall's book Black Sabbath: Symptom of the Universe, Butler was dead set against the song because he thought it too closely resembled Led Zeppelin's [...] "Communication Breakdown", with the bassist admitting, [...] "I thought it was so much like that we couldn't possibly get away with it... They were our favorite band by that time." [...] "Planet Caravan" [...] was an unusually quiet song which showcased that the band was capable of more than bone crushing guitar riffs. Iommi admitted that the band had doubts about the mellow number, telling Classic Albums, [...] "It was almost one of those 'Should we do this? with Butler adding, [...] "We just came up with that in the studio and it was really laid back so and we didn't want to come out with the usual love crap. So it was about floating through the universe with your loved one, instead of 'Let's go down to the pub and have some chips', or whatever... Just taking a spaceship out into the stars and having the ultimate romantic weekend." [...] Django Reinhardt's jazz influence is apparent on Iommi's guitar playing. [...] "Hand of Doom" [...] dealt with the problem of soldiers returning from the Vietnam War strung out on heroin, which the band witnessed first-hand when they played two American Army bases but, as Butler observed to Matthew Longfellow in 2010, there was [...] "nothing on the news about this. There was no programs telling you that the US troops in Vietnam, to get through that horrible war, were like fixing up and all this kinda thing. It just stuck in me head and when we got to [...] "Hand of Doom", that's what I wrote it about." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lombardy grew up at 838 Beck Street, Bronx, New York City, in an {{apartment}} with his parents and two other families. [...] "Bill recalls that his family had financial problems when he was young. His parents both worked and they all shared {{an apartment}} with his grandmother, an aunt and a cousin, until his second year in grammar school, when they moved to their own apartment." [...] Shortly after World War II, Lombardy and {{his family moved to}} 961 Faile Street, Lombardy recalled of his new apartment:I remember the winters were very tough in that apartment. My room <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sweat from the cold. The moisture <b>used</b> <b>to</b> seep through one wall. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> extra blankets <b>to</b> cover me at night so I wouldn't wake up with pneumonia in the morning.|$|R

5000|$|When Kortchmar {{was asked}} about the song he said [...] "I had the groove and the music going. That record was made back when the {{technology}} had just started to really take over in music. I had one of the first Yamaha DX7s, which was a keyboard that was used a ton in the '80s, but we ended up luckily getting one of the first ones in the United States. It's a synthesizer keyboard, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> it <b>to</b> <b>get</b> that sound that you hear the record starting with." ...|$|R
60|$|A very, {{very long}} while ago, when <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be <b>getting</b> {{three hundred and}} fifty rupees a month, and pickings, on a big timber-contract at Calcutta, I had a wife of sorts. But she's dead now. People said that I killed her by taking to the Black Smoke. Perhaps I did, but it's so long since it doesn't matter. Sometimes when I first came <b>to</b> the Gate, <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> feel sorry for it; but that's all {{over and done with}} long ago, and I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month, and am quite happy. Not DRUNK happy, you know, but always quiet and soothed and contented.|$|R

6000|$|... "Batter up!" [...] yelled Arthurs. [...] "A {{little more}} speed now, Peg. You see it ain't nothin' to get hit. Why, that's in the game. It don't hurt much. I never cared when <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hit. Batter up!" ...|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, she mastered the genre, according to her biographer Derek Pepys-Whiteley: There was about her a buoyancy and gaiety, an indefinable zest, which held the attention. With her tuneful voice, forceful humour, and vital personality, no one knew better how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the right song across to an audience. By1918 she had firmly established herself as a music-hall artiste, both in the provinces and in London.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, no! All {{the morning}} calls I ever saw were formal, every one stiff, and {{speaking}} by rote, or talking politics.

She {{would hang}} about for hours outside the cellar {{door for the}} purpose of sneaking in on the first opportunity and lapping up the drippings from the beer-cask. I do not mention this habit of hers in praise of the species, but merely to show how almost human some of them are. If the transmigration of souls is a fact, this animal was certainly qualifying most rapidly for a Christian, for her vanity was only second to her love of drink. Whenever she caught a particularly big rat, she would bring it up into the room where we were all sitting, lay the corpse down in the midst of us, and wait to be praised. Lord! how the girls <b>used</b> <b>to</b> scream.|$|R
