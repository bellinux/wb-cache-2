50|$|The <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> in turn are {{deposited}} in inclined layers over the bottomset beds as the active lobe advances. <b>Foreset</b> <b>beds</b> form {{the greater part}} of the bulk of a delta, (and also occur on the lee side of sand dunes). The sediment particles within <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> consist of larger and more variable sizes, and constitute the bed load that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the channel bottom. When the bed load reaches the edge of the delta front, it rolls over the edge, and is {{deposited in}} steeply dipping layers {{over the top of the}} existing bottomset beds. Under water, the slope of the outermost edge of the delta is created at the angle of repose of these sediments. As the foresets accumulate and advance, subaqueous landslides occur and readjust overall slope stability. The foreset slope, thus created and maintained, extends the delta lobe outward. In cross section, foresets typically lie in angled, parallel bands, and indicate stages and seasonal variations during the creation of the delta.|$|R

The <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> contain small-scale sediment gravity flow deposits such as grain flows and debris flows as well as thin turbidites and graded very fine sand and silt deposits that are rich in mica flakes and were deposited from suspension fallout. Rare wave-generated sedimentary structures (such as wave-ripple laminations) were observed in the foreset beds: gravitational processes were the major driving force of sediment transport on the delta front. The deltas developed in the northern and eastern basin are therefore recognized as fluvial-dominated deltas (cf. Bhattacharya and Walker, 1992; Bhattacharya, 2006).|$|R

40|$|During glacial {{outburst}} floods (jökulhlaups) large ice-blocks {{are often}} {{released from the}} glacier margin. Ice-blocks ground at points of flow deceleration, generating distinctive patterns of scour and deposition scaled to the obstacle size. The large-scale ice-block obstacle marks produced within the proglacial zone are diagnostic of jökulhlaups. We use ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to investigate the sedimentary architecture of ice-block obstacle marks generated by the November 1996 jökulhlaup at Skeiðarárjökull, Iceland. The GPR data reveal a varied sedimentary architecture, interpreted to suggest that ice-block obstacle mark sedimentology is controlled by flow conditions, sediment supply, and whether ice blocks are deposited in isolation or as a cluster. Following ice-block grounding, deflection of flow down {{and away from the}} obstacle develops horseshoe vortices that maintain a non-depositional hollow around the obstacle, whilst continued outwash deposition away from the obstacle raises the level of the surrounding sandur. Where ice-blocks ground early during the jökulhlaup, hollows are infilled with <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> at the up-flow end and backset beds (antidune) distally. However, where ice-blocks ground on the waning stage when sediment flux is reduced, antidunes are not preserved and the hollow is infilled with low-angle <b>foreset</b> <b>beds.</b> In both cases the lee-side shadow ridge is composed of pseudo-anticlinal beds proximal to the obstacle (where shed vortices are strong) and plane beds distally (where flows converge and the shed vortices weaken). Where flow parallel ice-block clusters develop, the grounding of smaller ice-blocks in the lee of the initial obstacle results in only limited shadow ridge aggradation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sediments {{deposited}} in transitional settings between shoreface and offshore lacustrine environments in the Pliocene Glenns Ferry Formation of the southwestern Snake River Plain include extensive nearshore oolitic sequences similar to wave-built terraces along Lake Bonneville described by Gilbert (1885). These sequences record both constructional and destructional phases. Constructional units formed during basinward progradation and avalanching of oolitic sediment from a shallow bench platform down a steeply-dipping bench slope. Reversed grading seen in proximal foresets and normal grading seen in distal foresets {{may have resulted}} from sediment transport by grain flow on {{the upper reaches of}} the slope and fluidized sediment flow on the lower slope surface. <b>Foreset</b> <b>beds</b> dip basinward to the northeast at 26 degrees, and foreset units attain thicknesses of 18 meters. Destructional episodes are recorded by missing sections within the tops of constructional units. Massive beds of thickly coated ooids overlie constructional units and record ooid formalion on the bench platform during transgressions which preceded progradation of subsequent foresets.

Most of these volcanoes are partially buried beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet, but in some, a combination of tectonic uplift and lowering of ice level has exposed basal hydrovolcanic sections produced by eruptions in an englacial environment. Some {{of the largest and}} best preserved hydrovolcanic structures are delta-like in form, with gentle distal slopes, and <b>foreset</b> <b>bedded</b> deposits composed of hyaloclastites, pillow breccias, pillow lavas, subaerial f ows and air fall tephras.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{report the}} {{experimental}} discovery of autogenic cyclicity in delta <b>foreset</b> <b>bedding</b> that arises simply from steady {{water and sediment}} input under particular hydraulic characteristics. This autogenesis is intrinsic to Froude-supercritical flow associated with a train of upstream-migrating hydraulic jumps that delineate cyclic steps. Upstream migration of hydraulic jumps is associated with discrete packages of sediment accumulation on the foreset slope. This synchronism originates from the periodic alternation between supercritical and subcritical flow states on the delta topset just upstream of the shoreline, i. e., the topset–foreset break of the delta. The alternation in turn depends on {{the distance from the}} topset–foreset break to the nearest hydraulic jump immediately upstream. When the hydraulic jump is still in close proximity to the river mouth (delta shore), it reworks existing topset deposits (and perhaps upper foreset deposits as well) as it migrates upstream. Reworked sediment is then entrained into the subcritical flow between the shore and the hydraulic jump, which then emplaces this fine suspended sediment onto the foreset slope. As the hydraulic jump moves sufficiently far upstream of the mouth, the topset flow becomes supercritical, with a flow velocity sufficient to transport fine sediment offshore beyond the foreset. Under these conditions, the sediment emplaced on the foreset tends to be coarser material deposited via avalanching or proximal deposition fro...|$|R

In this study, the basin-fill sediments of southwestern margin of the Kathmandu Basin were studied for the sediments recorded in vertical sequences at various localities and facies analysis was made. Mainly eight facies were recognised. They were matrix-supported massive gravel (Gmm), matrix-supported graded gravel (Gmg), gravelly fine or mud (GF), massive silt (Fsm), massive mud (Fm), ripple-laminated silt or laminated silt/mud/clay (Fl), carbonaceous clay (C), and incipient soil with roots (Fr). Four facies associations that were identified were proximal fan-delta facies association (FA 1), mid fan-delta facies associaiton (FA 2), distal fan-delta facies association (FA 3), and gravelly sinuous river facies association (FA 4).

40|$|Gilbert-type deltas are {{commonly}} characterised by steep <b>foreset</b> <b>bedding.</b> Changes in the foreset {{characteristics such as}} grain size, grading, alternating sand and gravel are often interpreted as records of changes of base level or sediment input due to diurnal, seasonal or climatic forcing. To aid such interpretations, an important question is to what extent cyclicity in the foreset characteristics {{can be explained by}} autogenic processes rather than exogenic forcing. Experimental deltas were generated with gravelly sand under constant boundary conditions and a varying width–depth ratio of the feeder system. The foresets of the narrow feeder system are regular and show gradual upward fining. The foresets of the wide feeder system, in contrast, show quasi-cyclic patterns of coarsening and fining during the delta progradation. The cyclicity is caused by the emergence of a channelised point feeder system with migrating gravel side bars, which distributes the sand and gravel laterally in a non-uniform manner. This spectacular change of foreset architecture is fully explained by the autogenic response of the feeder system to the width.

At Froude numbers ranging from about 0. 4 to 1. 0, three dune types developed: (1) asymmetrical (triangular) dunes, (2) convex (symmetrical) dunes and (3) humpback (whaleback) dunes. Asymmetrical dunes had gentle, long stoss sides and steep, short lee sides and contained cross-stratification with a maximum dip mostly about 30 degrees to 35 degrees. Flow separation and avalanching were strongly developed to the lee of these dunes. Convex dunes formed when the bed was thin and had longitudinal profiles that were convex-upward with stoss and lee sides of equal steepness. Internal cross-beds were likewise convex and formed from draping of sediment over the lee sides rather than from avalanching. Humpback dunes were the most distinctive bedforms in that on each dune profile the point of maximum elevation was offset {{from the top of}} the foreset (avalanche) slope. Immediately downstream from this maximum point, low-angle topset bedding merged uninterruptedly into steep <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> and these into bottomsets, producing sigmoidal bedding inside each dune.

40|$|The Swatch of No Ground is a shelf canyon that deeply incises the Bengal shelf {{near the}} Ganges–Brahmaputra river mouth, cuts the <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> of the subaqueous river delta and acts as {{temporary}} depocenter between river mouth and Bengal fan. Sedimentation {{rates in the}} Swatch of No Ground are highest near the canyon head at ∼ 50 cm a− 1, decreasing to ∼ 15 cm a− 1 in 600 m water depth. The canyon deposits consist of intercalated fine (silt–clay) and coarse (silt–sand) grained deposits. In seismic profiles, small-scale sedimentary structures and parallel-bedded layers reveal that sediment in the canyon is mainly deposited from suspension. During fair weather conditions tidal currents are the dominant mechanism that transports plumes of suspended river load towards the canyon, forming fine-grained silt–clay layers. During storm conditions, sediment is resuspended on the inner shelf and subaqueous delta east of the canyon. Storm-generated bottom currents transport the resuspended sediment alongshelf to the canyon where the particles are trapped and form graded coarse silt–sand layers. Channels and gullies in the Swatch of No Ground indicate active gravity-driven currents with an erosional character in the upper canyon and non-depositional character below ∼ 450 m, suggesting that persistent or ephemeral currents presently export sediment to the Bengal fan. Numerous slumps and slides observed in the canyon show small-scale acoustically transparent layers that indicate sediment liquefaction presumably initiated along the steep canyon margin. These mudflows move downslope and halt where the canyon gradient decreases. One widespread acoustically transparent layer with an age of approximately 140 – 160 years BP can be traced {{throughout much of the}} canyon and is probably the result of large-scale sediment remobilization triggered by a catastrophic event like an earthquake. This may represent decennial-to-centennial scale events that remove large quantities of sediment and prevent the canyon from rapid infilling...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Sorbas Basin is {{the land}} {{reference}} of the Messinian Salinity Crisis (MSC) that affected the Mediterranean Sea in the latest Miocene. Its stratigraphy has been re-visited using calcareous nannofossils and planktonic foraminifers, which provide a reliable biostratigraphic frame and lead to particularly specify {{the relationships between the}} Sorbas and Zorreras members with Yesares evaporites. The evaporites overlie a shallowing upward sequence ending with the deposition of the Reef Unit and Terminal Carbonate Complex (TCC) {{on the periphery of the}} basin. The reefal carbonates of the TCC are overlain by clastic deposits that are <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> of post-MSC Gilbert-type fan deltas developed on the northern edge of the basin. These sedimentary structures are separated from reefal carbonates and the Reef Unit by the Messinian Erosional Surface (MES). The various facies of the Sorbas Member have been correlated with the bottomset beds of the Gilbert-type fan deltas despite some differences in palaeobathymetry. In the southeastern periphery of the basin, the MES separates the Sorbas Member from the Yesares gypsums. In the central part of the basin, a hiatus characterizes the contact between these members. The Zorreras Member postdates the MSC and entirely belongs to Zanclean. Its white “Lago Mare” layers are lagoonal deposits, the fauna of which is confirmed to result from Mediterranean–Paratethys high sea-level exchange after the post-MSC marine reflooding of the Mediterranean Basin. This study allows to re-assert the two-step scenario of the MSC (Clauzon et al., 1996) with the following events:- at 5. 971 – 5. 600 Ma, minor sea-level fall resulting in the desiccation of this peripheral basin with secondary fluctuations;- at 5. 600 – 5. 460 Ma, significant subaerial erosion (or lack of sedimentation) caused by the almost complete desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea;- instantaneous marine reflooding, accepted at 5. 460 Ma, followed by continuing sea-level rise...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 80 - 86) Includes digitized image(s) in TIFF format. The Plio-Pleistocene marine lower Saugus Formation is well {{exposed in}} the Santa Susana Mountains north of Simi Valley, California. The lower Saugus is composed mostly of interfingering sandstone, coquinite, and conglomerate deposits, with rare occurrences of intrasparrudite limestone and laminated mudstone. The beds unconformably overlie the Miocene Modelo Formation {{throughout most of}} the study area. The lower Saugus, in the study area, is interpreted to represent a fluvial-dominated delta that is herein named the "Simi Delta". Lithosomes interpreted to be prodelta deposits include clast-supported phosphorite conglomerate and intensely bioturbated, fine to medium sandstone. Delta-front deposits include bedded medium sandstone, serpulid-bearing sandstone, and oyster-pecten coquinites. Distributary-mouth bar deposits are composed of well sorted, parallel-laminated, medium sandstone. Interdistributary bay deposits are composed of poorly sorted, silty, fine sandstone and commonly contain abundant macrofossils. A laminated, lensoidal mudstone, exposed in the Gillibrand Quarry area, is interpreted to represent an abandoned channel which was filled with clay. In Browns Canyon, an angular discordance which is interpreted to represent the transition between topset and <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> on a Gilbert-type delta is exposed stable or slightly emergent. This Gilbert-type delta requires a tectonic regime to form. In the Gillibrand Quarry area, where distributary-mouth bar deposits are exposed, a subsiding receiving basin is required. This difference in tectonic regimes suggests that the "Simi Delta" consisted of at least two different delta lobes, which were formed at two different times. Provenance includes an igneous, a high-rank metamorphic, and a reworked sedimentary source. The presence of anorthosite and gneissic clasts indicates that during the Plio-Pleistocene, the San Gabriel Mountain complex was a highland and was shedding these distinctive clasts into the westward-flowing Plio-Pleistocene Santa Clara River which deposited its sediment on the "Simi Delta". Between 1, 000, 000 and 70, 000 years before present, the Santa Susana Mountains were uplifted causing the Pleistocene Santa Clara River to shift to its present course and abandon the "Simi Delta" depositional site...|$|R
40|$|The incised {{valley of}} Ventimiglia, located along the Ligurian coast (NW Italy), {{was cut by}} deep river erosion during the Messinian sea-level fall and is {{connected}} seawards to a slope canyon. During Pliocene, the valley was flooded by the sea and transformed into a coastal embayment or ria. The infill sequence of the incised valley is up to 500 m thick. The paleovalley floor is locally paved by thin remnants of subaerial scree deposits, abruptly overlain by up to 150 m thick bathyal marls, above which a number of stacked prograding conglomerate Gilbert-type deltas constitute most of the valley fill. Gilbert deltas present 15 °– 25 ° dipping clinoforms, 50 to 250 m thick, and are alternated with up to 20 – 30 m thick marls intervals. This unusual character of incised-valley-fill sequence, can {{be accounted for by}} the rapid and high-amplitude eustatic sealevel rise that followed the Messinian event, and by the progradation occurring on a narrow and steep-gradient shelf, tectonically controlled by the tilting and collapse of the margin. High and coarse sediment supply was provided by the uplifting Alpine chain. A remarkable analogy in facies patterns and depositional setting is observed with the high-latitude Holocene fan-delta systems described by Prior and Bornhold [Prior, D. B., Bornhold, B. D., 1990. The underwater development of Holocene fan deltas. In: Colella, A., Prior, D. B. (Eds.), Coarse-Grained Deltas: Spec. Publs. Int. Ass. Sedim., vol. 10, pp. 75 – 90. ] in the fjords of the British Columbia. Both examples are characterized by high rate of sea-level rise after the entrenchment stage, and predominance of massflow processes and debris-avalanching in the first stage of progradation, followed, in the later stages of delta progradation, by deposition of better-organized and stratified <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> on the delta slope predominantly by inertia and turbidity flows. A large facies variability is observed in the Gilbert-type delta complex, recording deposition under a wide range of physical conditions, both in individual and successive wedges. Long-term evolution of the valley fill shows a general trend from deep-water to shallow-water deltas and from fluvial-dominated to wave-influenced deltas...|$|R
30|$|The Niger Delta {{sedimentary}} basin {{situated in the}} Gulf of Guinea is comprised of traditionally three stratigraphic units of variable geologic characteristics. These can be grouped as topset <b>beds,</b> <b>foresets</b> and bottomset as revealed from seismic stratigraphy (Galloway 1975). The topset portion known as regressive continental unit called the Benin Formation; the foreset unit forms the prograding Agbada Formation, whereas the marine clay/shale of the Akata Formation is referred as the bottomset portion of the delta depositional system. Several works carried out by researchers revealed the stratigraphy, sedimentology, structural styles and the play potential of the basin (Adesida and Reijers 1977; Avbovbo 1978; Reijers 2011).|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe 174 km {{diameter}} Terby {{impact crater}} (28. 0 °S- 74. 1 °E) {{located on the}} northern rim of the Hellas basin displays anomalous inner morphology, including a flat floor and light-toned layered deposits. An analysis of these deposits was performed using multiple datasets from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions, with visible images for interpretation, near-infrared data for mineralogical mapping, and topography for geometry. The geometry of layered deposits was consistent with that of sediments that settled mainly in a sub-aqueous environment, during the Noachian period as determined by crater counts. To the north, the thickest sediments displayed sequences for fan deltas, as identified by 100 m to 1 km long clinoforms, as defined by horizontal <b>beds</b> passing to <b>foreset</b> <b>beds</b> dipping by 6 - 10 ° {{toward the center of}} the Terby crater. The identification of distinct sub-aqueous fan sequences, separated by unconformities and local wedges, showed the accumulation of sediments from prograding/onlapping depositional sequences, due to lake level and sediment supply variations. The mineralogy of several layers with hydrated minerals, including Fe/Mg phyllosilicates, supports this type of sedimentary environment. The volume of fan sediments was estimated as > 5000 km 3 (a large amount considering classical martian fan deltas such as Eberswalde (6 km 3)) and requires sustained liquid water activity. Such a large sedimentary deposition in Terby crater is characteristic of the Noachian/Phyllosian period during which the environment favored the formation of phyllosilicates. The latter were detected by spectral data in the layered deposits of Terby crater in three distinct layer sequences. During the Hesperian period, the sediments experienced strong erosion, possibly enhanced by more acidic conditions, forming the current morphology with three mesas and closed depressions. Small fluvial valleys and alluvial fans formed subsequently, attesting to late fluvial processes dated as late Early to early Late Hesperian. After this late fluvial episode, the Terby impact crater was submitted to aeolian processes and permanent cold conditions with viscous flow features. Therefore, the Terby crater displays, in a single location, geologic features that characterize the three main periods of time on Mars, with the presence of one of the thickest sub-aqueous fan deposits reported on Mars. The filling of Terby impact crater is thus one potential "reference geologic cross-section" for Mars stratigraphy...|$|R
40|$|According to the «Carta Geologica d'Italia» the {{regressive}} deposits belonging tu the «Bradanic cycle» are considered, beginning {{from the}} stratigraphic {{contact with the}} «Argille subappennine» Formation, {{as a series of}} formations organized into vertical aggradational-type sandy and conglomeratic depositional systems. These formations, Pleistocene in age, are in stratigraphic relationship one another, are bounded by horizontal surfaces and form tabular bodies. In particular, the «Sabbie di Monte Marano» Fm., marine in origin, and the «Conglomerato di Irsina» Fm., continental and/or marine in origin, represent the most characteristic deposits of the Bradanic cycle. In the neighbourhood of the Irsina village, a stratigraphic and sedimentological study has been carried out on these deposits. This area is located in the central-western sector of the Bradanic trough: because of its isolated outcrops, Irsina relief represents a witness-area for studying the filling up successions of the Bradanic trough. This kind of study allows to make some important paleoenvironmental consideration, and new formational distinctions. The upper part of the Irsina relief is represented by a group of sandy-conglomeratic deposits, 60 meters in thickness, having lithostratigraphic and facies characteristics laterally and vertically variable. Internally this group of sediments shows a progradational geometry. with NW-SE trending low-and high angle <b>foreset</b> <b>beds.</b> In particular, it is possible to distinguish in the northern zone sandy or sandy-conglomeratic beach sequences, and in the southern zone conglomeratic delta sequences. The beach sequences lie on the «Argille subappennine» Fm. by intergrading: the conglomeratic delta sequences overlie erosively the underlying «Argille subappennine» Fm. The depositional model here suggested shows a very different stratigraphic architecture as regards that well-known in literature. In fact, it is not any more possible to consider the "Conglomerato di Irsina" Fm. as deposits in superposition on the "Sabbie di Monte Marano" Fm. For these reasons we propose to abandone the term "Sabbie di Monte Marano" and to replace it by the formal name "Formazione di Monte S. Marco", indicating the sandy-conglomeratic beach sequences: we propose to maintain the term "Conglomerato di Irsina" to indicate the conglomeratic delta sequences. Furthermore, we introduce the new formal unit "Conglomerati di Fosso Macello", represented by reddish continental gravels erosively overlying the «Formazione di Monte S. Marco» and the «Conglomerato di Irsina» and previously included into "Conglomerato di Irsina", "Sabbie dello Staturo" and «Argille calcigne» Fms...|$|R
