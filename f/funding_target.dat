The blueprint suggested that Parliament would pass laws: Finance Bill to scrap VAT on tampons and household energy bills; Asylum and Immigration Control Bill to end the automatic right of EU citizens to enter Britain; National Health Service (<b>Funding</b> <b>Target)</b> Bill to get an extra 100 million pounds a week; European Union Law (Emergency Provisions) Bill; Free Trade Bill to start to negotiate its own deals with non-EU countries; and European Communities Act 1972 (Repeal) Bill to end the European Court of Justice's jurisdiction over Britain and stop making contributions to the EU budget.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{goal of the}} Foundation was {{to raise}} £500,000 to fund {{equipment}} for a cancer research centre being built in the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, to be named The Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre. Once this was secure, the Foundation would turn its attention to funding other cancer related projects in the North East of England. The Foundation raised £260,000 in just over two weeks. By November 2008 it had raised over £1 million, double the initial <b>funding</b> <b>target</b> of £500,000 set in February, which itself was passed in just eight weeks. By 15 October 2009, just over 6 weeks after Sir Bobby's death and nearly 19 months after its launch, the charity had raised over £2 million. It passed the £2.5m mark in September 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The Fund has set {{itself a}} goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020, which is not an {{official}} figure for {{the size of the}} Fund itself. Uncertainty over where this money would come from {{led to the creation of}} a High Level Advisory Group on Climate Financing (AGF) by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon in February 2010. There is no formal connection between AGF and GCF, although its report is one source for debates on [...] "resource mobilisation" [...] for the GCF, an item that will be discussed at the GCF's October 2013 Board meeting. Disputes also remain as to whether the <b>funding</b> <b>target</b> will be based on public sources, or whether [...] "leveraged" [...] private finance will be counted towards the total.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how equities of nine individual economic sectors are affected when monetary policy announcements in the form of federal funds rate changes are made over the period January 1, 1999 to May 11, 2005. This sector-analysis is conducted over a recent time period, when the Federal Open Market Committee has adopted a policy of immediate disclosure of its federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate changes. Our results indicate that the Consumer Discretionary and Technology sectors’ equity returns are negatively and significantly related to changes in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate. This negative relationship appears to be especially pronounced for decreases in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate. A positive and significant relationship exists between equity returns in the Consumer Staples Sector and federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate changes, which is again concentrated in federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate decreases. A surprising finding is that Utility Sector returns tend to decrease in response to decreases in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate. In summary, we find that the relationship between equity returns and federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate changes documented in previous studies is more pronounced for some sectors in the economy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} changes in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate on bank stock returns through an event-study analysis. We examine the state dependency of such effects and focus on the surprise elements of policy changes derived from the federal funds futures market. Although we confirm an inverse relation between bank stock returns and changes in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate previously supported in the literature, we find that bank stock returns only respond to surprise or unexpected changes in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> rate. We also find that such responses are conditional on the context in which policy changes take place.

40|$|Abstract. Using {{high-frequency}} {{data in a}} Markov-switching framework, we iden-tify {{states that}} imply different responses of the yield curve to unexpected changes in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target.</b> Empirical estimates reveal a low-volatility state where long-term bonds respond significantly, and in a predictable manner, to unexpected changes in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target.</b> An alternative state exists with higher volatil-ity, where unexpected changes in the federal <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> raise the short-end of the yield curve, but have no {{significant effect on the}} long-end. The low-volatility state for long-term bonds occurs from September 1995 to May 1999 and again from March 2000 to January 2002. The timing of the switches between the two states for long-term bonds coincides with changes in FOMC communication policy- though, not all changes in communications policy induce a switch...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} hedge <b>fund</b> activism and <b>target</b> firm performance, executive compensation, and executive wealth. It introduces a theoretical framework that describes the activism process as a sequence of discrete decisions. The methodology uses regression analysis on a matched sample based on firm size, industry, and market-to-book ratio. All regressions control for industry and year fixed effects. Schedule 13 D Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings are the source for the statistical sample of hedge <b>fund</b> <b>target</b> firms. I supplement that data with target firm financial, operating, and share price information from the CRSP-COMPUSTAT merged database. Activist hedge <b>funds</b> <b>target</b> undervalued or underperforming firms with high profitability and cash flows. They do not avoid firms with powerful CEOs. Leverage, executive compensation, pay for performance and CEO turnover increase at target firms after {{the arrival of the}} activist hedge <b>fund.</b> <b>Target</b> firm executives’ wealth is more sensitive to changes in share price after hedge fund activism events suggesting that the executive team experiences changes to their compensation structure that provides incentive to take action to improve returns to shareholders.
