5|$|He {{enjoyed a}} {{successful}} post-war career {{working for the}} U.S. government as a diplomat, civil servant, and administrator. His conversion to the Republican Party and his cooperation with his old friend, President Ulysses S. Grant, as well as critical comments {{he wrote in his}} memoirs about General Lee's wartime performance, made him anathema to many of his former Confederate colleagues. His reputation in the South further suffered when he led African-American militia against the anti-Reconstruction White League at the Battle of Liberty Place in 1874. Authors of the Lost Cause movement focused on Longstreet's actions at Gettysburg as a primary reason for the Confederacy's loss of the war.

5|$|Remains {{attributed}} to Hypogeomys australis are known from Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar and Antsirabe in central Madagascar, suggesting a broad former distribution. Its range {{is not known}} to overlap that of H.antimena, which <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> dramatic reduction during the Holocene. A bone from Andrahomana has been radiocarbon dated to about 4440 BP and another to 1536 BP. Although almost nothing is known of the ecology of H.australis, Goodman and Rakotondravony presumed that it was similar to its living relative in living in burrows in areas with loose soils. H.australis shows relatively high content of carbon-13 isotope, likely because it ate some plants which were enriched in carbon-13 through C4 carbon fixation and crassulacean acid metabolism; both of these photosynthesis-related processes occur most frequently in plants adapted to dry environments.|$|E

It is {{the only member of}} the monotypic genus Bubulcus, although some authorities regard two of its subspecies as full species, the western cattle egret and the eastern cattle egret. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus Egretta, it is more closely related to the herons of Ardea.

5|$|The coyote {{features}} prominently as a trickster {{figure in}} the folktales of America's indigenous peoples, alternately assuming {{the form of an}} actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote acts as a picaresque hero which rebels against social convention through deception and humor. The coyote was likely given its trickster role in light of the actual animal's intelligence and adaptability; pre-Columbian American people observed its behavior, and their folkloric representations reflected its attributes. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike the gray wolf, which <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> radical improvement of its public image, cultural attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortress}} {{was built}} into the south face of a rocky mass, and is barely discernible from the distance as a man-made structure.

During the centuries of its use, the structure served various armies and <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> number of renovations, {{to keep up with}} the development of arms. The original appearance of the fortress is no longer known, due to the structural changes undertaken by Croatian nobility, Turks, Venetians and Austrians. The present day aspect of a mostly stone fortress dates back to the restructuring work carried out by the Venetians in the 17th century.|$|E

5|$|Although never {{losing its}} significance, the cathedral {{subsequently}} suffered centuries of virtual neglect. In 1441 it was restored as catholicosate and remains as such to this day.

Etchmiadzin was plundered by the Safavids in 1604, when relics and stones were {{taken out of the}} cathedral to New Julfa in an effort to undermine Armenians' attachment to their land. Since then the cathedral <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> number of renovations.

Today, it incorporates styles of different periods of Armenian architecture. Diminished during the early Soviet period, Etchmiadzin revived again in the second half of the twentieth century, and under independent Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids {{share many}} {{features}} with early birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise {{nature of their}} relationship to birds <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> great deal of study, and hypotheses about that relationship have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They even suggested that Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell et al., including new characters and better fossil evidence, to determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. A consensus of paleontologists has concluded {{that there is not}} yet enough evidence to determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.|$|E

5|$|Tawau has one public hospital, four {{public health}} clinics, three {{maternal}} {{and child health}} clinics, seven village clinics, one mobile clinic and two 1Malaysia clinics. Tawau Hospital, on Tanjung Batu Street, is the town's main hospital and an important healthcare facility for patients from Semporna, Lahad Datu, Kunak, and Sandakan. Indonesian patients near the border area also frequently visit the hospital. Tawau Specialist Polyclinics (TSPC) is a walk-in healthcare clinic that sees patients from Tawau and surrounding areas as well as patients from neighbouring Philippines and Indonesia. TSPC has a range of medical specialists, a medical laboratory and radiology services. The hospital <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> series of modernisations since 1990 with the construction of specialist clinics, Central Sterile Services Department (CSSD), new wards and operation theatres. Tawau Specialist Hospital is the only private hospital in the town. The Tawau Regional Library is one of three regional libraries in Sabah, the others are at Keningau and Sandakan. These libraries are operated by the Sabah State Library department. Some schools, colleges, or universities have private libraries.|$|E
5|$|The library <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon {{was closed for}} a repainting, the {{installation}} of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, which means they retain many basal characteristics from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown this group <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living tuatara. Tuatara show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to tuatara since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern tuatara.|$|E

5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red giant of {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> dramatic change in status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E
5|$|The gharial <b>has</b> <b>undergone</b> <b>a</b> chronic {{long-term}} decline, {{combined with}} a rapid short-term decline, leading the IUCN to list the species as critically endangered. In 1946, the gharial population had been widespread, numbering around 5,000 to 10,000; by 2006, however, it had declined 96–98%, reduced to {{a small number of}} widely spaced subpopulations of fewer than 235 individuals. This long-term decline had a number of causes, including egg collection and hunting, such as for indigenous medicine. The rapid decline of about 58% between 1997 and 2006 was caused by increasing use of gill nets and the loss of riverine habitat. The gharial population continues to be threatened by environmental hazards such as heavy metals and protozoan parasites, but as of 2013 numbers are rising, due to the protection of nests against egg predators. The Chinese alligator was historically widespread throughout the eastern Yangtze River system but is currently restricted to some areas in southeastern Anhui province thanks to habitat fragmentation and degradation. The wild population is believed to exist only in small fragmented ponds. In 1972, the species was declared a Class I endangered species by the Chinese government and received the maximum amount of legal protection. Since 1979, captive breeding programs were established in China and North America, creating a healthy captive population. In 2008, alligators bred in the Bronx Zoo were successfully reintroduced to Chongming Island. The Philippine crocodile is perhaps the most threatened crocodilian and is considered by the IUCN to be critically endangered. Hunting and destructive fishing habits have reduced its population to around 100 individuals by 2009. In the same year, 50 captive bred crocodiles were released into the wild to help boost the population. Support from local people is crucial for the species survival.|$|E
