40|$|Rivers may {{dramatically}} {{change course}} on a fluvial plain. Such an avulsion temporarily leads to two active channels connected at a bifurcation. Here we study {{the effect of}} dynamic meandering at the bifurcation {{and the effect of}} channel <b>width</b> <b>adjustment</b> to changing discharge in both downstream branches on the evolution of a bifurcation and coexisting channels. As an example, we reconstructed the last major avulsion at the Rhine delta apex. We combined historical and geological data to reconstruct a slowly developing avulsion process spanning 2000 years and involving channel <b>width</b> <b>adjustment</b> and meandering at the bifurcation. Based on earlier idealised models, we developed a onedimensional model for long-term morphodynamic prediction of upstream channel and bifurcates connected at the bifurcation node. The model predicts flow and sediment partitioning at the node, including the effect of migrating meanders at the bifurcation and channel <b>width</b> <b>adjustment.</b> Bifurcate channel <b>width</b> adaptation to changing discharge partitioning dramatically slows the pacing of bifurcation evolution because the sediment balance for <b>width</b> <b>adjustment</b> and bed evolution are coupled. The model further shows that meandering at the bifurcation modulates channel abandonment or enlargement periodically. This explains hitherto unrecognised reactivation signals in the sedimentary record of the studied bifurcation meander belts, newly identified in our geological reconstruction. Historical maps show that bifurcation migration due to meander bend dynamics increases the bifurcation angle, which increases the rate of closure of one bifurcate. The combination of model and reconstruction identifies the relevant timescales for bifurcation evolution and avulsion duration. These are the time required to fill one downstream channel over one backwater length, the time to translate one meander wavelength downstream and, for strong river banks, the adaptation timescale to adjust channel width. The findings have relevance for all avulsions where channel width can adjust to changing discharge and where meandering occurs...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{rules for}} the control of interbank rate {{volatility}} under different interest corridor systems when volatility stems from interbank market frictions. Friction-induced volatility will occur if there is heterogeneity in two dimensions (across banks and time) {{with respect to the}} degree to which frictions change the relative attractiveness of banks' outside options to using the interbank market. Under a "floor" or "ceiling operating system" (asymmetric scheme), friction-induced volatility can be controlled by implementing a relatively wide interest corridor - which is the inversion of the traditional principle.

Ring-width trends of canopy-sized white oak are simulated from regressions of BAI (ring area) data of real trees.

The long-term width trend was simulated as being toward constant ring width regardless of growth rate of the tree.

In addition, the simulation results show that the proposed WFs present better performances in MP mitigation compared to the WFs adopted by the Galileo and global positioning system modernization.|$|R

Identification of the dominant streambank erosion processes and their conceptualization in mathematical <b>width</b> <b>adjustment</b> models remain very difficult tasks. The U. S.

The model is intended for use in single thread gravel-bed rivers over annual to decadal timescales and for reach lengths of 1 – 10 km.

Bank erosion is treated as a function of excess shear stress with bank accretion occurring when shear stress falls below a second, low, threshold. A curvature function redistributes shear stress to either side of the channel. We illustrate the model through applications to a 5 · 6 -km reach of the upper River Wharfe in northern England. The sediment routing component with default parameter values gives excellent agreement with field data on downstream fining and down-reach reduction in bedload flux, and the width-adjustment components with approximate calibration to match maximum observed rates of bank shifting give plausible patterns of local change.

40|$|Alluvial {{fans are}} dynamic landforms, the {{evolution}} of which is controlled by both external environmental forcing (climate, tectonics and base level change) and internal process-form feedbacks. The latter include changes in flow configuration (between sheetflow and channelized flow states), driven by aggradation and degradation, which may in turn promote changes in sediment transport capacity. Recent numerical modelling indicates that such feedbacks may lead to dramatic and persistent fan entrenchment {{in the absence of}} external forcing. However, the parameterization of flow width within such models is untested to date and is subject to considerable uncertainty. This paper presents results from an experimental study of flow width dynamics on an aggrading fan in which spatial and temporal patterns of fan inundation are monitored continuously using analysis of digital vertical photography. Observed flow widths are compared with results from a simple theoretical model developed for non-equilibrium (aggradational) conditions.

30|$|Non-volatile {{resistive}} memories, such as phase-change RAM (PRAM) {{and spin}} transfer torque RAM (STT-RAM), {{have emerged as}} promising candidates because of their fast read access, high storage density, and very low standby power. Unfortunately, in scaled technologies, high storage density {{comes at a price}} of lower reliability. In this article, we first study in detail the causes of errors for PRAM and STT-RAM. We see that while for multi-level cell (MLC) PRAM, the errors are due to resistance drift, in STT-RAM they are due to process variations and variations in the device geometry. We develop error models to capture these effects and propose techniques based on tuning of circuit level parameters to mitigate some of these errors. Unfortunately for reliable memory operation, only circuit-level techniques are not sufficient and so we propose error control coding (ECC) techniques that can be used on top of circuit-level techniques. We show that for STT-RAM, a combination of voltage boosting and write pulse <b>width</b> <b>adjustment</b> at the circuit-level followed by a BCH-based ECC scheme can reduce the block failure rate (BFR) to 10 – 8. For MLC-PRAM, a combination of threshold resistance tuning and BCH-based product code ECC scheme can achieve the same target BFR of 10 – 8. The product code scheme is flexible; it allows migration to a stronger code to guarantee the same target BFR when the raw bit error rate increases with {{increase in the number of}} programming cycles.|$|R

Using digital elevation models, topographic maps, and field reconnaissance, we identified and characterized 30 tributary hanging valleys incised by gorges near their confluence with trunk streams in the Romanche watershed, French Western Alps. Longitudinal profiles of these tributaries are all convex and have abrupt knickpoints {{at the upper}} limit of oversteepened gorge reaches. We reconstructed initial glacial profiles from glacially polished bedrock knobs surrounding the gorges in order to quantify the amount of fluvial incision and knickpoint retreat. From morphometric analyses, we find that mean channel gradients and widths, as well as knickpoint retreat rates, display a drainage area dependence modulated by bedrock lithology. However, {{there appears to be}} no relation between horizontal retreat and vertical downwearing of knickpoints. Assuming a postglacial origin of these gorges, our results imply high postglacial fluvial incision (0. 5 - 15 mm yr− 1) and knickpoint retreat (1 - 200 mm yr− 1) rates that are, however, consistent with previous estimates. Numerical modeling was used to test the capacity of different fluvial incision models to predict the inferred evolution of the gorges. Results from simple end‐member models suggest transport‐limited behavior of the bedrock gorges. A more sophisticated model including dynamic <b>width</b> <b>adjustment</b> and sediment‐dependent incision rates predicts present‐day channel geometry only if a significant supply of sediment from the gorge sidewalls (∼ 10 mm yr− 1) is triggered by gorge deepening, combined with pronounced inhibition of bedrock incision by sediment transport and deposition...|$|R
