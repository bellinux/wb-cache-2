40|$|Coordination and Capacity in Ocean Governance Marcus Haward School of Government, Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studies & Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre The {{last decade}} has seen {{increasing}} attention to institutional arrangements and policy outcomes (governance) affecting {{the management of}} seas and oceans at national, regional and international levels. At the international level Australia has made important contributions to, inter alia, the moratorium on commercial whaling, ballast water management and related problems of introduced marine pests, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and (through APEC) regional support for integrated ocean management. Australia's international actions have been matched {{by the development of}} national oceans governance initiatives including a national Oceans Policy framework. Governance is clearly linked to policy capacity. While policy capacity can be conceptualised in different ways, two key elements are first the ability to make decisions (a process or procedural dimension) and second the quality of policy decision (the substance of policy). Both elements of policy capacity are linked to developing effective ocean governance. Key agencies {{need to be able to}} maintain and extend their own capacity, and be able to display leadership in this area, but they also need to be able to work effectively with the range of other actors engaged in work that will contribute such responses. This presentation examines coordination and capacity as significant variables in national and <b>international</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>governance...</b>|$|E
40|$|The European Atlas of the Seas {{offers a}} {{snapshot}} of environmental and socio-economic features that characterize the coastal and marine environment. The latest release (Version 4) addresses the public in general, but also non-specialist experts involved with environmental issues, human activities or policies related to Europe's coasts and seas. The information content of the Atlas comprises a series of geographical layers, subdivided in “background maps”, “thematic maps” (i. e. maritime Europe, natural setting, sea bottom, sea level rise, security, transport, tourism, energy, wind, fisheries and fish consumption) and “do-it-yourself maps” (dealing with marine knowledge, nature and environment, socio-economics, fisheries, aquaculture, transport, energy, sea bed mining, coastal tourism, Maritime Spatial Planning, integrated maritime surveillance, and <b>international</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>governance).</b> All maps follow consistent cartographic rules and can be extracted for external use. The Atlas database is updated regularly, but historical data remain accessible after the updates, so that time series may be constructed. Tools for map exploration and combination {{can be used to}} combine together more layers, providing professional users with analysis and interpretation capabilities, to couple data into graphical indicators. The Atlas aims to supports also policy making, on marine environment, maritime issues and economic sectors, both within and outside the European Institutions (e. g. on Common Fisheries Policy or Maritime Spatial Planning). Further, it expands the same support to near-coastal issues and matters related to land-sea interactions. The web application for accessing Atlas contents offers links to other Marine Information Systems, and is available to a broad audience from computers, tablets and mobile devices. JRC.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 {{years it has}} been {{globally}} acknowledged that the world’s oceans are in crisis, {{and it has been}} suggested that the solution to this crisis lies in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance.</b> <b>Oceans</b> <b>governance</b> includes, but is not limited to, the institutions, laws, policies, state and non-state actors involved in the governance of all living and non-living elements that are connected to oceans and coasts. Under this ‘umbrella’ of <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> a number of conceptual frameworks have evolved such as: ecosystem-based management; integrated policy approaches; zoning; and marine spatial planning. These interrelated approaches have been tried and tested in the Australasian region with varying degrees of success. There are often conflicting interests in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance.</b> On the broader scale there are differences in marine management – for instance whether to approach it from a scientific, security, economic, policy or political perspective, or a combination of all of these. On a sectoral level, different sectoral groups have challenges within <b>ocean</b> <b>governance</b> or with each other – it is not unusual for environmental non-governmental organisations to come into conflict with fisheries or offshore oil companies. On a jurisdictional level, national, state and local governments also have different responsibilities and concerns over the management of their ocean areas. As the following papers in this special edition demonstrate, jurisdictional overlaps or inconsistencies have been a significant part of the <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> ‘problem’, particularly in Australia. Marrying these conflicting interests through integrated approaches from an ecosystem-based perspective may have been echoed over the last three generations as being the most effective form of <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> but in reality this process has been difficult to achieve. This special edition on <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> examines the past, present and future challenges of <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> in Australia and New Zealand.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the dispute {{settlement}} provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC or Convention), and the potential and actual role that they play in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance.</b> The study focuses {{not only on the}} traditional role of dispute settlement mechanisms in peacefully settling disputes, but also on their potential for contribution to good <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> in many ways. The jurisprudence generated so far under the dispute settlement provisions of the LOSC can be called neither a complete success nor a total failure. Part XV of the Convention, dealing with dispute settlement procedures, has made a promising start with the inaugural jurisprudence under the prompt release and provisional measures proceedings. However, besides the general beneficial influence of the jurisprudence on <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> a few detrimental developments have also been identified from the perspective of <b>oceans</b> <b>governance.</b> The present thesis demonstrates that a lot of hope had been pinned on the dispute settlement provisions at the time when the LOSC was drafted. However, most of these hopes have not yet found expression, and if the limited use of dispute settlement procedures continues, it is unlikely that Part XV will fulfil those hopes in the future. Nevertheless, this thesis argues along more optimistic lines, and expresses a realistic hope that the actual role of dispute settlement in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> will improve in the future. The thesis concludes that {{the success or failure of}} the dispute settlement mechanisms mostly depends upon their actual use made by states. Further, the dispute settlement mechanisms once invoked must be able to settle disputes objectively on the basis of law, equity and justice and uphold the principles and provisions of the LOSC. It is hoped that states will have recourse to Part XV more often for the purpose of settling their disputes peacefully, and that the dispute settlement provisions will in turn fulfil their mandate. Only then will the world witness the dispute settlement mechanisms playing a real and beneficial role in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> concurrently with other <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> institutions and arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Adopting a {{critical}} geopolitics approach {{that accounts for}} the mutually reinforcing link between geo-informed narratives and power projection practices, this article proposes that <b>ocean</b> <b>governance</b> and maritime security have translated into states’ and regional organisations’ increasing control over maritime spaces. This leads to a certain territorialisation of the sea, not so much from a sovereignty and jurisdictional perspective but from a functional and normative perspective. The article starts by discussing the ways oceans have been represented and shows that they are far from a placeless void, both in practice and in discourse.

This paper examines Australia’s policy capacity to develop and implement oceans policies in the context of its history of responses to key commitments to international forums, such as United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development and the World Summit on Sustainable Development.

40|$|Since {{it entered}} into force in 1994, signatories of the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) have been obligated to {{demonstrate}} that they can effectively manage the resources within their Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). In 1998, the Australian Government took {{the first step to}} fulfil its obligation to LOSC and released Australia's Oceans Policy (AOP), a world first policy initiative focussed on providing a framework for integrated ecosystem based management of Australia's vast marine domain. Both Canadian and New Zealand representatives have been encouraged by the Australian Government to observe, and in some instances, take part in, the AOP development and implementation process. Subsequently, both Canadian and New Zealand governments have developed, or {{are in the process of}} developing their own ocean policies indicating that some policy components have been transferred from the AOP process. Key researchers of policy transfer such as Dolowitz (2003); Dolowitz and Marsh (2000); Jones and Newburn (2002); and Evans and Davies (1999) argue that policy transfer processes increase innovation in policy making and allow policy makers, through globalisation and technological advances in communication, to become aware of what other political systems are achieving through policy initiatives. Dolowitz and Marsh (2000 : 12) identify eight components of policy that can be transferred. These include policy goals, policy content, policy instruments, policy programs, institutions, ideologies, ideas and attitudes, and negative lessons. Policy transfer has become an important tool for governments as they look for quick solutions to their policy issues.

40|$|Oceans were a key {{theme of}} the Rio+ 20 Conference in 2012 and the {{importance}} of the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans was reinforced by the UN member states in The Future We Want agreement. During Rio+ 20, the Australian delegation focussed on achievements in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance,</b> such as the development of a National System of Marine Protected Areas. Australia announced its ocean commitments that included the prioritisation of international and regional initiatives, as well as maintaining fish stocks, elimination of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; and the elimination of harmful fisheries subsides that contribute to over-fishing and overcapacity. However, Australia did not specify any new commitments to national oceans policies or holistic approaches to <b>oceans</b> <b>governance.</b> This paper examines Australia’s role in contributing to a blue economy, our past commitments to integrated <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> and whether Australia has the policy capacity to deliver the commitments from Rio+ 20.

Australia has over 100 laws and policy instruments addressing aspects of {{the management of the}} marine environment. Many of these instruments incorporate post UNCED principles as well as reflecting a broader government reform agenda that saw government moving to more market and or collaborative oriented forms of governance. Australia has taken a high profile lead in <b>oceans</b> <b>governance</b> in these areas, developing marine protected area management in the 1970 s, supporting stronger initiatives against marine pollution in the 1980 s, and taking significant action against illegal, unreported or unregulated (IUU) fishing in the 1990 s.

40|$|The {{enactment}} of ocean-related legal and policy instruments {{and the establishment}} of ocean-mandated institutions driven by the United Nations in the past 30 years have not succeeded in protecting the oceans and their resources as the continuing depletion of ocean resources and deterioration of marine ecosystems attest. It is assumed that the overall system of <b>ocean</b> <b>governance</b> is plagued by problems characterised by a sectoral approach towards management and uncoordinated proliferation of legal and policy instruments as well as institutional organisations. This thesis utilises principles of international law as analytical tools to argue that their introduction in the legal and institutional frameworks for <b>ocean</b> <b>governance</b> can contribute to reducing these governance problems. These principles are cooperation, integration, ecosystem and precautionary approaches. The selected principles of international law were chosen because all of them are compatible with the notion that ocean problems are interrelated and multi-dimensional in their nature. It is argued that the negative effects of the governance problems can be reduced if the interrelated and multi-dimensional nature of the oceans is recognised through the inclusion of the principles of international law within the text of ocean-related legal and policy instruments and in the practice of ocean-mandated institutions. It is concluded that the inclusion of the above-referred principles in several of the ocean-related policy and legal instruments and in the practice of some institutions contributed to a shift in paradigm in <b>ocean</b> <b>governance</b> from a prevalence of sectoral views and uncoordinated proliferation of legal and policy instruments and institutions to a more holistic approach in ocean management. The thesis gives particular consideration to linkages (or their absence) among sectoral management initiatives from a legal and institutional perspective. The results suggest that despite the shift to a more holistic approach in ocean management, there still remain problems due to the prevalence of a dichotomy in <b>ocean</b> <b>governance</b> between the widespread approach towards single use and sectoral management and new approaches that support more integrated, cooperating, ecosystem and precautionary approaches towards <b>ocean</b> <b>governance.</b> This thesis also offers suggestions on how some of the persisting governance problems can be overcome...|$|R
