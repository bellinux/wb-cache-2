However, Moray was subjugated by the Scottish kings after 1130, when the native ruler, Óengus of Moray was killed leading a rebellion. Another revolt in 1187 was equally unsuccessful.|$|E

The transition period from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age in Greece is known as Sub-Mycenaean (c. 1050–1000 BC).|$|E
5|$|The {{area and}} the {{surrounding}} chase were subject to forest law, as a Royal forest.

5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very <b>early</b> <b>period</b> (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

5|$|All {{thirteen}} known Ruisdael etchings {{come from}} his <b>early</b> <b>period,</b> {{with the first}} one dated 1646. It is unknown who taught him the art of etching. No etchings exist signed by his father, his uncle, or his fellow Haarlem landscapist Cornelis Vroom, who influenced his other work. His etchings show little influence from Rembrandt, either in style or technique. Few original impressions exist; five etchings survive in only a single impression. The rarity of prints suggests that Ruisdael considered them trial essays, which did not warrant large editions. The etching expert Georges Duplessis singled out Grainfield at the Edge of a Wood and The Travellers as unrivalled illustrations of Ruisdael's genius.|$|E
5|$|Alt Clut (named {{after the}} Brythonic name for Dumbarton Rock, the Medieval {{capital of the}} Strathclyde region) may have had its origins with the Damnonii people of Ptolemy's Geographia. Two kings are known from near {{contemporary}} sources in this <b>early</b> <b>period.</b> The first is Coroticus or Ceretic (Ceredig), known as the recipient of a letter from Saint Patrick, and stated by a 7th-century biographer to have been king of the Height of the Clyde, Dumbarton Rock, placing him {{in the second half}} of the 5th century. From Patrick's letter it is clear that Ceretic was a Christian, and it is likely that the ruling class of the area were also Christians, at least in name. His descendant Rhydderch Hael is named in Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the famous}} names {{associated}} with Bristol in this <b>early</b> <b>period</b> is Paul Dirac, who graduated in 1921 {{with a degree}} in engineering, before obtaining a second degree in mathematics in 1923 from Cambridge. For his subsequent pioneering work on quantum mechanics, he was awarded the 1933 Nobel Prize for Physics. Later in the 1920s, the H.H. Wills Physics Laboratory was opened by Ernest Rutherford. It has since housed several Nobel Prize winners: Cecil Frank Powell (1950); Hans Albrecht Bethe (1967); and Sir Nevill Francis Mott (1977). The Laboratory stands on the same site today, close to the Bristol Grammar School and the city museum.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. The primitive present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the <b>early</b> <b>period</b> of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|City {{planning}} and urban lifestyles had {{been influenced by}} the Greeks from an <b>early</b> <b>period,</b> and in the eastern Empire, Roman rule accelerated and shaped the local development of cities that already had a strong Hellenistic character. Cities such as Athens, Aphrodisias, Ephesus and Gerasa altered some aspects of city {{planning and}} architecture to conform to imperial ideals, while also expressing their individual identity and regional preeminence. In the areas of the western Empire inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples, Rome encouraged the development of urban centres with stone temples, forums, monumental fountains, and amphitheatres, often on or near the sites of the preexisting walled settlements known as oppida. Urbanization in Roman Africa expanded on Greek and Punic cities along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. It is relatively primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his <b>early</b> <b>period.</b> According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E
