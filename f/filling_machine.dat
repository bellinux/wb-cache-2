50|$|Depending on the {{magnitude}} of the bottling endeavor, there are many different types of bottling machinery available. Liquid level <b>machines</b> <b>fill</b> bottles so they appear to be filled to the same line on every bottle, while volumetric <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> <b>fill</b> each bottle with exactly the same amount of liquid. Overflow pressure fillers are the most popular machines with beverage makers, while gravity <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> are most cost effective. In terms of automation, inline <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> are most popular, but rotary machines are much faster albeit much more expensive.|$|R

50|$|The first aseptic {{packing of}} foods (especially milk in metal cans) {{was carried out}} in Denmark prior to 1913 and in 1921 a patent for this process (termed aseptic conservation) was granted. In 1917, Dunkley in USA {{patented}} sterilization with saturated steam of cans and subsequent filling of pre-sterilized product. In 1923, aseptically packaged milk from South Africa reached a trade fair in London, England in perfect conditions. The American can company developed a <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> in 1933, called the Heat-Cool-Fill (HCF) system which used saturated steam under pressure to sterilize the cans and ends. The sterile cans were filled with sterile product and the ends sealed on in a closed chamber, which was kept pressurized with steam or a mixture of steam and air. Three commercial plants were built and operated on this principle until 1945.|$|E
50|$|AB Tetra Pak was {{established}} in Lund, Sweden, in 1951. In May of that year, the new packaging system {{was presented to the}} press, and in 1952, the first <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> producing 100 ml cream tetrahedrons was delivered to Lundaortens Mejeriförening, a local dairy. In the subsequent years, the tetrahedron packages became more and more frequent in Swedish grocery stores, and in 1954, the first machine producing 500 ml milk packages was sold to a Stockholm dairy. That same year the first machine was exported to Hamburg, Germany, soon to be followed by France (1954), Italy (1956), Switzerland (1957) and later the Soviet Union (1959) and Japan (1962).Rausing relentlessly strove to improve the Tetra Classic system, wrought with many technical problems during the 1950s, and spent enormous amounts on development. The different projects - the tetrahedron, the aseptic packaging technology, Tetra Brik - all demanded extremely large resources and the company had financial troubles well into the 1960s. Indeed, Tetra Pak's commercial breakthrough did not arrive until the mid-1960s with the new Tetra Brik package, introduced in 1963, and the development of the Aseptic technology. To liberate capital, Åkerlund & Rausing was sold in 1965 while AB Tetra Pak was retained.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{processes}} {{have many}} sources of variation; {{most of them}} are minor and may be ignored. If the dominant sources of variation are identified, however, resources for change can be focused on them.If the dominant assignable sources of variation are detected, potentially they can be identified and removed. Once removed, the process is said to be [...] "stable". When a process is stable, its variation should remain within a known set of limits. That is, at least, until another assignable source of variation occurs.For example, a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with 500 grams of cereal. Some boxes will have slightly more than 500 grams, and some will have slightly less. When the package weights are measured, the data will demonstrate a distribution of net weights.If the production process, its inputs, or its environment (for example, the machines on the line) change, the distribution of the data will change. For example, as the cams and pulleys of the machinery wear, the cereal <b>filling</b> <b>machine</b> may put more than the specified amount of cereal into each box. Although this might benefit the customer, from the manufacturer's point of view, this is wasteful and increases the cost of production. If the manufacturer finds the change and its source in a timely manner, the change can be corrected (for example, the cams and pulleys replaced).|$|E

40|$|One of the {{possible}} reasons for post-contamination of extended shelf life (ESL) milk could be attachment and formation of biofilms on stainless steel pipe surfaces. In South Africa, ESL milk processors are still facing challenges extending the shelf life beyond 14 days. It is hypothesized that post-contamination along the milk processing line is responsible of reducing the shelf life of ESL milk. This assumption was investigated by assessing the microorganisms associated with the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> post CIP process and {{this study was designed}} and divided into two phases. Phase one involved isolation and characterisation of the bacteria associated with the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> after CIP process with the aim of determining the diversity of microorganisms attached to the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> Swab samples were collected from a plant processing ESL milk. Twenty swabs were taken from ten different nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> during 4 visits (n= 80). The swab samples were plated on the day of sampling. A total bacterial count ranging from 1. 75 - 1. 95 log CFU/cm 3 with an average of 1. 81 log CFU/cm 3 (n= 80). MALDI-TOF revealed a high percentage of Gram-positive rods (69 %), followed by Gram-positive cocci (20 %) and then Gram-negative rods (7 %). The Gram-positive rods belonging to genus Bacillus were identified as Bacillus cereus, followed by B. pumilus, B. subtilis and Paenibacillus spp. The Gram-positive cocci included S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus and Anaerococcus spp. The Gram-negative rods were identified as Acinetobacter junii. The prevalence of Bacillus spp. noted in the nozzles of ESL aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> is attributed to their ability to resist heat treatment during CIP process and their ability to attach to stainless steel surfaces. There was a degree of similarity in terms of MALDI-TOF MS profiles for the strains of B. cereus, Staphylococcus spp. and Paenibacillus spp. originating from the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines</b> and the packaged ESL milk product. Furthermore, these isolates show close relatedness. These bacteria are likely to originate from the nozzles, dispensed into the final ESL milk during filling process. Phase two aimed at determining cell surface hydrophobicity of the isolates originating from the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> Co-currently the study further determined the ability of B. cereus, S. epidermidis, M. luteus and Paenibacillus spp. to attach and form biofilms on stainless surfaces. The bacterial strains were isolated from the nozzles of aseptic <b>filling</b> <b>machines.</b> The degree of hydrophobicity of the spore formers ranged from 8 - 91 % while non-spore formers ranged from 6 - 67 %. Hydrophobicity of S. hominis, S. epidermidis, Acinetobacter junii and Arthrobacter castelli differed significantly (p? 0. 05). Hydrophobicity of B. pumilus, Paenibacillus spp. and B. cereus (p? 0. 05) differed significantly. Spore formers showed the highest hydrophobicity to solvents, this can be contributed to their hydrophobic nature and their ability to attach to stainless surfaces. A continuous flow reactor system was used to grow biofilm of the isolates in skim milk. The skim milk was inoculated with spore suspension of B. cereus, Paenibacillus spp. and bacterial suspension of M. luteus and S. epidermidis. The bacterial suspensions were run separately over a period of 20 h at 37 °C. Stainless steel strips were submitted to Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) after 22 h. The results suggested that spores of B. cereus and Paenibacillus spp. can only attach whilst M. luteus and S. epidermidis can attach and form biofilms on stainless steel. The ability of these isolates to form biofilms on stainless steel strips could be the main cause of contamination of ESL milk. Strains of Bacillus spp. can form biofilm on stainless steel and limit the shelf life of milk and milk products. However, toxins produced by some of these strains of B. cereus might be contagious to humans. The results confirmed {{that one of the reasons}} of contamination of ESL milk could be the ability of B. cereus to attach to stainless surfaces and M. luteus to form biofilms. Over and above the fact that the spores of B. cereus can lead to spoilage of milk and milk products, a concern is that the toxins produced by some of the strains of B. cereus are detrimental to human health.
