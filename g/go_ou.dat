40|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) {{are among}} the most puzzling forms of develop-mental disability. This term refers to a spectrum of pervasive developmental disorders sharing defi cits in three major domains: social relatedness and inter-activity, communication, and restricted interests and/or stereotypic or repeti-tive behaviors with diffi cult transitions. Studies have investigated genetic fac-tors, neurologic, immunologic, and early environmental insults. ASD are lifelong, often severe disorders impact-ing all facets of individual, family, and community function. Relationships are disrupted, and socially inappropriate behaviors are prominent. Often these children do not cope well with change, making it diffi cult for families to <b>go</b> <b>ou...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Hand hygiene is the simplest, most {{effective}} measure for preventing nosocomial infections. However, {{this technique is}} not consistently translated into clinical practice. Educators must first evaluate current practices to determine what has been effective, what changes need to occur, how to evaluate, and what evidence provides guidelines for best practices. Methods: This article examines current practices of instructing hand hygiene and describes teaching and evaluation strategies used in a nursing fundamental didactic and laboratory course. Instructors used educational strategies, lab practice, and mock hospital simulations to teach and evaluate hand hygiene compliance in the clinical setting. The authors used Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory during both lecture and lab to analyze the effectiveness of hand hygiene education and compliance during evaluations of undergraduate nursing students. Different simulation techniques were evaluated to determine implementations for future improvement. Conclusion: Educators must continue to combine didactic courses and simulations labs to enhance the knowledge and improve skills of undergraduate nursing students. Educators must mentor each other and define clear objectives before teaching a lab simulation or lecture. More research is needed as to what specific concepts should be taught using learning and theoretical models that will ultimately improve patient safety through hand hygiene compliance when nurses <b>go</b> <b>ou...</b>|$|E

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o efeito de seis diferentes tarefas duplas no desempenho funcional de idosos da comunidade. Em 35 idosos com idade média de 69, 6 ± 7, 1 anos foi aplicado o teste de levantar e caminhar cronometrado (TLCC, Timed up and <b>go</b> <b>ou</b> TUG) simples (TLCCS) e associado a duas tarefas motoras - carregar um copo com água (TLCCM 1) e transferir moedas de um bolso para o outro (TLCCM 2) - e duas cognitivas, repetir uma frase (TLCCC 1) e falar os dias da semana em ordem inversa (TLCCC 2), sendo aferidos os acertos e erros nessas tarefas. Houve piora significativa da média do tempo em segundos no TLCC nas tarefas duplas, independente da tarefa, e correlação significativa, de moderada (r= 0, 676) a quase perfeita (r= 0, 953), entre os tempos de cada tipo de TLCC. O número de moedas transferidas no TLCCM 2 e o número de dias na semana dito em ordem inversa no TLCCC 2 apresentaram correlação com o tempo gasto para realizar todas as outras tarefas. Essas duas tarefas foram as que mais afetaram o tempo do TLCC (p The {{purpose was}} to assess the effect of six {{different}} dual tasks in community dwelling elderly. Thirty-five volunteers (aged 69. 6 ± 7. 1 years) were submitted to the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and to further five tasks wherein TUG was associated to two motor tasks - carrying a glass of water (TUGM 1) and transferring coins from one pocket to another (TUGM 2); to two cognitive tasks - repeating a sentence (TUGC 1) and saying weekdays backwards (TUGC 2); and to a motor-cognitive task, of carrying a glass of water while repeating a sentence (TUGMC). Time spent, failure and success in each task were counted. Results showed a significant decrease in average time (in seconds) spent in TUG when associated with all tasks; and a significant correlation from moderate (r= 0. 676) to almost perfect (r= 0. 953) between the times of each association with TUG. The number of transferred coins in TUGM 2 and the number of days of the week correctly said in TUGC 2 showed a correlation with the time spent in all the other tasks. These two tasks most affected the time spent to accomplish TUG (p< 0. 001). Hence, dwelling community elderly showed a decrease in performance at all dual tasks associated to TUG. The worst functional performances were transferring coins from one pocket to another and saying weekdays backwards, showing that task complexity, rather than task nature, had greater impact on the time spent to perform TUG...|$|E

Gibbs' Sooners rebounded with a 9–3 record, a No. 17 finish in the final Associated Press poll and a Sun Bowl victory in 1993. En route, OU beat then-fifth-ranked Texas A, 44–14, and recorded its only victory against Texas under Gibbs. The 1994 season proved to be another letdown, though, as OU finished 6–6. Gibbs announced his resignation prior to OU's losses to Nebraska in the regular-season finale and Brigham Young University in the Copper Bowl. Ultimately, it was his record against Oklahoma's major rivals that did him in. Gibbs went 2–15–1 against Texas, Nebraska and Colorado. In addition to his record, he was thought to be uncomfortable around alumni and the media, and with being a head coach in general. Gibbs' final record as head coach at OU was 44-23-2.|$|R
40|$|In {{response}} to a nationwide decline in U. S. house prices that had signi…cant repercussions for the U.

Most of the proposed reforms include the establishment of new governmental agencies to regulate banks and other …nancial institutions and/or to prohibit or restrict certain types of …nancial transactions. I o¤er several guiding principles for …nancial reform and suggest the types of reforms that are likely to generate the best results based on these principles. Finally, I discuss the role that the central bank can play in mitigating the size, duration, and e¤ects of …nancial crises. While the analysis draws heavily on the U.

S. …nancial crisis was a consequence of a nationwide decline in the U. S. house prices. While a number of analysts–most notably Robert Shiller–warned that house prices were unsustainably high, no governmental regulatory agency, including the Federal Reserve, took any action. While there are many reasons for this, an important one is simply that it is di ¢ cult to identify an asset-price bubble–even after the fact.
