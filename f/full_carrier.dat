2500|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of AM {{is that it}} is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal. [...] The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). [...] However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using envelope detection, providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. [...] In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency) from a greatly reduced [...] "pilot" [...] carrier (in reduced-carrier transmission or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, carrier regeneration is possible using a Costas phase-locked loop.

50|$|At {{the start}} of the carrier {{recovery}} process it is possible to achieve symbol synchronization prior to <b>full</b> <b>carrier</b> recovery because symbol timing can be determined without knowledge of the carrier phase or the carrier's minor frequency variation/offset.

Decision directed methods are suited to synchronizing frequency differences that are less than the symbol rate because comparisons are performed on symbols at, or near, the symbol rate. Other frequency recovery methods may be necessary to achieve initial frequency acquisition.|$|E

5000|$|For transmission, the {{baseband}} signal modulates the {{amplitude of}} the carrier. The modulation index is negative, so higher video level yields lower carrier (RF) level and vice versa. 1 volt (white) video yields only 10% of the <b>full</b> <b>carrier</b> level. The audio signal is frequency-modulated. In a later stage the audio signal is superimposed {{on the video}} signal. [...] If, for any reason, the video signal increases beyond 1 volt, the portion of video in excess of 1 volt begins {{to interfere with the}} audio signal. The repetition rate of a line is about 15 kHz (15625 Hz in system B and 15750 Hz in system M). The repetition rate of a field is 50 or 60 Hz (50 Hz in system B and 60 Hz in system M). So the interference has two components: a very high-pitched sound of 15 kHz and a low-pitched sound of 50 Hz (or 60 Hz). On the other hand, video input in excess of 1.1 volt results in the loss of the carrier level and this tends to shut down the transmitter.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for high performance {{as well as}} low standby power devices has been {{the main reason for}} the aggressive scaling of conventional CMOS transistors. Current devices are at the 32 nm technology node. However, due to physical limitations as well as increase in short-channel effects, leakage, power dissipation, this scaling trend cannot continue and will eventually hit a barrier. In order to overcome this, alternate device topologies have to be considered altogether. Extensive research on ultra thin body double gate FETs and gate all around nanowire FETs has shown a lot of promise. Under strong inversion, these devices have demonstrated increased performance over their bulk counterparts. This is mainly attributed to <b>full</b> <b>carrier</b> inversion in the body. However, these devices are still limited by lithographic and processing challenges making them unsuitable for commercial production. This thesis explores a unique device structure called the CFET (Cylindrical Field Effect Transistors) which also like the above, relies on complete inversion of carriers in the body/bulk. Using dual gates; an outer and an inner gate, full-volume inversion is possible with benefits such as enhanced drive currents, high Ion/Ioff ratios and reduced short channel effects...|$|E
