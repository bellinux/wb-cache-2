5|$|As {{early as}} {{three years after}} independence, the Naga National Council called for a boycott of Independence Day in {{northeast}} India. Separatist protests in this region intensified in the 1980s; calls for boycotts and terrorist attacks by insurgent organisations such as the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, marred celebrations. With increasing insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir from the late 1980s, separatist protesters boycotted Independence Day there with bandh (strikes), use of black flags and by flag burning. Terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Hizbul Mujahideen and the Jaish-e-Mohammed <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> threats, and have carried out attacks around Independence Day. Boycotting of the celebration has also been advocated by insurgent Maoist rebel organisations.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, Philipp was {{transferred}} to Defense of the Reich duties as Geschwaderkommodore (wing commander) of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG1—1st Fighter Wing), flying high altitude interception operations against the USAAF Eighth Air Force over the North Sea and northern Germany. He claimed his 204th victory on 2 May, and his 205th on 18 May before falling ill with appendicitis. This required hospitalization in Meissen.

5|$|Since 1 January 2002, the {{national}} central banks (NCBs) and the ECB <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> euro banknotes on a joint basis. Euro banknotes do not show which central bank issued them. Eurosystem NCBs are required to accept euro banknotes put into circulation by other Eurosystem members and these banknotes are not repatriated. The ECB issues 8% of {{the total value of}} banknotes issued by the Eurosystem. In practice, the ECB's banknotes are put into circulation by the NCBs, thereby incurring matching liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB. These liabilities carry interest at the main refinancing rate of the ECB. The other 92% of euro banknotes are issued by the NCBs in proportion to their respective shares of the ECB capital key, calculated using national share of European Union (EU) population and national share of EU GDP, equally weighted.|$|E
5|$|Since Nagpal's {{suspension}} came {{to public}} view, {{it has been}} alleged that Samajwadi Party leader Narendra Bhati, who has cabinet-minister rank as the chairperson of the UP State Agro Industrial Corporation Limited, was responsible for getting her abruptly suspended because he was frustrated by Nagpal's drive against illegal mining. Bhati was later recorded on video boasting about getting the officer suspended within 40 minutes. Other leaders of the Samajwadi party such as Azam Khan and Naresh Agarwal <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> statements supporting the suspension order.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd {{century was}} the age in which the {{initiative}} for persecution shifted from the masses to the Imperial office.

Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) and Maximin (r. 235–38) are alleged to <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> general rescripts against the religion and targeted its clergy, but the evidence for their acts is obscure and contested. There is no evidence that Philip effected any changes to the Christians' legal status. Pogroms against the Christians in Alexandria took place while Philip was still emperor.

5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of heat at a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
5|$|In February 1992, European Union {{countries}} {{signed the}} Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The first stage centered on liberalizing capital mobility and aligning macroeconomic policies between countries. The second stage established the European Monetary Institute which was ultimately dissolved {{in tandem with}} the establishment in 1998 of the European Central Bank (ECB) and European System of Central Banks. Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. The third and final stage introduced a common currency for circulation known as the Euro, adopted by eleven of then-fifteen members of the European Union in January 1999. In doing so, they disaggregated their sovereignty in matters of monetary policy. These countries continued to circulate their national legal tenders, exchangeable for euros at fixed rates, until 2002 when the ECB began issuing official Euro coins and notes. , the EMU comprises 17 nations which <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> the Euro, and 11 non-Euro states.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of DFS has been determined on a state-by-state basis based on local gambling laws and other rulings. The federal Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIEGA) contains language dictating that fantasy sports are not considered an unlawful wager under the act; however, the act only prohibits the electronic transfer of funds from unlawful gambling as defined under state laws. A number of state attorneys general <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> opinions concluding that DFS {{is a form of}} illegal gambling, while the state of Nevada declared that DFS games must be licensed as a sports pool. The New York State ruling, which resulted from an investigation of DFS services after it was alleged that employees working for DraftKings and FanDuel had used inside information to win cash prizes from each other, spawned retaliatory lawsuits from the companies which alleged that the rulings were the result of a misinterpretation of the nature of their services. The state has since joined other states, such as Massachusetts and Virginia, in choosing to legalize and regulate DFS rather than prohibit it.|$|E

5|$|The WHL {{folded in}} 1926, and its assets were {{bought by the}} NHL. This left the NHL as the only league left {{competing}} for the Cup. Other leagues and clubs <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> challenges, but from that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for it, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the cup to the NHL, allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished {{to play for the}} Cup. A 2006 Ontario Superior Court case found that the trustees had gone against Lord Stanley's conditions in the 1947 agreement. The NHL has agreed to allow other teams to play for the Cup should the league not be operating, {{as was the case in}} the 2004–05 NHL lockout.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Compact Disc, the various labels for which Horowitz {{recorded}} began reissuing his pre-digital recordings. This began in the mid-1980s and increased in the years immediately following Horowitz’s death. Beginning in 1987, Columbia issued single-composer compilations drawn from various albums. RCA Victor issued many of Horowitz’s recordings on their Gold Seal mid-priced label. By 1993, both Columbia's and RCA's entire cache of previously issued recordings was available on CD, including several older items which had never appeared on LP. A number of items were issued more than once, including the 1978 recording of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 which was issued on CD in 1987, again in 1993, with a new cover, and in a new remastering in 2000. Over the past two decades, several previously unavailable Horowitz recordings have been issued. These include studio and live recordings from the Columbia era, and a collection from Carnegie Hall recitals between 1945 and 1951 which were recorded privately by Horowitz. In addition, several smaller labels <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> CDs made from bootleg recordings from the 1960s onward and several of Horowitz’s stereo recordings have been issued in the blu-spec and SHM-CD (Super High Material) formats.|$|E
5|$|Avi Shlaim, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the University of Oxford, {{asserts that}} two main {{schools of thought}} have been {{developed}} {{on the question of}} the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the World Zionist Organization, and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to <b>have</b> <b>issued</b> a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the University of Haifa, proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government’s wider agenda to partition the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
