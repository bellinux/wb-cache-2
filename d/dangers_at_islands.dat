40|$|Outbreaks of the {{crown-of-thorns starfish}} (COTS), Acanthaster planci, have {{occurred}} at many locations throughout the Indo-Pacific {{and are a}} major contributor to widespread coral loss and reef degradation. The causes of outbreaks remain controversial, but are commonly attributed to anthropogenically elevated nutrients and/or over-fishing. If so, it seems unlikely that outbreaks would occur in reef systems that are largely isolated from anthropogenic disturbances. However, high densities of COTS were recently observed on reefs in the Chagos Archipelago, a remote group of atolls and banks within the central Indian Ocean, which experience very limited anthropogenic influence. Aggregations of COTS were first noticed <b>at</b> Eagle <b>Island</b> in 2012, which, although unquantified, appeared to be at outbreak levels, and very high densities (1624 km^− 2) were subsequently recorded <b>at</b> <b>Danger</b> <b>Island</b> in 2013. While these islands are uninhabited by humans, it is possible that nutrient inputs result from upwelling zones around the Archipelago, or high densities of breeding seabirds. Among islands within the Great Chagos Bank, densities of the red-footed booby Sula sula ranged from 8 to 7888 individuals km^− 2, with associated guano input ranging from 96 to 25, 381 kg island^− 1 year^− 1. However, Danger and Eagle Islands where high COTS densities were recorded, had both high and low levels of guano production, respectively, which suggests that outbreaks may not be directly linked to guano nutrient enrichment. Other factors which might be responsible for intermittent COTS outbreaks should be considered in isolated reef systems such as the Chagos Archipelago. ...|$|R

40|$|PT X is a {{vegetable}} oils company that produces coconut oil and palm oil. PT X has not have Occupational Safety and Health Management System, so {{the numbers of}} accidents tends to increase. This thesis was conducted to design Occupational Safety and Health Management System for production area. The design includes fire and flood prevention, health service, personal protective equipment (PPE), safety signs, and B 3 spills. Firstly, hazard identification and risk assessment were conducted to determine the level of danger based on Risk Priority Number (RPN). The greater the RPN, the more dangerous. Hazard identification and risk assessment were {{carried out in the}} production area namely Plant- 1, Plant- 2, and Plant- 3. Source of the greatest <b>danger</b> <b>at</b> Plant- 1 (RPN= 108) is the open conveyor. Source of the greatest <b>danger</b> <b>at</b> Plant- 2 (RPN= 84) is loud noise produced by vacuum forming machine. Source of the greatest <b>danger</b> <b>at</b> Plant- 3 extraction (RPN= 64) is hexane tank. Source of the greatest <b>danger</b> <b>at</b> Plant- 3 pelletizing (RPN= 96) is dusty work area and workers negligent in use of PPE. The risk assessment also accompanied by precautions so that accidents do not happen again. ...|$|R
