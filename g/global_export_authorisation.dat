40|$|In 1976 <b>global</b> <b>exports</b> {{for fish}} and {{fisheries}} products was approximately $ 8 billion. In 2000, <b>global</b> <b>exports</b> exceeded $ 55 billion. The period between 1985 and 1995 witnessed the tripling of <b>global</b> fisheries <b>exports.</b> This {{represents more than}} half of total value of global fisheries production. Developing countries began to increase their share of this total during the 1990 s and now account for {{more than half of}} <b>global</b> <b>exports.</b> In 2000 the net trade value (exports minus imports) for developing country seafood exports exceeded $ 18 billion. Taken at face value these statistics suggest that the monetary benefits of fisheries trade have increased in the wake of EEZ extension with developing countries benefiting the most. These statistics fail to reflect some important costs, however. Such costs include subsidies to the fishing industry and a variety of social and environmental externalities associated with changes in fishing activity. They also tell us little about how both costs and benefits resulting from fisheries trade our distributed among a variety of affected stakeholders within fisheries and the communities that depend upon them. In particular, the trends depicted above have been criticized for adverse impacts on small-scale fishing communities and their historical institutional arrangements. This paper will explore the interplay between seafood trade, fisheries management and human livelihoods. The paper will argue that economic structure of a given fisheries sector, the political organization of its industry, and the institutional arrangements that govern it all play important roles in determining the size and distribution of costs and benefits associated with the expansion of seafood trade...|$|R

The data are obtained from ‘The Small Statistical Yearbook’ for years 1930 – 1939 and cover the period 1922 – 1939. The tests were conducted using statistical program ‘Gretl’ and the results were confronted with the selected literature. The analysis concerned the following dependences: import and export in Poland; import and domestic trade turnover in Poland; export and domestic trade turnover in Poland; Polish global import and import through the port of Gdynia; Polish global import and import through the port of Gdansk; Polish <b>global</b> <b>export</b> and export through the port of Gdynia; Polish <b>global</b> <b>export</b> and export through the port of Gdansk.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} independent exchange rate policy, relative to other determinants, on <b>global</b> <b>export</b> performance of WAMZ countries. The regression results show that exports originating from the Zone {{to the rest of}} the world are influenced positively by domestic output, export prices and exchange rate devaluations, but negatively by import price and economic performance of the major global trading partner, proxied by the US GDP. This result is not universal as the Gambia, Ghana and Guinea total exports functions show that exchange rate policy penalized exports contrary to the Nigerian case in which the coefficient estimate is significant and positive. The study infers that these results are consistent with theoretical expectation given the ironical divergence in export basket. Although they are all primary commodity exporters, Nigeria’s exports is mainly crude oil, and a priori expectation is that rapid economic growth or booms in the US should lead to increased demand for energy (healthy competitions). In conclusion, the study infers that since independent flexible exchange rate policy makes no difference to the Zonal export performance ex ante, but have great potential for <b>global</b> <b>exports</b> collectively, they could explore an OCA to enhance both intra- and <b>global</b> inter-regional <b>export</b> trade. ...|$|R

Additionally, the impact of China's ICT export expansion on the other countries' export performance is investigated econometrically with a panel-data model. Our empirical analysis on the likely negative China-effects indicates that such effects are present and statistically significant. However, those effects have a rather weak quantitative impact on the other countries' export specialisation in ICT goods. <b>global</b> trade; <b>export</b> performance; China; ICT; information technology; communications technology; specialisation patterns; econometrics; panel-data; global markets; high-tech electronics. ...|$|R
