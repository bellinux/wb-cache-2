5000|$|Robbery is <b>the</b> crime <b>of</b> taking or {{attempting}} {{to take anything}} of value by force, threat of force or by putting the victim in fear. According to common law, robbery is defined as taking <b>the</b> property <b>of</b> another, with <b>the</b> intent to permanently deprive <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> that property, by means of force or fear; that is to say, it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault. Precise <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence</b> may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting or car theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are triable either way, whereas robbery is triable only on indictment. The word [...] "rob" [...] came via French from Late Latin words (e.g. deraubare) of Germanic origin, from Common Germanic raub -- [...] "theft".|$|R

5000|$|... the {{definition}} of the actus reus elements of the crime must be wide enough to include a continuing sequence of events. Some offences are either frozen in time or geography because they are defined either as activities being undertaken when the harm occurs (e.g. driving offences), or in terms of their consequences. For example, {{the definition}} of a [...] "deception" [...] is some form of dishonest representation that induces the victim to do or refrain from doing something that causes him or her loss. Anything else is preparatory or anticipatory to this key intellectual event. Thus, to facilitate a prosecution of X, the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence</b> in State A must include writing and posting the letter in State A as well as the operation of the letter upon the mind of the recipient in the State B.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue with}} {{automatism}} {{is that when}} the issue is raised by the defence as a realistic defence (an evidentiary basis), the prosecution then has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant was acting voluntarily. This is the case for several other defences e.g. duress. The justification for this is that voluntary action is part of the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence,</b> and therefore something under the presumption of innocence the prosecution has to prove. The evidentiary burden was laid down in Hill v Baxter where the defence of automatism failed because there was no good evidence for the alleged blackout. Evidentiary burden means that the defendant needs to provide evidence to satisfy the judge that the issue should be put to the jury, which normally requires medical evidence (although R v Woolley, in which an HGV driver crashed after sneezing, proved an exception).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence</b> in {{criminal}} law treaty plays several roles. First and foremost, {{it has the}} symbolic, normative role of expressing society's condemnation of the forbidden acts. Second, it facilitates agreement. Since states tend to be reluctant to undertake stringent obligations in matters related to the exercise of their domestic jurisdiction, a precise definition of the crime, which restricts the scope of those obligations, makes agreement less costly. Third, it provides an inter-subjective basis for the homogeneous application of the treaty's obligations on judicial and police cooperation. This function is of particular importance in extradition treaties because, to grant an extradition, most legal systems require that the crime be punishable both in the requesting state and the requested state. Fourth, it helps states to enact domestic legislation to criminalize and punish the wrongful acts defined in the treaty in conformity with their human rights' obligations. The principle of nullum crimen sine lege requires, in particular, that states define precisely which acts are prohibited before anyone can be prosecuted or punished for committing those same acts.|$|E
5000|$|Goddard, CJ, sitting alone, {{considered}} intention, {{making it}} clear that the prosecution bore the burden of proving the specific intent required by the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence.</b> This point had been settled by Woolmington v. DPP in 1935 although no authorities were cited in his judgement. The pivotal dictum in the case is thatif the prosecution prove an act the natural consequences of which would be a certain result ... then a jury may ... find that the prisoner is guilty of doing the act with the intent alleged ... but, if ... there is room for more than one view as to the intent of the prisoner ... (and) if they either think that the intent did not exist or they are left in doubt as to the intent, the prisoner is entitled to be acquitted.Goddard also referred to duress as a possible defence but ruled that it was unnecessary to consider it because of the particular conditions pertaining while the defendant was under the control of an enemy power. He said that an inference must be drawn that the defendant intended the natural consequences of his acts merely from {{the fact that he did}} them, but went on to say that this did not necessarily impute a guilty intent.Having stated this, Goddard then decided Steane's appeal on the basis of the trial judge's summing up, stating that the various threats to which the defendant had been exposed were not adequately put to the jury and that as a result the jury may well have been left with the impression that, as a man must be taken to intend the natural consequence of his actions, these matters as to which he had given evidence were of no moment.and on this basis quashed the conviction.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{imputation}} in penal law generated, through out the history, many controversies. The principal {{aim of this}} study is to clarify this concept, both in relation with the Romanian and foreign doctrine, and with the new provisions of the new Penal code, enforced by the Law nr. 286 / 2009. The new Penal code introduces, a new <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence,</b> containing the concept of “imputability”. Our study is based both on the opinions of some foreign authors regarding the concept of imputability, imputation and Romanian authors. According to the Initiator (Ministry of Justice) the main justification for introducing this concept into the offence definition was that “a deed, in order to bring upon criminal responsibility, must not only to correspond with the legal description, to be unjustified, but also, the deed, must be able to be imputable to the offender; that means, the deed could be reproached to the offender. In order to discuss this concept of imputation, there are necessary some premises: the offender must have had the representation of his/her actions or inactions and the lack of any duress (the offender should not have been irresponsible, intoxicated or an under aged). In addition, the offender must have known the illicit character of the deed when committing the offence (the lack of error). Also, the study is structured in tree parts, fist beginning with the need for a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence,</b> second part refers to the concept of offence in Romanian law; third part (the extended one) is dedicated to the essential features of the offence, with a special view on imputation/imputability...|$|E

40|$|Until {{relatively}} recently, <b>the</b> {{common law}} <b>offence</b> <b>of</b> misconduct {{in public office}} has been regarded as anachronistic. <b>The</b> <b>offence</b> was perceived to have been supplanted by specific statutory offences that could more appropriately deal with criminal conduct by public officials. However, {{there has been a}} revival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence</b> with successful prosecutions occurring in Australia, England and Hong Kong. Many of these contemporary cases have involved police officers. Examination of these cases reveals that the circumstances in which misconduct in public office has been identified have been diverse, including <b>the</b> unauthorised disclosure <b>of</b> confidential information, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> false search warrants and <b>the</b> sexual exploitation <b>of</b> vulnerable persons.

This chapter examines the Victorian contribution to that transformation. It will commence with a discussion of the ‘fair labelling’ of homicide offences before outlining two alternative model codifications of the crime of murder and comparing them with the Victorian law of murder. The first is the Australian Model Criminal Code <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offence</b> in Chapter 5, Fatal Offences Against the Person 1998 (Model Criminal Code Officers Committee (MCCOC, 1998)).

With the recent legislative abolition of ‘defensive homicide’, Victoria has come close to accepting the Model Criminal Code recommendations for reform.

The case originated from two custody orders issued by the Judge of Preliminary Inquiries (Giudice per le Indagini Preliminari (hereafter ‘GIP’)) of the Tribunal of Naples on 18 November 2005 and 23 January 2006 against an individual suspected of terrorist activity who had been investigated for offences under Articles 270 bis cp (Association with purpose of international terrorism and subversion of the democratic order), 416 cp (Criminal association), and 81, 110, 482, 648 cp (Complicity in counterfeit documents). The Tribunal of Re-examination (Tribunale del Riesame) of Naples subsequently conﬁrmed the custody orders. The suspect appealed to the Court of Cassation against the orders in separate proceedings which were subsequently joined. The suspect argued before the court that the orders were made on irrational grounds, and suggested, in particular, that a simple ideological adhesion to the principles which inspire most grave terrorist attacks, or even a sentiment of hostility towards Western people, did not constitute an offence under Article 270 bis cp. The suspect submitted that the mere expression of a will would not be punishable and, in conclusion, that the judge had distorted the facts of the matter. The Court of Cassation held that the offence of association with the purpose of international terrorism is made out by the ideological adhesion to serious criminal intentions aimed at committing acts of terrorism, even if the material execution of those acts never takes place...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The 9 / 11 {{terrorist}} attacks in New York and Washington lifted counter-terrorism to <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European security agenda. The bombings in Madrid of March 2004 and in London of July 2005 proved that Europe is also a target <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new forms <b>of</b> international terrorism. <b>The</b> EU has since been trying {{to react to the}} terrorist threat with a comprehensive strategy grounded on four core objectives: prevent, protect, pursue and respond. The Union has also reshaped its institutional and legal counter-terrorist framework. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> some EU bodies has been strengthened, while new institutional actors have been set up. The most important EU institutions in the fight against terrorism have proved to be the European Commission, Europol and Eurojust. Despite some good results achieved, lack of co-ordination and difficulties in information sharing are weaknesses that still hamper <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> an effective intelligence and judicial co-operation. A new European common <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> terrorist <b>offences,</b> <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Arrest Warrant and <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> biometrics are pioneering legal instruments in counter-terrorism. Such legal tools have enhanced <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU action in preventing and suppressing terrorism. On the other hand, they have raised concerns about fundamental rights and civil liberties. This paper is aimed at providing an initial evaluation of both institutional and legal aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU fight against terrorism. Whilst acknowledging <b>the</b> achievement <b>of</b> many positive results, this assessment leads also {{to the conclusion that the}} European Union has to further step up its efforts to remedy a number of inadequacies and weaknesses arising in both the institutional and legal frameworks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU counter-terrorism response...|$|R
