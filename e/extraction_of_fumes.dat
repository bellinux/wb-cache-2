40|$|The <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> welding <b>fumes</b> must be {{optimised}} {{in order}} to achieve an improvement in the working conditions for welders and protection from harmful welding fumes. The integrated extractor torches offer a high potential here since these permit extraction directly at the place where the fumes originate and make the laborious handling <b>of</b> an <b>extraction</b> hood unnecessary. In order to allow the further minimisation of the burdens caused by harmful metal oxides arising during welding, a comprehensive investigation of systems already available on the market was conducted within the framework of a research project and an optimised trade-off (compromise) solution was developed from this. For this purpose, the existing systems were initially investigated and assessed with the aid of CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation and a special schlieren test bench. On the basis of the specific properties of the systems investigated in each case, it was possible to develop the trade-off solution and to investigate and assess it also using CFD simulations and the schlieren test bench in realistic conditions. Not only the welding fume extraction but also the shielding gas coverage were investigated and assessed in this respect so that the extractor torch system could be optimised in an all-encompassing way. The measurement <b>of</b> the welding <b>fume</b> emissions made it possible to confirm the good results for the trade-off solution and to prove a distinct reduction in the harmful emissions in comparison with other extractor torch variants. Thus, a system which unites a high extraction capacity with good shielding gas coverage and, at the same time, has a compact construction shape is now available. It may not only reduce the dangers for the welder due to harmful welding fumes but also increase the competitiveness of welding plants using local extraction systems and an optimised welding quality...|$|R

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the formulation of}} multipurpose grease using red gypsum from titanium dioxide manufacturing wastes. Greases produced with different amount <b>of</b> <b>fume</b> silica (FS) and red gypsum in its compositions. The effect of red gypsum’s and fumed silica’s concentrations on the formulated greases has been studied. The grease mixture is formulated using silicone oil as base oil, fumed silica and red gypsum as thickener, molybdenum disulphide as additive and iron octoate as anti-oxidant agent. Amount <b>of</b> <b>fumed</b> silica involves 2 - 20 % wt (2 % wt, 7 % wt, 16 % wt and 20 % wt). All the fume silica proportions covered (70 % gypsum, 30 % FS), (60 % gypsum, 40 % FS) and (50 % gypsum, 50 % FS). The testing (penetration test, type of thickener, dropping point test, and amount of oil separated) have been done on the formulated greases to determine the properties. It was discovered that formulated grease has no dropping point until 260 o C which proves that the greases has stable structure at higher temperature. All the formulated greases proved to be composed of non-melt thickener type. As the amount <b>of</b> <b>fumed</b> silica and red gypsum increase oil separation decreases and {{the consistency of the}} greases increases. The penetration also significantly decreases as fumed silica addition increases. This is due to the larger strength and small size <b>of</b> <b>fumed</b> silica. The larger strength <b>of</b> <b>fumed</b> silica was thought to be due to the structure being knit together by means of primary valence bonds. It can be concluded that the formulated grease is multi purpose grease. Higher the amount <b>of</b> <b>fumed</b> silica and gypsum (thickener), better the grease’s quality. Therefore, the formulated greases has high potential to be used in wide range of industries such as the cars, ships, aircrafts and most of the industries that deals with heavy duty equipments...|$|R

Using an additive equation of OEL and exposure concentration of each hazardous component, health risk in welders with combined exposure to welding fumes and gases was assessed as 18. 6 to 46. 0 times of OEL, which exceeded the unity.
