40|$|We {{previously}} reported that DNA vaccination {{was able to}} elicit cellular immune responses and partial protection against Chlamydia trachomatis infection. However, DNA immunization alone did not generate immune responses or protection as great as that induced by using live organisms. In this study, we evaluated the immunologic effects of a combinational vaccination approach using C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) major outer membrane protein (MOMP) DNA priming followed by boosting with immune-stimulating complexes (<b>ISCOM)</b> of MOMP protein (MOMP <b>ISCOM)</b> for protection of BALB/c mice against MoPn lung infection. Substantially better protection to challenge infection was observed in mice given combinational vaccination compared with mice given MOMP <b>ISCOM</b> immunization alone, and the protection approximated that induced by live organisms. Enhanced protection was correlated with stronger delayed-type hypersensitivity, higher levels of gamma interferon production, and increased immunoglobulin A antibody responses in lung homogenates. The results indicate that DNA priming followed by <b>ISCOM</b> protein boosting {{may be useful in}} designing a fully protective chlamydial vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Dogs {{and mice}} were immunized {{with either a}} rabies {{glycoprotein}} subunit vaccine incorporated into an immune stimulating complex (<b>ISCOM)</b> or a commercial human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) prepared from a Pitman Moore (PM) rabies vaccine strain. Pre-exposure vaccination of mice with two intraperitoneal (i. p.) doses of 360 ng <b>ISCOM</b> or 0. 5 ml HDCV protected 95 % (38 / 40) and 90 % (36 / 40) of mice, respectively, against a lethal intracerebral (i. c.) dose with challenge virus strain (CVS). One 360 ng i. p. dose of <b>ISCOM</b> protected 87. 5 % (35 / 40) of mice against i. c. challenge with CVS. Three groups of five dogs were vaccinated intramuscularly (i. m.) with 730 ng of rabies <b>ISCOM</b> prepared from either the PM or the CVS rabies strains, and they resisted lethal street rabies challenge. Postexposure treatment of mice {{with three or four}} 120 ng i. m. doses of <b>ISCOM</b> protected 90 % (27 / 30) and 94 % (45 / 48), respectively, of mice inoculated in the footpad with street rabies virus, but three doses of HDCV conferred no protection. When four doses of HDCV were administered postexposure, 78 % (32 / 41) of the mice died of anaphylactic shock; 21 % (11 / 52) of mice had already died of rabies 4 days after the third vaccine dose was administered...|$|R
40|$|Rinderpest virus (RPV), {{a member}} of genus Morbillivirus in the family Paramyxoviridae, causes an acute and often fatal disease in cattle and other large ruminants. A subunit {{rinderpest}} vaccine consisting of an immune-stimulating complex (<b>ISCOM)</b> incorporating the RPV haemaggulutinin (H) protein, was examined {{for its ability to}} induce protective immunity in cattle, the natural host of RPV. All of four cattle vaccinated with the <b>ISCOM</b> vaccine survived challenge with virulent virus. Three were solidly protected, showing no clinical signs of infection, while the fourth animal developed only mild and transient symptoms.

40|$|Cancer {{vaccines}} aim {{to induce}} CTL responses against tumors. Challenges for vaccine design are targeting Ag to dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo, facilitating cross-presentation, and conditioning the microenvironment for Th 1 type immune responses. In this study, {{we report that}} <b>ISCOM</b> vaccines, which consist of ISCOMATRIX adjuvant and protein Ag, meet these challenges. Subcutaneous injection of an <b>ISCOM</b> vaccine in mice led to a substantial influx and activation of innate and adaptive immune effector cells in vaccine site-draining lymph nodes (VDLNs) as well as IFN-gamma production by NK and NKT cells. Moreover, an <b>ISCOM</b> vaccine containing the model Ag OVA (OVA/ISCOM vaccine) was efficiently taken up by CD 8 alpha(+) DCs in VDLNs and induced their maturation and IL- 12 production. Adoptive transfer of transgenic OT-I T cells revealed highly efficient cross-presentation of the OVA/ISCOM vaccine in vivo, whereas cross-presentation of soluble OVA was poor even at a 100 -fold higher concentration. Cross-presenting activity was restricted to CD 8 alpha(+) DCs in VDLNs, whereas Langerin(+) DCs and CD 8 alpha(-) DCs were dispensable. Remarkably, compared with other adjuvant systems, the OVA/ISCOM vaccine induced a high frequency of OVA-specific CTLs capable of tumor cell killing in different tumor models. Thus, <b>ISCOM</b> vaccines combine potent immune activation with Ag delivery to CD 8 alpha(+) DCs in vivo for efficient induction of CTL responses.

50|$|ISCOM {{technology}} {{was invented in}} 1982 by Professor Bror Morein at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Uppsala. The key components of <b>ISCOMs</b> are the Quillaja saponins, which are derived from the bark of the Chilean soap-bark tree Quillaja saponaria Molina. Quillaja saponins are well known {{for their ability to}} activate the immune system. It is also known that saponins in general can have toxic side-effects, including the induction of haemolysis. However, when Quillaia saponins, cholesterol and phospholipids are mixed under the specific stoichiometry that forms <b>ISCOMs,</b> this haemolytic activity is practically eliminated, while the adjuvant activity is retained.|$|E
50|$|The {{congress}} also holds pre-course masterclasses about research skills, {{and a great}} variety of workshops during the congress days on practical skills. Besides that <b>ISCOMS</b> offers keynote lectures from renowned scientist presenting their research to the participants.|$|E
50|$|<b>ISCOMS</b> is {{more than}} just a congress; it also {{incorporates}} several different projects. The <b>ISCOMS</b> Research Fellowships (IRF) is such a project and is unique in Europe and has become an integral part of the experience. It provides a starting point for students to pursue a career in medical sciences, broaden their scientific network, increase the range of their knowledge and amplify their experience with research by giving 25 enthusiastic and talented students the opportunity to join a research group in the University Medical Center Groningen. During a challenging two-week period, chosen students will work on their own individual project and for some this may transcend into a chance to conduct a long-term PhD project in Groningen.|$|E

5000|$|... ‘Healthy Ageing’ is {{the primary}} focus of research, patient care, and {{education}} & training within the University of Groningen and the University Medical Center Groningen. Knowing that ageing of the population poses an increasing burden on society, and that associated disabilities and diseases incur increasing economic, healthcare, infrastructural and personal costs that tax national societies heavily, stimulation of a healthy lifestyle is a key {{in order to deal with}} this societal challenge. Therefore, <b>ISCOMS</b> continues to emphasize the importance of ‘Healthy Ageing’. It is well known that lifestyles, nutritional patterns, the amount of exercise, and the use of medication are all factors that affect the development of health. However, the influences of these factors and the way they relate to each other is still unclear. As such, <b>ISCOMS</b> is proud to contribute to the gaining of new knowledge.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a minimally-invasive neural interface for distributed wireless electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording systems. The proposed interface equips all necessary components for ECoG recording, {{such as the}} high performance front-end integrated circuits, a fabricated flexible microelectrode array, and wireless communication inside a miniaturized custom-made platform. The multiple units of the interface systems can be deployed to cover {{a broad range of}} the target brain region and transmit signals via a built-in intra-skin communication (<b>ISCOM)</b> module. The core integrated circuit (IC) consists of 16 -channel, low-power push-pull double-gated preamplifiers, in-channel successive approximation register analog-to-digital converters (SAR ADC) with a single-clocked bootstrapping switch and a time-delayed control unit, an <b>ISCOM</b> module for wireless data transfer through the skin instead of a power-hungry RF wireless transmitter, and a monolithic voltage/current reference generator to support the aforementioned analog and mixed-signal circuit blocks. The IC was fabricated using 250 nm CMOS processes in an area of 3. 2 × 0. 9 mm 2 and achieved the low-power operation of 2. 5 µW per channel. Input-referred noise was measured as 5. 62 µVrms for 10 Hz to 10 kHz and ENOB of 7. 21 at 31. 25 kS/s.

40|$|Immune {{stimulating}} complex (<b>iscom)</b> matrix is a formulation {{that is used}} as an adjuvant within research. The {{capability of}} the <b>iscom</b> matrix to elicit an immune response when not present together with an antigen has not been extensively investigated. One way to evaluate {{the status of the}} immune system is to measure the amount of cytokines that usually are produced by various cell types during an immune response. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the early immune responses in porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after stimulation in vitro with the <b>iscom</b> matrix, AbISCO®- 100. The immune response was evaluated by measuring the mRNA expression for various cytokines, a chemokine receptor (CXCR 4) and regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS 16) in porcine PBMC after stimulation with AbISCO®- 100 or other inducers like a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN 2216) used as controls. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed low increase (p ≤ 0. 05) in mRNA expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α after 6 hours of stimulation with AbISCO®- 100. This result indicates that AbISCO®- 100 may have the capacity to evoke a cytokine response by itself. In addition, low but detectable increases in expression of IL- 10, CXCR 4 and RGS 16 were observed in one of five pigs after stimulation with AbISCO®- 100. In comparison, mRNA for IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 10 (p ≤ 0. 001), IL- 12 p 40 and TNF-α (p ≤ 0. 01) was induced after 6 hours exposure of the PBMC to LPS and for IFN-α (p ≤ 0. 01) after 6 h in the presence of ODN 2216. Proliferation and viability test performed, demonstrated that AbISCO®- 100 was not mitogenic and just had a small lytic effect on the PBMC. Thus, the <b>iscom</b> matrix, AbISCO®- 100, does not appear to be toxic or induce any harmful early inflammatory responses in porcine PBMC. An extended period of incubation and use of a lager number of pigs are needed to better examine the effects of AbISCO®- 100...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the effect of a}} novel kind of immune-stimulating complexes (<b>ISCOMs)</b> on human skin penetration of model compounds in vitro to evaluate their potential as a delivery system, ultimately for transcutaneous vaccination. Special focus was on elucidating the mechanisms of penetration. Preparation of <b>ISCOMs</b> was done by dialysis and subsequent purification in a sucrose density gradient. The penetration pathways of acridine-labeled <b>ISCOMs</b> were visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to evaluate the ultrastructural changes in the skin after application of the <b>ISCOMs</b> with or without hydration. Transcutaneous permeation of the model compound, methyl nicotinate, was evaluated in diffusion cells. The prepared <b>ISCOMs</b> were 42 – 52  nm in diameter as evaluated by dynamic light scattering with zeta potentials of − 33 to − 26. 1  mV. TEM investigations verified the presence of ISCOM structures. Penetration of acridine into skin was greatly increased by incorporation into <b>ISCOMs</b> as visualized by CLSM. Permeation of methyl nicotinate was enhanced in the presence of <b>ISCOMs.</b> Ultrastructural changes of the intercellular space in the stratum corneum after exposure of <b>ISCOMs</b> were observed on micrographs, especially for hydrated skin. In conclusion, cutaneous application of <b>ISCOMs</b> leads to increased penetration of hydrophobic model compounds through human stratum corneum and thus shows potential as a transcutaneous delivery system. The increased penetration seems to be reflected by a change in the intercellular space between the corneocytes, and the effect is most likely caused by the components of the <b>ISCOMs</b> rather than intact <b>ISCOMs...</b>|$|E

40|$|ISCOM is an {{efficient}} mucosal delivery system for RSV envelope proteins {{as measured by}} antibody responses in respiratory tract secretions and in sera of mice following two intranasal (i. n.) administrations. Intranasally administered RSV <b>ISCOMs</b> induced high levels of IgA antibodies both in the upper respiratory tract and in the lungs. In the lungs, a prominent and long-lasting IgA response was recorded, which still persisted 22 weeks after the second i. n. immunization when the experiment ended. Subcutaneous (s. c.) immunization only induced low IgA titres in the upper respiratory tract and no measurable response to RSV {{was found in the}} lungs. Differences were also noticed in serum between the i. n. and s. c. modes of immunization. <b>ISCOMs</b> given intranasally induced earlier, higher and longer lasting IgM and IgG 1 serum anti-RSV antibody responses than those induced by the s. c. mode of administration. A low serum IgE response was only detectable at 2 weeks after i. n. immunization with <b>ISCOMs</b> and after s. c. immunization with an inactivated virus, but no IgE response was detectable after s. c. injection of <b>ISCOMs.</b> The serum IgA response was more pronounced following s. c. injection of inactivated virus than after i. n. application of <b>ISCOMs,</b> and a clear-cut booster effect was obtained with a second immunization.

40|$|The {{development}} of subunit vaccines requires {{the use of}} adjuvants that act by stimulating components of the innate immune response. Immune-stimulating complexes (<b>ISCOMS)</b> containing the saponin adjuvant Quil A are potential vaccine vectors that induce a wide range of Ag-specific responses in vivo encompassing both humoral and CD 4 and CD 8 cell-mediated immune responses. <b>ISCOMS</b> are active by both parenteral and mucosal routes, but the basis for their adjuvant properties is unknown. Here we have investigated the ability of <b>ISCOMS</b> to recruit and activate innate immune responses as measured in peritoneal exudate cells. The i. p. injection of <b>ISCOMS</b> induced intense local inflammation, with early recruitment of neutrophils and mast cells followed by macrophages, dendritic cells, and lymphocytes. Many of the recruited cells had phenotypic evidence of activation and secreted a number of inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide, reactive oxygen intermediates, IL- 1, IL- 6, IL- 12, and IFN-γ. Of the factors that we investigated further only IL- 12 appeared to be essential for the immunogenicity of <b>ISCOMS,</b> as IL- 6 - and inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout (KO) mice developed normal immune responses to OVA in <b>ISCOMS,</b> whereas these responses were markedly reduced in IL- 12 KO mice. The recruitment of peritoneal exudate cells following an injection of <b>ISCOMS</b> was impaired in IL- 12 KO mice, indicating a role for IL- 12 in establishing the proinflammatory cascade. Thus, <b>ISCOMS</b> prime Ag-specific immune responses at least in part by activating IL- 12 -dependent aspects of the innate immune system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the horse, {{conventional}} inactivated or subunit vaccines against {{equine influenza}} virus (EIV) induce a short-lived antibody-based immunity to infection. Alternative strategies of vaccination have been subsequently developed {{to mimic the}} long-term protection induced by natural infection with the virus. One of these approaches {{is the use of}} immune-stimulating complex (<b>ISCOM)</b> -based vaccines. <b>ISCOM</b> vaccines induce a strong antibody response and protection against influenza in horses, humans, and a mouse model. Cell-mediated immunity (CMI) has been demonstrated in humans and mice after <b>ISCOM</b> vaccination, but rarely investigated in the horse. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate EIV-specific immune responses after intra-muscular vaccination with an ISCOM-EIV vaccine (EQUIP F) containing both equine influenza H 7 N 7 (A/eq/Newmarket/ 77) and H 3 N 8 (A/eq/Borlänge/ 91 and A/eq/Kentucky/ 98) strains. The antibody response was measured by single radial haemolysis (SRH) assay using different H 3 N 8 EIV strains. Stimulation of type- 1 immunity was evaluated with a recently developed method that measures EIV-specific IFNγ synthesis by peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). The protective efficacy of this ISCOM-based vaccine against challenge infection with a recent equine influenza (H 3 N 8; A/eq/South Africa/ 4 / 03) strain was also evaluated. Vaccinated ponies developed elevated levels of EIV-specific SRH antibody and increased percentage of EIV-specific IFNγ^+ PBL, whereas these responses were only detected after challenge infection in unvaccinated control ponies. Vaccinates showed minimal signs of disease and did not shed virus when challenged shortly after the second immunisation. In conclusion, evidence of type- 1 immunity induced by an ISCOM-based vaccine is described for the first time in horses...|$|R
