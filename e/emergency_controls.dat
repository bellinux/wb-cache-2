50|$|In the beginning, the CWFLU {{was very}} slow {{to unite the}} Filipino {{community}} of laborers in the canneries. It wasn’t until two union leaders were murdered in 1936 did Filipinos rally behind the union for higher wages, better hours, and sanitary working conditions for its members. By 1938, the contract system was eliminated, and from that point on, hiring for the canneries was done through the union hall. When WWII started, union activity was limited to Filipino workers, while the internment of Japanese workers was brought about. Many of the cannery workers were enlisting in the military or finding jobs in defense industries, while governmental <b>emergency</b> <b>controls</b> banned strikes and initiated a wage freeze. Another wave of immigrants arrived at the canneries in the 1970s, and a separate organization was established called the Alaska Cannery Workers Association (ACWA). Local 37 was reformed, and by 1980, reformers had gained control of the union, which was changed to IBU/ILWU, Region 37 in 1987, which was actually a merging of the Longshoremen's Union and the Inland Boatmen's Union of the Pacific.|$|E

Based on the proposed model, probabilities of transmission-line damage and tower collapse can be calculated. The validity and accuracy of the proposed model are verified by comparing the numerical results given by the model with historical data of a real transmission system during two serious ice storms in China.

40|$|System {{adequacy}} {{has been}} {{recognized as one of}} the essential properties of a power market; however, there is no research work to date specifically on integrating demand-side management, demand-side reserve market and supply-side reserve market. To ensure system adequacy and improve the performance of reserve control, the time-of-use (TOU) power price can be employed as a preventive control. Dispatching the supply-side reserve, shedding interruptible loads with low and high price compensation in the demand-side reserve market are considered as emergency or corrective controls after a system event. Based on the different technical and economic properties of the emergency and preventive controls, this paper proposes to quantitatively analyze the performance of different control schemes using an integrated system model.

30|$|Transient {{stability}} {{has been}} widely {{regarded as one of}} the most concerned issues of modern power system. In the last two decades, a number of large blackouts occurred all over the world due to the loss of synchronization caused by cascading failures [1]. Insufficient online implementations and lack of timely <b>emergency</b> <b>controls,</b> such as load shedding, generator tripping and proactive islanding, are said to be the common causes of those accidents [2]. The increasing renewable energy integration brings dynamic security deterioration of power systems, which would lead to the operation risks [3]. However, the deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) provides a promising way to improve awareness ability of control centers for the disturbed operation scenarios. PMUs, the infrastructure of wide-area monitoring system (WAMS) of power system, is able to measure synchronized phasor data with much higher sampling frequency compared with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) [4]. The measurement accuracy is also reported to be sufficiently satisfactory. Since PMUs can grasp the instant response of power systems when faults occur, how to utilize the massive disturbed trajectories has been significantly investigated in the last decade.|$|E

30|$|In fact, all the {{blackout}} events showed that equipment along the power flow rerouting path during the dynamic process could be tripped by protection relays earlier than UFLS actions. Therefore the cascading development such as successive islanding {{could not possibly}} be interrupted by solely depending on the distributed control measures such as UFLS. Moreover, the <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> problem should be formulated as that of {{the blackout}} defense mechanism in case of sudden loss of a key power transmission interface which although was a single transmission line in all the above cases. Therefore, the primary control objective should be to prevent cross-grid rerouting of large power flow and the follow-up uncontrolled equipment tripping and system islanding, and automatic generator tripping and load shedding triggered by the event of a sudden loss of transmission corridor is the most effective <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> measure to prevent similar cascading outages. The economic rationality of deploying this type of <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> can be analyzed {{from the point of view}} of risk reduction.|$|R
