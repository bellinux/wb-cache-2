A job is characterized with <b>fixed</b> (jobspecific) <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and other non-pecuniary attributes. As a result, observed hours of work are interpreted as the job-specific (fixed) hours of work that is associated with the chosen job.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to gain a deeper {{understanding}} of how the Chinese prioritize between work and family and how the culture can affect it. Nowadays, availability and work-life balance are often mentioned in a Western context, in this thesis we want to bring it into a Chinese context instead. China has  the largest population in the world but there is not so much previous research in this field. Thus, it was of interest to us to do our research on the work-life balance and availability in China. Chinese culture is strong and plays an important role for the Chinese in their daily lives. In Chinese culture, family relations are important also {{it is not just the}} relationship with the core of the family that is important, but also with the parents or parents- in- law. In this thesis we will show how the Chinese strike a balance between work and family and how they prioritize these two spheres. Other questions that will be dealt with are whether or not the employees of private organizations prioritize differently to the employees of public organizations. We have used a qualitative method and have interviewed ten people from both public and private organizations to gain a deeper understanding. We interviewed both men and women with administrative job. Another criterion was that the respondents had to have a child. We used this criterion since we wanted {{a deeper understanding of}} how they prioritize when they have a child and are still active in working life. The respondents all had fairly much the same conditions when it came to their duties and family situations, but their opinions regarding their work-life balance were different depending on which organization they belonged to. In the analysis and results chapter, you as a reader will notice different factors affecting the respondents priorities between work and family, for an example their living situations, finances and ages of their children. Availability is often connected with the opportunity to have flexible <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> or <b>working</b> from home since it can help you to be available for family and work at the same time. One distinct difference that we noticed is that the respondents from different organizations had different opinions regarding this opportunity.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to study infant feeding practices used by working mothers in Nairobi. Mothers attending clinics at two hospitals, one a private hospital serving higher socioeconomic groups and the other a public hospital represented the low socioeconomic groups, were interviewed. A structured interview was held with 444 mothers (200 from the low socioeconomic group and 244 from the high socioeconomic group) between January 5 th and February 11 th 2000. All mothers with infants aged 16 - 48 weeks who were willing to participate were interviewed. The prevalence of breastfeeding at the time of the study was found to be 94. 1 %. The low socioeconomic group exhibited a higher prevalence of breastfeeding (99 %) with a 10 % difference between the low and high socioeconomic groups. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 13. 3 % at three months. Early introduction of other feeding methods was high, with 46. 4 % of the mothers introducing other feeding methods before one month. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors that were associated with exclusive breastfeeding using two separate models for exclusive breastfeeding at one month and two months. The mode of work (<b>fixed</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> as opposed to shift work) was associated with exclusive breastfeeding for at least month (OR= 0. 45) and two months (OR= 0. 39). Insufficient milk and return to work were the main reasons cited for cessation of exclusive breastfeeding. Multiple linear regression was used to find out whether growth rates differed between feeding methods and types of foods for complementary feeding. Bottle-feeding had a significant negative association (- 0. 240, p= 0. 018) with baby weight and a downward trend was evident in baby Z-score for age exhibiting a risk of growth faltering in all infants. The results of this study indicate that the prevalence of breastfeeding in Nairobi Kenya has remained considerably high. Working mothers are still committed to breastfeeding despite the long <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> of separation (mean 46. 23 hours). However exclusive breastfeeding is low, recommendations are made for interventions to promote exclusive breastfeeding and policies with strategies to enable working mothers to exclusively breastfeed for at least four months...|$|R

40|$|Why do {{taxi drivers}} work when they work? Unlike those {{in many other}} occupations, taxi drivers do not have <b>fixed</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> This raises the {{question}} of what influences their working time. Based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative research conducted in Warsaw between November 2012 and June 2013, this dissertation argues that the working time of Warsaw taxi drivers is anchored in four “temporal structures”: earning time, waiting time, political time and domestic time. First, taxi drivers’ working time is dependent on the demand for their service, which structures their earning time. I argue that, since taxi drivers are coordinating agencies, their earning time is dependent on multiple superior coordination agencies that make up the multi-layered temporal architecture of Warsaw. Such agencies include the religious calendar and the state calendar. Second, taxi drivers’ working time is shaped by a temporal structure of waiting time. I trace the origin of this structure, showing how waiting time is linked to the emergence of capitalism in Poland in 1989. However, while the introduction of capitalism created the structural conditions for waiting time, I argue that waiting time is reproduced every day as taxi drivers have to cope with the uncertainty of demand for their service. Third, taxi drivers’ working time is anchored in political time since they try collectively to improve their working conditions through voice. I distinguish between different forms of voice, showing how and why the political actions of taxi drivers have been largely unsuccessful. Finally, taxi drivers work when they work because of a temporal structure of domestic time. Taxi drivers’ working time is shaped by the temporal order of their family life, which is often in conflict with the rhythm of the market. I describe how the gendered nature of domestic time, characterized by an unequal division of household labour, enables male taxi drivers to work long hours. By providing an explanation for taxi drivers’ working time, which highlights the temporal dimension of social life, this dissertation shows the need for economic sociology to study the impact of time on economic practices...|$|R

40|$|Teleworking is an {{alternative}} way to organize work that integrates two sources of competitive advantage: a company's Human Resources and the new Information and Telecommunication Technologies. There is no agreement in literature about teleworking definition and its different meanings. Sometimes, terms such as telecommuting, remote working, and home working are used to explain its different eanings. Teleworking occurs when employees perform all or {{a substantial part of}} their work physically separated from the location of their employer, using IT for operation and communication (Baruch, 2001). Davenport and Pearlson (1998) introduce teleworking as {{an alternative}} mode of work, enabled by technological improvements and increase in use of information technology (IT) on the one hand, and on the other hand, by an unconventional managerial approach, which takes it that work is what you do, not a place where you go. Three main types of teleworking are usually found in operation: home-based telework, satellite offices, and mobile working. Home-based teleworking refers to employees who work at home on a regular basis, though not necessarily every day. A person can be considered as a teleworker if her telecommunications link to the office is as simple as a telephone; however, teleworkers often use other communications media such as electronic mail and personal computer links to office servers. Self- employed workers and workers who have no connection to a central workplace are not considered as teleworkers. In satellite offices, employees work both outside the home and away from the normal workplace in a location convenient to the employees and/or customers to reduce commuting time. Other category of teleworkers is the mobile workers. The mobile workers are frequently on the road, using ommunications technology to work from home, from a car, from a plane, or from a hotel - communicating with the office as necessary from each location. Salespersons and investment bankers are examples of mobile teleworkers. The development of teleworking started in the 1970 s. Teleworking is commonly used in many industries such as IT, telecommunication, insurance, construction and manufacturing. In Sri Lanka, teleworking is still an emerging concept compared to most of the other countries. Software industry is an emerging industry in Sri Lanka and there are many multinational companies operating in Sri Lanka. These companies are experiencing different types of work patterns such as flexible <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> shift <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and occasional teleworking.

In this paper we argue for an alternative modeling framework that differs from the standard models of labor supply in that the notion of job choice is fundamental. Specifically, the worker is assumed to have preferences over a latent worker-specific choice set of jobs from which he chooses his preferred job. A job is characterized with <b>fixed</b> (job-specific) <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> wage rate and nonpecuniary attributes. As a result, observed hours of work and wage rate are interpreted as the jobspecific (fixed) hours of work and wage rate associated with the chosen job. The discussion in this paper focuses on interpretation of different versions and extensions of the alternative framework, theoretical and practical advantages, and how this approach relates to familiar existing approaches in the literature...|$|R

A rational agent exposed to a temporary increase (reduction) in wages will respond by increasing (reducing) <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> However, empirically such behavior has been hard to confirm. Most income increases are not temporary; hence a substantial income effect confuses the responding behavior from such an agent. Equally, most workers cannot adjust their <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> on a daily, or even a weekly basis but have a pretty <b>fixed</b> <b>working</b> week of e. g. 40 hours in many OECD countries. Recently, Camerer et al. (1997) found that inexperienced New York cab drivers did not respond as predicted to wage increases, {{but according to the}} authors were guided by daily income targets and loss aversion which would explain the unpredicted behavior. Fisheries offer an example of job where workers are exposed to short term wage changes {{and at the same time}} have freedom to set their number of <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> A better understanding of the micro economic behavior of fishers is necessary to managers aiming at regulating fisheries in a sustainable and efficient manner. In this paper we analyze three datasets on paua (abalone) divers in southern New Zealand between 2001 and 2006. These fishers face an inelastic export demand and at the same time vary their daily <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> We find non-constant and significant wage elasticities, which have a significant impact on the common assumption of a one day time horizon...|$|R

He became known for his frank piety and openness to members of different Christian sects.According to the Reverend Frederick Monod,Legrand thought that a Christian who owned property should give half of his income to the service of God and the poor. He provided good conditions to his workers, including housing and schools.He did not mechanize his factory, but let his employees work at home.He petitioned with some success for laws that would reduce the <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> of children in the factories.In Legrand's 1841 Lettre d'un industriel des montagnes des Vosges he threw down a challenge to the French leaders when he said that even England had [...] "found that all its interests, without exception, imperiously demanded the intervention of the legislation in order to <b>fix</b> the age, <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and schooling of its factory workers in order to save them from ruin and perdition."Legrande was a believer in small-scale family industry, where children worked with their parent, and hours were shorter than was common at the time. This would avoid the corrupting influence of the factory on children, would strengthen family bonds and would provide long-term social benefits.|$|R
