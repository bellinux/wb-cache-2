25|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} REBT is humans {{do not get}} <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbed</b> by unfortunate circumstances, but by how they construct their views of these circumstances through their language, evaluative beliefs, meanings and philosophies about the world, themselves and others. This concept has been attributed {{as far back as}} the Roman philosopher Epictetus, who is often cited as utilizing similar ideas in antiquity. In REBT, clients usually learn and begin to apply this premise by learning the A-B-C-D-E-F model of psychological disturbance and change. The A-B-C model states that it is not an A, adversity (or activating event) that cause disturbed and dysfunctional emotional and behavioral Cs, consequences, but also what people B, irrationally believe about the A, adversity. A, adversity can be an external situation, or a thought, a feeling or other kind of internal event, and it can refer to an event in the past, present, or future.|$|E
50|$|Resentment (also called ranklement or bitterness) is {{a mixture}} of disappointment, anger, and fear. It {{comprises}} the three basic emotions of disgust, sadness and surprise—the perception of injustice. As the surprise of injustice becomes less frequent, so too fades anger and fear, leaving disappointment as the predominant emotion. So, to the extent perceived disgust and sadness remain, the level of disappointment also remains. Resentment can be triggered by an <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbing</b> experience felt again or relived in the mind. When the person feeling resentment is directing the emotion at himself or herself, it appears as remorse.|$|R

[...] Westwood had already been feeding him material, like a tome on Charles Manson, likely to encourage his worst instincts. Early in 1977, he met Nancy Spungen, an <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbed</b> drug addict and sometime prostitute from New York. Spungen is commonly thought to be responsible for introducing Vicious to heroin, and the emotional codependency between the couple alienated Vicious from {{the other members of the}} band. Lydon later wrote, [...] "We did everything to get rid of Nancy.... She was killing him. I was absolutely convinced this girl was on a slow suicide mission.... Only she didn't want to go alone. She wanted to take Sid with her.... She was so utterly fucked up and evil." [...] Lydon also admits to regretting introducing the two in The Filth and the Fury.|$|E

Men and women tend to use different neural pathways to encode stimuli into memory. While highly emotional pictures were remembered best by all participants in one study, as compared to emotionally neutral images, women remembered the pictures better than men. This study also found greater activation of the right amygdala in men and the left amygdala in women.

40|$|There {{are many}} murderer protagonists in recent American {{television}} series. Rape, however, {{is most often}} used to mark a character as clearly villainous—and more so than a murderer. This chapter argues that rape is morally disgusting. Nonetheless, in real life laws rape {{is not in the}} same way marked as being worse than murder. This chapter suggests that the explanation for this asymmetry between fiction and real-life moral psychology is that we as spectators rely more heavily on moral emotions when engaging in fiction, and that rape is <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbing</b> in a way that murder need not be. Our attitude towards the rapist as repulsive becomes more evident when we engage in fiction. This points to a difference between the morality activated by fiction and the morality activated by real-life events...|$|R

To accomplish that effect, the Black Lanterns have personalities and actively seek out those who will be affected by their appearance. A prime example of Johns' use of personality distortion with the Black Lanterns is Elongated Man (typically depicted as being a [...] "light" [...] character that uses his detective skill to [...] "smell" [...] when something isn't right) looking upon his victims and remarking to his undead wife: [...] "I smell a mystery."

500|$|His {{characters}} are often <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbed,</b> obsessive and morally ambiguous, facing the fears and anxieties of loneliness, guilt, jealousy, and greed; {{in addition to}} the larger themes of corruption and conspiracy. By grounding [...] "everyday neurosis – our everyday sort of fears and hopes for ourselves" [...] in a heightened reality, Nolan makes them more accessible to a universal audience. The protagonists of Nolan's films are often driven by philosophical beliefs, and their fate is ambiguous. In some of his films, the protagonist and antagonist are mirror images of each other, a point which is made to the protagonist by the antagonist. Through these clashings of ideologies, Nolan highlights the ambivalent nature of truth. The director also uses his real-life experiences as an inspiration in his work, [...] "From a creative point of view, the process of growing up, the process of maturing, getting married, having kids, I've tried to use that in my work. I've tried to just always be driven by the things that were important to me." [...] Writing for The Playlist, Oliver Lyttelton singled out parenthood as a signature theme in Nolan's work, adding; [...] "the director avoids talking about his private life, but fatherhood has been at the emotional heart of almost everything he's made, at least from Batman Begins onwards (previous films, it should be said, pre-dated the birth of his kids)." ...|$|E
500|$|Victor Meldrew (Richard Wilson) – Victor is {{the main}} protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself {{constantly}} battling against all that life throws {{at him as he}} becomes entangled in complicated misfortunes and farcical situations. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name [...] "Victor" [...] was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser. From being buried alive to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a [...] "box" [...] at his place of employment, but to no avail. He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be upset because it is always someone else's fault. Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism. Yet his polite façade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. [...] "Victor-isms" [...] include [...] "I do not believe it!", [...] "I don't believe it!", [...] "Un-be-lievable!", [...] "What in the name of bloody hell?", [...] "In the name of sanity!". Despite his grumpy demeanor Victor isn't totally devoid of compassionin [...] "Hearts of Darkness" [...] he liberates elderly nursing home residents that were being mistreated by the staff and in [...] "Descent Into The Maelstrom" [...] he calls the incident room number and gives the location of an <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbed</b> girl that abducted a baby and stole Margaret's pearl earrings, which resulted in the girl getting picked up by the police. However, because the girl was a friend of Margaret's and knowing she meant a lot to her, Victor never said anything. Victor has also shown a vast amount of loyalty to Margaret as, throughout their entire 38 years of lifelong marriage together, not once has the thought of infidelity ever occurred to him. In [...] "Rearranging the Dust", Victor and Margaret recollect the days of their courtship at a party after which Victor says [...] "You were always my first choice", which leaves Margaret stunned. In another episode, Margaret recounts the time Victor took her to the funfair and they ended up getting stuck in the hall of mirrors for over an hour. Victor had said he didn't mind as he was happy to stay there and look at all the reflections of her. Victor's very best act of compassion came in the episode [...] "The Wisdom of the Witch" [...] in which he ends up saving Patrick's life from his new secretary's psychopathic boyfriend by forcing Patrick's would-be murderer, with himself along with him as well, {{out the window of the}} house in which they were trapped during a snowstorm.|$|E

40|$|Music Performance Anxiety (MPA) is a {{specific}} type of anxiety that appears in musicians when they are called to perform in front of others. Mayor causes of MPA are competitive nature of this profession, desire to reach perfection in interpretation, presence of critics and the audience and strong need to control those mental functions that are affected the most by stage fright (such as memory, concentration and muscle coordination). Many authors believe that cognitive factors are the most important for explaination of MPA, especially negative automatic thoughts that appear shortly before the performance. Those dysfunctional thoughts are deforming reality. They are <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbing</b> and they are affecting performance artistic value.

40|$|EMDR is {{an acronym}} for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, a {{remarkable}} form of psychotherapy that is being widely used to treat trauma and PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). EMDR combines elements from several therapeutic approaches with bilateral stimulation to facilitate hemispheric processing in the brain. Controlled studies support the efficacy of EMDR, making it not only the most thoroughly researched method ever used {{in the treatment of}} trauma, but also useful in a variety of applications from phobias to eating disorders. In 1987, Dr. Francine Shapiro noticed that her <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbing</b> thoughts diminished after she moved her eyes rapidly from side to side, and she recognized the similarity to REM sleep. In REM sleep, conflicts are resolved, information is processed, balance is restored, and learning and memory are consolidated.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the analogy between film and memory {{through a consideration of}} Shona Illingworth’s video and sound installation Balnakiel (2009). In particular, the article focuses on up-to-date psychological views of memory as a spatial as well as temporal construct and {{on the role of the}} point of view in memory retrieval. Central to the argument is the link between emotion and point of view as contingent on memory as a space that we inhabit. Sigmund Freud’s concept of screen memory is revisited in the light of current memory models, drawing attention to the salience of memory perspective for emotionally problematic memories. Within this context, the cultural analogy of memory and film is indicative of the broader relevance of the moving image as a referent for the understanding of memory processes and the ways in which we affectively position ourselves in relation to <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbing</b> memories. In Balnakiel, a work informed by these new perspectives, place and memory feature as contested sites of individual and collective recollection...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyses}} user-generated YouTube cut and mix {{videos of}} irregular migration as producing communicative memory {{of those who}} have suffered at Europe’s external borders. Visual and textual analyses examine a neglected perspective on the study of media representations of migration by examining a particular practice through which people engage with news images and participate in (re) construction of collective memory in relation to irregular migration. The analysis shows that while hegemonic Eurocentric imagery prevails also in the vernacular amateur productions, re-mixing different cultural productions nevertheless complicates the representation of irregular migration and affords alternative positions. The article examines an emerging area in memory studies: practices of vernacular commemoration and its convergence with more institutionalized and professional media and memory practices. The videos are communicative reactions to <b>emotionally</b> <b>disturbing</b> news images of suffering – the public’s re-articulations of migration and migration control, which nevertheless are constrained into the existing mainstream media framings and entertainment economies. This type of performative citizenship is crucial for social equality, particularly since non-performance of memory in relation to contemporary migration tragedies has dominated European public spheres...|$|R
