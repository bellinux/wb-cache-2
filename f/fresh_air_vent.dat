50|$|To {{construct}} the Executive Mustang, Trans Florida purchased military surplus P-51s. The airframes were completely disassembled, the military equipment stripped out, and then rebuilt {{with a second}} seat, new avionics, plush leather interiors, luggage bays and civilian paint schemes. By 1961, the aircraft were renamed Cavalier 2000, referring to the 2000 smi km range. Five different Cavalier models were eventually offered: the Cavalier 750, 1200, 1500, 2000 and 2500, differing in fuel capacity, with the name indicating the approximate range of the aircraft. Over {{the course of the}} next decade, nearly 20 of these aircraft would be constructed. Several FAA approved modifications to the Cavalier design would be made during that time, including canopy frame mounted cockpit <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>vents,</b> 96 gal wingtip fuel tanks, fuselage baggage door, 60 gallon ammo/gun bay fuel tanks, and a 14 in taller vertical stabilizer.|$|R

500|$|While Monitor was {{undergoing}} repairs her crew was put aboard [...] and were eventually granted a furlough by Bankhead who himself went on leave. For approximately six weeks the vessel remained in drydock while her bottom was scraped clean of barnacles and other sea growth, the engines and boilers were overhauled, the entire vessel was cleaned and painted, {{and a number}} of improvements made, including an iron shield around the top of the turret. To make the vessel more seaworthy a [...] funnel shaped smokestack was placed over the smoke outlet while taller <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>vents</b> were installed. The berth deck below was also enlarged and raised by removing some of the side storerooms and placing them below, thus reducing the height of the interior which now barely allowed the crew to stand upright. Several cranes were also added while interior improvements were made making the confining environment more livable. A large blower that operated with its own engine was installed which drew <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> down through the pilothouse. During this time the two Dahlgren guns were each engraved with large letters, MONITOR & MERRIMAC – WORDEN and MONITOR & MERRIMAC – ERICSSON, respectively. Additional iron plates were installed covering where dents were made during the previous battles. Each plate was inscribed with the name of the source from where the shell causing the dent was made. i.e. Merrimack, Fort Darling, etc. Stanchions were also installed {{around the perimeter of the}} freeboard with a rope strung through each making it safer to walk about the deck amid stormy weather and rough seas. Monitor was finally taken out of drydock on 26 October. By November the ship was fully repaired and refitted, resupplied and ready to return to service.|$|R

40|$|Efforts {{to create}} thermal comfort {{has long been}} done in the tropics. One way to create comfort in the room is by {{entering}} the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> through the <b>vents.</b> This <b>air</b> exchange systems generally utilize natural ventilation system. The advantage of natural ventilation through the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> ventilation, utilizing outside air into the building is also advantageous because there is no unused electrical energy load. <b>Fresh</b> <b>air</b> is felt occupants in the room is due to the evaporation process, winds {{on the surface of the}} skin can reduce the surface temperature of the human skin. Creating a natural ventilation system is a common way to help the exchange of air in the room. Natural ventilation is basically just rely on natural wind blowing from the outside, but not all locations have high wind speeds and constant. It required a tool to increase the speed of the exchange of indoor air, so that the process of replacing / air exchange is constant and sufficiency, by using the "Exhaust Fan" or "Ventilating Fan". This system often also referred to as system "Mechanical Ventilation". Application of the simulation results of cross ventilation of mechanical model of building Student Center with an array of fan system UAJY indicate the movement of the air flow in the room. The maximum air flow rate on field observations in the middle indicates flow velocities of up to 0, 3 - 1, 5 m/s m/s, the speed of air flow is obtained by combining the supply fan exhaust fan speed 2750 RPM in its field and fan exhaust with speed 2750 RPM in the audience tribune area.

2500|$|Poor {{construction}} {{quality was}} apparent {{even in the}} company's press department fleet. The British magazine Motor published a road test of an automatic 3500 in January 1977, and while keen to highlight the Rover's general excellence, they also reported that the test car suffered from poor door seals, with daylight visible from inside past the rear door window frame's edge {{on the left side}} of the car, and a curious steering vibration at speed which might (or might not) have resulted from the car's front wheels not having been correctly balanced. Disappointment was recorded that the ventilation outlet directly in front of the driver appeared to be blocked, delivering barely a breeze even when fully open; the writer had encountered this problem on one other Rover 3500, although he had also driven other cars of the same type with an abundant output of <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> through the <b>vent</b> in question. Nevertheless, in March 1977, Britain's Autocar was able to publish an article by Raymond Mays – a famous racing driver and team manager during (in particular) the 1930s, 1950s and 1960s – in which Mays explained why, after driving it for 12,000miles, he considered his Rover 3500 was [...] "the best car he [...] ever had", both for its many qualities as a driver's car and for its excellent fuel economy even when driven hard. Similar ventilation problems persisted until 1980 and were reported in tests of the V8-S version.|$|R
