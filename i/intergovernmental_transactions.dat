Control, finance, and administration should be distinguished in measuring centralization and each level’s share of general government, administered expenditures being net of grants given to other governments and financed expenditures net of grants received. Disparate decentralization of finance, control, and administration brings vertical imbalance, measured by the portion of a government’s expenditures not covered by its own resources and by the ratio of intergovernmental grants to total government expenditures. ...|$|E

40|$|From the introduction: The {{past decade}} has been a tumultuous and {{energized}} period {{in the study of}} administrative law and regulatory regimes. Debate continues over both positive and normative theories of the administrative state, as well as over the appropriate directions of innovation and 2 ̆ 2 reinvention. Among legislators and the public, the tax system and the Internal Revenue Service have been targets for criticism. This paper outlines a receQt procedural innovation in the tax area, the Advance Pricing Agreement Program (2 ̆ 2 APA 2 ̆ 2 program), and evaluates its success.
