50|$|The {{operators}} {{working in}} the unit {{at the time of}} the incident were unable to reach manual <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> that would have isolated the damaged section from a fuel source. A remotely operated <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> was located between the damaged section and the storage tanks but not between the damaged section and the distillation column. In addition, the pumps were controlled from a local control station that was also inaccessible. The pumps were eventually shut down from the central control building but there was not a remote shutdown control for the pumps in the central control room. Isolating the damaged section via a remotely operated valve upstream of the pumps could have ended the incident prior to ignition of the vapor cloud and would have definitely reduced the severity of the situation.|$|R

50|$|Non-{{pressure}} refuel systems operate via {{a closed}} loop system where all pressure is contained interior to signal lines, level control, and a <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve.</b> When the fuel tank fill point is reached, a bleed line signal is closed and back pressure is applied to a diaphragm valve at the fuel entry point. Due to differential pressure and an internal spring, the diaphragm is forced closed and cannot be overfilled. Non-pressurized refueling systems do not require tank pressurization for automatic nozzle shut-off, thus allowing their use on thin-walled metallic and composite material fuel tanks.|$|R

25|$|If a <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> is fitted {{between the}} first and second stages, as is found on scuba bailout systems used for {{commercial}} diving and in some technical diving configurations, the demand valve will normally be isolated and unable to function as a relief valve. In this case an overpressure valve must be fitted to the first stage if it does not already have one. As very few contemporary (2016) scuba regulator first stages are factory fitted with overpressure relief valves, they are available as aftermarket accessories which can be screwed into any low pressure port available on the first stage.|$|R
50|$|During {{this period}} of some 25 years, {{starting}} with Convair, and General Dynamics Pazmany also worked at McDonnell Douglas for aerostructures and engines. Douglas was a specialist in fighter aircraft who merged with Boeing in 1967. At Rohr he produced related components, including engine nacelles, thrust reversers, and mounting pylons for both military and commercial aircraft. Pazmany’s engineering talents stretched from conventional prop-driven aircraft to jets, missiles, cruise missiles, and unmanned stealth craft, aero systems and parts. He earned seven patents for inventions for aircraft thrust reversers to emergency natural gas <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> that activate during earthquakes.|$|R

The scenario of the hard accident in NPP and the methodology of the calculation of the fragility curve of the failure overpressure using the probabilistic safety assessment PSA 2 level are presented. The elasto-plastic behavior of steel material dependent on temperature was considered in software ANSYS. The method of central composite design sampling (CCD) of the response surface methodology (RSM) was used to probability and sensitivity analysis of the hermetic cover reliability...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for ensuring the safe, reliable, and environmentally sound operation of the nation's natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines. Regulations adopted by PHMSA for gas pipelines are provided in 49 CFR 192, and spacing requirements for valves in gas transmission pipelines are presented in 49 CFR 192. 179. The present report describes {{the findings of a}} scoping study conducted by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to assist PHMSA in assessing the safety impact of system valve spacing. Calculations of the pressures, temperatures, and flow velocities during a set of representative pipe depressurization transients were carried out using a one-dimensional numerical model with either ideal gas or real gas properties for the fluid. With both ideal gas and real gas properties, the high-consequence area radius for any resulting fire as defined by Stevens in GRI- 00 / 0189 was evaluated as one measure of the pipeline safety. In the real gas case, a model for convective heat transfer from the pipe wall is included to assess the potential for <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> failures due to excessively low temperatures resulting from depressurization cooling of the pipe. A discussion is also provided of some additional factors by which system valve spacing could affect overall pipeline safety. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work: (1) Using an adaptation of the Stephens hazard radius criteria, valve spacing has a negligible influence on natural gas pipeline safety for the pipeline diameter, pressure range, and valve spacings considered in this study. (2) Over the first 30 s of the transient, pipeline pressure has a far greater effect on the hazard radius calculated with the Stephens criteria than any variations in the transient flow decay profile and the average discharge rate. (3) Other factors besides the Stephens criteria, such as the longer burn time for an accidental fire, greater period of danger to emergency personnel, increased unavoidable loss of gas, and possible depressurization cooling of the <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> may also be important when deciding whether a change in the required valve spacing would be beneficial from a safety standpoint. (4) The average normalized discharge rate of {lambda}{sub avg} = 0. 33 assumed by Stephens in developing his safety criteria is an excellent conservative value for natural gas discharge at the pressures, valve spacings, and pipe diameter used in this study. This conclusion remains valid even when real rather than ideal gas properties are considered in the analysis. (5) Significant pipe wall cooling effects (T{sub w} < - 50 F or 228 K) can extend for a mile or more upstream from the rupture point within 30 s of a break. These conditions are colder than the temperature range specifications for many valve lubricants. The length of the low-temperature zone due to this cooling effect is also essentially independent of the system <b>shut-off</b> <b>valve</b> spacing or the distance between the break and a compressor station. (6) Having more redundant <b>shut-off</b> <b>valves</b> available would reduce the probability that pipe cooling effects could interfere with isolating the broken area following a pipeline rupture accident...|$|R
