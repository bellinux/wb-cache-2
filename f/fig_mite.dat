40|$|Tarsonemid mites in {{the tribe}} Tarsonemellini {{have been found}} in figs or phoretic on fig wasps or fruit bats in the Neotropics, Africa and Asia. Here, the first known Australian <b>fig</b> <b>mite,</b> Paratarsonemella giblindavisi sp. n., is {{described}} from adult females and males collected from within the syconia of Ficus virens from St Lucia, Queensland. The male of Paratarsonemella is described {{for the first time and}} is found to have a unique fusion of the femur, genu, tibia and tarsus of leg IV...|$|E
50|$|Dicopomorpha echmepterygis is {{a species}} of {{parasitic}} wasp in the family Mymaridae, which exhibits strong sexual dimorphism. The males are blind, apterous, and their body length is only 40% that of females. With a body length averaging 186 μm (for 8 specimens measured, which ranged from 139 to 240 μm), males of D. echmepterygis have the shortest body length of all known insects (smaller than certain species of Paramecium and amoeba, which are single-celled organisms). The measured body length of a female was 550 μm. The eggs and larvae of this parasitoid are considerably smaller than the adult. This species, described from Illinois, United States, is an idiobiont parasitoid of the eggs of a lepidopsocid barklouse, Echmepteryx hageni. Of five host eggs dissected, four contained one male and one female, the fifth one contained three males and one female. Adult males appear to mate with their sisters inside the host egg and die without ever leaving the egg. Similar life histories can be found with other species of Chalcidoidea, such as Prestwichia aquatica, which mate within the host egg, fig wasps in the family Agaonidae, which exhibit similar sexual dimorphism and mate within the host <b>fig,</b> and <b>mites</b> in the genus Adactylidium, which mate inside {{the body of the}} mother before they are born.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe <b>fig</b> spider <b>mite,</b> Eotetranychus hirsti {{is one of}} {{the major}} pests of fig trees worldwide. The effect of {{temperature}} on the developmental time and the survival rate of E. hirsti feeding on fig leaves was determined at six constant temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30, 32 and 35 °C. The total developmental time of females (from egg to adult emergence) at the above-mentioned temperatures was 41. 29, 24. 15, 16. 95, 12. 35, 10. 21 and 10. 67 days, respectively. The lower, optimal and upper developmental threshold (Tmin, Topt and Tmax, respectively) and thermal constant (K) of the pest were estimated by ordinary linear and Logan 6 nonlinear models. The lower temperature threshold (Tmin) and thermal constant (K) of the immature stages were estimated to be 9. 86 °C and 239. 48 degree-days (DD), respectively. The Topt and Tmax were estimated to be 34. 30 and 35. 44 °C, respectively. As the temperature increased from 15 to 30 °C, the survival rate of immature stages increased from 33. 33 to 70. 59 %, then decreased and reached 54. 91 % at 35 °C. Temperature-dependent development data, thermal requirements and temperature thresholds can be used to predict the occurrence, number of generations and population dynamics of E. hirsti...|$|R
40|$|In 1950 I {{received}} from Mr. D. Hille Ris Lambers a strange Pseudococcid from Java {{which had been}} collected by Mr. F. W. Rappard, a senior forestry officer, who regularly collects aphids for Mr. Hille Ris Lambers on his tours of duty. As this insect was a coccid, it was transmitted to me for examination. Its appearance is quite abnormal; the shape of its body reminds one almost of a large <b>mite</b> (<b>fig.</b> 4). The 6 -segmented antennae have a dense vestiture of fine hairs, with exception of the 2 first segments which are very short. A tuft of 5 very long setae is present {{on the top of}} each of the anal lobes. The ungual digitules are extremely large and very flat. It was only after close study that the insect was recognized as a Pseudococcid. It has 2 pairs of ostioles in the usual position, a circulus on the ventral side of the second abdominal segment, and a few trilocular pores {{on both sides of the}} body. As I suspected an abnormal mode of living, I asked Mr. Hille Ris Lambers to write to Java for further particulars, and more material. To comply with this request Mr. Rappard has collected abundant material and communicated his field notes on these insects, which he calls "ant-riders" from their peculiar habit of climbing upon the black ants by which they are closely attended, as soon as these ants are disturbed, to have themselves transported in this way. The material at hand contains 3 different instars which seem to represent first and second stage larvae, and immature adult females. Of the latter stage only 3 specimens are available. Eggs or embryos were not observed in these specimens, but in one of them the oviduct and its exterior opening (one segment behind the posterior ostioles) is faintly visible in the chitinou...|$|R
40|$|Non-mutualist {{species that}} {{interact}} with mutualists occur commonly in nature. Non-mutualists {{associated with the}} mutualism between fig trees and their pollinating <b>fig</b> wasps include <b>mites</b> and nematodes. This thesis focusses on the interaction of nematodes with fig trees and fig wasps in South Africa and Indonesia, with additional investigation on how <b>mites,</b> nematodes and <b>fig</b> pollination respond to highly seasonal environments. The reproduction of monoecious Ficus burtt-davyi in Grahamstown, South Africa slows down but does not stop in winter. There are fewer fig pollinating wasps Elisabethiella baijnathi flying in the air during winter, but most figs are probably pollinated by locally-produced fig wasps. Elisabethiella g 5 baijnathi females transport mites (Tarsonemella sp. nr. africanus) and nematodes (Parasitodiplogaster sp.) between figs. Contrasting dispersion patterns and relationships with fig wasp foundress numbers indicate that the mites, but not the nematodes, disperse between figs after being carried there by the pollinators. Three nematode species (Caenorhabditis sp., Schistonchus centerae, and S. guangzhouensis) developed inside {{both male and female}} figs of dioecious F. hispida tree in Sumatra, Indonesia. Caenorhabditis sp. was transferred between figs as juveniles, whereas Schistonchus spp. were transferred mostly as juveniles, and occasionally as adults. The nematode community of eight species in Sumatran monoecious F. racemosa was the most diverse recorded anywhere. No mites were found in both species of fig trees. Peak nematode populations occurred in D-phase figs, when the fig wasp offspring are ready to emerge. The nematodes attach themselves to newly-emerged female pollinators, which then carry them away. Usually more nematodes attached on the first fig wasps to emerge. Entry into figs by early-emerging pollinators resulted in higher numbers of the next generations of nematodes within the figs. Details of the ecology of each nematode species may be different, but as a group they did not seem to significantly affect seed and wasp development in both F. hispida and F. racemosa figs. ...|$|R
