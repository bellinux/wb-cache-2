40|$|Recent {{scanning}} tunnelling spectroscopy measurements [Y. Koksaka et al., Nature 454, 1072 (2008) ] {{have shown}} that dispersing quasiparticle <b>interference</b> <b>peaks</b> in Fourier transformed conductance maps disappear as the bias voltage exceeds a certain threshold corresponding to the coincidence of the contour of constant quasiparticle energy with the antiferromagnetic zone boundary. Here we argue that this is caused by quasistatic short-range coexisting order present in the d-wave superconducting phase, and that the most likely origin of this order is disorder-induced incommensurate antiferromagnetism. We show explicitly how the peaks are extinguished in the related situation with coexisting long-range antiferromagnetic order, and discuss the connection with the realistic disordered case. Since it is the localized quasiparticle <b>interference</b> <b>peaks</b> rather than the underlying antinodal states themselves which are destroyed at a critical bias, our proposal resolves a conflict between scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoemission regarding {{the nature of these}} states.

40|$|A {{new family}} of {{multicomponent}} metallic alloys exhibits an excellent glass forming ability at moderate cooling rates of about 10 K/s {{and a wide}} supercooled liquid region. These glasses are eutectic or nearly eutectic, and thus {{far away from the}} compositions of competing crystalline phases. The nucleation of crystals from the homogeneous amorphous phase requires large thermally activated composition fluctuations for which the time scale is relatively long, even in the supercooled liquid. In the Zr{sub 41. 2 }Ti{sub 13. 8 }Cu{sub 12. 5 }Ni{sub 10 }Be{sub 22. 5 } alloy therefore a different pathway to crystallization is observed. The initially homogeneous alloy separates into two amorphous phases. In the decomposed regions, crystallization probability increases and finally polymorphic crystallization occurs.
