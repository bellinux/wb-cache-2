5|$|Western Europe and North America {{were the}} {{original}} major markets for large-scale lettuce production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer {{different types of}} lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially <b>iceberg,</b> <b>lettuce</b> becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, {{with the development of}} <b>iceberg</b> <b>lettuce,</b> 95 percent of the lettuce grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce. By the end of the century, other types began to regain popularity and eventually made up over 30 percent of production. Stem lettuce was first developed in China, and remains primarily cultivated in that country.|$|E

There were two varieties: The Regular served with mayonnaise, whole leaf <b>iceberg</b> <b>lettuce,</b> tomato and grilled onions, and the Bacon Cheddar, with bacon and smoked cheddar cheese. There was one LTO variety, the Black Stack Griller, made with Black Strap Barbecue sauce (a strong molasses-flavored sauce), Swiss cheese, bacon, and onions, to promote Men in Black II.

40|$|Abstract: Lettuce mosaic {{has been}} a {{long-term}} world wide problem. Resistance is available at a single locus. A single gene, partially dominant, for mild reaction, can be combined with an allele for resistance to produce {{a higher level of}} resistance. Breeding work is under way. An additional source of high level resistance has been tentatively identified. A new seed borne strain of LMV that overcomes resistance may become a problem. Big vein has also been a long-term problem. Moderate sources of resistance have been identified, based upon proportion of plants showing symptoms at harvest time. Pavane appears to have the highest level of the identified sources. The species Lactuca virosa appears to have complete resistance and is being used in a breeding program. Verticillium is a new disease in <b>lettuce.</b> No <b>iceberg</b> type <b>lettuce</b> cultivars tested are resistant. Several other cultivars of different type are resistant and are being used in breeding...|$|R
40|$|Wounding {{lettuce leaves}} induces the de novo {{synthesis}} of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL, EC 4. 3. 1. 5), the accumulation of phenolic compounds, and subsequent tissue browning. A brief heat-shock at 45 degreesC reduces the rise in wound-induced PAL, the accumulation of phenolic compounds, and tissue browning. The activity of PAL measured 24 h after wounding {{and the content of}} phenolic compounds (absorbance of methanol extract at 320 nm) measured 48 h after wounding was highly correlated (R- 2 > 0. 90) in tissue developing the normal wound response and in tissue subjected to 0 - 180 s of heat-shock after wounding. The synthesis of a unique set of proteins called heat-shock proteins (hsps) is induced by these heat-shock treatments. Western-blot analyses of proteins isolated from wounded and heat-shocked <b>Iceberg</b> and Romaine <b>lettuce</b> mid-rib leaf tissue was done using antibodies against hsp 23. Only those heat-shock treatments that were effective at inducing the synthesis of hsp 23 were effective in reducing the activity of PAL induced by wounding and the subsequent accumulation of phenolic compounds. Hsps induced in non-wounded, whole leaves by exposure to 45 degreesC for 150 s did not significantly interact with PAL previously synthesized in non-heat-shocked wounded leaves to limit its activity. The preferential synthesis of hsps over that of wound-induced PAL, rather than the presence of hsps, may be responsible for the ability of a heat-shock treatment to reduce the wound-induced increase in PAL activity. Our results support this novel concept, and the possibility that heat-shock treatments can have significant physiological effects on the response of the tissue to other stresses, not because of the specific genes they induce or repress, or the products they cause to be synthesized, but by their secondary action of influencing the synthesis of other proteins (e. g. PAL) by the suppression of non-hsps protein synthesis...|$|R

25|$|But the UFW was not {{the only}} union to see the end of the Delano grape strike as an opportunity. Six {{thousand}} drivers and packing workers in the Salinas Valley in California, represented by the Teamsters, struck on July 17, 1970 effectively preventing most of the nation's summer lettuce crop from reaching consumers. The price of <b>iceberg</b> <b>lettuce</b> tripled overnight, and thousands of acres of lettuce were plowed under as crops spoiled on the ground. The strike ended on July 23, but the contract included a special agreement by the growers to give the Teamsters, not the UFW, access to farms and the right to organize workers into unions.|$|E
25|$|Angus burgers – Four types: the Angus Deluxe (American cheese, sliced {{red onions}} and sliced red tomatoes, <b>iceberg</b> <b>lettuce,</b> pickles, mustard, and {{mayonnaise}}); Angus Mushroom and Swiss (sautéed mushrooms, Swiss cheese and mayonnaise); Angus Bacon and Cheese (bacon, American cheese, sliced red onions, mustard, ketchup and pickles); and the Angus Chipotle BBQ Bacon (chipotle sauce, red onions, pickles, bacon, and American cheese). In Australia and New Zealand, {{there are three}} Angus burgers sold; The Grand Angus (which is a clone of the Angus Deluxe) and the Mighty Angus (which resembles the Angus Cheese and Bacon, but with no pickles and mayonnaise and onion relish replacing the ketchup and mustard). For a limited time only, the Angus The Third, similar to the Grand Angus, but with no mustard and made with a tomato chili relish and only one slice of cheese. Also, for a limited time, Angus the Great was sold, a clone of the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. In October 2012, an Angus version of the Cheddar Bacon Onion (CBO) Sandwich was made available, consisting of a horseradish-like sauce, grilled caramelized onions, bacon and cheddar cheese. In May 2013, McDonald's stopped selling the Angus burger. Two years later the third-pound burgers returned (known as Sirloin Third Pound Burgers), but as a limited-time promotion. It comes in three sandwiches: Bacon & Cheese, Lettuce & Tomato, and Steakhouse. The Angus Burgers are still available in Canada and some markets in Latin America.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Root-knot {{nematodes}} {{were among}} the earliest plant-parasitic nematodes to be recognized. Before 1949, they were considered as the one species Heterodera marioni (Cornu 1887) Goodey 1932. In 1949 Chitwood completed a taxonomic study of the root-knot nematodes and placed them in a separate genus Meloidogyne. Economically {{they are one of}} the most important group of nematode pests and their distitibution is cosmopolitan. As in many other parasitic organisms, biotypes or physiological races exist within various species of root-knot nematodes. Most frequently pathogenic characters on given hosts have been used in making distinctions of biotypes. Meloidogyne hapla, Chitwood 1949 is a root-knot nematode species found mainly in the temperate regions. It is widely distributed in the northwestern USA on numerous hosts, but it is also known that some populations of this nematode have different host preferences. In the biotype study, 14 of the 15 populations of M. hapla were collected from northwestern USA; one population came from eastern USA. These populations were exposed to various hosts in the greenhouse at temperatures averaging 73. 4 F day and 62. 6 F night. Five biotypes were established through pattern of infection on various hosts. The resistance expected of two graminaceous plants, corn and oat, was broken by two M. hapla biotypes. A test was made to cross males of M. haplabiotype Five (Quincy # 1) and females from M. haplabiotype Three (Ontario). Larvae that hatched from eggs of this "bisexual union" did not show a physiological action different from larvae that hatched from eggs of the female parent alone. A few larvae from the "two parents" and from the female parent alone, penetrated roots of <b>lettuce</b> (<b>Iceberg)</b> but did not develop into egg laying females. It did not appear that root-knot nematode males altered the physiological character of the larvae. Tests were made to determine the influence of host age on resistance and susceptibility to M. hapla (biotype Five, Quincy # 1). Results indicated that in a resistant alfalfa (65 - 298), newly germinated seedlings showed evidence of resistance to infection. This resistance increased with age in one-week and two-week seedlings. In susceptible alfalfa('Lahontan'), newly germinated seedlings, one-week and two-week seedlings were equally disposed to infection. Tests were made to determine the influence of pH ranges 4. 7, 5. 9 and 7. 8 on resistance and susceptibility of plants inoculated with M. hapla (biotype Five, Dayton # 1). All plants (resistant and susceptible alfalfa and susceptible Rutgers tomato) grew best in pH 7. 8, good in pH 5. 9 and poorly in pH 4. 7. These pH ranges did produce marked differences in plant growth but did not affect their basic nematode resistance or susceptibility. Influence of pH on nematodes appeared to be indirect via the host plant in which the nematodes thrive...|$|R

[...] She discusses ways the combination can be used in soups, appetizers, and salads. Recipes are provided for multiple versions of the BLT sandwich. Jordan writes that to make the best sandwich, one should select the finest ingredients. She recommends shopping at farmers' markets for fresh tomatoes, a butcher for choice bacon, and a bakery for fresh bread. The author recommends mayonnaise brands Hellmann's and Best Foods, and Niman bacon from California. Jordan writes, [...] "For lettuce, remove the first outer leaf and then use only the next three layers. Further in, <b>iceberg</b> <b>lettuce</b> gets a little cabbagey." ...|$|E
