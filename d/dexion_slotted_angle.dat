50|$|In 1968, {{the company}} was floated on the London Stock Exchange, {{in one of the}} three largest issues that year, buoyed by results showing a 40% {{increase}} in world sales to £14m and a new record profit of £1.133m. A year later, turnover reached £21m, with profits rising to £1.5m. By this stage, over one million feet per week of <b>Dexion</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>angle</b> were being produced, and sales were increasingly focused on uses in warehousing and distribution. The Comino Foundation educational charity was established in 1971, financially supported by the proceeds of dividend income following Dexion's 1968 public flotation.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Krisson resumed as a {{printing}} business, but Comino left day-to-day {{management in the}} hands of senior staff so that he could devote himself to the <b>Dexion</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>angle</b> concept (though he did write a history of the printing business, published as The Krisson Story in 1953). Several prototypes were made, and in 1946, with £7000 savings and £7000 borrowed from Krisson's bankers, he invested in a second-hand Henry & Wright standard die press, and began manufacture, adapting the press so that the steel strip could be continuously fed into it and painted. In May 1947, he established a factory in Chingford in north-east London, staffed by nine factory workers and one sales person, but sales were initially disappointing, partly due to post-war cash payment requirements. However, sales and production increased to 50,000 feet per week in 1949, generating a business turnover of £500,000 that year. During 1950, the Dexion strips began to be used for exhibitions, and production reached 125,000 feet per week, and a new Dexion factory was opened in Enfield.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} spin-polarized {{current switching}} of Pac-man type II (PM-II) nanoelements in Pac-man shaped nanoscale spin-valves (Co/Cu/Py) using micromagnetic simulations. The effects of <b>slot</b> <b>angle</b> and antiferromag-netic (AFM) layer were simulated to obtain optimum switching {{in less than}} 2 ns. At a critical <b>slot</b> <b>angle</b> of 105 °, the lowest current density for anti-parallel to parallel (AP-P) switching was observed due to no vortex or anti-vortex formation during the magnetic reversal process. All other <b>slot</b> <b>angles</b> for AP-P formed a vortex or anti-vortex during the magnetization reversal process. Additionally, a vortex or anti-vortex formed for all <b>slot</b> <b>angles</b> for parallel to anti-parallel (P-AP) switching. The addition of an AFM layer caused the current density to decrease significantly for AP-P and P-AP at <b>slot</b> <b>angles</b> less than 90 °. However, at <b>slot</b> <b>angles</b> greater than 90 °, the current density tended to decrease by less amounts or actually increased slightly as shape anisotropy became more dominant. This allowed ultra-fast switching with 5. 05 and 5. 65 x 108 A/cm 2 current densities for AP-P and P-AP, respectively, at a <b>slot</b> <b>angle</b> of 105 °...|$|R
50|$|Prototype <b>slotted</b> <b>angle</b> strips were {{developed}} by London-based engineer Demetrius Comino in the late 1930s, as he sought alternatives to conventional wooden shelving in his printing works. Comino owned an engineering business, Dexion Ltd, which began production in 1947 and the steel <b>slotted</b> <b>angle</b> strips eventually became known as Dexion.|$|R
50|$|To {{construct}} {{items from}} <b>slotted</b> <b>angle,</b> items {{can be cut}} to size (some versions are marked to show the optimum points at which to cut the metal) using special <b>slotted</b> <b>angle</b> cutters or shears, and then fixed with nuts and bolts.

50|$|<b>Slotted</b> <b>angle</b> (also {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>slotted</b> <b>angle</b> iron) is a system of reusable metal strips used to construct shelving, frames, work benches, equipment stands and other structures. The name derives, first, from the use of elongated slots punched into the metal at uniform intervals to enable assembly of structures fixed with nuts and bolts, and second, from the longitudinal folding of the metal strips to form a right angle.|$|R
50|$|The Dexion-style <b>slotted</b> <b>angle</b> or {{angle iron}} was also widely copied by other {{manufacturers}} using different configurations of slots, different metal thicknesses, and different metals (e.g.: aluminium).|$|R

It is found that the said parameter of antenna depends heavily on the <b>slot</b> <b>angle</b> θ. Resonant frequency and magnitude of return loss has also been investigated as a function of θ. The variation in resonant frequency for first, second and third resonance is (1. 43 GHz to 1. 57 GHz), (1. 772 GHz to 1. 973 GHz) and (2. 557 Ghz to 2. 597 GHz) and the variation in return loss is (- 9. 297 dB to- 1. 75 dB),(- 21. 15 dB to- 27. 25 dB) and (- 23. 89 dB to- 26. 83 dB) respectively.

40|$|A CFD {{study was}} {{performed}} to analyze the mixing potential of opposed rows of staggered jets injected into confined crossflow in a rectangular duct. Three jet configurations were numerically tested: (1) straight (0 deg) slots; (2) perpendicular slanted (45 deg) <b>slots</b> <b>angled</b> in opposite directions on top and bottom walls; and (3) parallel slanted (45 deg) <b>slots</b> <b>angled</b> {{in the same direction}} on top and bottom walls. All three configurations were tested at slot spacing-to-duct height rations (S/H) of 0. 5, 0. 75, and 1. 0; a jet-to-mainstream momentum flux ratio (J) of 100; and a jet-to-mainstream mass flow ratio of 0. 383. Each configuration had its best mixing performance at S/H of 0. 75. Asymmetric flow patterns were expected and predicted for all slanted slot configurations. The parallel slanted slot configuration was the best overall configuration at x/H of 1. 0 for S/H of 0. 75...|$|R

Polymer solution {{injected into}} valleys of grooves through array of holes or <b>slots</b> <b>angled</b> downstream to keep injected streams within grooves.

50|$|Free-standing shelf {{frames are}} also usually {{manufactured}} from metal (usually steel), though the shelves {{may be made}} of wood. The metal frames may be formed of <b>slotted</b> <b>angle</b> - steel strips longitudinally pressed into a right-angle or L-shaped section (C- and box-section systems are also used where structures have to carry particularly heavy loads); these sections are perforated with circular holes or elongated slots to allow shelves to be mounted directly or fixed using nuts and bolts. The most heavy duty form of adjustable shelving is pallet racking.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical investigation {{was conducted to}} determine the film cooling effectiveness of a normal <b>slot</b> and <b>angled</b> <b>slot</b> under realistic engine Mach number conditions. Freestream Mach numbers of 0. 65 and 1. 3 were tested. For the normal slot, hot gas ingestion into the slot was observed at low blowing ratios (M 0. 6) the cooling film was observed to lift off from the surface. For the 30 o <b>angled</b> <b>slot,</b> the data was found to collapse using the blowing ratio as a scaling parameter (x/Ms). Results from the current experiment were compared with the subsonic data published to confirm this test procedure. For the <b>angled</b> <b>slot,</b> at the supersonic freestream Mach number, the current experiment shows {{that at the same}} x/Ms, the film cooling effectiveness increases by as much as 25 % as compared to the subsonic case. The results of the experiment also show that at the same x/Ms, the film cooling effectiveness of the <b>angled</b> <b>slot</b> is considerably higher than that of the normal slot, at both subsonic and supersonic Mach numbers. The flow physics for the slot tests considered here are also described with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations in the subsonic and supersonic regimes...|$|R

The study provided some ideas about the effect of testing conditions that change the testing results and should be considered in LCM sealing evaluation.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{analysis of}} flow in simplex fuel atomizers using the arbitrary-Lagrangian–Eulerian method is presented. It {{is well established}} that the geometry of an atomizer {{plays an important role}} in governing its performance. We have investigated the effect on atomizer performance of four geometric parameters, namely, inlet <b>slot</b> <b>angle,</b> spin chamber convergence angle, trumpet angle, and trumpet length. For a constant mass flow rate through the atomizer, the atomizer performance is monitored in terms of dimensionless film thickness, spray cone half-angle, and discharge coefficient. Results indicate that increase in inlet <b>slot</b> <b>angle</b> results in lower film thickness and discharge coefficient and higher spray cone angle. The spin chamber converge angle has an opposite effect on performance parameters, with film thickness and discharge coefficient increasing and the spray cone angle decreasing with increasing convergence angle. For a fixed trumpet length, the trumpet angle has very little influence on discharge coefficient. However, the film thickness decreases, and spray cone angle increases with increasing trumpet angle. For a fixed trumpet angle, the discharge coefficient is insensitive to trumpet length. Both the spray cone angle and the film thickness are found to decrease with trumpet length. Analytical solutions are developed to determine the atomizer performance considering inviscid flow through the atomizer. The qualitative trends in the variation of film thickness at the atomizer exit, spray cone angle, and discharge coefficient predicted by inviscid flow analysis are seen to agree well with computational results...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain better performance, gas {{turbines}} always operate with high inlet temperature. This contributes to {{a high level of}} thermal load on the first stage vane endwall. To ensure safe operation of a gas turbine within a proper temperature range, the cooling performance of the vane endwall must be further investigated. In the present study, effects of the mainstream turbulence and upstream coolant flow direction on the endwall cooling and vane suction side surface phantom cooling were numerically investigated. Three-dimensional (3 D) Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations combined with shear stress transport (SST) k-ω turbulence model were solved to conduct the numerical simulations on basis of the validated turbulence model. The calculated results indicate that both the adiabatic cooling effectiveness on the endwall and the phantom cooling effectiveness on the vane suction side surface are significantly influenced by <b>slot</b> injection <b>angle.</b> For α=- 30 °, the coolant injection is driven towards the vane suction side, which contributes to the lowest adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall and the highest phantom cooling effectiveness level on the vane suction side surface. With the increase of the <b>slot</b> injection <b>angle,</b> the adiabatic cooling effectiveness level on the pressure side endwall is enhanced significantly. In contrast, the phantom cooling (when the vane suction side is cooled by coolant originating from the endwall) of the vane suction side surface is reduced significantly. This is because a large <b>slot</b> injection <b>angle</b> leads to a large coolant momentum towards the pressure side. Moreover, the case with a smaller <b>slot</b> injection <b>angle</b> obtains a slightly higher area-averaged adiabatic cooling effectiveness level around the leading edge due to a relatively larger portion of coolant being confined near the leading edge. In addition, the inlet turbulence intensity has a small impact on the overall endwall cooling and the phantom cooling of the vane suction side surface compared to the <b>slot</b> injection <b>angle...</b>|$|R

50|$|The two-seam fastball {{appears to}} have more {{movement}} than a four-seam fastball, but can {{be more difficult to}} master and control. The amount of break on the pitch varies greatly from pitcher to pitcher depending on velocity, arm <b>slot</b> <b>angle,</b> and pressure points of the fingers. The two-seamer is a very natural pitch to throw, and is often taught to pitchers at a very early age. Its use is widespread throughout all levels of baseball, and most pitchers at any level have a two-seamer in their repertoire. Many pitchers, especially those without exceptional velocity, prefer a two-seam fastball to the four-seam because of its movement at the plate. However, power pitchers such as Justin Verlander combine control, high velocity, and break to make the two-seamer {{one of the most effective}} pitches in baseball.|$|R
