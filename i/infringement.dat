40|$|Nowadays, {{repurposing}} {{of personal}} data {{is a major}} privacy issue. Detection of data repurposing requires posteriori mechanisms able to determine how data have been processed. However, current a posteriori solutions for privacy compliance are often manual, leading <b>infringements</b> to remain undetected. In this paper, we propose a privacy compliance technique for detecting privacy <b>infringements</b> and measuring their severity. The approach quantifies <b>infringements</b> by considering a number of deviations from specifications (i. e., insertion, suppression, replacement, and re-ordering) ...|$|R

40|$|Enforcement {{relies on}} the idea that <b>infringements</b> are {{violations}} and as such should not be allowed. However, this notion is very restrictive and cannot be applied in unpredictable domains like healthcare. To address this issue, we need conformance metrics for detecting and quantifying <b>infringements</b> of policies and procedures. However, existing metrics usually consider every deviation from specifications equally making them inadequate to measure the severity of <b>infringements.</b> In this paper, we identify a number of factors which can be used to quantify deviations from process specifications. These factors drive the definition of metrics that allow for a more accurate measurement of privacy <b>infringements.</b> We demonstrate how the proposed approach can be adopted to enhance existing conformance metrics through a case study on the provisioning of healthcare treatment...|$|R

40|$|Different {{organizations}} {{are committed to}} reducing deaths and serious injuries in road traffic. Their activities must be guided by research to produce measurable results contributed in reducing casualties and making roads safer. This paper provides detailed information about {{the second stage of}} the study for an evaluation of social legislation <b>infringements</b> for international haulage truck drivers involved in severe road transport accidents. The data were obtained from original sources of information: from digital tachograph printouts, analog tachograph data record sheets and attestations of activities. The aim of the second research stage was to find out to which extent the drivers involved in severe road traffic accidents (hereinafter RTA) have committed <b>infringements</b> more often and in larger quantities compared to the data obtained from the vehicle and driver regular roadside checks, i. e. compared with the drivers not involved in RTA. The second task for the paper is to analyze <b>infringements</b> by type and by level of drivers' riskiness {{to be involved in the}} RTA. The obtained findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies have been compiled, processed, analyzed and systematized by severity, quantity and type of simultaneously committed offences, installed tachograph type and other parameters. The statistical data have been grouped, systematized and analyzed according to the aim of the research. Based on various sources of information, an analysis of <b>infringements</b> for international haulage truck drivers was made between the obtained average amount of <b>infringements</b> per severe RTA case and per regular roadside check. The results of the research state that the drivers involved in severe RTA have committed considerably more <b>infringements</b> before the actual RTA has happened. The most part of <b>infringements</b> directly or indirectly refers to the lack of rest time and increased driving or overall working hours. These <b>infringements</b> for international haulage truck drivers are referred to be as major factors contributing to drivers' fatigue and high accidents risk...|$|R
