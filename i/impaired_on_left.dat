40|$|A 64 -year-old female {{presented}} with fever and weight loss, accompanied by normochromic normocytic anaemia with high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. She developed severe cor pulmonale. Ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy revealed a non-matched perfusion defect {{of the entire}} right lung with <b>impaired</b> perfusion <b>on</b> the <b>left</b> side. The CT scan of the thorax revealed an intravascular mass which completely blocked the right pulmonary artery with incomplete obstruction of the pulmonary trunk. Treatment with anticoagulants was started but failed. The presumably thrombotic mass was removed by thoracotomy; the histopathological diagnosis was: sarcoma of the pulmonary artery, incompletely resected. Postoperatively, {{the condition of the}} patient showed initial improvement, but she later developed fatal mediastinitis. Pulmonary artery sarcoma is a rare cause of cor pulmonale. Diagnosis is usually only established at operation, curative resection is uncommon and the prognosis is therefore poor [...] most patients die within months after the diagnosis has been made...|$|R

40|$|Macaque monkeys with {{bilateral}} lesions {{of either}} the frontal eye-fields (Area 8) or the inferior parietal lobule (Area 7 a or PG) were compared with unoperated controls {{on their ability to}} perform a series of 8 pre-operatively learnt visual discriminations. Simple non-spatial discriminations were not affected, but the frontal group was affected when the stimuli in a shape discrimination varied in position from trial to trial and the parietal group was <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the judgement of centre. Both groups were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> a spatial andmark test which used luminous timuli presented in the dark, in positions that varied randomly with respect to the monkey so that only allocentric ues were available.

A comparison of the performance of the two groups on all 8 tests suggests that although both are <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> spatial discriminations, the frontal eye-fields are concerned with spatially organising responses to explore the environment, while the inferior parietal lobule is concerned more directly with the processing of spatial information and the perception of spatial relationships...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} verbal and spatial working memory (WM) functioning in individuals with the neuro-developmental disorder Williams syndrome (WS) using WM component tasks. While {{there is strong}} evidence of WM impairments in WS, previous {{research has focused on}} short-term memory and has neglected assessment of executive components of WM. There is a particular lack of consensus concerning the profile of verbal WM functioning in WS. Here, WS participants were compared to typically developing participants matched for (1) verbal ability and (2) spatial ability (N = 14 in each of the 3 groups). Individuals with WS were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> verbal WM tasks, both those involving short-term maintenance of information and executive manipulation, in comparison to verbal-matched controls. Surprisingly, individuals with WS were not <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> a spatial task assessing short-term maintenance of information in memory (remembering spatial locations) compared to spatial-matched controls. They were, however, <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> a spatial executive WM task requiring the manipulation of spatial information in memory. The present study suggests that individuals with WS show WM impairments that extend to both verbal and spatial domains, although spatial deficits are selective to executive aspects of WM function...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} on the DSM-IV subtypes of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has demonstrated that the subtypes differ in demographic characteristics, types of functional impairment, and profiles of comorbidity with other childhood disorders. However, little research has tested whether the subtypes differ in underlying neuropsychological deficits. This study compared the neuropsycho-logical profiles of children without ADHD (n D 82) and children who met symptom criteria for DSM-IV Predominantly Inattentive subtype (ADHD-IA; n D 67), Predominantly Hyperactive Im-pulsive subtype (ADHD-HI; n D 14), and Combined subtype (ADHD-C; n D 33) {{in the areas of}} processing speed, vigilance, and inhibition. We hypothesized that children with elevations of inatten-tion symptoms (ADHD-IA and ADHD-C) would be <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> measures of vigilance and processing speed, whereas children with significant hyperactivity/impulsivity (ADHD-HI and ADHD-C) would be <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> measures of inhibition. Contrary to prediction, symptoms of inattention best predicted performance on all dependent measures, and ADHD-IA and ADHD-C children had similar profiles of impairment. In contrast, children with ADHD-HI were not significantly <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> any dependent measures once subclinical symptoms of inattention were controlled. Our results do not support distinct neuropsychological deficits in ADHD-IA and ADHD-C children, and suggest that symptoms of inat-tention, rather than symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity, are associated with neuropsychological impairment.

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 126 p. The relationship between visual perception and visual memory was investigated. Two tests of visual perception (Facial Recognition and Judgment of Line Orientation) and two tests of visual memory (Form Sequence Learning and the 7 / 24 Spatial Recall Test) were administered to 35 subjects with unilateral cerebral lesions acquired through cerebrovascular accidents. On both perceptual measures the frequency of deficits was significantly greater among subjects with right hemisphere lesions than among subjects with left hemisphere lesions, p $<$. 05. Performance on the visual memory tests was essentially normal for subjects with left hemisphere lesions unaccompanied by aphasia. In the presence of aphasia, performance on both visual memory tests was uniformly poor. Of subjects with right hemisphere lesions, 33 % were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> Form Sequence Learning whereas 70 % were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the 7 / 24 Spatial Recall Test. The hypothesis that visual perception was related to visual memory performance was confirmed, although the relationship varies with the hemispheric locus of lesion, and the types of perceptual and visual memory tests used. Specifically, Form Sequence Learning is significantly correlated with Facial Recognition following left hemisphere lesions, r(16) =. 51, p $<$. 05. Following right hemisphere lesions, 8 of 11 subjects <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the 7 / 24 test were also <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> Judgment of Line Orientation. With the lesion groups combined, Form Sequence Learning shows a pattern of significant correlations with verbal measures, whereas the 7 / 24 test shows a pattern of significant correlations with perceptual and perceptual-constructional measures. The results indicate that visual memory deficits accompany the syndrome of aphasia following left hemisphere lesions. Following right hemisphere lesions, visual memory impairment forms part of a wider syndrome of perceptual deficits...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY Loss {{of upper}} and lower homonymous sectors in the visual field, and wasting of {{corresponding}} sectors in the retinal nerve fibre layer, followed ligation of the distal part of the anterior choroidal artery in a patient with a meningioma of the velum interpositum. Clinical and radiological evidence indicated that the visual pathway was damaged within {{that part of the}} lateral geniculate body that is served by the anterior choroidal artery. A syndrome of sectorial optic atrophy and hom-onymous, horizontal sectoranopia has recently been described in this journal, and attributed to infarction of the territory of the lateral choroidal artery in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) (Frisen et al., 1978). Ischaemia within that part of the LGN that is served by the anterior choroidal artery should give the opposite picture: loss of {{upper and lower}} homonymous sectors in the visual field with corresponding sectorial optic atrophy. Such a case has not been described pre-viously but the following observations indicate that the prediction is correct. Case report A 31 year old engineer awoke one morning in 1972 with headache and a sensation of clumsiness in his left hand. He had previously been in ex-cellent health. Examination by a neurologist a few weeks later disclosed a minimal <b>left</b> hemi-paresis, <b>impaired</b> stereognosis <b>on</b> the <b>left,</b> and a left homonymous hemianopia. Bilateral papill-oedema of moderate degree was also noted. A radioisotope study showed early uptake of con-siderable magnitude in the deep parietal area on the right. Right carotid angiography demonst-rated a 15 mm displacement {{to the left of the}} midline vessels, and upward shift of middle cerebral artery branches.

40|$|Humans {{are able}} to use nonverbal {{behavior}} to make fast, reliable judgments of both emotional states and personality traits. Whereas a sizeable body of research has identified neural structures critical for emotion recognition, the neural substrates of personality trait attribution have not been explored in detail. In the present study, we investigated the neural systems involved in emotion and personality trait judgments. We used a type of visual stimulus that is known to convey both emotion and personality information, namely, point-light walkers. We compared the emotion and personality trait judgments made by subjects with brain damage to those made by neurologically normal subjects and then conducted a lesion overlap analysis to identify neural regions critical for these two tasks. Impairments on the two tasks dissociated: Some subjects were impaired at emotion recognition, but judged personality normally; other subjects were <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the personality task, but normal at emotion recognition. Moreover, these dissociations in performance were associated with damage to specific neural regions: Right somatosensory cortices were a primary focus of lesion overlap in subjects <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the emotion task, whereas left frontal opercular cortices were a primary focus of lesion overlap in subjects <b>impaired</b> <b>on</b> the personality task.
