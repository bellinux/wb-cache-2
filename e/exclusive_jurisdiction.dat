5|$|<b>Exclusive</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any geographical area. If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will {{have to choose between}} them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) <b>Exclusive</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of <b>Exclusive</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E
5|$|Relations between Grand Lodges are {{determined}} by the concept of Recognition. Each Grand Lodge maintains a list of other Grand Lodges that it recognises. When two Grand Lodges recognise and are in Masonic communication with each other, they are said to be , and the brethren of each may visit each other's Lodges and interact Masonically. When two Grand Lodges are not in amity, inter-visitation is not allowed. There are many reasons why one Grand Lodge will withhold or withdraw recognition from another, but the two most common are <b>Exclusive</b> <b>Jurisdiction</b> and Regularity.|$|E
5|$|If {{the federal}} {{property}} is an enclave, then {{the federal government}} has <b>exclusive</b> <b>jurisdiction,</b> unless the state reserved rights when it ceded the land to the federal government. The Assimilative Crimes Act makes it a federal crime to violate a state law while at a federal enclave in that state. The Assimilative Crimes Act only applies to criminal laws (not regulatory laws), and is not applicable if the conduct is already regulated by federal law. Under federal law, military facilities are required to adopt state traffic laws, but the base commander is permitted to institute additional traffic laws.|$|E

Two notable exceptions are: (1) actions for replevin, in which the District Courts have <b>exclusive</b> original <b>jurisdiction</b> regardless {{of the value of}} the thing in controversy; [...] and (2) landlord-tenant matters, in which the District Court has <b>exclusive</b> original <b>jurisdiction</b> in all cases.|$|R

5|$|Macdonald wrote Nova Scotia's {{submission}} {{and presented}} it himself when the Commission held hearings in Halifax in February 1938. He {{called on the}} federal government to take full responsibility for social programs such as unemployment insurance, old-age pensions and mothers' allowances. Macdonald recommended that the federal government be given <b>exclusive</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over income taxes and succession duties to pay for these programs. He argued however, that to maintain their independence, the provinces needed to collect indirect sources of revenue such as sales taxes. He also called for exclusive provincial control over such minor tax fields as gasoline and electricity taxes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had <b>exclusive</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Macdonald {{plunged into}} {{his role as}} a leading {{champion}} for the provinces. He argued that in order to maintain their independence, provinces needed <b>exclusive</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over such sources of revenue as gasoline, electricity and amusement taxes. He lobbied for constitutional amendments designed to guarantee provincial rights. Macdonald urged the federal government to accept the 1940 recommendations of the Rowell-Sirois Commission and redistribute national wealth based on need. Such a policy, he maintained, would enable poorer provinces to sustain government services available {{in other parts of the}} country without having to impose higher-than-average levels of taxation. In the end, Macdonald won only small victories such as gaining exclusive provincial access to gasoline taxes. The federal government refused to recognize financial need as the basis for provincial subsidies.|$|E

5|$|The Serjeants had {{for many}} centuries <b>exclusive</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over the Court of Common Pleas, {{being the only}} lawyers allowed {{to argue a case}} there. At the same time they had rights of {{audience}} in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by Writ of Summons under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace {{at the top of the}} wig.|$|E
5|$|Through the Judiciary Act of 1789, Congress {{established}} a six-member Supreme Court. The court {{was composed of}} one Chief Justice and five Associate Justices. It was given exclusive original jurisdiction over all civil actions between states, or between a state and the United States, as well as over all suits and proceedings brought against ambassadors and other diplomatic personnel; and original, but not <b>exclusive,</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> over all other cases in which a state was a party and any cases brought by an ambassador. The Court was given appellate jurisdiction over decisions of the federal circuit courts as well as decisions by state courts holding invalid any statute or treaty of the United States; or holding valid any state law or practice that was challenged as being inconsistent with the federal constitution, treaties, or laws; or rejecting any claim made by a party under a provision of the federal constitution, treaties, or laws.|$|E

40|$|Courts {{have long}} assumed the {{existence}} of <b>exclusive</b> federal <b>jurisdiction</b> over private actions implied from section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule 10 b- 5. The result {{is not only to}} restrict forum choice for rule 10 b- 5 claimants but also to generate a host of questions concerning the extent of federal authority: whether rule 10 b- 5 actions are exempt from the claim and issue preclusive effects of state court decisions; whether state courts can hear defenses and state-created claims that involve rule 10 b- 5; and whether federal courts can stay rule 10 b- 5 actions in deference to state court litigation. In dividing on these questions, courts invariably fail to examine the underlying premise: that <b>exclusive</b> federal <b>jurisdiction</b> has a valid legal basis. The thesis of this Article is that <b>exclusive</b> federal <b>jurisdiction</b> over rule 10 b- 5 actions lacks a legitimate foundation and should be rejected. State courts should share with federal courts the adjudication of rule 10 b- 5 actions...|$|R
