Current pressure vessel design codes such as the European Unfired pressure vessel code MSA EN 13445 Part 3 present buckling as a failure mode {{that needs to be}} prevented. The latest version of the code has a <b>Design</b> <b>by</b> <b>Analysis</b> route that requires the designer to perform a buckling check on the design model. This study considers the different design approaches (<b>Design</b> <b>by</b> <b>Analysis</b> and Design by Rule) presented in MSA EN 13445 Part 3 and compares computational results with experimental data available from literature. The study shows that the pressure vessel design code MSA EN 13445 Part 3 guarantees that the calculated design load will not subject torispherical heads to buckling in the knuckle region, under {{the action of}} internal pressure...|$|E
40|$|Thin shell {{torispherical}} {{pressure vessel}} heads {{are known to}} exhibit complex elastic-plastic deformation and buckling behaviour under static pressure. In pressure vessel <b>Design</b> <b>by</b> <b>Analysis,</b> the designer is required to assess both of these behaviour modes when specifying the allowable static load. The EN and ASME boiler and pressure vessel codes {{permit the use of}} inelastic analysis in <b>design</b> <b>by</b> <b>analysis,</b> known as the direct route in the EN Code. In this paper, plastic collapse or gross plastic deformation loads are evaluated for two sample torispherical heads by 2 D and 3 D FEA based on an elastic-perfectly plastic material model. Small and large deformation effects are considered in the 2 D analyses and the effect of geometry and load perturbation are considered in the 3 D analysis. The plastic load is determined by applying the ASME twice elastic slope criterion of plastic collapse and an alternative plastic criterion, the Plastic Work Curvature criterion. The formation of the gross plastic deformation mechanism in the models is considered in relation to the elastic-plastic buckling response of the vessels. It is concluded that in both cases, design is limited by formation of an axisymmetric gross plastic deformation in the knuckle of the vessels prior to formation of non-axisymmetric buckling modes...|$|E

40|$|Large {{air-cooled}} {{heat exchangers}} (ACHEs) are most popularly {{implemented in the}} petrochemical and power industries at arid locations. They operate on a simple concept of convective heat transfer, whereby air in the surrounding atmosphere is caused to flow across a tube bundle, which in turn transports a process fluid. The distribution {{and direction of the}} process fluid flow may furthermore be guided via a set of appropriately located header boxes, which essentially consist of a collection of welded flat plates and nozzle attachments. Perforations on one of the faces of these boxes serve as an interface to the tube bundle. The overall design and construction of an ACHE is commonly regulated by an American Petroleum Institute (API) standard, which is required to be used in conjunction with acceptable design codes. In spite of this, the design of certain header box configurations remains of prominent concern. It is the focus of the present study to investigate the approach adopted for a header box variant labelled as the removable cover type. In this configuration, one of the plates used to construct the header box is fastened and sealed by a collection of bolted joints and a gasket, allowing it to be removed. One appropriate design code for the header box equipment is the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) boiler and pressure vessel code. However, it provides no specific approach pertaining to the removable cover design. Instead it has been commonplace in industry for a number of aspects from this code to be synthesized, together with a collection of assumptions surrounding the header box behaviour, into an all encompassing design by rule approach. In this approach, the header box behaviour is accepted as being planar, whilst circumstances such as nozzle attachments and associated loading would suggest that a more comprehensive approach should be undertaken. The aim of the present study is therefore to critically evaluate the current practice, and establish its adequacy. To do so, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model (FEM) of an example header box design is developed. Subsequent comparisons with the stress distribution predicted via current practice show that the existing analytical model gives inaccurate and, in cases, overly conservative results. A new analytical approach developed from rigid frame theory is demonstrated to provide improved correlation with FEM. The linear elastic <b>design</b> <b>by</b> <b>analysis</b> approach, presented in the ASME code, is also utilised as a method for establishing design adequacy. Results obtained via <b>design</b> <b>by</b> <b>analysis</b> incorporating the finite element method are shown to be less conservative than those arising from design by rule methods. The <b>design</b> <b>by</b> <b>analysis</b> approach is also used to conduct a more detailed investigation of nozzle placement and external loading. In general, the effect of including a nozzle did not result in a significant increase in side plate stress, with failure more likely to occur within the nozzle wall.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are used}} to design test geometries and loading histories that are suitable for probing the large-scale bridging effects of through-thickness reinforcement that is shearing at high strain rates. The bridging effects are represented by a cohesive law and tests are sought that will determine any rate dependence in its parameters. The End Notched Flexure test is studied, because it allows easy application of time dependent loading and {{has proven to be}} an information-rich test in the quasi-static case. However, dynamic conditions greatly complicate fracture behavior, with possible regimes of hammering and multiple cracking, which should be avoided when maximum information is sought. Information content is addressed by focusing on regimes within the full computed solution space where crack growth is approximately steady-state and the information content of experiments can be most easily assessed. Numerical results show that hypothetical rate-dependence in the cohesive law causes strong and measurable changes in the regime of steady-state behavior, if the tests are properly selected to vary the crack sliding speed. The estimates of information content are conservative, because the information available from all possible tests of specimens <b>designed</b> <b>by</b> <b>analysis</b> of the steady state regime will necessarily exceed the information deduced by analyzing the steady-state regime alone...|$|R

Two analogue peptides (analogue I and III) showed more potent antifungal and lower hemolytic activity than the original peptide. To study the antifungal mechanism of these peptides, fluorescence activated flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy were performed with the most powerful antifungal analogue I peptide designed in the present study.
