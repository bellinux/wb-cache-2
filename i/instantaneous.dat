5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any <b>instantaneous</b> laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the mean flow is also the <b>instantaneous</b> flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a parabolic PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution {{often referred to as the}} Blasius boundary layer.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{expressions}} {{are for the}} mean obliquity, that is, without the nutation of the equator included. The true or <b>instantaneous</b> obliquity includes the nutation.|$|E
5|$|Deviations {{can occur}} for small {{droplets}} and during different rainfall conditions. The distribution tends to fit averaged rainfall, while <b>instantaneous</b> size spectra often deviate {{and have been}} modeled as gamma distributions. The distribution has an upper limit due to droplet fragmentation.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an unexplained {{phenomenon}} {{causes the}} sky to flash white. Afterward, every chicken around the world develops <b>instantaneous</b> intelligence on par with humans. They are also able to speak clearly.|$|E
5|$|Many {{personal}} dive computers {{record the}} <b>instantaneous</b> depth at small time increments during the dive. This data {{can often be}} downloaded to a personal computer or tablet and displayed in graphic form as a dive profile.|$|E
5|$|Regeneration {{and power}} {{consumption}} can be {{monitored by the}} driver with an analogue instrument on the dashboard/control panel which shows both <b>instantaneous</b> power consumed and regeneration.|$|E
5|$|Space is also crisscrossed with {{continuum}} fluxes, coordinate pairs {{that allow}} <b>instantaneous</b> travel between them without consuming fuel. Travel via fluxes cuts down significantly on fuel costs and travel time, though it causes {{all but the}} most accomplished navigators to lose their bearings.|$|E
5|$|Developed by Game Freak and {{published}} by Nintendo, the Pokémon series began in Japan in 1996. The player assumes {{the role of a}} Pokémon Trainer whose goal is to capture and train creatures called Pokémon. Players use the creatures' special abilities to combat other Pokémon, and certain abilities also grant new ways to navigate the game's world, such as <b>instantaneous</b> travel between two areas.|$|E
5|$|Plants are not passive, but {{respond to}} {{external}} signals such as light, touch, and injury by moving or growing towards {{or away from}} the stimulus, as appropriate. Tangible evidence of touch sensitivity is the almost <b>instantaneous</b> collapse of leaflets of Mimosa pudica, the insect traps of Venus flytrap and bladderworts, and the pollinia of orchids.|$|E
5|$|The cap {{was pulled}} down, {{and while he}} was praying the trap was pulled. Death was not <b>instantaneous.</b> Louis Riel's pulse ceased four minutes after the trap-door fell and during that time the rope around his neck slowly strangled and choked him to death. The body was to have been interred inside the gallows' enclosure, and the grave was commenced, but an order came from the Lieutenant-Governor to hand the body over to Sheriff Chapleau which was {{accordingly}} done that night.|$|E
5|$|This {{establishment}} {{just received}} from Europe the negatives {{for the new}} process of <b>instantaneous</b> photographies that have so much success there. Through these chichets one can obtain a more perfect portrait of a moving child, of nervous people... The public is invited to come examine in the establishment some portraits obtained by the new process.|$|E
5|$|Two {{measures}} of the <b>instantaneous</b> discharge of Darby Creek at Foxcroft in the 2000s were 10 and 17 cubic feet per second. The specific conductance of the creek ranged from 274 to 313 micro-siemens per centimeter. The pH was slightly alkaline, ranging from 7.3 to 7.8. The concentration of water hardness in the creek ranged between 100 and 109 milligrams per liter.|$|E
5|$|Walker {{resisted}} Kenney's {{proposals that}} the bombers conduct attacks from low level using bombs armed with <b>instantaneous</b> fuses. Kenney ordered Walker {{to try the}} fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued their use. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck, but the <b>instantaneous</b> fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, so bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. A few weeks later, Walker was shot down leading a daylight raid over Rabaul, an attack that Kenney had ordered to be conducted at night.|$|E
5|$|Let us not, therefore, be discouraged, though, for the present, {{we should}} see no great number of churches professedly unitarian.... We are, as it were, laying gunpowder, grain by grain, under the old {{building}} of error and superstition, which a single spark may hereafter inflame, so as to produce an <b>instantaneous</b> explosion; in consequence of which that edifice, the erection {{of which has been}} the work of ages, may be overturned in a moment, and so effectually as that the same foundation can never be built upon again....|$|E
5|$|The {{impact with}} the fire {{extinguisher}} wrenched Pryce's helmet upward sharply. Death was almost certainly <b>instantaneous.</b> Pryce's Shadow DN8, now with its driver dead at the wheel, continued at speed down the main straight towards the first corner, called Crowthorne. The car left the track to the right, scraping the metal barriers, hitting an entrance for emergency vehicles, and veering back onto the track. It then hit Jacques Laffite's Ligier, sending both Pryce and Laffite head-on into the barriers. Jansen van Vuuren's injuries were so extensive that, initially, his body was identified only after the race director had summoned all of the race marshals {{and he was not}} among them.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An <b>instantaneous</b> measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
5|$|The wing profile {{remained}} {{the same as the}} F-5E, but had modified leading edge extensions (LEX), which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12% with an increase in wing area of only 1.6%. The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch, so the horizontal stabilizer was increased in size by 30% and a new dual-channel fly-by-wire control system was added. Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the <b>instantaneous</b> turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach0.8 and 15,000ft (4,572m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16's 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% higher than those of the F-5E.|$|E
25|$|If the {{reference}} {{point is the}} <b>instantaneous</b> axis of rotation the expression of velocity of {{a point in the}} rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of <b>instantaneous</b> axis of rotation is zero. An example of <b>instantaneous</b> axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Instantaneous</b> – All 12 links {{are present}} in the same instant.|$|E
25|$|An <b>instantaneous</b> unit {{hydrograph}} {{is a further}} refinement of the concept; for an IUH, the input rainfall is assumed to all take place at a discrete point in time (obviously, this isn't the case for actual rainstorms). Making this assumption can greatly simplify the analysis involved in constructing a {{unit hydrograph}}, and {{it is necessary for}} the creation of a geomorphologic <b>instantaneous</b> unit hydrograph.|$|E
25|$|A {{theoretical}} ideal sampler produces samples {{equivalent to}} the <b>instantaneous</b> value of the continuous signal at the desired points.|$|E
25|$|Predict {{the range}} and bearing of the echo at 0935, if the (<b>instantaneous)</b> {{manoeuvre}} is made at 0941.|$|E
25|$|These {{drugs are}} {{efficient}} for acute poisoning of arsenic, {{which refers to}} the <b>instantaneous</b> effects caused by arsenic poisoning. For example, headaches, vomiting or sweating {{are some of the}} common examples of an <b>instantaneous</b> effect. In comparison, chronic poisonous effects arise later on, and unexpectedly such as organ damage. Usually it is too late to prevent them once they appear. Therefore, action should be taken as soon as acute poisonous effects arise.|$|E
25|$|Type 25B {{electric}} impact fuze. This {{could be}} set to <b>instantaneous</b> detonation, short delay (less than 1 second), or for a 17-second delay.|$|E
25|$|In {{the context}} of {{communication}} waveforms, the time-variant angle , or its principal value, {{is referred to as}} <b>instantaneous</b> phase, often just phase.|$|E
25|$|Algebraically, the {{equation}} may be rearranged to compute torque {{for a given}} angular speed and power output. Note that the power injected by the torque depends only on the <b>instantaneous</b> angular speed – not on whether the angular speed increases, decreases, or remains constant while the torque is being applied (this {{is equivalent to the}} linear case where the power injected by a force depends only on the <b>instantaneous</b> speed – not on the resulting acceleration, if any).|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} by Euler's {{rotation}} theorem that, for any rotating frame, there always exists an <b>instantaneous</b> {{axis of rotation}} in any instant. In {{the case of a}} frame, the angular velocity vector is over the <b>instantaneous</b> axis of rotation. Any transversal section of a plane perpendicular to this axis has to behave as a two dimensional rotation. Thus, the magnitude of the angular velocity vector at a given time t is consistent with the two dimensions case.|$|E
25|$|Robert Heinlein's The Number of the Beast {{utilizes}} non-Euclidean geometry {{to explain}} <b>instantaneous</b> transport through {{space and time}} and between parallel and fictional universes.|$|E
25|$|Dispersion (usually {{named after}} Fritz London), {{which is the}} {{attractive}} interaction between any pair of molecules, including non-polar atoms, arising from the interactions of <b>instantaneous</b> multipoles.|$|E
25|$|A common {{example is}} a chirped Gaussian pulse, a wave whose field {{amplitude}} follows a Gaussian envelope and whose <b>instantaneous</b> phase has a frequency sweep.|$|E
25|$|The Holiness Movement {{emerged in}} the 1860s in the USA {{with the desire to}} re-emphasize Wesley's sanctification doctrine. Holiness preachers taught that sanctification was an <b>instantaneous</b> experience.|$|E
25|$|Peter Lynds {{has argued}} that all of Zeno's motion paradoxes are {{resolved}} by the conclusion that instants in time and <b>instantaneous</b> magnitudes do not physically exist.|$|E
25|$|At a {{personal}} level, CMC such as SMS Text Messaging and mobile e-mailing (push mail) has greatly enhanced <b>instantaneous</b> communication. Some {{examples include the}} iPhone and the BlackBerry.|$|E
25|$|At {{very short}} time scales, however, the motion of a {{particle}} is dominated by its inertia and its displacement will be linearly dependent on time: Δx = vΔt. So the <b>instantaneous</b> velocity of the Brownian motion can be measured as v = Δx/Δt, when Δt << τ, where τ is the momentum relaxation time. In 2010, the <b>instantaneous</b> velocity of a Brownian particle (a glass microsphere trapped in air with an optical tweezer) was measured successfully. The velocity data verified the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution, and the equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle.|$|E
25|$|Results in 2013 from Planck mission, in {{combination}} with data from WMAP polarization, small-scale CMB experiments, and BAO measurements yield an <b>instantaneous</b> reionization redshift of z = 11.3 ± 1.1.|$|E
