25|$|One of {{the first}} {{applications}} of <b>electrotyping</b> was in printing. Initially, <b>electrotyping</b> was used to make copper reproductions of engraved metal plates or wooden carvings, which were used to print artwork. The electrotypes could be incorporated along with movable type to compose the s for printing. Jacobi published his first account of <b>electrotyping</b> in October 1838. In 1839, <b>electrotyping</b> was used by Russian printers for government documents; the Russian Czar Nicholas I had immediately become an enthusiastic supporter and patron of the technology. In England, the first use of <b>electrotyping</b> for printing appeared in the London Journal of April 1840, and other English examples are known from later in that year. The image to the right shows {{one of the earliest}} uses of <b>electrotyping</b> in the United States; it is a comparison done by Joseph Alexander Adams in 1841 of the printed image prepared directly from a wood carving and of the image printed from a copper electrotype copy. Electrotyped copper plates could be formed into cylinders, which was valuable for use in magazine and newspaper printing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrotyping</b> {{is related}} to electroplating, which {{permanently}} adds a thin metallic overlayer to a metallic object instead of creating a freestanding metal part. <b>Electrotyping</b> and electroforming both produce metal parts, but differ in technical details. Electroforming involves {{the production of a}} metallic part around a metallic mandrel, although the term is sometimes used more broadly to encompass all electrodeposition processes. As noted above, <b>electrotyping</b> forms the part using a non-conducting mold or form whose surface has been made conducting by applying a thin coating of graphite or metal powder.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a second}} type of <b>electrotyping</b> {{that has been used}} in which the copper film is {{deposited}} onto the outside of a form, and is not separated from it. In this use the form is typically waterproofed plaster, which remains as a core after <b>electrotyping.</b> In German this method is known as Kerngalvanoplastik; the more usual technique described in the previous paragraph is known as Hohlgalvanoplastik.|$|E

25|$|By the 1900s {{printing}} plants often incorporated <b>electrotyping</b> and stereotyping departments, and <b>electrotyping</b> and stereotyping {{had become}} trades with associated apprenticeships. In the United Kingdom, the National Society of Electrotypers and Stereotypers (NSES) formed in 1893, {{and continued to}} 1967 when it amalgamated with the National Graphic Association. In the US and Canada, the International Stereotypers and Electrotypers Union (ISEU) was formed in 1902; previously, electrotypers had belonged to the International Typographer's Union (ITU). In 1925 there were 6800 members, and in 1955 10,500. In 1973 the ISEU was absorbed into the International Printing and Graphic Communications Union. In 1978, an Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that 2000 electrotypers and stereotypers were employed in the US. However, job prospects were reported as poor. Offset printing has supplanted letterpress printing in most printing plants; the last letterpress facility for a newspaper was installed in the 1980s. For offset printing, the printing plates are typically prepared by coating them with light-sensitive materials, and creating {{the image on the}} plate by direct optical exposure (the photo-offset process); stereotyping and <b>electrotyping</b> are not used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electrotyping</b> is {{activated}} by electric currents that flow between anode wires {{that are also}} immersed in the solution and the wire connected to the coated mold (the cathode). For copper <b>electrotyping,</b> a typical aqueous electrolyte contains copper sulfate (CuSO4) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and the anode is also copper; the arrangement is illustrated in the figure. The electric current causes copper atoms to dissolve from the anode's surface and to enter the electrolyte as copper ions (Cu++ in the figure). Copper ions are {{taken up by the}} mold's conducting surface at the same rate at which copper dissolves from the anode, thus completing the electrical circuit. When the copper layer on the mold grows to the desired thickness, the electric current is stopped. The mold and its attached electrotype are removed from the solution, and the electrotype and the mold are separated. An animation of the <b>electrotyping</b> process was produced in 2011 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Other metals besides copper can be electrotyped; similar procedures apply, but each different metal needs its own anode and electrolyte chemicals.|$|E
25|$|Fine {{printing}} presses, {{notably the}} Chiswick Press, bought original Caslon type from the Caslon foundry; copies of these matrices were also made by <b>electrotyping.</b> From the 1860s new types {{began to appear}} in a style similar to Caslon's, starting from Miller & Richard's Modernised Old Style of c. 1860. The Caslon foundry itself covertly cut new swash capitals and replaced some sizes with new, cleaner versions.|$|E

25|$|A slight {{problem with}} <b>electrotyping</b> of type {{is that the}} new form is {{slightly}} smaller than the original - according to Justin Howes, the calculation of the Stephenson Blake type foundry was that the shrinkage was on average 0.0038%. While obviously not very much, this deviance could accumulate if a letterform was repeatedly regenerated. Stephenson Blake's solution was to squash type slightly in a press or file it down to broaden it before putting it into the electrotype bath.|$|E
25|$|As {{with metal}} casting and stereotyping, a mold is first formed from the model. Since <b>electrotyping</b> {{involves}} wet chemical processes and is done near room temperature, the molding material can be soft. Materials such as wax, gutta-percha (natural latex), and ultimately ozokerite were used. The mold's surface is made electrically conducting by coating it very thinly with fine graphite powder or paint. A wire {{is attached to}} the conducting surface, and the mold is suspended in an electrolyte solution.|$|E
25|$|Thoreau {{returned}} to Concord {{and worked in}} his family's pencil factory, which {{he would continue to}} do alongside his writing and other work for most of his adult life. He rediscovered the process of making good pencils with inferior graphite by using clay as the binder. This invention allowed profitable use of a graphite source found in New Hampshire that had been purchased in 1821 by Thoreau's brother-in-law, Charles Dunbar. The process of mixing graphite and clay, known as the Conté process, had been first patented by Nicolas-Jacques Conté in 1795. The company's other source of graphite had been Tantiusques, a mine operated by Native Americans in Sturbridge, Massachusetts. Later, Thoreau converted the pencil factory to produce plumbago, a name for graphite at the time, which was used in the <b>electrotyping</b> process.|$|E

500|$|The dean of this {{department}} was Alexander Rodchenko, {{who was appointed}} in February 1922. Rodchenko's department was more expansive than its name would suggest, concentrating on abstract and concrete examples of product design. In {{a report to the}} rector of 1923, Rodchenko listed the following subjects as being offered: higher mathematics, descriptive geometry, theoretical mechanics, physics, the history of art and political literacy. Theoretical tasks included graphic design and [...] "volumetric and spatial discipline"; while practical experience was given in foundry work, minting, engraving and <b>electrotyping.</b> Students were also given internships in factories. Rodchenko's approach effectively combined art and technology, and he was offered the deanship of Vkhutein in 1928, although he refused. El Lissitzky was {{also a member of the}} faculty.|$|E
500|$|Bird's {{experiments}} with his cell were {{important for the}} new discipline of electrometallurgy. [...] An unforeseen result was the deposition of copper on and within the plaster, without any contact with the metal electrodes. [...] On breaking apart the plaster {{it was found that}} veins of copper were formed running right through it. [...] So surprising was this result that it was at first disbelieved by electrochemical researchers, including Faraday. [...] Deposition of copper and other metals had previously been noted, but only on metal electrodes. [...] Bird's experiments sometimes get him credit for being the founder of the industrial field of electrometallurgy. [...] In particular, Bird's discovery is the principle behind <b>electrotyping.</b> [...] However, Bird himself never made practical use of this discovery, nor did he carry out any work in metallurgy as such. [...] Some of Bird's contemporaries with interests in electrometallurgy wished to bestow the credit on Bird in order to discredit the commercial claims of their rivals.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electrotyping</b> {{has been}} used for the {{production}} of metal sculptures, where it is an alternative to the casting of molten metal. These sculptures are sometimes called [...] "galvanoplastic bronzes", although the actual metal is usually copper. It was possible to apply essentially any patina to these sculptures; gilding was also readily accomplished in the same facilities as <b>electrotyping</b> by using electroplating. <b>Electrotyping</b> {{has been used}} to reproduce valuable objects such as ancient coins, and in some cases electrotype copies have proven more durable than fragile originals.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Electrotyping</b> {{was also}} used to produce entire {{printing}} plates directly from the formes composed from movable type and illustrations. In this application, <b>electrotyping</b> was a higher quality but more costly alternative to stereotyping, which involved casting of type metal into a mold prepared from the forme. Stereotyping had been invented around 1725, and was already well-established when <b>electrotyping</b> was invented in 1838. Both methods yielded plates that could be preserved in case of future needs, for example in the printing of novels and other books of unpredictable popularity. The movable type used to compose the original forme could then be re-used. Both methods {{could be used to}} prepared curved plates for rotary presses, which were used for the longest print runs. The widespread adoption of <b>electrotyping</b> for this use occurred after mechanical electrical generators (dynamos) became commonly available around 1872. These generators supplanted the whole rooms of chemical batteries (Smee cells) that were previously used to provide electricity for <b>electrotyping.</b> Batteries did not have the electrical capacity needed to rapidly deposit the electrotype (or [...] "electro"). The advent of plating dynamos sped up <b>electrotyping</b> twenty times or more, so that an electrotype printing plate could be deposited in less than two hours. In addition, the chemical batteries gave off toxic fumes that had required their isolation in separate rooms.|$|E

J. Jordan with the invention in England, or Joseph Alexander Adams in the United States; Heinrich in particular gave a thorough account of the controversies surrounding the crediting of the invention, along with a short biography of Jacobi, in an article honoring the centennial of <b>electrotyping</b> in 1938.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Electrotyping</b> (also galvanoplasty) is a {{chemical}} method for forming metal parts that exactly reproduce a model. The method {{was invented by}} Moritz von Jacobi in Russia in 1838, and was immediately adopted for applications in printing and several other fields. As described in an 1890 treatise, <b>electrotyping</b> produces [...] "an exact facsimile of any object having an irregular surface, whether it be an engraved steel- or copper-plate, a wood-cut, or a form of set-up type, {{to be used for}} printing; or a medal, medallion, statue, bust, or even a natural object, for art purposes." [...] In art, several important [...] "bronze" [...] sculptures created in the 19th century are actually electrotyped copper, and not bronze at all; sculptures were executed using <b>electrotyping</b> at least into the 1930s. In printing, <b>electrotyping</b> had become a standard method for producing plates for letterpress printing by the late 1800s. It complemented the older technology of stereotyping, which involved metal casting. By 1901, stereotypers and electrotypers in several countries had formed labor unions around these crafts. The unions persisted into the 1970s, but by the late 20th century, after more than a century in widespread use for preparing plates, the two technologies had been bypassed by the transitions to offset printing and to new techniques for the preparation of printing plates.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>electrotyping</b> {{industry}} was limited for some decades by {{the sources of}} the electric currents needed to activate the deposition of metal films into the mold; the rate of film growth is proportional to the magnitude of this current. In the initial work, the Daniell cell was used to provide these currents. The Daniell cell was largely replaced by the Smee cell (amalgamated zinc and platinized silver in sulfuric acid) after the latter's invention by [...] in 1840. Both of these cells are forerunners of contemporary electrical batteries. By the 1870s, mechanical generators were being used; the larger currents that could be sustained by generators enabled substantial increases in the rate of metal deposition during <b>electrotyping.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Many sculptors have {{experimented with}} the {{technique}} of <b>electrotyping</b> a plaster form that remains as {{the core of the}} finished sculpture (Kerngalvanoplastik). As one example, the sculptor Elie Nadelman did several significant sculptures in the 1920s and 1930s using this technique. The advantage was that Nadelman could have these [...] "galvanoplastique" [...] metal sculptures made quickly and inexpensively. Such sculptures can degrade quickly, and have presented significant preservation and restoration problems.|$|E
