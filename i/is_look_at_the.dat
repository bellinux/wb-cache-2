Bachmann and Santorum criticised him for suggesting that Pakistan should get no aid at all, with Santorum saying [...] "we can't be indecisive about whether Pakistan is our friend. They must be our friend, {{and we must}} engage them as friends". Bachmann drew raised eyebrows for her claim that China's economy was growing because of its lack of a social safety net, saying [...] "If you look at China, they don't have food stamps. They don't have the modern welfare state, and China's growing... And so what I would do <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> programs that LBJ gave us with the Great Society and they'd be gone." ...|$|E

Specifically, they {{will discuss the}} interaction (pathway) between a specific 'sphere' and the 'event' (hurricane). Working in groups, students will be assigned a specific sphere to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> more closely in relation to hurricanes. When all groups are finished, each will present their findings to the class for comparison and a closer look. If the group is assigned the Hydrosphere they will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oceans in the Live Access Server (LAS), if the group is assigned the Lithosphere <b>the</b> group will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Land Surface in the LAS, if the group is assigned the Biosphere they will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Biosphere in the LAS and the group that is assigned <b>the</b> Atmosphere will <b>be</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Atmosphere in the LAS.

[...] "There's {{something}} afoot, and I can't be sure what it <b>is.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd to-night. Of course, all the Americans are here, but the diplomatic attendance has never been so thin. The Rumanian Minister and his wife, the Italian, the Spanish, and the Swedish representatives are all absent. I have just heard, too, that Baron von Schwerin is giving a dinner-party." ...|$|E

I must go back and see after some executions I ordered," [...] and she walked off, leaving Alice with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like {{the look of the}} creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.|$|E

What do you know about her except that she is a beauty? I grant you she's that, but are you aware of the infinitesimal part looks play in married life? My dear chap, better is it for a man that he marry a sympathetic gargoyle than a Venus with a streak of hardness in her. You know--and you would admit it if you were honest with yourself--that this girl is hard. She's got a chilled-steel soul.|$|E

5000|$|Critical {{opinion is}} divided, however, {{as to the}} virtues of the color version {{compared}} to the original black and white art. Wivel, for example, has referred to the 1987 American edition as [...] "garishly colored" [...] whereas Witzke feels [...] "the colors can’t be undersold [...] [...] [...] they are transformative to the work, and {{all you need to do}} <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun setting over two pages, which is so good it's kind of an insult to call it stunning." [...] Among Moebius admirers there seems to be no consensus on this matter, and some readers like both versions. Ian MacEwan, the creator of a popular Tumblr site dedicated to Moebius, has called himself [...] "a huge fan of the coloring [...] [...] [...] I like it at least as much as the original b&w, purist in me be damned." ...|$|E

5000|$|It is in {{some ways}} {{difficult}} to gauge the difference in athletic performance. In racing sports, such as cross country and track & field, it is simple because all one has to do <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> individual and team standings. In sports where only two teams play each other, it is more difficult. Massey Ratings does attempt to rank college teams across NCAA Divisions. As of November 19, 2013, NCAA Division III had 448 members, and the Massey Ratings had over 100 Division III men's basketball teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's basketball had 88 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's tennis had over 170 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's soccer had over 300 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's volleyball had over 300 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] These are the fall sports where only two teams play each other at a time, and where over 300 members of each Division field teams. In all of these rankings, the top teams were Division I teams. While these rankings are in constant states of flux as the seasons progress, they are typical of the substantial overlap between the Divisions, with the top teams being Division I teams.|$|E
