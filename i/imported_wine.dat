5|$|Though most provinces {{were capable}} of {{producing}} wine, regional varietals were desirable and wine was a central item of trade. Shortages of vin ordinaire were rare. The major suppliers {{for the city of}} Rome were the west coast of Italy, southern Gaul, the Tarraconensis region of Hispania, and Crete. Alexandria, the second-largest city, <b>imported</b> <b>wine</b> from Laodicea in Syria and the Aegean. At the retail level, taverns or speciality wine shops (vinaria) sold wine by the jug for carryout and by the drink on premises, with price ranges reflecting quality.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of beer for himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants <b>imported</b> <b>wine</b> and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E

25|$|Smuggling {{activity}} in Britain became more prevalent though the Tudor and Stuart period reaching its peak {{at the end}} of the 18th century. High rates of duty were levied on <b>imported</b> <b>wine,</b> spirits, and other luxury goods to pay for Britain's expensive wars with France and the United States. Cornwall was a haven for smugglers at this time, with its many secluded coves ideally suited for evasion of the duty, a smuggling provided a highly profitable venture for impoverished fishermen and seafarers. St Buryan was no different in this respect, and also home to smuggling activity. Thomas Johns, a known smuggler and agent of smugglers, was the landlord of the Kings Arms public house, formerly on the site of Belmont House in the village square, who divided his time between St Buryan and his liquor establishments in Roscoff, Brittany. More famous still was the Lamorna wink public house near Lamorna Cove which was also a base for smugglers. The pub was so named as winking at the barman would reputedly allow you to purchase smuggled spirits.|$|E
500|$|The city, {{through its}} {{location}} on the River Ouse and its proximity to the Great North Road became a major trading centre. King John granted the city's first charter in 1212, confirming trading rights in England and Europe. During the later Middle Ages York merchants <b>imported</b> <b>wine</b> from France, cloth, wax, canvas, and oats from the Low Countries, timber and furs from the Baltic and exported grain to Gascony and grain and wool to the Low Countries. York became a major cloth manufacturing and trading centre. Edward I further stimulated the city's economy by using {{the city as a}} base for his war in Scotland. [...] The city was the location of significant unrest during the so-called Peasants' Revolt in 1381. [...] The city acquired an increasing degree of autonomy from central government including the privileges granted by a charter of Richard II in 1396.|$|E
500|$|While {{wine was}} the most common table {{beverage}} in much of Europe, {{this was not the case}} in the northern regions where grapes were not cultivated. Those who could afford it drank <b>imported</b> <b>wine,</b> but even for nobility in these areas it was common to drink beer or ale, particularly towards the end of the Middle Ages. In England, the Low Countries, northern Germany, Poland and Scandinavia, beer was consumed on a daily basis by people of all social classes and age groups. By the mid-15th century, barley, a cereal known to be somewhat poorly suited for breadmaking but excellent for brewing, accounted for 27% of all cereal acreage in England. However, the heavy influence from Arab and Mediterranean culture on medical science (particularly due to the Reconquista and the influx of Arabic texts) meant that beer was often heavily disfavoured. For most medieval Europeans, it was a humble brew compared with common southern drinks and cooking ingredients, such as wine, lemons and olive oil. Even comparatively exotic products like camel's milk and gazelle meat generally received more positive attention in medical texts. Beer was just an acceptable alternative and was assigned various negative qualities. In 1256, the Sienese physician Aldobrandino described beer in the following way: ...|$|E

2500|$|A glass flask or bottle {{brought up}} from the ship bears an {{impressed}} crest of the Boynton or Ogle family, who both were based in Northumberland in northern England. [...] Through dendrochronological analysis it has been determined that the timber used for the ship was cut no later than 1628 in Northern Europe, perhaps in Northumberland. A trade route linked Stockholm, Newcastle and Amsterdam in the mid-17th century. In this triangular trade, Swedish brass was exported to England where, among other things, Newcastle coal was taken on. The coal, for which the local market in Stockholm was too small, would have been sold in part at Amsterdam where products like <b>imported</b> <b>wine</b> were loaded for export back to Sweden. When the ship sank it was carrying coal originating from England or Germany and stoneware Bartmann jugs that most likely contained wine. The glass bottle {{is believed to have}} been manufactured sometime between 1640 and 1670. [...] One of the Bartmann jugs brought {{up from the}} ship for analysis bears the seal of the city of Amsterdam. Though most likely built in England by English shipwrights, it could have been contracted by Swedish or even Dutch owners. Analysis of a pistol found on the weather deck found that it bore close resemblance to a 1683 pistol model manufactured for the Swedish navy. The wood used for the pistol, though, is walnut, an expensive material in Sweden, making it less likely that it was part of a larger production series.|$|E
2500|$|Cotton's husband, Joseph Leslie Cotton, {{was born}} in Barbados in 1856 to Dudley Page Cotton and Rebecca Jane Roach Cotton. Dudley P. Cotton was a {{successful}} merchant, trading in the West Indies, who belonged to a wealthy and well connected family based originally in New Hampshire. At {{the time of his}} first marriage J. Leslie Cotton had lived in Boston and managed a ranch in Wyoming Territory. By the time he married Cotton in 1888 he had joined with two friends in a New York firm that <b>imported</b> <b>wine</b> and spirits from Europe. He left the firm when he and Cotton, then married, decided to live abroad. The couple's wealth together with Cotton's gift for social advancement enabled them to gain acceptance within the British aristocracy and a few years after their arrival in London they were granted the privilege of a presentation to the Court at Buckingham Palace. While living in both Paris and London they were known for the [...] "entertainments" [...] they hosted. In 1893, while staying in London, their first and only child was born, a son named Hugh Dudley Benedict Cotton. By 1901 J. Leslie Cotton had re-established himself in New York and was working as an architect. Cotton continued to reside mainly abroad and during her visits to the United States the society press would make note of events {{that the two of them}} attended together. Increasingly, however, their social activities would be reported separately and in 1916 it was apparent that they were separated when they both attended a performance at the Metropolitan Opera yet sat in separate boxes. When their son married in New York in 1920 a New York address was given for his father and his mother was listed as [...] "Mrs. Cotton of Paris." [...] By 1921 they had divorced and at J. Leslie Cotton's death in 1929 the New York Times obituary listed survivors but made no mention of Cotton as former wife.|$|E
