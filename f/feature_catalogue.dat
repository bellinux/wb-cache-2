I present the methodology of building a <b>feature</b> <b>catalogue</b> that {{is defined by the}} international standard ISO 19110 : 2005. The master thesis includes a <b>feature</b> <b>catalogue</b> of digital navigation base for an effective navigation of emergency vehicles. The thesis discusses further navigation systems, their structure and function. The emphasis is on algorithms for searching optimal routes with a minimal path overlap. Further it includes an analysis of the most used web applications to determine optimal routes for vehicles and the assessment adequacy for emergency vehicles.

This document describes the INSPIRE draft data specification on Cadastral parcels as developed by the Thematic Working Group using both natural and conceptual schema language. This document includes two executive summaries that provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, {{and the content of}} the data specification on Cadastral parcels in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries in the first place. The UML diagrams given in 5. 1. 1 offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial objects, attributes, and relationships are included in the <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue</b> in 5. 1. 2. People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> Users might also find the <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue</b> especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are/will be responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of Cadastral parcels...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{features}} {{have been}} identified by the engineering community as meaningful abstractions with which humans can reason about products and processes. From the designer's point of view, features are functional primitives, which {{serve as the basis}} for sufficient product representation, improving the quality of design and the link to life cycle activities, such as process planning and manufacturing. Up to now, virtually no commercial wire frame CAD system gives the user the possibility to design with features. All objects in a drawing are loose CAD entities (points, lines, arcs, [...] .) that can not be recognised as features. Feature based CAD systems mostly offer the user a fixed <b>feature</b> <b>catalogue</b> to design with. In many cases this <b>feature</b> <b>catalogue</b> is too rigid (a fixed set of feature types with fixed parameters) and does not correspond to the features that are used in a company for other feature based applications (e. g. process planning, NC programming, [...] .). This paper describes a method for defining and extracting user definable manufacturing feature information from several wire frame and feature based CAD systems. This method is applied in a software module that interfaces CAD systems and a feature based process planning system. The development of this module, called the CAD Process Planning Interface (CAD PPI), was carried out in the framework of the Esprit project 6805 COMPLAN. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} “INSPIRE data specification on Natural Risk Zones – Guidelines” version 2. 0 as {{developed by the}} Thematic Working Group (TWG) Natural Risk Zones using both natural and a conceptual schema language. This version is now available for the public consultation. Based {{on the results of}} the consultation (received comments and the testing reports), the final version 3. 0 will be prepared by the TWGs. The data specification is based on a common template used for all data specifications and has been harmonised using the experience from the development of the Annex I data specifications. This document provides guidelines for the implementation of the provisions laid down in the draft Implementing Rule for spatial data sets and services of the INSPIRE Directive. This document includes two executive summaries that provide a quick overview of the INSPIRE data specification process in general, and the content of the data specification on Natural Risk Zones in particular. We highly recommend that managers, decision makers, and all those new to the INSPIRE process and/or information modelling should read these executive summaries first. The UML diagrams (in Chapter 5) offer a rapid way to see the main elements of the specifications and their relationships. The definition of the spatial object types, attributes, and relationships are included in the <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue</b> (also in Chapter 5). People having thematic expertise but not familiar with UML can fully understand the content of the data model focusing on the <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> Users might also find the <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue</b> especially useful to check if it contains the data necessary for the applications that they run. The technical details are expected to be of prime interest to those organisations that are/will be responsible for implementing INSPIRE within the field of Natural Risk Zones. The technical provisions and the underlying concepts are often illustrated by examples. Smaller examples are within the text of the specification, while longer explanatory examples and descriptions of selected use cases are attached in the annexes. In order to distinguish the INSPIRE spatial data themes from the spatial object types, the INSPIRE spatial data themes are written in italics...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} impediments to {{realising}} the Semantic Web vision is that most scientific data, even those data deployed on the web, are not generally expressed or encoded in an unambiguously defined, machine-interpretable manner. This is particularly the case for Antarctic-themed data. Ontologies that are linked to datasets via semantic annotation are required to achieve semantic-enablement of scientific data infrastructure. In scientific communities that adhere to the Open Geospatial Consortium Service-Oriented-Architecture (Web services) paradigm, Feature Catalogues are the repositories intended to manage and publish descriptions of dataset concepts. This thesis explores how Feature Catalogues can be ontologically-grounded to facilitate semantic annotation {{and in doing so}} addresses the lack of guidance in current standards about how to configure an ontologically grounded <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue</b> and how best to access the resources it contains for the semantic annotation of Web services. Also investigated is how ontology selection and evaluation is currently taking place in practise because ontology evaluation methodologies mentioned in the literature are resource intensive to apply, often requiring a high level of ontological expertise. Both contributions seek to lower barriers for ontology uptake and reuse within scientific communities. To address these issues, two scientific communities of practise (i. e., AODN and SCAR) were used as case studies within a Design Science research method to ground-truth the design and to prototype an ontologically grounded, service-enabled <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue.</b> To address research questions pertaining to ontology selection and evaluation practise, fourteen experts (from outside of the AODN and SCAR communities) with experience in building semantically-enabled scientific infrastructure, were surveyed and interviewed to ascertain what ontology evaluation methods and criteria are being used in practise. A hierarchical evaluation model was established from analysed expert data using Template Analysis (Crabtree and Miller, 1992; King, 2004). The Analytical Hierarchical Processing (AHP) technique (Saaty, 1980), was then harnessed to establish the relative importance given by experts to each of the model elements. The contributions arising consisted of an enhanced ISO 19110 <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue</b> model which accommodated additional concepts necessary to describe the observation-centric dataset paradigms of the two case study communities. The extended conceptual model was semantically grounded using the DOLCE (upper ontology) and expressed in both OWL and SKOS. Demonstration REST-based service interfaces (and REST query patterns) were created for serving Catalogue content to requesting Web clients. To the author’s knowledge, no other <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue</b> implementation, founded on the ISO 19110 conceptual model, has attempted to model the Catalogue as an ontology, or permits access to Catalogue content via REST-based service interfaces. This thesis also delivers a “practical” framework for evaluating and then selecting reusable ontological content which encompasses weighted model elements (indicating relative levels of importance), coupled with expert-derived evaluation metrics. Although the evaluation criteria listed in the framework are not novel in themselves, identifying which criteria are of most utility to experts who are operating in real-world scenarios, is an important contribution to practise...|$|E

40|$|YesIn {{this study}} {{a method for}} 3 D {{representation}} of active regions and sunspots that are detected from Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager magnetogram and continuum images is provided. This is our first {{attempt to create a}} visual solar catalogue. Because of the difficulty of providing a full description of data in text based catalogues, it can be more accurate and effective for scientist to search 3 D solar feature models and descriptions {{at the same time in}} such a visual solar catalogue. This catalogue would improve interpretation of solar images, since it would allow us to extract data embedded in various solar images and visualize it at the same time. In this work, active regions that are detected from magnetogram images and sunspots that are detected from continuum images are represented in 3 D coordinates. Also their properties extracted from text based catalogues are represented at the same time in 3 D environment.

40|$|NoWe {{present an}} {{automated}} technique for comparison of magnetic field inversion-line maps from SOHO/MDI magnetograms with solar filament {{data from the}} Solar <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue</b> created {{as part of the}} European Grid of Solar Observations project. The Euclidean distance transform and connected component labelling are used to identify nearest inversion lines to filament skeletons. Several filament inversion-line characteristics are defined and used to automate the decision whether a particular filament/inversion-line pair is suitable for quantitative comparison of orientation and separation. The technique is tested on 551 filaments from 14 H¿ images at various dates, and the distributions of angles and distances between filament skeletons and line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic inversion lines are presented for six levels of magnetic field smoothing. The results showed the robustness of the developed technique which can be applied for a statistical analysis of magnetic field in the vicinity of filaments. The method accuracy is limited by the static filament detection which does not distinguish between filaments, fibrils, pre-condensations and filament barbs and this may increase the asymmetries in magnetic distributions and broadening in angular distributions that requires the incorporation of a feature tracking technique...|$|E
40|$|Abstract, Despite {{several decades}} of {{research}} and development in the field of pattern recognition, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientations, locations, and scales remains unsolved and normally is applied using iterative manual evaluation of the detection results. This problem is becoming increasingly important with the growing number of massive archives of solar images produced by instruments located at ground-based observatories and aboard current satellites such as YOHKOH, SOHO and TRACE, with future satellites such as SOLAR B, SDO and STEREO in prospect. The size of expected archives requires a new automated approach to digital image processing and data extraction with robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques to be developed and implemented. This review evaluates techniques for the standardisation in shape and intensity of solar images and summarises the existing manual and semi-automated feature recognition techniques applied to a representative range of solar features, including sunspots, filaments, active regions, flares, coronal mass ejections and magnetic neutral lines. The review also surveys the most recent fully-automated detection techniques developed for the creation of Solar Feature Catalogues of sunspots, active regions and filaments for the European Grid of Solar Observations. The survey is aimed to help researchers and students to learn about the recognition techniques applied to astrophysical images with different levels of noise and distortions and to work effectively with the Solar <b>Feature</b> <b>Catalogue...</b>|$|E

40|$|In 2003, the Inland ENC Harmonization Group (IEHG) {{was formed}} to agree upon {{specifications}} for Inland ENCs that are suitable for all known Inland ENC data requirements for safe and efficient navigation in European and North American inland waterways and rivers. In 2004, the IEHG expanded to include Russian Federation. It is expected that South America will join IEHG in the near future. The overall framework for international Inland ENC standards includes: - Use IHO S- 57 Edition 3. 1 ‘maritime’ ENC Product Specification, where applicable. - A minimum Inland ENC Product Specification that includes mandatory requirements for safety-of-navigation on inland waterways, worldwide. - An Inland ENC Encoding Guide that provides guidance on recommended object classes, attributes, and attribute values for encoding IENC data. - An Inland ENC Register for additional real-world, IENC object classes, attributes, and attribute values not already contained in IHO S- 57 Edition 3. 1 Object Catalog. - Use of the Open ECDIS Forum (OEF) {{as a means of}} communication and for establishment of Register for Inland ENC object classes, attributes, and attribute values. - Align with the future IHO S- 100 Geospatial Standard for hydrographic data.
