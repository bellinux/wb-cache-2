Juveniles may also have had different lifestyles than adults, filling predator niches between those of the enormous adults and the smaller contemporaneous theropods, the largest of which were two orders of magnitude smaller than an adult Albertosaurus in mass. However, as the preservation of behavior in the fossil record is exceedingly rare, these ideas cannot readily be tested.

Contrary to previous reports, pubic nipples do not occur in Nycteridae, Emballonuridae, Phyllostomidae, or "nyctophiline " vespertilionids. When present, pu-bic nipples are ubiquitous in females but may be absent in some males. Although many previous authors have indicated that pubic nipples do not function at all in lactation, gross morphology of pubic nipples suggests that they may have at least some lacteal function in many species.

This interval, however, did not pass unoccupied. The first and last of all the principal operations at the Bell Rock were accompanied by three hearty cheers from all hands, and, on occasions like the present, the steward of the ship attended, when each man was regaled with a glass of rum. As the water left the rock about six, some began to bore the holes for the great bats or <b>holdfasts,</b> <b>for</b> fixing the beams of the Beacon-house, while the smith was fully attended in laying out the site of his forge, upon a somewhat sheltered spot of the rock, which also recommended itself from the vicinity of a pool of water for tempering his irons.

Those who had been sick picked dulse (Fucus palmatus), which they ate with much seeming appetite; others were more intent upon collecting limpets for bait, to enjoy the amusement of fishing when they returned on board of the vessel. Indeed, none came away empty-handed, as everything found upon the Bell Rock was considered valuable, being connected with some interesting association. Several coins and numerous bits of shipwrecked iron, were picked up, of almost every description; and, in particular, a marking-iron lettered JAMES--a circumstance of which it was thought proper to give notice to the public, as it might lead to the knowledge of some unfortunate shipwreck, perhaps unheard of till this simple occurrence led to the discovery.

40|$|Caulobacters {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} {{in the environment}} via their holdfasts, attachment organelles located {{at the base of}} the flagellum in swarmer cells and later at the end of the cellular stalk in the stalked cells which develop from the swarmer cells. There seems to be little specificity with respect to the types of surfaces to which holdfasts adhere. A notable exception is that the holdfast of one cell does not adhere to the cell surface of another caulobacter, except by joining holdfasts, typically forming "rosettes" of stalked cells. Thus, the localized adhesion of the holdfasts to the cells is in some way a specialized attachment. We investigated this holdfast-cell attachment by developing an adhesion screening assay and analyzing several mutants of Caulobacter crescentus CB 2 A selected to be defective in adhesion. One class of mutants made a normal holdfast by all available criteria, yet the attachment to the cell was very weak, such that the holdfast was readily shed. Another class of mutants made no holdfast at all, but when mixed with a wild-type strain, a mutant of this class participated in rosette formation. The mutant could also attach to the discarded holdfast produced by a shedding mutant. In addition, when rosettes composed of holdfast-defective and wild-type cells were examined, an increase in the number of holdfast-defective cells was correlated with a decrease in the ability of the holdfast material at the center of the rosette to bind colloidal gold particles. Gold particles are one type of surface to which holdfasts adhere well, suggesting that the stalk end and the colloidal gold particles occupy the same sites on the holdfast substance. Taken together, the data support the interpretation that there is a specialized attachment site <b>for</b> the <b>holdfast</b> {{at the base of the}} flagellum which later becomes the end of the stalk, but not a specialized region of the <b>holdfast</b> <b>for</b> attachment to this site. Also, attachment to the cell is accomplished by bond formations that occur not only at the time of holdfast production. Thus, we propose that the attachment of the holdfast to the cell is a true adhesion process and that the stalk tip and base of the flagellum must have compositions distinctly different from that of the remainder of the caulobacter cell surface...|$|R

Its long jaws contained, both sides combined, 58 or more banana-shaped teeth; larger tyrannosaurids possessed fewer teeth, Gorgosaurus at least 62. Unlike most theropods, Albertosaurus and other tyrannosaurids were heterodont, with teeth of different forms depending on their position in the mouth. The premaxillary teeth {{at the tip of the}} upper jaw, four per side, were much smaller than the rest, more closely packed, and D-shaped in cross section. Like with Tyrannosaurus, the maxillary (cheek) teeth of Albertosaurus were adapted in general form to resist lateral forces exerted by a struggling prey. The bite force of Albertosaurus was less formidable, however, with the maximum force, by the hind teeth, reaching 3,413 Newtons. Above the eyes were short bony crests that may have been brightly coloured in life and used in courtship to attract a mate.William Abler observed in 2001 that Albertosaurus tooth serrations resemble a crack in the tooth ending in a round void called an ampulla.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{stages in}} the life history of the {{parasitic}} copepod Nectobrachia indivisa Fraser, 1920, have been described. The adult female lives permanently attached to the gills of the starry flounder, Platichthys stellatus (Pallas, 1811) Girard, 1854. The adult male is a dwarf, which usually lives attached to the genital process of the female. The eggs hatch into free-swimming, but relatively inactive nauplii. They usually molt after 20 - 40 minutes into vigorous free-swimming copepodid larvae. The copepodid either remains in the gill chamber of the original host or migrates to a new one of the same species. After about three days it attaches itself {{by means of a}} chitinous disc and filament to the cuticle of an adult female copepod, usually Nectobrachia indivisa but occasionally Acanthochondria rectangularis (Fraser, 1920) Oakley, 1927, or Lepeophtheirus parvicrurus Fraser, 1920. A withdrawal of the protoplasm from the extremities into the cephalothorax takes place in the copepodid. A new skin forms around the protoplasmic mass and within the old copepodid skin. This marks the advent of the pupal stage. The old copepodid skin {{may or may not be}} cast, but the pupa continues to use the original attachment filament. The pupa molts into either an immature female or a nearly mature male. The male soon seeks out an attached female of the same species, matures, and copulates. The post-pupal female remains connected to the pupal case for a period and then attaches permanently to a gill filament of the host by means of an eight-branched bulla. After changing considerably, both in size and morphology, the female becomes sexually mature. Mating occurs and fertile eggs are deposited into the egg sacs. The orientation of embryos in the egg sacs is with head to the inside, opposite to that of Achtheres ambloplitis Kellicott, 1880. Wilson proposed that oxygen supply is the factor in the latter, while ease of hatching may be the advantage of this arrangement for Nectobrachia indivisa. The nauplius differs from all other lernaeopodid nauplii in having mandibles and non-plumose setae. A long club-like process is present on each of the first antennae of the copepodid stage. It may have a sensory function involving taste or smell or both. The attachment of the copepodid appears to require a chitinous substrate. Possible methods of attachment are discussed. The formation of a discrete pupal skin is recognized in this family and the maxillipedal sleeves are described, both for the first time.

40|$|In natural environments, {{bacteria}} often {{adhere to}} surfaces where they form complex multicellular communities. Surface adherence {{is determined by}} the biochemical composition of the cell envelope. We describe a novel regulatory mechanism by which the bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, integrates cell cycle and nutritional signals to control development of an adhesive envelope structure known as the holdfast. Specifically, we have discovered a 68 -residue protein inhibitor of holdfast development (HfiA) that directly targets a conserved glycolipid glycosyltransferase required <b>for</b> <b>holdfast</b> production (HfsJ). Multiple cell cycle regulators associate with the hfiA and hfsJ promoters and control their expression, temporally constraining holdfast development to the late stages of G 1. HfiA further functions as part of a 'nutritional override' system that decouples holdfast development from the cell cycle in response to nutritional cues. This control mechanism can limit surface adhesion in nutritionally sub-optimal environments without affecting cell cycle progression. We conclude that post-translational regulation of cell envelope enzymes by small proteins like HfiA may provide a general means to modulate the surface properties of bacterial cells...|$|R

Ancestral states were reconstructed <b>for</b> <b>holdfast</b> shape, thallus branching type, as well as asexual (trichospore) and sexual (zygospore) spore morphology. Two of these characters, holdfast shape and trichospore morphology, supported the split of the two main clades revealed by the molecular phylogeny, suggesting these are natural clades and these traits may have evolutionary and perhaps ecological significance...|$|R
40|$|Caulobacter crescentus cells {{adhere to}} {{surfaces}} {{by using an}} extremely strong polar adhesin called the holdfast. The polysaccharide component of the holdfast is comprised in part of oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine. The genes involved in the export of the holdfast polysaccharide and the anchoring of the holdfast to the cell were previously discovered. In this study, we identified a cluster of polysaccharide biosynthesis genes (hfsEFGH) directly adjacent to the holdfast polysaccharide export genes. Sequence analysis indicated that these genes {{are involved in the}} biosynthesis of the minimum repeat unit of the holdfast polysaccharide. HfsE is predicted to be a UDP-sugar lipid-carrier transferase, the glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the first step in polysaccharide biosynthesis. HfsF is predicted to be a flippase, HfsG is a glycosyltransferase, and HfsH is similar to a polysaccharide (chitin) deacetylase. In-frame hfsG and hfsH deletion mutants resulted in severe deficiencies both in surface adhesion and in binding to the holdfast-specific lectin wheat germ agglutinin. In contrast, hfsE and hfsF mutants exhibited nearly wild-type levels of adhesion and holdfast synthesis. We identified three paralogs to hfsE, two of which are redundant to hfsE <b>for</b> <b>holdfast</b> synthesis. We also identified a redundant paralog to the hfsC gene, encoding the putative polysaccharide polymerase, and present evidence that the hfsE and hfsC paralogs, together with the hfs genes, are absolutely required <b>for</b> proper <b>holdfast</b> synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Gracilaria vermiculophylla, a red {{macroalga}} {{from the}} West Pacific, {{was discovered in}} western Germany (the Wadden Sea) in 2002 and has since also been observed in Sweden (from about 70 km south to about 80 km north of Göteborg), Denmark (Wadden Sea, Horsens Fjord, Limfjorden, Vejle Fjord, Holckenhavn Fjord, Øster Hurup Harbor) and eastern Germany (Kiel Bay). Today, less than 5 years following its first observation in the Wadden Sea the invader is common in many invaded regions, often being amongst the most abundant macroalgal species. G. vermiculophylla is successful in shallow protected soft-bottom estuaries and bays, typically in association with ubiquitous native invertebrates (lugworms, tube-building worms, mussels, cockles, snails). The invertebrates provide substratum <b>for</b> <b>holdfast</b> attachment and thalli incorporation, most likely increasing the stability of local G. vermiculophylla populations. We hypothesize that this substratum provision is highly important for its general invasion success. We also confirm that G. vermiculophylla can maintain growth at all salinities experienced along Danish coastlines (8. 5 - 34 psu). In addition, laboratory experiments indicate that the ubiquitous grazer Littorina littorea {{has the potential to}} control G. vermiculophylla growth under specific environmental conditions, but also that L. littorea may facilitate small-scale dispersal within invaded locations, because grazing increases thalli fragmentation rates. Given its widespread distribution, rapid range expansion, and known ecological traits, G. vermiculophylla is clearly a permanent resident of northern European waters...|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{has been}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important pollutants in coastal and estuarine areas. Efforts have been made to detect, as early as possible, the effects of this and other metals in several species. Macroalgae, particularly Fucus spp., have been widely used as biomonitors of metal pollution. In this study, three Fucus species (F. spiralis, F. vesiculosus and F. ceranoides) were collected from several sampling sites in Portugal. The concentrations of mercury were determined in three structural parts (holdfast, stipe and receptacles). Two different techniques were used to determine mercury concentrations. Almost all mercury concentrations (in sediments and in water) were below national and international standards. Mercury concentration in the specimens (0. 012 - 0. 061 mu g g(- 1) for receptacles, 0. 028 - 0. 221 mu g g(- 1) for stipe and 0. 029 - 0. 287 mu g g(- 1) <b>for</b> <b>holdfast)</b> was always higher that those obtained for the sediment (0. 001 - 0. 112 mu g g(- 1)). With few exceptions the contrary was found for receptacles. In general, a good agreement between concentrations of mercury in sediment and Fucus was found. The results indicate that Fucus accumulate mercury and may be a suitable species for use in risk assessment for coast and estuarine areas, by providing valuable information regarding the levels of mercury that will be available for the consumers of Fucus spp. FCTCONTROL project - PDCTM/C/MAR/ 15266 / 199...|$|R
40|$|Caulobacter crescentus firmly {{adheres to}} {{surfaces}} with a structure {{known as the}} holdfast, which {{is located at the}} flagellar pole of swarmer cells and at the stalk tip in stalked cells. A three-gene cluster (hfaAB and hfaC) is involved in attachment of the holdfast to the cell. Deletion and complementation analysis of the hfaAB locus revealed two genes in a single operon; both were required <b>for</b> <b>holdfast</b> attachment to the cell. Sequence analysis of the hfaAB locus showed two open reading frames with the potential to encode proteins of 15, 000 and 26, 000 Da, respectively. A protein migrating with an apparent size of 21 kDa in gel electrophoresis was encoded by the hfaA region when expressed in Escherichia coli {{under the control of the}} lac promoter, but no protein synthesis could be detected from the hfaB region. S 1 nuclease analysis indicated that transcription of the hfaAB locus was initiated from a region containing a sequence nearly identical to the consensus for C. crescentus sigma 54 -dependent promoters. In addition, a sequence with some similarity to ftr sequences (a consensus sequence associated with other Caulobacter sigma 54 -dependent genes) was identified upstream of the hypothesized sigma 54 promoter. At least one of the hfaAB gene products was required for maximal transcription of hfaC. The sequence of hfaB showed some similarity to that of transcriptional activators of other bacteria. The C-terminal region of the putative gene product HfaA was found to be homologous to PapG and SmfG, which are adhesin molecules of enteropathogenic E. coli and Serratia marcescens, respectively. This information suggests that the protein encoded by the hfaA locus may have a direct role in the attachment of the holdfast to the cell, whereas hfaB may be involved in the positive regulation of hfaC...|$|R
