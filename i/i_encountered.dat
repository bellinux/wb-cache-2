25|$|Tradition {{has it that}} it was at {{the foot}} of Arthur's Seat, covered by the forest of Drumselch, that Scotland's 12th-century king David <b>I</b> <b>encountered</b> a stag while out hunting. Having fallen from his horse and about to be gored, he had a vision of a cross {{appearing}} between the animal's antlers, before it inexplicably turned away, leaving him unharmed. David, believing his life had been spared through divine intervention, founded Holyrood Abbey on the spot. The burgh arms of the Canongate display the head of the stag with the cross framed by its antlers.|$|E

2500|$|Swagger sticks {{were once}} in vogue in the Corps, {{starting}} as an informal accessory carried by {{officers in the}} late 19th century. In 1915, it gained official approval as recruiters were encouraged to carry them to improve public image. This tradition grew when Marines deployed for World War <b>I</b> <b>encountered</b> European officers carrying swagger sticks, leading to an entry in the uniform regulations in 1922 authorizing enlisted Marines to carry them as well. The usage died down in the 1930s and 40s, excepting China Marines, and returned in vogue when a 1952 regulation encouraged them; reaching a peak from 1956 to 1960, when Commandant Randolph M. Pate encouraged use. However, his successor, David M. Shoup, quickly made them optional and discouraged their use. [...] In 1977 then Commandant Gen. Louis H. Wilson issued a directive banning the carry of them while in uniform.|$|E

[...] "So filled with rubato is Cooke's interpretation that the usually powerful, forward-moving piece nearly comes to a stand-still on several occasions. [...] Chords are played with a tiresome delay at the bottom half that makes Cooke's playing predictable."
