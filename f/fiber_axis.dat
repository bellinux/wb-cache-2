For liquid crystalline fibers with molecular orientation along the <b>fiber's</b> <b>axis</b> the model predicts that capillary instabilities will break the fiber into an array of droplets, {{just as in the}} case of isotropic Newtonian fibers. The characteristic growth rate and wavelength of the instability are functions of the orientation dependent surface tension and the extensional viscosity.

40|$|In this study, {{magnetic}} nanofibers were fabricated using {{polyvinyl alcohol}} (PVA) as {{a shelter for}} (y-Fe 2 O 3) magnetic nanoparticles suspension. Two-level full factorial experiments with center and augmented axial points were performed where process parameters studied were flow rate, applied voltage, distance between needle and collector, and collector rotating speed. The response variables analyzed were morphology and fiber diameter distribution. The model obtained from the experimental design revealed that the flow rate, voltage, the two-way interaction of these factors and the second order effect of flow rate-A 2 were significant in determining nanofiber diameters.

With the designed HB-PCF, {{the effect of}} the pump parameters on the modulation instability (MI) in the anomalous dispersion region close to the second ZDWs of the HB-PCF is comprehensively studied in this work.

50|$|Because {{parts of}} the core closer to the <b>fiber</b> <b>axis</b> have a higher {{refractive}} index than the parts near the cladding, light rays follow sinusoidal paths down the fiber.

30|$|Conversely, the {{mechanical}} e-twins {{with the pole}} orientation that makes small angles to the <b>fibers</b> long <b>axis</b> in the calcite grains, which is nearly parallel to the c-axis, were formed in CV- 2, which indicates extension parallel to the <b>fibers</b> long <b>axis.</b> Therefore, it can be inferred that the fibrous grains in CV- 2 were first formed by vein opening followed by precipitation of fibrous calcite grains, which was further followed by the formation of e-twins under extension perpendicular to the vein wall. Subsequently, the veins were compressed in the direction perpendicular to the vein wall, and kink bands and brittle fractures were formed along the axial plane of the kink folds, which indicates that the stress direction perpendicular the vein wall was reversed. In fact, the orientations of mechanical e-twins are rotated more than 10 Â° about the axis of kink bands, thus showing {{the validity of the}} inferred order of microstructural development.|$|R
30|$|For sample CV- 2, it {{has been}} shown that two microstructures, kink bands and {{mechanical}} e-twins, are developed in calcite grains. The kink bands were developed by the compression parallel to the long axis of fibrous calcite grains (i.e., buckling, Ramsay, [1967]), and hence, it is perpendicular to the vein wall. The fact that fluid inclusions are concentrated in some parts of the kinked bands elongated parallel to the <b>fiber</b> long <b>axis</b> suggests that dilation occurred normal to the <b>fiber</b> long <b>axis,</b> thereby providing evidence that these microstructures that are correlated with dilation veins in a kink band (Ramsay, [1967]) are in fact caused by kinking. Further, brittle fractures were formed along the axial plane of kink folds (FigureÂ  2 d), which indicates that the formation of kink bands (or folds) was accommodated by brittle fractures under very low temperatures. Therefore, the possibility that the apparently curved fiber veins were formed by a change in the opening direction of the veins (e.g., Passchier and Trouw, [2005]; Bons et al. [2012]) can be completely rejected.|$|R
