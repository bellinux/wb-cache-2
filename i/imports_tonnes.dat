50|$|The Japans Mining Office, in 1925 {{referred}} to coal {{reserves in the}} empire of 8,000 million tonnes, or 2,933 million tonnes (Kyūshū, Miiki and Mitsui deposits), 2,675 or 3,471 million tonnes (Hokkaidō, ones 1,113,600 million from Yubari mine), 1,362 million tonnes (Karafuto, in Kawakami deposits), 614 million tonnes (Honshū), 385 million tonnes (Formosa, in the Kirun area), 81 million tonnes (Korea). Extraction in Japan during 1912 was 20,000,000 tonnes, in 1932 in 30,000,000 tonnes and grew in 1941 to 55,500,000 tonnes and was divided between the following sources, in tonnes: Korea (5,000,000), Formosa (2,500,000) and Karafuto (2,500,000) and additional <b>imports</b> 4,000,000 <b>tonnes</b> from China and Indochina.|$|R

50|$|Virtual water trade {{refers to}} the idea that when goods and {{services}} are exchanged, so is virtual water. When a country <b>imports</b> one <b>tonne</b> of wheat instead of producing it domestically, it is saving about 1,300 cubic meters of real indigenous water. If this country is water-scarce, the water that is 'saved' can be used towards other ends. If the exporting country is water-scarce, however, it has exported 1,300 cubic meters of virtual water since the real water used to grow the wheat will no longer be available for other purposes. This has obvious strategic implications for countries that are water-constrained such as those found in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) area.|$|R

50|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000 sacks of rice to storm victims, and the country planned to <b>import</b> 300,000 <b>tonnes</b> of rice to overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500 people.

However, China produced 126 GT of wheat in 2014, according to the same source. For comparison, Egypt was 2014's largest importer, with imports of 10.7 GT. If China had imported more than Egypt, it still would have produced almost 10 times more wheat than it imported, while in fact it produced more than 100 times more.|$|R
50|$|Jute is a {{rain-fed crop}} with little need for {{fertilizer}} or pesticides, {{in contrast to}} cotton's heavy requirements.

50|$|Rice is {{a staple}} in Cuban diet; {{one of the main}} dishes is rice and beans. Rice in Cuba is mostly grown along the western coast. There are two crops per year. Most rice farms are {{state-owned}} or co-operatives. Production is limited by the shortage of water and, similar to other industries in Cuba, lack of fertilizer and modern agricultural technology. The yield per hectare remains lower than the average of Central American and Caribbean countries. Therefore, Cuba has been a major importer of rice. Recently, <b>imports</b> approached 500,000 <b>tonnes</b> of milled rice per year.|$|R
