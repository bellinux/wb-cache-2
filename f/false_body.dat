40|$|A {{commission}} to create mannequin prosthetics for the fashion exhibition 'Malign Muses: When Fashion Turns Back', curated by Judith Clark, {{gave me the}} opportunity to speculate on jewellery, value, the body, display and adornment. It generated questions such as: Is an object designed to be worn by a static mannequin less significant than an object worn by a live body? Is it worth less? Can mannequin prosthetics even be described as jewellery if they cannot be worn by a living person? To explore these questions I made a series of resin and crystal masks and prosthetic necks for the mannequins, reminding the viewer of the body form that normally goes un-noticed in fashion exhibitions. I focused on accents of human form around the collar bone, neck and chin, these being areas that did not interfere with the many high profile designers’ garments on display, which included Dior, Schiaparelli, Quant and Chalayan. I also customised mannequin arms with Swarovski crystals and a waxen plastic coating to suggest the mannequin is a life size doll; and I coated a mannequin head in black flock to evoke popular Victorian profile portraits. As accessories to the customised mannequins I made a hand (electroformed in copper) and a pair of carved wooden harlequin feet, working in collaboration with specialist carvers and model makers. Together these objects mimic the human form but are worn by the prosthetic body of a mannequin. They are paradoxical works moulded from a live body that have become divorced from it and attached to a <b>false</b> <b>body</b> to provoke series of speculations {{on the role of the}} body in jewellery and adornment...|$|E

Some {{of the challenges}} involved {{in the development of}} new musical instruments have affinities to the realm of wicked problems. Wicked problems are hard to define and have many different solutions that are good or bad (not true or <b>false).</b> The <b>body</b> of possible solutions to a wicked problem can be called a design space and exploring that space must be the objective of a design process. In this paper we present effective methods of iterative design and participatory design that we have used in a project developed in collaboration between the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and the University College of Opera, both in Stockholm. The methods are outlined, and examples are given of how they have been applied in specific situations. The focus lies on prototyping and evaluation with user participation. By creating and acting out scenarios with the user, and thus asking the questions through a prototype and receiving the answers through practice and exploration, we removed the bottleneck represented by language and allowed communication beyond verbalizing. Doing this, even so-called tacit knowledge could be activated and brought into the development process. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{we address}} the problem of 3 D pose estima-tion of {{multiple}} humans from multiple views. This is a more challenging problem than single human 3 D pose estimation due to the much larger state space, partial occlusions as well as across view ambiguities when not knowing the iden-tity of the humans in advance. To address these problems, we first create a reduced state space by triangulation of corresponding body joints obtained from part detectors in pairs of camera views. In order to resolve the ambiguities of wrong and mixed body parts of multiple humans after tri-angulation and also those coming from <b>false</b> positive <b>body</b> part detections, we introduce a novel 3 D pictorial structures (3 DPS) model. Our model infers 3 D human body configu-rations from our reduced state space. The 3 DPS model is generic and applicable to both single and multiple human pose estimation. In order to compare to the state-of-the art, we first eval-uate our method on single human 3 D pose estimation on HumanEva-I [22] and KTH Multiview Football Dataset II [8] datasets. Then, we introduce and evaluate our method on two datasets for multiple human 3 D pose estimation. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Falls are {{dangerous}} for the aged population as they can adversely affect health. Therefore, many fall detection systems have been developed. However, prevalent methods only use accelerometers to isolate falls from {{activities of daily living}} (ADL). This makes it difficult to distinguish real falls from certain fall-like activities such as sitting down quickly and jumping, resulting in many <b>false</b> positives. <b>Body</b> orientation is also used as a means of detecting falls, but it is not very useful when the ending position is not horizontal, e. g. falls happen on stairs. In this paper we present a novel fall detection system using both accelerometers and gyroscopes. We divide human activities into two categories: static postures and dynamic transitions. By using two tri-axial accelerometers at separate body locations, our system can recognize four kinds of static postures: standing, bending, sitting, and lying. Motions between these static postures are considered as dynamic transitions. Linear acceleration and angular velocity are measured to determine whether motion transitions are intentional. If the transition before a lying posture is not intentional, a fall event is detected. Our algorithm, coupled with accelerometers and gyroscopes, reduces both false positives and false negatives, while improving fall detection accuracy. In addition, our solution features low computational cost and realtime response. I...|$|R

While the primary cause of action would be against the ehealth data provider, questions may arise as to possible liability of the trustmark authority. For example, some US liability exposure is possible based on cases involving the potential liability of product warrantors, trade associations and certifiers or endorsers.

40|$|This article {{draws on}} Foucault’s {{concept of the}} {{exercise}} of power and Gramsci’s concept of hegemony to examine how women used cosmetic surgery to exercise power over their bodies and lives. The analysis is rooted in two feminist perspectives on cosmetic surgery. The first argues that women who elect to have their bodies surgically altered are victims of <b>false</b> consciousness whose <b>bodies</b> are disciplined by the hegemonic male gaze. The second asserts that women who undergo elective cosmetic surgery exercise free choice in controlling their bodies and lives. By examining sites wherein power is exercised by and over women, the authors argue for a synthesis of these two perspectives. They find that the women achieved greater power and control over their bodies and lives when they embodied hegemonic ideals of feminine beauty. Cosmetic surgery can be empowering for individual women while reinforcing the hege-monic ideals that oppress women as a group. Elective cosmetic surgery, like other practices designed to help women achieve hegemonic standards of feminine beauty, is problematic for feminist scholars because it involves agency as well as subordination. On one hand, women choose what procedures to have done. On the other, the choices women make are deter-mined by hegemonic cultural norms. The academic debate regarding women and beauty has included examinations and theoretical discussions of fashion, makeup, diet and exercise, eating disorders...|$|R

All of this with the purpose of thinking in a different way the artistic production, which is not aimed by the creation of beautiful art pieces (classical concept), but in a way of conceiving the feminist art from a position situated far from the canons of the patriarchal vision of aesthetics. After then, the nodal point of this text focuses on the death of art, which leads to think about processes of an alternative subjectivity than one which is designed by dominant categories of the logos. So, this work above involves a new self-awareness of the female body and a divergent creation of identity structures in a way to take in a highest value this form of artistic production that questions how a woman should be. A reconstruction of the body where there is not myself, but an effacement to my identity, a dance of masks in which the powers from the false make their appearance as a desterritorialization of well established subjectivities. An aesthetic based over organs dismembered, or an artistic creation viewed as an abortion of the physics, which emphasizes the political and the experimental body, this one is seen as a battleground.  Keywords: <b>false's</b> power, <b>body,</b> subjectivity, stamping out, feminist art. ...|$|R
