50|$|The Stereo Speakers - The contestants must install stereo {{speakers}} {{that are}} to be recessed into the walls of their rooms over their tubs. For this challenge, the nominators will be paired with someone other than their nominee. Matt, paired with Joe-Anne, confuses electrical wire for speaker wire, and is forced to turn to Kory (in Charlene's room) for advice. In the end, he can only get one speaker installed, and fails. Despite a minor hiccup in forgetting to secure his electrical box for the amplifier unit (causing the speaker wire to fall off the wall), Rob (with Charmaine) passes. Dan (with Prabhjot) installs the speakers without much trouble, albeit with one slightly higher than the other, but is deemed to have failed due mixing his plaster improperly and doing an extremely messy job of covering the wires. Ajay (with Natasha) is forced to bite to strip his wire, and installs his speakers vertically, meaning that the sound will not be in stereo. Still, his connections are fine (though there is a <b>knot</b> <b>in</b> the <b>wire</b> neither notices), and he passes. Kory is forced to do most of the gruntwork in Charlene's challenge, and is forced to intervene when he tries to get Charlene to do her own work, only for her to mud over the groove in which she was to install her speaker wire without having installed her wire or electrical box. She fails.|$|R
