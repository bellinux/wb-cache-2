50|$|<b>Emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> {{is a type}} of {{paragraph}} in, or section of, an auditors' {{report on}} financial statements.

5000|$|If {{a public}} company and a private company report that its {{auditors}} have doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern, investors may {{take that as a}} sign of increased risk, although an <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> paragraph in an audit report does not necessarily indicate that a company {{is on the verge of}} insolvency. [...] Despite this, some fund managers may be required to sell the stock to maintain an appropriate level of risk in their portfolios. A negative judgment may also result in the breach of bank loan covenants or lead a debt rating firm to lower the rating on the company's debt, making the cost of existing debt increase and/or preventing the company from obtaining additional debt financing. Because of such responses to expressed concerns by auditors, in the 1970s, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Cohen commission concluded that an auditor's expression of uncertainty about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern [...] "tends to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The auditor's expression of uncertainty about the company's ability to continue may contribute to making its failure a certainty." [...] Businesses should also communicate with business advisors as well as their auditors in the time of trouble. Communication can let advisors and auditors help when needed. They can help business review their internal risk management along with other internal controls.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{disentangle}} the relation between GC exception in the <b>Emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Matter</b> of unqualified opinion, modified opinion for GC and the opening of insolvency proceedings. Using a unique hand-collected database on audit opinions of 326 Italian listed companies from 2007 to 2011, we analyze audit opinions first using a GLM with fixed effects and then we test our results adopting a hierarchical model with random effects. First, we find that the probability of opening an insolvency proceeding is higher following a modified opinion for GC than after a GC exception in the <b>Emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Matter</b> of an unqualified opinion. Second, we identify a positive and significant relationship between a GC exception reported in the <b>Emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>Matter</b> of unqualified opinion at time (t- 1) and a modified opinion for GC at time (t). Overall, the findings suggest that going concern opinions have to be disentangled to really understand the risk of default. Auditors properly perform their monitoring role even if they do not appear to be fully independent in expressing their opinions. This study further investigates the content of audit opinions in a low litigation risk context, adding further insights into auditors’ practices...|$|E

40|$|Background: Auditing {{can support}} {{national}} democratic processes, national development and government good will. Supreme Audit Institutions (SAI), such as offices of Auditor General, publish consolidated reports on audit outcomes for local authorities, government departments, parastatals and related public entities. These reports identify broad areas analysed during audit exercises that often include financial management, governance, asset management, risk management, revenue collection and debt recovery. They highlight trends that were detected during audit exercises {{at the end}} of a financial year. The reports further show how records and records management affect audit exercises as well as financial management within the audited institutions. Objectives: The intention of the research was to ascertain the contribution of records management to audit opinions and accountability in financial management in Zimbabwean government entities. Method: A document analysis of Comptroller and Auditor General of Zimbabwe (CAGZ) ’s reports was used to identify the types of decisions and recommendations (audit opinions) issued, in juxtaposition to the records management issues raised. Results and Conclusion: This study shows that there is a strong correlation between records management concerns and audit opinions raised by the CAGZ’s narrative audit reports. Inadequate records management within government entities was associated with adverse and qualified opinions and, in some cases, unqualified opinions that had <b>emphases</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter.</b> There was a causal loop in which lack of documentary evidence of financial activities was the source cause of poor accounting and poor audit reports. Errors resulting from incomplete or inaccurate records meant that government entities were not showing a true picture of their financial status and their financial statements could be materially misstated. As an important monitoring and control system, records management should be integrated into the accounting and auditing processes of government entities. </p...|$|R

DISCLOSURE TENDENCIES FOR LIFO INVENTORY LIQUIDATIONS We examine {{the extent of the}} enhancement of net income resulting from the liquidation of Last In, First Out (LIFO) inventories and whether companies have been transparent in providing disclosure of the positive impact that LIFO liquidations have had on reported earnings. This issue is particularly relevant in light of the recent calls to eliminate LIFO for tax revenue reasons, the controversy surrounding the proposed shift to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) which does not permit LIFO inventory valuation, and SEC rulings and interpretations demanding more disclosure and transparency in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of corporate annual reports. Not unexpectedly, our analysis shows that the percentage effect on income (i. e., materiality) is significant in explaining corporate disclosure tendencies. Despite this finding, we note that none of the material and potentially-misleading disclosures resulted in a modification (either <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> a <b>matter</b> or disclosure <b>of</b> a departure from generally accepted accountin...|$|R
40|$|This article explores recent {{regulatory}} {{reforms in}} Italy and analyzes the first-time application of mandatory disclosure in {{annual reports of}} audit and non-audit fees. This information can convey to readers of fi nancial statements an indication of auditor independence (in appearance). An empirical analysis is conducted on annual reports of 239 Italian listed companies for the year 2007. The main research objectives are as follows: (1) to provide a comprehensive description of the relative level of non-audit fees; and (2) to investigate the relation between non-audit services (NAS) and the opinion expressed in the audit report. The evidence shows that the average ratio of non-audit fees (further assurance services, tax advisory services and other services) to total auditor remuneration is 0. 24. In particular, there are 38 companies (15. 9 per cent) that paid their auditor more for NAS than for audit services; excluding further assurance services, there are 22 cases (9. 2 per cent) with a ratio of non-audit fees that is higher than 0. 50. In our sample, we observed 231 unqualified opinions (96. 7 per cent) and eight qualified opinions (3. 3 per cent) : a statistical significant relationship between the NAS ratio and qualified opinions was not found. However, the study ’ s results {{show that there is}} a positive association between the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> paragraph in the audit report and NAS. This finding cannot be interpreted as an indication of compromised auditor independence, thus opening space for further empirical studies on the use of <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> paragraphs in auditor reports...|$|E
40|$|Research {{conducted}} on the information content of going concern “modified ” reports in the United States and United Kingdom indicate that a modified audit report {{does not appear to}} have information content to users once the going concern contingency is disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This raises the question as to whether any form of qualification is necessary since readers appear not to give additional credence to the auditor’s report once the going concern contingency is reported. In this study we provide evidence from Australia. We examine whether modification / qualification by an auditor in Australia (an “emphasis of matter ” and an “except for ” report respectively) has information content to a user. The results indicate that, if the company is in a state of financial distress, the qualification, in either form, does not appear to significantly enhance either perceptions of risk or decision making. While the auditor’s report was perceived to be useful in that it helped loan officers to focus on matters raised in the report, the qualification appears not to have incremental information content. While one could expect the <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> report to not communicate any additional information (as the information addressed in the emphasi...|$|E
40|$|Many TAFEs {{have yet}} to respond {{effectively}} to changes to the funding model and contestability arrangements, resulting in a significant decline in the financial sustainability of the sector, according to this audit. Overview This report covers {{the results of the}} 2013 financial audits of 27 entities, comprising 14 technical and further education (TAFE) institutes and the 13 entities they control. Clear audit opinions were issued on the financial reports of all entities. An <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> paragraph was included in the financial report of Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE, drawing attention to a material uncertainty in its ability to continue as a going concern. Clear audit opinions were issued on all 19 performance reports for 2013. However, the TAFE sector did not have a framework that mandated relevant and appropriate key performance indicators, nor was it provided with sufficient guidance in establishing suitable targets and analysing performance. Accordingly, the sector 2 ̆ 7 s performance reporting was underdeveloped and inconsistent, lacked clear direction and did not facilitate comparability across the sector. From 2014, TAFEs are to implement a strategic planning framework requiring them to set key performance indicators clearly linked to their key strategies. While an improvement, the framework does not establish a core suite of indicators against which TAFEs are to report. Without the ability to compare performance across the sector and between entities, the value of performance reporting is diminished. The 14 TAFEs generated a net deficit of 16. 2 million, a decrease of 74. 8 million from 2012. These results suggest that many TAFEs {{have yet to}} respond effectively to changes to the funding model and contestability arrangements. The changes were designed to improve the sector 2 ̆ 7 s financial sustainability and have increased TAFEs 2 ̆ 7 reliance on student fee revenue in a contestable environment. While a majority of TAFEs reduced their expenditure during the year, the cost reductions and increases in student fee revenue were not sufficient to offset the reduction in funds from government of 116. 3 million. Consequently there has been a significant decline in the financial sustainability of the sector. We assessed the financial sustainability of five of the TAFEs as being high risk in 2013. This means that there are immediate or short term financial challenges at these TAFEs that need to be addressed. Northern Melbourne Institute of Technology (NMIT) reported a net operating deficit of 31. 7 million, {{and in the absence of}} any remedial action projected substantial cash-flow deficits for the next two years. As a result, the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development has agreed to support NMIT in securing a two-year interest-free government bridging loan of 16 million to assist with proposed restructuring arrangements. Following changes to the board and executive team, NMIT has identified and commenced the implementation of various operational initiatives to improve its cash flows for 2014. NMIT has been flagged as an overall high financial sustainability risk in this report. Against the trend, Chisholm, Goulburn Ovens, Kangan and Sunraysia TAFEs reported improved financial results. Some of the effective initiatives at these TAFES have included implementing service provision through third parties (Goulburn Ovens and Sunraysia), changed course offerings, staff redundancies and reduced operating costs. Early adoption of these initiatives has made these TAFEs more financially viable, and they are to be commended...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between State immunity and diplomatic immunity {{has always been}} a rather complex one. The two concepts undoubtedly have a common juridical background {{in the form of the}} concepts of sovereignty, independence and dignity. 1 On the other hand, recent developments in both fields have seen a move towards a more functional-based approach. Thus, in relation to diplomatic immunity, the dominant theoretical basis is that of functional necessity. 2 As regards State immunity, recent developments in both international law 3 and, more particularly, in UK law 4, from absolute to restrictive State immunity, have resulted in a more functionally orientated approach, that is, a shift <b>of</b> <b>emphasis</b> in <b>matters</b> <b>of</b> State immunity from immunity ratione personae to immunity ratione materiae. 5 Now two recent cases in the United Kingdom have raised the possibility that, in the case of diplomats at least, the two concepts may be combined to provide a double immunity for diplomatic agents against civil suit. More controversially, the cases have raised the possibility of a third type of protection based upon immunity ratione personae in what could be said to amount to a modified act of State doctrine. The cases in question are Propend Finance Pty Ltd. v. Alan Sing and The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police 6 and Re P (Diplomatic Immunity: Jurisdiction). ...|$|R

Central to the argument is a nested goal/sub-goal hierarchy that the authors claim is inherent to the structure of epistemically responsible belief-formation: pursuing true beliefs by pursuing beliefs that are objectively likely given one’s total available evidence; pursuing this sub-goal by pursuing beliefs that are likely true (given that evidence) relative to one’s own deep epistemic sensibility; and pursuing this sub-sub-goal by forming beliefs in accordance with one’s own all-in, ultima facie, epistemic seemings...|$|R

The transition to sustainable energy systems {{is accompanied by}} a multitude of research methods, as energy systems are complex structures of technical, economical, social and ecological interactions. The description of different discipline’s perspectives in this paper show that a more mutual understanding between disciplines of their respective focus is necessary as they partly create internally competitive views arising from differing <b>emphasis</b> <b>of</b> connected <b>matters.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> this paper is to present a framework for interdisciplinary proceeding in a complex energy system transition process. Resilience thinking is chosen as a core concept for a more holistic view on sustainable energy system development. It is shown that it is already widely used in different disciplines connected to energy system research and is especially suitable due to its wide application across disciplines. The seven principles of resilience thinking (maintain redundancy and diversity, manage connectivity, manage slow variables and feedback, foster complex adaptive systems thinking, encourage learning, broaden participation, and promote polycentric governance systems) are chosen as the basis for a procedure that can be utilized to increase the interdisciplinary perspectives of energy system transitions. For energy transition processes based on scenario development, backcasting and pathway definition, resilience thinking principles are used to assess the resilience of the target energy system, the pathway resilience and the design of the scenario process with respect to the probability of a resilient outcome. The described procedure consisting of questions and parameters can be applied as a first attempt for a resilience assessment of energy transition processes. The perspective of resilience in sustainable energy systems strengthens the importance of diversity, redundancy and flexibility, which reduces the current dominant focus on efficiency of the overall system...|$|R
