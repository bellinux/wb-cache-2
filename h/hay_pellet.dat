5000|$|The {{waterside}} {{hot water}} <b>hay</b> <b>pellet</b> furnace {{was invented by}} Gus Swanson a farmer from Pictou County, Nova Scotia. [...] Swanson {{came up with the}} idea after search for an affordable alternative to home heating through oil after the price of oil began to increase. Swanson and two of his partners, Philip Landry and Jim Trussler, founded the company LST Energy Inc. as a way to grow and build their <b>hay</b> <b>pellet</b> furnace technology.|$|E
50|$|Research has be {{conducted}} to discover what type of grass is best suited {{for use in the}} Waterside Hot Water <b>Hay</b> <b>Pellet</b> Furnace and it was found the reed canary hay pellets, produced from reed canary grass is the most efficient grass pellet source. It emitted 90% less Carbon Dioxide (CO2) than heating oil, propane or natural gas. Eighteen thousand tonnes of CO2 can be saved from being emitted into the atmosphere for every 50 acres of reed canary grass burnt as hay pellets in the Waterside Hot Water <b>Hay</b> <b>Pellet</b> Furnace.|$|E
50|$|The {{waterside}} {{hot water}} <b>hay</b> <b>pellet</b> furnace is technology {{that was developed}} to convert grass and hay into energy that can used in home heating, also known as grass pellet heating.|$|E
50|$|Heating a {{home with}} <b>hay</b> <b>pellets</b> is a much cheaper {{alternative}} to that of oil. Swanson currently heats a three-bedroom apartment, a two-bedroom apartment, and a two-bedroom house using <b>hay</b> <b>pellets</b> and it cost him only $300/month, compared to the $900/month it used to cost {{him when he was}} heating these properties with oil.|$|R
50|$|Hay, {{which comes}} from grass, is an {{economically}} viable, renewable and sustainable resource. Two acres of hay will heat an average home for the winter and it would only take 4% of Canadian land to produce enough hay to heat every Canadian home. The <b>hay</b> <b>pellets</b> used in the furnace are also an environmental friendly energy source. It is considered a carbon neutral energy source. The <b>hay</b> <b>pellets</b> burning efficiency is increased by its low moisture content and it burns without producing any smoke and as clean or cleaner than any fossil fuel. Wood stoves release 45g of particulate/hour, while <b>hay</b> <b>pellets</b> only product 1.2g/hour.|$|R

50|$|The {{waterside}} {{hot water}} <b>hay</b> <b>pellet</b> furnace converts hay pellets into energy by burning {{them in a}} furnace, wood stove, or pellet stove. The hay pellets are made from dried field hay (grass) that is harvested {{at the end of}} season and then pressed into pellets.|$|E
50|$|The Nova Scotia Agricultural College {{has been}} helping LST energy Inc. on the {{development}} of the <b>hay</b> <b>pellet</b> furnace.

50|$|Sub {{category}} of pellet systems are boilers or burners capable of burning pellet with higher ash rate (paper <b>pellets,</b> <b>hay</b> <b>pellets,</b> straw pellets). One {{of this kind}} is PETROJET pellet burner with rotating cylindrical burning chamber.In terms of efficiencies advanced pellet boilers can exceed other forms of biomass because of the more stable fuel charataristics. Advanced pellet boilers can even work in condensing mode and cool down combustion gases to 30-40 °C, instead of 120 °C before sent into the flue.|$|R

40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} whether Mycobacterium bovis {{can be transmitted}} from experimentally infected deer to uninfected in-contact deer. Animals—Twenty-three 6 -month-old white-tailed deer. Procedure—On day 0, M bovis (2 X 108 colony-forming units) was administered by intratonsillar instillation to 8 deer; 3 control deer received saline (0. 9 % NaCl) solution. Eight in-contact deer were comingled with inoculated deer from day 21. On day 120, inoculated deer were euthanatized and necropsied. On day 180, 4 in-contact deer were euthanatized, and 4 new incontact deer were introduced. On day 360, all in-contact deer were euthanatized. Rectal, oral, and nasal swab specimens and samples of <b>hay,</b> <b>pelleted</b> feed, water, and feces were collected for bacteriologic culture. Tissue specimens were also collected at necropsy for bacteriologic culture and histologic analysis. Results—On day 90, inoculated and in-contact deer developed delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions to purified protein derivative of M bovis. Similarly, new in-contact deer developed DTH reactions by 100 days of contact with original in-contact deer. Tuberculous lesions in in-contact deer were most commonly detected in lungs and tracheobronchial and medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes. Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from nasal secretions and saliva from inoculated and in-contact deer, urine and feces from in-contact deer, and <b>hay</b> and <b>pelleted</b> feed. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance—Mycobacterium bovis is efficiently transmitted from experimentally infected deer to uninfected in-contact deer through nasal secretions, saliva, or contaminated feed. Wildlife management practices that result in unnatural gatherings of deer may enhance both direct and indirect transmission of M bovis...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} measure glucose and lac-tate absorption and metabolic interrelationships in lambs either switched gradually (experiment 1) or abruptly (experiment 2) from hay to a high concentrate diet. In experiment 1, seven lambs were given primed, continuous, 3 -hour infu sions of 2 -[3 H]glucose, U-[HC]L-lactateand para-aminohippuric acid (portal blood flow indicator) before and after switching from a <b>pelleted</b> <b>hay</b> to a <b>pelleted,</b> 85 % concentrate diet. Blood samples were collected at 20 -minute intervals during infusions. In experiment 2, four lambs were abruptly switched from a <b>pelleted</b> <b>hay</b> to an all-concentrate diet. Portal and arterial blood samples were collected before and up to 1 week after the diet switch. As a result of increased concentrate intake (experiment 1) net portal absorption and turnover of L-lactate and glucose increased. Percentage of glucose derived from L-lactate decreased. Net portal D-lactate absorption, L-lactate absorption {{as a percentage of}} turnover and con version of L-lactate to glucose were not affected by diet.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the most}} used biofuel in Slovak {{republic}} is log wood. Alternatively, {{there are also}} biofuels based on vegetal biomass (phytomass) like wheat straw or grass. The advantage of these biofuels is lower cost price because they are usually considered as waste product. The major disadvantage of these vegetal biofuels is their problematic combustion. It is mainly due to the low ash melting temperature because of chemical composition of ash from phytomass. The low ash melting temperature causes slagging and sintering, which reduce {{the efficiency of the}} combustion process. This disadvantage causes very difficult and problematic combustion of phytomass. The article deals the way of trouble reduction during combustion of pellets made from phytomass (specific hay) through the wood pellet co-combustion in a standard automatic boiler for combustion of wood pellets. During the experiments, the mixing ratio of <b>hay</b> <b>pellets</b> and wood pellets is varied and subsequently, there is determined its impact on the combustion process, namely on heat output of the boiler, and there is also evaluated the effect of the mixing ratio on the production of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO 2), organic hydrocarbons (OGC) and particulate matters (PM 10, PM 2. 5) ...|$|R
40|$|Rumen and caecal digesta were collected, under anaesthetic, {{from eight}} sheep offered either <b>hay,</b> <b>pelleted</b> {{concentrate}} or pasture at the Johnston Memorial Laboratory, Lincoln University during 1991.

The samples were centrifuged at 30000 g for 30 min and magnesium (Mg) concentration measured in the 30000 g supernatant fraction and in total digesta to assess Mg solubility. In rumen digesta, Mg solubility declined from 0 · 86 at pH 5 to 0 · 30 at pH 7 and differences in response between diets were small. Magnesium solubility in caecal digesta was generally higher than in ruminal digesta, and particularly at pH values > 6. At pH 7 the difference was twofold. Moreover, differences were observed between diets in the rate of decline in solubility in caecal digesta with increasing pH. At pH 5, 0 · 90 of Mg from hay and concentrate diets was soluble compared with only 0 · 8 for pasture. At pH 7, Mg solubility in caecal digesta from hay and concentrate-fed animals was almost double that from pasture-fed animals (0 · 64 and 0 · 62 v. 0 · 36, respectively).

Presently, one tonne of hay is equivalent to around $700 worth of heating oil. It is predicted that a farm in Nova Scotia with 100 acres of hay could make up to $50,000 a year selling their hay for production of pellets that will be used in the furnace. An increase in demand for pellets made out of hay could also potentially increase jobs available in rural farming areas across Canada.|$|R

Previous work has demonstrated good efficacy of dried SL (<b>hay,</b> <b>pellets)</b> against small ruminant GIN, but information is lacking on consumption of fresh SL, particularly during the late summer–autumn period in the southern USA when perennial warm-season grass pastures are often low in quality. A study was designed {{to determine the effects of}} autumn (September–November) consumption of fresh SL forage, grass pasture (predominantly bermudagrass, BG; Cynodon dactylon), or a combination of SL + BG forage by young goats [intact male Spanish kids, 9 months old (20. 7 ± 1. 1 kg), n = 10 /treatment group] on their GIN infection status. Three forage paddocks (0. 40 ha) were set up at the Fort Valley State University Agricultural Research Station (Fort Valley, GA) for an 8 -week trial. The goats in each paddock were supplemented with a commercial feed pellet at 0. 45 kg/head/d for the first 4 weeks of the trial, and 0. 27 kg/head/d for the final 4 weeks. Forage samples taken at the start of the trial were analyzed for crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and acid detergent fiber (ADF) content, and a separate set of SL samples was analyzed for CT in leaves, stems, and whole plant using the benzyl mercaptan thiolysis method. Animal weights were taken at the start and end of the trial, and fecal and blood samples were collected weekly for determination of fecal egg counts (FEC) and packed cell volume (PCV), respectively. Adult GIN was recovered from the abomasum and small intestines of all goats at the end of the experiment for counting and speciation. The CP levels were highest for SL forage, intermediate for SL + BG, and lowest for BG forage samples, while NDF and ADF values were the opposite, with highest levels in BG and lowest in SL forage samples.

50|$|A doe (female rabbit) becomes fertile between 8-12 {{weeks of}} age and can be safely bred at 16-17 weeks of age. Breeding before this age can cause harm or death to the doe and/or kits. Does are fertile all year long {{although}} day length can affect that some. The gestation period is around 28-35 days, although most will kindle (give birth) at 31-32 days. A nest box should be provided for the new mother two to five days prior to the expected kindling date. The doe will pull fur from her abdomen and dewlap and along with hay or other materials provided she will create a nest. The young are born hairless, deaf, and blind. Fur begins to grow in by day 3 to 5 and after 7 to 10 days the kits' eyes will open by 2 weeks they may begin exploring and sampling outside food sources.
