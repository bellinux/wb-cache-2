5|$|McLamore and Edgerton {{acquired}} {{a license to}} operate an Insta-Burger King franchise and opened their first location on 4 December 1954 at 3090 NW 36th Street in Miami. By 1959, the pair had stores at several locations within the Miami-Dade area, and operations were growing at a fast rate. However, the partners discovered that the insta-broiler units' heating elements were prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> that avoided the problems by cooking the meat patties a different way inside the unit. The new cooking appliance, which they called a flame broiler, moved the patties over the flame vertically on a chain link conveyor over the heating elements, a design that imparted grill lines on the patties similar to those made on a charcoal grill. The new unit worked so well that they {{made the decision to}} replace all of their Insta-Broilers with the newly designed unit.|$|E
5|$|The company {{known today}} as Burger King itself began as a franchise; the {{predecessor}} of the modern company was founded in 1953 in Jacksonville, Florida, as Insta-Burger King. The original founders and owners, Kieth J. Kramer and Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around {{a piece of equipment}} known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, Kramer and Burns required all of their franchises to carry the device. The rights to open stores in Miami, Florida, belonged to two businessmen named James McLamore and David R. Edgerton and their company: South Florida Restaurants, Inc. Due to operational issues with the Insta-Broiler, in 1954 McLamore and Edgarton made the decision to replace the Insta-Broiler with a mechanized <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> they called a flame broiler. Even though the company had rapidly expanded throughout the state until its operations totaled more than 40 locations in 1955, the original Insta-Burger King ran into financial difficulties and the pair of McLamore and Edgarton purchased the national rights to the chain and rechristened the company as Burger King of Miami.|$|E

5000|$|... "Pellet grills", {{sometimes}} referred to as pellet smokers, are backyard cookers that combine elements of charcoal smokers, <b>gas</b> <b>grills,</b> and kitchen ovens. Fueled by wood pellets, pellet grills infuse food with smoky flavor associated with charcoal grills and smokers, but offer the convenience of <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> and the temperature control of an indoor oven. They have the ability to smoke as well as grill and bake using an electronic control panel to automatically feed fuel to the fire, regulate the grillâ€™s airflow, and maintain consistent cooking temperatures. The best pellet grills also utilize sophisticated sensors and advanced algorithms for precision temperature control.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> follow the cart grill design concept: the grill unit itself {{is attached to}} a wheeled frame that holds the fuel tank. The wheeled frame may also support side tables and other features.|$|R
50|$|A hybrid grill is a grill {{used for}} outdoor cooking with {{charcoal}} {{and natural gas}} or liquid propane and can cook {{in the same manner}} as a traditional outdoor <b>gas</b> <b>grill.</b> The manufacturers claim that it combines the convenience of an outdoor <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> with the flavor and cooking techniques of a charcoal and wood grill.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{increased}} demand for home grills, Char-Broil began to mass-produce <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> in the 1960s. In 1961, Char-Broil patented the first grease-handling system for an outdoor grill to make grilling safer and easier. In the 1970s, {{they were the first}} to package the LP tank and grill in one box, which revolutionized the backyard grill industry. Char-Broil introduced the first electric <b>grills,</b> portable <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> and table-top grills in the 1970s. In 1973, the Manufacturing Division moved from the Iron Works to a more modern plant in the Bradley Industrial Park and becomes known as W.C. Bradley Enterprises. Then in 1977, W.C. Bradley Enterprises became known as Char-Broil. In 1989, Char-Broil became a separate business division of the W.C. Bradley Company.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, {{more than}} 40,000 pounds of waste were reduced through the {{combined}} {{efforts of the}} eight schools. This is equal to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 105 metric tons. This number {{is comparable to the}} amount of greenhouse emissions that are produced annually from the consumption of about 12,000 gallons of gasoline or equal to the annual emissions generated from about 4,400 propane cylinders used to fuel <b>gas</b> <b>grills.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another type of <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> gaining {{popularity}} {{is called a}} flattop grill.

5000|$|The outdoor <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> {{was invented}} in the early 1950s by Don McGlaughlin, owner of the Chicago Combustion Corporation, known today as LazyMan. McGlaughlin invented the first {{built-in}} grill from the successful gas broiler called BROILBURGER. These first Lazy-Man grills were marketed as [...] "open-fire charcoal-type gas broilers" [...] which featured [...] "permanent coals", otherwise known as lava rock. In the 1950s, most residential households {{did not have a}} barbecue, so the term broiler was used for marketing purposes to commercial establishments. The gas open-broiler design was adapted into the first portable <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> in 1954 by Chicago Combustion Corporation as the Model AP. McGlaughlin's portable design was the first to feature the use of the 20-lb propane cylinders, which previously were exclusively used by plumbers as a fuel source.|$|E
50|$|The {{use of a}} time {{pressure}} gauge provides for better planning with any instrument that emits carbon gas through varying consumption rates determined by pressurized contents. Efficiency is maximized by understanding energy requirements in time. One such example would be {{something as simple as}} a <b>gas</b> <b>grill.</b> Operation of a <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> with all burners on can observe tangible results (time reduction) by turning the gas control to low or by shutting off one burner. Seeing the increase in time will automatically indicate an increase in energy saving. Most notably the {{time pressure}} gauge could reduce carbon emissions in all air travel through increased fuel efficiency, while also reducing fuel cost. Furthermore, recently the airline industry is under pressure to reduce carbon emissions globally, and instruments such as the time pressure gauge could spearhead this movement.|$|E

The clubhouse is also equipped with modern bathrooms, a kitchen, a dining room, a television, and a porch with picnic tables, <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> and pop machines. Rental cars, pull carts, and clubs are available.|$|R
50|$|A recent {{trend in}} <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> is for {{manufacturers}} {{to add an}} infrared radiant burner {{to the back of}} the grill enclosure. This radiant burner provides an even heat across the burner and is intended for use with a horizontal rotisserie. A meat item (whole chicken, beef roast, pork loin roast) is placed on a metal skewer that is rotated by an electric motor. Smaller cuts of meat can be grilled in this manner using a round metal basket that slips over the metal skewer.|$|R
50|$|In Japanese cities, yakitori carts, restaurants, or shops can be found. These contain charcoal-fired grills and marinated {{grilled meat}} on a stick. Yakiniku {{is a type}} of food where meat and/or {{vegetables}} are grilled directly over small charcoal or <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> at high temperatures. (This style of cooking has become popular throughout Asia.) In Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Thailand, a popular food item from food vendors is satay, which is marinated meat on a bamboo skewer grilled over a charcoal fire and served with peanut (sate) sauce.|$|R

5000|$|A {{small metal}} [...] "smoker box" [...] {{containing}} wood chips {{may be used}} on a <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> to give a smoky flavor to the grilled foods. Although, barbecue purists would argue that to get a true smoky flavor (and smoke ring) the user has to cook low and slow, indirectly and using wood or charcoal. Gas grills are difficult to maintain at the low temperatures required (~225-250 Â°F), especially for extended periods.|$|E
50|$|Piezo {{ignition}} {{is a type}} of ignition that is used in portable camping stoves, <b>gas</b> <b>grills</b> {{and some}} lighters, and potato cannons. Piezo ignition uses the principle of piezoelectricity, which, in short, is the electric charge that accumulates in some materials in response to high pressure. It consists of a small, spring-loaded hammer which, when a button is pressed, hits a crystal of PZT or quartz crystal. Quartz is piezoelectric, which means that it creates a voltage when deformed. This sudden forceful deformation produces a high voltage and subsequent electrical discharge, which ignites the gas.|$|R
5000|$|In 1925, W.C. Bradley Co. acquires {{controlling}} {{interest in the}} Columbus Iron Works, which previously made parts for steamboats and stove products. By the 1940s, agricultural started moving west. The Bradley Company adapted quickly, redirecting focus to the [...] "backyard" [...] leisure market and manufactured a portable outdoor cooker called [...] "Char-Broil." [...] The Char-Broil 19 (also known as the CB 19) {{is thought to be}} the first cast iron charcoal grill on the market. Hardware stores that carried the Bradley's agricultural and stove supplies begin selling the cast-iron charcoal grill for $19, which were purchased and delivered across the United States. The early grills were made from steel drum, and two years later, electric grills were manufactured. Char-Broil brand products have set the standards for grills and led the way with features such as the Flarefighter shutter grid, wide viewing window and anti-wobble construction. Between the Char-Broil brand and Certified Grill Parts, W.C. Bradley Company became a worldwide leader in the manufacture of aluminum <b>gas</b> <b>grills,</b> grill parts and accessories.|$|R

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to combine the best {{attributes}} of a real wood fire, a convection oven, a high-end <b>gas</b> <b>grill,</b> and a smoker, Memphis created a grill that uses 100 percent natural wood pellets. The grills have an intelligent temperature control panel {{that is used to}} set exact temperatures based on cooking needs. Between the different models, the grills have a recorded range of 180-700 Â°F, the highest of which can be achieved through an open-flame insert.|$|E
50|$|Burners are hollow {{with gas}} inlet holes and outlet 'ports'. For each inlet {{there is a}} {{separate}} control on the control panel of the grill. The {{most common type of}} <b>gas</b> <b>grill</b> burners are called 'H' burners and resemble the capital letter 'H' turned on its side. Another popular shape is oval. There are also 'Figure 8', 'Bowtie' and 'Bar' burners. Other grills have a separate burner for each control. These burners can be referred to as 'Pipe', 'Tube', or 'Rail' burners. They are mostly straight since they are only required to heat one portion of the grill.|$|E
