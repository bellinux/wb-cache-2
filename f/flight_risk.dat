5|$|Awaiting appeal, Scrushy {{was briefly}} transported to a {{transfer}} site for inmates in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma before {{being sent to}} his permanent location at a low security federal prison in Beaumont, Texas. Scrushy filed a request with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, asking to be released on appeal bond. The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Scrushy's request to be released on bond, citing an earlier ruling written by U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller. The ruling was issued while Scrushy was on bond awaiting sentencing, and deemed him a <b>flight</b> <b>risk.</b> Scrushy again filed for release in February and May 2008 but both requests were denied.|$|E
5|$|Stack v. Boyle (1951) is {{the only}} {{case in which the}} Supreme Court has held the bail imposed to have been constitutionally {{excessive}}. There, the Court found $50,000 to be excessive in relation to the <b>flight</b> <b>risk</b> for impecunious defendants charged under the Smith Act. In United States v. Salerno (1987), the Court upheld the Bail Reform Act of 1984, which authorized the consideration of future dangerousness in the determination of the amount of, or the denial of, bail.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 2012, the State Attorney {{brought a}} motion to remand Blythe in pre-trial detention, as he {{considered}} Blythe a <b>flight</b> <b>risk.</b> During a hearing conducted the same day, judge Petr Fassati of the Prague 8 District Court ruled that Blythe {{will be held on}} remand, with the possibility of a bail of CZK 4,000,000 (~ US$ 200,000), Blythe's alleged annual income; Blythe was held in Pankrác Prison. Bail was deposited in the court's bank account on mid-day of July 3, 2012. After this, the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint. Due to public holidays it was not until July 9, 2012, that the State Attorney filed his complaint, which was to be dealt with by appellate court, the Prague Municipal Court.|$|E

25|$|Madoff posted $10 million bail in December 2008 and {{remained}} under 24-hour monitoring and house arrest in his Upper East Side penthouse apartment until March 12, 2009, when Judge Denny Chin revoked his bail and remanded {{him to the}} Metropolitan Correctional Center. Chin ruled that Madoff was a <b>flight</b> <b>risk</b> because of his age, his wealth, {{and the prospect of}} spending {{the rest of his life}} in prison. Prosecutors filed two asset forfeiture pleadings which include lists of valuable real and personal property as well as financial interests and entities owned or controlled by Madoff.|$|E
25|$|By 30 October, {{work had}} resumed as normal {{throughout}} Catalonia as the Spanish government's takeover met with little resistance from Catalan authorities. Puigdemont {{and part of}} his cabinet fled to Belgium to escape action from the Spanish judiciary, having been formally accused of rebellion, sedition and embezzlement by the Spanish Attorney General. The independence declaration was suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain on the next day. Eight members of the deposed Catalan government—including Puigdemont's deputy and ERC leader, Oriol Junqueras—were ordered to be remanded to custody without bail on 2 November for posing a <b>flight</b> <b>risk,</b> with a ninth being granted a bail, with Spanish prosecutors seeking a European Arrest Warrant for Puigdemont and four other members refusing to attend the hearing.|$|E
50|$|The {{defendants}} faced possible life {{prison terms}} for {{violation of the}} Neutrality Acts and various weapons charges. They initially were denied bail, with a federal court ruling that they were likely <b>flight</b> <b>risks,</b> given their extensive connections, access to private aircraft, and resources.|$|R
50|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}} (DVT) is the third-most common vascular disease, next to stroke and heart attack.

25|$|On 15 June 2007, {{defendants}} were indicted by {{a grand jury}} and an 11th man was arrested {{in connection with the}} alleged plot. The defendants face possible life prison terms for violation of the U.S. Neutrality Act and various weapons charges. Vang and the other Hmong were initially denied bail by the California federal court, which cited each of them as a <b>flight</b> <b>risk.</b> Since the 4 June 2007 federal raid, the arrests became the subject of mounting criticism. His fellow friends, including Hmong, Mienh, Lao, Vietnamese, and Americans individuals who knew Vang protested the arrests, rallying in California, Minnesota, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Several of Vang's high-level U.S. supporters criticized the California court that issued the arrest warrants. In 2009 all of the federal charges against Vang Pao were dropped.|$|E
25|$|The law {{provides}} {{for the right to}} bail, except in cases involving narcotics, violent crimes, and firearms violations. Although the bail system was used, civil rights groups claimed that judges were more likely to order the holding of indicted suspects in preventive or pretrial detention than to allow suspects to remain free pending their trial. In November 2008 the highest penal court broadly ruled that pretrial detention should be the exception to the rule, except in cases where a suspect represents a <b>flight</b> <b>risk</b> or may act to obstruct justice. Detainees are allowed prompt access to counsel, and public defenders were provided for detainees unable to afford counsel, although such access sometimes was delayed due to an overburdened system. Strong demand and a lack of resources for the Public Defender's Office results in an excessive caseload for public defense attorneys.|$|E
25|$|Clarett was arraigned on {{the latest}} charges on August 10, 2006 in Franklin County Municipal Court in Columbus. During the arraignment, Judge Andrea C. Peeples set his bond on the charges of {{carrying}} a concealed weapon without a permit and failure to maintain current lane at $5 million. In setting the bond, Peeples agreed with prosecutors that Clarett is now a <b>flight</b> <b>risk</b> or could attempt to intimidate witnesses in his upcoming robbery trial. Clarett remained lodged in the Franklin County Corrections Center, however, as the $1.1 million bond for the robbery charge was revoked by trial judge David Fais. According to a Columbus Dispatch report, Clarett, who was due to be tried for his January arrest, was {{in the neighborhood of}} one of the principal witnesses against him at the time the events of August 9 occurred.|$|E

25|$|Prosecutors say {{it sends}} a message {{that no one is}} above the law, and the {{likelihood}} of being perp-walked after arrest deters criminal behavior on the part of offenders, especially white-collar criminals, who might otherwise believe they could successfully avoid conviction. Mary Jo White, former United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, the federal prosecutor's office that handles most crimes committed in the financial sector, believes perp walks in such cases restore investor confidence. Police say that the image of a suspect being taken into custody, when publicized, can encourage other witnesses to come forward with relevant information. Lastly, prosecutors may be trying to get an advantage in a bail hearing if they consider the defendant to be a <b>flight</b> <b>risk,</b> since it bolsters their case if the defendant apparently had to be arrested.|$|E
25|$|In January 2012 Efrain Rios Montt, {{the former}} {{dictator}} of Guatemala, {{appeared in a}} Guatemalan court on genocide charges. During the hearing, the government presented evidence of over 100 incidents involving at least 1,771 deaths, 1,445 rapes, and the displacement of nearly 30,000 Guatemalans during his 17-month rule from 1982–1983. The prosecution wanted him incarcerated because he {{was viewed as a}} <b>flight</b> <b>risk</b> but he remained free on bail, under house arrest and guarded by the Guatemalan National Civil Police (PNC). On 10 May 2013, Rios Montt was found guilty and sentenced to 80 years in prison. It marked {{the first time that a}} national court had found a former head of state guilty of genocide. The conviction was later overturned, and Montt's trial resumed in January 2015. In August 2015, a Guatemalan court ruled that Rios Montt could stand trial for genocide and crimes against humanity, but that he could not be sentenced due to his age and deteriorating health.|$|E
500|$|On March 2, {{the defense}} argued {{in court that}} Cisneros should be set free on bond during the trial {{because she did not}} pose a <b>flight</b> <b>risk</b> as {{demonstrated}} by her actions during the first trial. The defense stated that she never failed to appear in court during the 1994 trial even though she was facing a possible death penalty. In addition, they said she was a long-time resident of Brownsville and had no previous criminal history. Though Cisneros was aware of the FBI investigation, and the possibility of a new indictment against her, she had not fled, thus justifying her bond. On March 9, Cisneros was released from jail on a US$300,000 bond. The court ruled for the defense after deciding that she would not attempt to flee before the trial. [...] Court officials imposed certain restrictions on her freedom, however. They asked her to hand over her U.S. passport and to limit her travel to the Brownsville and McAllen, Texas judicial districts. Her husband was also required to sign a document that made him a third-party custodian.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Flight {{safety is}} the basis of the Air Force combat effectiveness. We propose a fault tree {{approach}} to qualitatively identify risk factors that affect <b>flight</b> safety. <b>Risk</b> factor identification index system of flight safety is established, and the risk coefficient method is developed to identify the risk factors quantitatively. We finally study an example of a Military Region, the risk factors of which are from different sources, and establish the classification system. The results can provide an objective basis for headquarters offices and flight safety management department policy formulation, which can lay the foundation for further development of <b>flight</b> safety <b>risk</b> assessment...|$|R

2500|$|Once {{loaded onto}} the trains, the {{deportees}} became {{the responsibility of}} the MVD. The loading stations needed special supervision and security to prevent escapes therefore they were, if possible, away from towns to prevent the gathering of deportee family members, friends, or onlookers. MVD also recruited informants from among the deportees and placed people categorized as <b>flight</b> <b>risk</b> under heavier guard. The train cars were mostly standard 20-ton freight cars (...) with no amenities. The cars, on average, fit 35 people and their baggage which means about [...] of space per person.

He was jailed shortly before the trial began when he {{received}} a $3.5million wire transfer from Lebanon. Rezko had told the court {{that he had no}} access to money from overseas. Ten weeks into the trial, on April 18, Judge Amy St. Eve released Rezko, after friends and relatives put up 30 properties valued at about $8.5million to secure his bond. Prosecutors opposed the motion for release, saying that Rezko was a <b>flight</b> <b>risk.</b> On May 6, both the prosecution and the defense rested their cases. Government prosecutors spent 8 weeks presenting their case. Rezko’s lawyer, Joseph J. Duffy, chose not to present any witnesses, saying that he did not believe that the prosecution had proven the charges. Prosecutors contended that they had shown Rezko's [...] "corrupt use of his power and influence" [...] to gain benefits for himself and his friends. Duffy argued that the prosecution had exaggerated Rezko's influence in state government, and attacked Levine's credibility as a witness.|$|E
