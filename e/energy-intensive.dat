5|$|During the {{transition}} period participants in energy, fossil fuels and industry will only need to surrender one NZU for two tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. Free allocation of units to <b>energy-intensive</b> and trade-exposed activities will also be halved. Secondly, participants may pay a fixed price of NZ$25 instead of buying and surrendering units. This measure means that firms will face a cost of no higher than NZ$12.50 per tonne of emissions. There is a restriction {{on the sale of}} units oversea during this transition period, except for forest removal credits.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{production}} is mainly from steam reforming natural gas, and less often from more <b>energy-intensive</b> {{methods such as}} the electrolysis of water. Most hydrogen is used {{near the site of}} its production, the two largest uses being fossil fuel processing (e.g., hydrocracking) and ammonia production, mostly for the fertilizer market. Hydrogen is a concern in metallurgy as it can embrittle many metals, complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks.|$|E
5|$|Research on a cleaner, less <b>energy-intensive</b> lead {{extraction}} process continues; a major drawback is that either too much lead is lost as waste, or the alternatives {{result in a}} high sulfur content in the resulting lead metal. Hydrometallurgical extraction, in which anodes of impure lead are immersed into an electrolyte and pure lead is deposited onto a cathode, is a technique that may have potential.|$|E
25|$|At the Wales Office, Crabb {{worked on}} {{maintaining}} {{the competitiveness of}} Wales' <b>energy-intensive</b> industries {{in the face of}} high energy costs. In the 2014 Spring Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the British Government would compensate <b>energy-intensive</b> industries hit hard by the rising cost of energy.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1940s, {{agricultural}} productivity has increased dramatically, {{due largely to}} {{the increased use of}} <b>energy-intensive</b> mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides.|$|E
25|$|Seawater {{desalination}} - an <b>energy-intensive</b> {{process where}} salt and other minerals {{are removed from}} seawater to produce potable water for drinking and irrigation, typically through membrane filtration (reverse-osmosis), and steam-distillation.|$|E
25|$|From 1995 to 2013, {{the energy}} {{intensity}} of the economy per unit of GDP declined by 25 percent. A contributing factor is the growth of relatively less <b>energy-intensive</b> service industries.|$|E
25|$|AMPK {{inhibits}} the <b>energy-intensive</b> {{protein biosynthesis}} process {{and can also}} force a switch from cap-dependent translation to cap-independent translation, which requires less energy, by phosphorylation of TSC2, RPTOR, transcription initiation factor 1A.66, and eEF2K.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major problem}} is that {{desalination}} is very <b>energy-intensive,</b> while the import of fuel to produce the necessary electricity is restricted by Israel and Egypt. Furthermore, revenues from drinking water tariffs are insufficient to cover the operating costs of the envisaged plant at the current tariff level.|$|E
25|$|The power {{problems}} were further exacerbated by Mbeki's government policy of attracting <b>energy-intensive</b> industry (such as Aluminium smelters) through the carrot of cheap electricity. This meant that, as Eskom's excess capacity {{ran out and}} became a deficit, the South African government finds itself contractually bound to provide power to <b>energy-intensive</b> industries. Despite this meaning {{the rest of the}} country experienced traffic problems and business disruption due to the blackouts. For South Africa to remain a desirable foreign investment destination the country must be seen to honour its contractual obligations. To shut down the smelters is not a simple process, said one analyst. Government would be paying the cost of effects all through the relevant parties aluminium value chain – its aluminium refineries and bauxite ore mines in other countries.|$|E
25|$|Sectoral costs: In a {{literature}} assessment, Barker et al. (2001:563–564), {{predicted that the}} renewables sector could potentially benefit from mitigation. The coal (and possibly the oil) industry was predicted to potentially lose substantial proportions of output relative to a baseline scenario, with <b>energy-intensive</b> sectors, such as heavy chemicals, facing higher costs.|$|E
25|$|More directly, {{the high}} {{petroleum}} (oil) and gas prices of 2005 have {{only added to}} the attraction of renewable energy sources. Although most renewable energies are more expensive at current fuel prices, the difference is narrowing, and uncertainty in oil and gas markets is a factor worth considering for highly <b>energy-intensive</b> businesses.|$|E
25|$|Its main {{advantage}} is that it accelerates aircraft more smoothly, putting less stress on their airframes. Compared to steam catapults, EMALS also weighs less, is expected to cost less and require less maintenance, and can launch aircraft that are heavier or lighter. It uses far less fresh water, reducing the need for <b>energy-intensive</b> desalination.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 the {{government}} created incentives to expand large-scale manufacturing industries and <b>energy-intensive</b> industries, targeting these industries and building policies around them. The Heavy Industries Corporation of Malaysia (HICOM), for example, {{was formed to}} assist in the manufacture of pig-iron, aluminium die casting, pulp and paper, steel, cement, motorcycle and heavy engineering. At the same time, export incentives were initiated.|$|E
25|$|Narrower stomatal {{apertures}} {{can be used}} {{in conjunction}} with an intermediary molecule with a high carbon dioxide affinity, PEPcase (Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase). Retrieving the products of carbon fixation from PEPCase is an <b>energy-intensive</b> process, however. As a result, the PEPCase alternative is preferable only where water is limiting but light is plentiful, or where high temperatures increase the solubility of oxygen relative to that of carbon dioxide, magnifying RuBisCo's oxygenation problem.|$|E
25|$|Carbon capture, utilization, and {{sequestration}} (or storage) {{is increasingly}} being utilized in modern coal gasification projects {{to address the}} greenhouse gas emissions concern {{associated with the use}} of coal and carbonaceous fuels. In this respect, gasification has a significant advantage over conventional coal combustion, in which CO2 resulting from combustion is considerably diluted by nitrogen and residual oxygen in the near-ambient pressure combustion exhaust, making it relatively difficult, <b>energy-intensive,</b> and expensive to capture the CO2 (this is known as “post-combustion” CO2 capture).|$|E
25|$|It is envisaged that {{achieving}} {{the aim of}} a 2000-watt society will require, amongst other measures, a complete reinvestment in the country's capital assets; refurbishment of the nation's building stock {{to bring it up}} to low energy building standards; significant improvements in the efficiency of road transport, aviation and <b>energy-intensive</b> material use; the possible introduction of high-speed maglev trains; the use of renewable energy sources, district heating, microgeneration and related technologies; and a refocusing of research into new priority areas.|$|E
25|$|Interest {{has been}} {{expressed}} in Western Canada, where CANDU reactors are being considered as heat and electricity {{sources for the}} <b>energy-intensive</b> oil sands extraction process, which currently uses natural gas. Energy Alberta Corporation announced 27 August 2007 that they had applied for a licence {{to build a new}} nuclear plant at Lac Cardinal (30km west of the town of Peace River, Alberta), with two ACR-1000 reactors going online in 2017 producing 2.2 gigawatts (electric). A 2007 parliamentary review suggested placing the development efforts on hold.|$|E
25|$|Changing price {{conditions}} favored {{conservation and}} {{alternative sources of}} industrial energy. Although the investment costs were high, many <b>energy-intensive</b> industries successfully reduced their dependence on oil during the late 1970s and 1980s and enhanced their productivity. Advances in microcircuitry and semiconductors in the late 1970s and 1980s led to new growth industries in consumer electronics and computers, and to higher productivity in pre-established industries. The net result of these adjustments was to increase the energy efficiency of manufacturing and to expand knowledge-intensive industries. The service industries expanded in an increasingly postindustrial economy.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{multi-storey}} car parks provide lower {{building cost}} per parking slot, as they typically require less building volume and less ground area than a conventional facility {{with the same}} capacity. However, {{the cost of the}} mechanical equipment needed to transport the cars needs {{to be added to the}} building cost to determine the total cost. Other costs are usually lower too, for example there is no need for an <b>energy-intensive</b> ventilating system, since cars are not driven inside and human cashiers or security personnel may not be needed.|$|E
25|$|Cellulosic ethanol {{production}} {{is a new}} approach that may alleviate land use and related concerns. Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from any plant material, potentially doubling yields, {{in an effort to}} minimize conflict between food needs vs. fuel needs. Instead of utilizing only the starch by-products from grinding wheat and other crops, cellulosic {{ethanol production}} maximizes the use of all plant materials, including gluten. This approach would have a smaller carbon footprint because the amount of <b>energy-intensive</b> fertilisers and fungicides remain the same for higher output of usable material. The technology for producing cellulosic ethanol is currently in the commercialization stage.|$|E
25|$|Since the 1940s, {{agricultural}} productivity has increased dramatically, {{due largely to}} {{the increased use of}} <b>energy-intensive</b> mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources. Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area) as world population doubled. Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment. These threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the <b>energy-intensive</b> stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most <b>energy-intensive</b> life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective ways to increase fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{believe that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment. These threats include the {{problems}} of processing, transport and storage of radioactive nuclear waste, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism, as well as health risks and environmental damage from uranium mining. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong; {{and there have been}} serious nuclear accidents. Critics {{do not believe that the}} risks of using nuclear fission as a power source can be fully offset through the development of new technology. In years past, they also argued that when all the <b>energy-intensive</b> stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is neither a low-carbon nor an economical electricity source.|$|E
25|$|A second {{consideration}} {{related to}} the feedstock is moisture content. Drier, stackable substrates, such as food and yard waste, are suitable for digestion in tunnel-like chambers. Tunnel-style systems typically have near-zero wastewater discharge, as well, so this style of system has advantages where the discharge of digester liquids are a liability. The wetter the material, the more suitable {{it will be to}} handling with standard pumps instead of <b>energy-intensive</b> concrete pumps and physical means of movement. Also, the wetter the material, the more volume and area it takes up relative to the levels of gas produced. The moisture content of the target feedstock will also affect what type of system is applied to its treatment. To use a high-solids anaerobic digester for dilute feedstocks, bulking agents, such as compost, should be applied to increase the solids content of the input material. Another key consideration is the carbon:nitrogen ratio of the input material. This ratio is the balance of food a microbe requires to grow; the optimal C:N ratio is 20–30:1. Excess N can lead to ammonia inhibition of digestion.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another environmental issue is discharge of hot water into the sea. The hot water modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the <b>energy-intensive</b> stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies. Actual construction costs often exceed estimates, and spent fuel management costs do not have a clear time limit.|$|E
500|$|Wing {{shape and}} size {{generally}} determine a bird's flight style and performance; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less <b>energy-intensive</b> soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources {{and the absence of}} land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to [...] "fly" [...] through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.|$|E
500|$|Reuters {{reported}} that the amended NZ ETS allowed unlimited imports of offsets and that business groups largely backed the changes, while environmental groups largely felt that the NZ ETS would not do enough to reduce emissions. In March 2010, Reuters {{reported that}} the NZ ETS had [...] "no emissions cap nor any limit {{on the number of}} free carbon permits for <b>energy-intensive</b> companies that export their products". Reuters noted that the absence of a cap and the two-tonnes-for-one-unit surrender arrangement had led to [...] "accusations of some big polluters getting a free ride and that the scheme will fail to cut emissions of planet-warming gases".|$|E
500|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes. Flight {{is the primary}} means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.

500|$|Large {{reserves}} {{of natural gas}} were discovered {{off the coast of}} Bintulu in 1969. Following this, a feasibility study was done in 1975, and Tanjung Kidurong was found to be a suitable site for a deep-water port. On 14 June 1978, Malaysia LNG Sdn Bhd (MLNG Satu) was established by Petronas, a Malaysian national oil and gas company for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) processing at Bintulu. On 8 July 1978, the Bintulu Development Authority (BDA) was established by the Sarawak state government for infrastructure development and to promote industrial investment in the area. On 15 August 1981, the Bintulu Port Authority was established at Tanjung Kidurong, starting operation on 1 January 1983. Since the establishment of Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE) in 2008, Bintulu become the gateway to Samalajau Industrial Park, which is located [...] away from Bintulu. The industrial park is a centre of heavy, <b>energy-intensive</b> industry. Among the companies that started their operations in the industrial park are Tokuyama Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Press Metal Bintulu Sdn Bhd, and OM Materials Sdn Bhd.|$|E
500|$|The Sun's energy, stored by plants (primary producers) during photosynthesis, {{passes through}} the food chain to other organisms to {{ultimately}} power all living processes. Since the industrial revolution the concentrated energy of the Sun stored in fossilized plants as fossil fuels {{has been a major}} driver of technology which, in turn, has been the source of both economic and political power. In 2007 climate scientists of the IPCC concluded that there was at least a 90% probability that atmospheric increase in CO2 was human-induced, mostly as a result of fossil fuel emissions but, to a lesser extent from changes in land use. Stabilizing the world's climate will require high-income countries to reduce their emissions by 60–90% over 2006 levels by 2050 which should hold CO2 levels at 450–650ppm from current levels of about 380ppm. Above this level, temperatures could rise by more than 2°C to produce [...] "catastrophic" [...] climate change. Reduction of current CO2 levels must be achieved against a background of global population increase and developing countries aspiring to <b>energy-intensive</b> high consumption Western lifestyles.|$|E
