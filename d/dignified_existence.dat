40|$|From charity {{to welfare}} rights? A study of social care {{practices}} My PhD project starts from {{the finding of}} a (conceptual) transition from charity to welfare rights in social work, as {{can be found in}} scholarly literature in Belgium and beyond (Schuyt, 1978; Goodin, 1988; Notredame, 1997; Bouverne-De Bie, 2003; Vranken, 2005). In Belgium this transition was initiated with the law on a basic minimum income of 1974, which for the first time guaranteed a right to a basic minimum income. In 1976 the law on the Public Centres for Social Welfare (PCSW) (Openbare Centra voor Maatschappelijk Welzijn), which are the successors of the Commissions of Public Assistance (Commissies van Openbare Onderstand), formally established a right to social welfare. The right to social welfare had and has as an aim to guarantee a <b>dignified</b> <b>existence</b> for all people in Belgium. This meant the completion of the transition to welfare rights. However, some Belgian scholars argue that we experience a throwback to charity through the dominance of workfare and more particularly the growing conditionality of these welfare rights (Notredame, 1999). The law on the PCSW obliges the Belgian State to secure a <b>dignified</b> <b>existence.</b> However, it is still not clear how the concrete social care practice gives shape to this right.

Yet, few tasks confronting the world community today remain more vital to its future than the defense and fulfillment of the basic values of the individual human being.

This remains the core of development problems that underline the principal objective of development policy as embodied in the Millennium Declaration. Despite significant improvements over the past 50 years in advancing human well-being, extreme poverty and inequities remain widespread in the developing world. The world today is characterized by vertiginous accumulation of wealth by a few {{to the exclusion of}} larger majority who suffer untold hardrhip and Impoverishment. These conditions have been exacerbated by the adoption of free market paradigm anchored on private accumulation. This has engendered an overlap of all types of injustice and social polarization that now define the basis for social life in most countries of the world, including Nigeria where 70 percent of the population lives below US one dollar a day. As an exploratory study, secondary sources ofdata were engaged to interrogate the policy of market fundamentalism and the man((estations of inequities it has engendered The paper argued that the lack of access to essential goods and services for a <b>dignified</b> human <b>existence,</b> the unevenness in the distribution of incomes and fruits of economic growth, as well as constraints in the access to power, self-esteem and freedom coupled with the prevalence of ethnic, religious, gender differences and orientations have generated violence, unrests, war. terrorism and deepen social conflicts- which reinforce the conditions of growing social inequality. The paper further proposed a restructuring of the present one-size-fits all model of social relations of economic globalization to one which require closer economic cooperation, where people and countries collectivezv act together to solve their common problems qf trade, capital and environment. Besides, there is need for international financial institutions such as the World Bank/IMF to respect national sovereignty, allow each country 10 make appropriate decisions that will shape and strengthen the process of nation building and better quality of life.

40|$|Trade {{liberalization}} as {{an integral}} part of economic globalization has achieved phenomenal boost with the advent of the WTO in the mid- 1990 s. The protection and promotion of human rights as the core value of <b>dignified</b> human <b>existence</b> has attained its preeminence with the emergence of the UN. Both, emerging at the aftermath of the Second World War, are now institutionalized and internationalized that impinge on state sovereignty, socio-economic imperatives, and cultural plurality of the world. Trade-induced income has the potential for better economic conditions and living standards, resulting in greater ability to enjoy human rights and social justice. But trade liberalization often creates new opportunities and challenges. Those who can take the advantage of these new opportunities enjoy human rights more than those who cannot cope with the new challenges. Seemingly this inequality has far reaching effects on human rights and distributive socio-economic justice. The true nexus between trade liberalization and human rights has become a recurring feature of contemporary international discourse and is the subject-matter of this article. The article critically examines their interface and the ability of international law to render them mutually supportive. It finds that trade liberalization is complimentary to human rights in some instances. But the distant goal of humanism is, more often than not, lost in the pursuit of immediate economic gains. This reality has relegated the human rights protection regime to the status of soft law, which often fails to grapple with hard economic rationales. In the event of a conflict between international standards and obligations emanating from both trade liberalization and human rights, it is the former that receives priority over the latter. This posture is further compounded by the fact that the WTO is devoid of any direct human rights consideration. It promotes human rights only incidentally as an opportunistic fulcrum to advance a global free trade. This fragmentary adherence to human rights limited only to flourishing markets has some negative impacts that far outweigh its paltry positive impacts on human rights. The article suggests that it is time for the WTO to mainstreaming human rights into its trade liberalization agenda. Trade has a significant impact on the lives of all global citizens. The WTO, being an organization of raising living standards and promoting sustainable development, cannot afford to ignore global social benefits and public interests. The realm of trade is in no way exempt from juscogens and erga omnes obligations emanating from core human rights, which can be relied upon to challenge the dominance of trade law. This is not to trivialize the potential of trade liberalization in inducing worldwide economic growth. Should this prospective growth eventuate, it would improve the economic and social conditions of people particularly in developing countries, thereby enhancing their ability to enjoy human rights and social justice. This complementary link between human rights and trade must be recognized. The task at hand is not to undermine the ongoing trade liberalization, but to tame it to be responsive to social justice and human rights friendly. 33 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{confrontation of}} Oriental and Occidental values {{represents one of}} the most important topics of scholarship since the twentieth century. Within this debate, American-born Chinese female writers occupy a unique position in their preoccupation with the two seemingly irreconcilable cultures. On the one hand, their Western upbringings entices the distortion of China from an Orientalistic perspective, on the other hand, they find their desire to come to terms with their ethnic cultural heritage to be equally difficult to supplant. It is a dilemma which sparked conflicts even within the Chinese American community, and begs the redefinition of the Chinese American female identity. It is thus, by applying Simone de Beauvoir’s ethical notions about Self/Other relations to the writings of Chinese American female writers, I consider how subjectivity is not substantive but a situated experience of selfhood in movement, and argue that Chinese American female writers may still be internalizing and perpetuating oriental stereotypes in their works, when they too have started re-orienting and hence, re-orientalising China and their Chinese identity. The United States of America is to Chinese American women as alienated at times as China. Under the framework, I further consider the futility of disputing the dual identity of Chinese American female writers to the extent to which identity can be considered as an ambivalent and ambiguous notion that has a temporal element in it. As a writer writes first and foremost about his or her own singular experiences in relation to the world, this thesis tackles the above question by examining how elements of anguish, solitude, and death, as noted by Beauvoir, and that are often present in Chinese American female writers’ accounts of their singular experiences, connect them to others. Through the evocation of such elements to establish the connection between Self and Other, which constitutes the authenticity of self-expression as opposed to suppression of self-assertion, one’s struggle with separation and one’s own truth is represented. In this sense, it is not, the ultimate result or triumph of an individual’s struggle with unity or individuality that matters; but rather, the process of self-struggle that corresponds to the <b>dignified</b> human <b>existence</b> within Beauvoir’s philosophical framework. The three elements of situation anguish, death and solitude are dealt with in this project in the following context: in Chapter Two, Ann Mah’s anguish over Chinese and American food is examined in connotation to the relations of herself with others around her that coerces her to reflect upon her ethnic and cultural affiliations. In Chapter Three, death is explored through the discussion of the footbinding notion in which the death of the foot signifies the end of docile acceptance as well as the beginning of transformations. Solitude is elucidated in Chapter Four through Maxine Hong Kingston’s warrior woman conceptualization that adopts and later re-orientalises silence. In all three situations, I pay attention to the way re-orientalisation is achieved in the Chinese American female project of selfhood in movement towards the Other. published_or_final_versionChineseMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

Feminist theorists value the concept of care, & the emotional aspect of 'caring about' in 'caring for'.

Furthermore, feminists express concern that the DPM's pragmatic {{solution to the problem of}} 'care' is a form of discursive alignment with 'malestream' public policy that constitutes both disabled people & women as 'other' subjects of modern welfare state economies. Drawing on the work of Irigaray, we propose that a post-feminist analysis of the constitution of the parties in the caring dyad can help to make the case for a mutually beneficial ethics of care. We support the feminist voice in disability studies, particularly its call for an embodied, experiential, emotional & political view of the caring relationship. We articulate a post-structuralist feminist critique of waste & want as the discursive terrain upon which both disabled people & women are constituted as marginalized subjects in caring relationships. Irigaray's claim that women's immersion in the pleasure of 'the other' marginalizes her from her embodied experience, dims her sense of self, & locates her & her caring practices in a liminal, abject space on the margins of phallocentric culture, ground this analysis. We claim that disabled people are similarly disembodied, & constituted as waste, & that their passionate fight for dispassionate goals might be working against their demands for a <b>dignified</b> & inclusive <b>existence.</b> Finally, we make a plea to disability activists & feminists to make common cause in the struggle for an ethics of care that is founded upon embodied interdependence...|$|R
40|$|Dying is {{not only}} a highly {{personal}} topic, but we cannot forget that it is also a social theme, because people who are near death are always affected not only by other people but by society as well. Social workers and those in services that help the dying to live a meaningful, <b>dignified,</b> and painless <b>existence</b> in the interim must make a number of decisions, many of which being uneasy or uncomfortable, even in some cases where they have no clear solution. It is these problematic cases that these workers meet in their daily life. This thesis is therefore focused on the dilemmas faced by social workers that work with the dying. The theoretical part introduces problems of social work {{in the context of the}} dying. In order to understand a particular context, it must be something about the problems of dying to know why their work occasionally works as terms like dying, death and palliative care. As a crucial part of the work is the problem of dilemmas, where I come from Musil (2004) concept of everyday dilemmas. The theoretical part is devoted only dilemmas that research has not been proven. Other dilemmas are more specified in the empirical part. In the empirical part, I am setting one main goal, in which I try to find out what some of the dilemmas are that the staff working in social services with the dying people experience (such as in hospices, nursing homes, and retirement homes) and how to solve those dilemmas. To that end, I set two main research questions and six sub-research questions. To collect my data I chose the qualitative research method of questioning through semi-structured interviews. For the research sample, I chose the method of random selection. The research had to meet a set of predetermined criteria. For my data processing research, I chose the method of case studies. The research occurred in phases, where the first stage was partial, and then subsequently I conducted my own research. My goal in this work was to identify the problems experienced by people who provide social services to the dying, and how these are solved. The results have shown that they are indeed faced with many challenges. The research revealed nine such examples, while some individual workers had repeated instances. Further research showed that workers in most cases solve dilemmas as best as their knowledge and conscience permit. Accumulated experience is probably the most valuable asset in dealing with such situations, and the majority of respondents considered it important to discuss the issues faced by a multidisciplinary team. I believe that my work goals were met successfully and the research questions provided answers. My work could serve as a basis for a conference or for a technical article dealing with these issues in more detail...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades a broad-based {{advocacy}} movement has coalesced around the proposal that all members of society should be guaranteed an unconditional basic income (BI) sufficient to support a modest but <b>dignified</b> <b>existence.</b> Grounded on a loss of faith in the ability of market societies to provide decent paid employment for everyone who needs it, BI advocates promote the BI idea as a more direct and environmentally friendly way of eradicating poverty and a more equitable and liberating way of ensuring everyone’s right to pursue personally rewarding work. In this paper I argue that BI advocates have been too ready to reject the conventional definition of the right to work, too willing to embrace the assumption that it cannot be secured by reasonable means, and too quick to conclude that a BI guarantee would provide an adequate substitute for it. I do not, however, reject the BI idea. Rather than viewing it as a substitute for securing the right to work, I argue that it should be seen as a foundation for policies designed to secure what I refer to as the right to income support.

40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDPoverty and {{inequality}} are deeply entrenched in Kenya, {{with the country}} {{being one of the}} mostunequal countries in the world. To eradicate poverty {{and inequality}}, enhance the achievement ofsocial justice, fast-track human development, as well as to entrench participatory democracy and a culture of justification in governance, Kenya has, for the first time, entrenched justiciable socio-economic rights (SERs) in its 2010 Constitution. In this thesis, I undertake a criticalanalysis of the prospects for the implementation and enforcement of the entrenched SERs as well as the probable challenges that Kenya may face in their realisation. In this endeavour, the thesis develops a theoretical and interpretive approach for the realisation of these entrenched SERs. It entails an expansive analysis of the nature, scope, content and extent of the SERs entrenched in the 2010 Kenyan Constitution, and especially the place of international human rights obligations contained in customs and ratified international human rights treaties due to the provisions of the 2010 Constitution which espouse the direct application of international law in Kenya’s domestic legal system. It is submitted in this thesis that in order to improve the socio-economic conditions of the poor, vulnerable and marginalised groups in Kenya, {{there is a need for}} their socio-economic as well as political empowerment to enable them to effectively take part in societal decision-making in both the public and private spheres with regard to resource (re) distribution. The theory of dialogical constitutionalism, based on the constitutionally entrenched principle of popular participation in governance and public decision-making, is aimed at the realisation of both political and socio-economic empowerment of these groups. Even though the theory of dialogical constitutionalism underscores the importance of litigation in the achievement of the transformative aspirations of the 2010 Kenyan Constitution contained in the entrenched SERs, it acknowledges that litigation is not the panacea of SER enforcement, and that other political and advocacy strategies play an important role in the emancipation of the socio-economically deprived groups in society. The thesis thus advocates a multi-pronged strategy which espouses the equal participation of all sectors of society in a collaborative and cooperative deliberative effort aimed at the full realisation of the entrenched SERs. To accompany the above theoretical framework for the interpretation and implementation of the entrenched SERs, the thesis further proposes a transformative and integrated approach which combines the progressive aspects of the minimum core approach and the reasonableness approach. This is an approach of purposive interpretion which, in the first instance, envisages the courts undertaking a strict and searching scrutiny of the SER implementation framework developed by the political institutions of the State to ensure that sufficient provision has been made for the basic necessities of the most poor and vulnerable groups in society, basically the espousal of a minimum core content approach. The approach entails the requirement that should the SER implementation framework fail to provide this basic minimum to vulnerable groups, and the political institutions do not provide a substantive justification as to the failure, then the courts should find the relevant SER implementation framework per se unreasonable and thus invalid. However, should the implementation framework provide sufficiently for the basic essentials for vulnerable groups, the courts should then proceed to review it using the reasonableness standards that have been developed by the South African Constitutional Court. The rationale for this searching analysis is the acknowledgement that if the needs and interests of the most indigent and marginalised in society are not catered for, the entire corpus of rights in the Bill of Rights becomes redundant. The thesis then undertakes a case study of two rights, the right to food and the right to housing, using the theoretical and interpretive approaches developed in the previous chapters of the thesis. On food security, the thesis finds that Kenya is a food insecure country with a declining food production capacity. This is basically due to a lack of subsidy to farmers, global warming leading to intermittent rainfall, lack of investment in sustainable agriculture as well as a fragmented and contradictory legislative and policy agenda. In response to this situation, the thesis proposes the adoption of a livelihoods approach to food security in Kenya, based on the constitutionally entrenched right to food and other supporting rights. This approach advocates the enhancement of the food entitlements of the different sectors of the Kenyan society to ensure their access to adequate and nutritious food, be it through self-production or through the market. On the right to housing, the thesis finds that housing plays a crucial role in ensuring that people are able to have a holistic, <b>dignified</b> and valuable <b>existence.</b> However, Kenya faces a dire housing situation, with the majority of Kenyans, both in rural and urban areas lacking adequate shelter and sanitary conditions, evidenced by the large informal settlements in urban areas and the squatter phenomenon in rural areas. With the entrenchment of a justiciable right to adequate housing in the 2010 Constitution, the study finds that several legislative and policy reforms are underway to improve the housing situation, with efforts being made to draft the Landlord and Tenant Bill 2007, the Housing Bill 2011, the Evictions and resettlement Guidelines and the Evictions and Resettlement Procedures Bill, 2012, among others. The thesis proposes that these legal reforms must be undertaken within an environment of cooperative and collaborative strategic partnership involving all sectors of society so as to ensure that the housing concerns as well as interests of all are catered for...|$|R
40|$|Action, {{virtue and}} {{forgiveness}} {{in the political}} thought of Hannah Arendt This article explores the interrelated concepts of action, virtue and forgiveness in the political thought of Hannah Arend. For Arendt a truly ethical or virtuous life is one that displays strength of character and greatness or generosity of spirit (magnanimity). As such it is {{the exact opposite of}} resentment and meanness of spirit. Forgiveness, together with trustworthiness (the capacity to make and to keep promises), constitute for Arendt the highest “principles” of action. The capacities of promising and forgiving do not only impart stability and durability to our actions, but they give us, in the first place, the confidence to act at all. Cultivating the capacities of promising and forgiving can thus be viewed as the highest expression of (and the most fundamental precondition for) virtue. According to Arendt, nothing on earth can be more ethical or more virtuous than helping to create a situation in which it becomes possible for people to go on with their lives, to make a fresh start in all candidness without being constantly plagued by feelings of guilt and remorse. For Arendt revengefulness is the opposite of forgiveness. It represents the worst of all vices, mainly because it is purely reactive, unable to initiate anything new or creative. Hence, the basic concern for Arendt is to devise strategies towards overcoming resentment and revengefulness. These strategies are discussed in some detail, with particular attention to Arendt’s criticism of moral sentiments such as pity and compassion, as well as the egalitarian view of social justice. Arendt insists on the world-directedness of virtue and forgiveness. She takes it out of the narrowly circumscribed sphere of sentiments such as love, relating it rather to something like respect, which she describes as “a kind of ‘friendship’ without intimacy and without closeness. ” Arendt insists that in principle nobody should be excluded from participating in the public life of politics. But when persons indeed make their appearance in the public sphere, they are expected to demonstrate certain qualities, and quite rightly so. They are judged in terms of their trustworthiness, their personal integrity, their capacity for judgement, often their physical courage, as well as their commitment to matters of public concern (the res publica) and to excellence, “regardless not only of social status and administrative office but even of achievement and congratulation”. Thus, participating in politics necessarily has an “elitist” (i. e. “aristocratic” or self-perfectionist) dimension: Only those who exhibit exceptional qualities and a passion for public life should be “allowed” to appear in the public sphere. The demand that everybody must be allowed to participate, irrespective of their capabilities or commitment to the public interest, will eventually lead to the degeneration of political action and its corruption through extra-political issues and interests. These views of Arendt must nevertheless be seen together with her plea for the “right to have rights”, i. e. the right to belong to a political community where one can be seen and heard. This is the most basic, the most fundamental human right. It finds its purpose and legitimacy in itself, in the human condition of worldliness, natality and plurality. From an Arendtian perspective, a political community can only claim recognition and legitimacy if its members themselves respect the human conditions of natality and plurality. This, in turn, is what makes possible and sustains the public sphere, which is for Arendt the best guarantee for a <b>dignified,</b> genuinely human <b>existence,</b> fragile as it may be. Violating these conditions amounts for Arendt to a “law against humanity”. Genuine democracy requires a belief in equality and, where necessary, measures to maintain it. But this does not at all imply uniformity or homogenising of differences, which basically follows the logic of fabrication (social engineering). According to Arendt, this would lead to the destruction of the public sphere and genuine politics, leaving the door wide open for totalitarian rule or new forms of despotism. Hierdie artikel ondersoek die onderling verbandhoudende begrippe van handeling, deug en vergiffenis in die politieke denke van Hannah Arendt. Vir Arendt is ’n waarlik etiese of deugdelike lewe een wat gekenmerk word deur ’n sterk karakter en grootmoedigheid, gulhartigheid en ruimgeestigheid. As sodanig is dit die presiese teendeel van ressentiment, wraaksug en kleingeestigheid. Vergiffenis, tesame met betroubaarheid (die vermoë om beloftes te maak en te hou), maak vir Arendt die hoogste “beginsels” van handeling uit. Wanneer daaraan voldoen word, verleen dit nie alleen stabiliteit en duursaamheid aan ons handelinge nie, maar verskaf dit ook die nodige vrymoedigheid en vertroue om hoegenaamd te kan handel. Kultivering van die vermoë om beloftes te maak en te vergewe kan dus beskou word as die hoogste uitdrukking van (en die mees fundamentele voorwaarde vir) deugdelikheid. Niks op aarde kan volgens Arendt méér eties of méér deugsaam wees as om ’n situasie te help skep waarin dit vir mense moontlik word om met hulle lewens voort te gaan, d. w. s. in alle vrymoedigheid ’n nuwe begin te maak sonder om voortdurend gebukkend te gaan onder gevoelens van skuld en berou nie. Vir Arendt is wraaksugtigheid die teendeel van vergiffenis. Dit verteenwoordig die ergste ondeug, veral omdat dit suiwer reaktief is en nie in staat om enigiets nuuts of kreatief te inisieer nie. Daarom is dit vir Arendt so belangrik om strategieë te bedink om ressentiment en wraaksug te bowe te kom. Hierdie strategieë word taamlik breedvoerig bespreek, met besondere aandag aan Arendt se kritiek op morele sentimente soos jammerhartigheid en meegevoel, sowel as die egalitaristiese opvatting van sosiale geregtigheid.

In the matter of active women empowerment in the society the contribution of law deserves a special remark at national and international level. The pervasive inequalities existing in the societies are the basic gender issues that lead to deprivation of human rights for woman. Without human rights they can’t have security of life and liberty as well as a <b>dignified</b> <b>existence</b> and they neither can realize their full potential as human beings nor can function as full citizens, participating in all the processes that contribute towards the social progress of a country. Besides all the feminine legislations, international law and covenants and though judiciary has also played an active role with the spirit of judicial activism; still, the euphoria to justice for woman is seems to be a vague discourse without social transformation. Social transformation seeks for active participation of both the sex to move forward towards the ideal of woman empowerment and gender justice in their true sense. Therefore, in this paper various dimensions relating to women has been analyzed at the various stages and steps and also provided certain remedial or suggestive measures to improve the conditions of women which will ultimately lead to the betterment of the conditions of women in the society and then onl...|$|E

The Gülen movement provides a unique example of a faith-based civil society initiative. Islamic movements have often been perceived as being a reaction against democracy or modernity, and the Gülen Movement challenges such mainstream ideas about Islamic movements. The Turkish state has been controlling and nationalizing Islam {{under the rule of}} a Diyanet attempting to construct a state version of Islam to the extent ofcriminalizing popular Islamic actors and unofficial interpretations of Islam in the public sphere. Fethullah Gülen and the Gülen movement assert that the practice of tolerance and love is much needed in contemporary Turkey and promote respect for multi-ethnic and religious minorities. In this respect, the Gülen Movement seems to make a significant contribution to the democratization and modernization of Turkey, and because of the movement's influence and democratic activities, it has managed to escape the state's religious regulation. However, the Gülen movement's democratic activities have certain dubious characteristics that are not necessarily conducive to social inclusion. In particular, they presuppose the existing Turkish nation-state and Turkish Muslim historical legacy. In other words, they are in some ways complicit with the authoritative state ideology. However, in contemporary Turkey, various minority groups who have been denied a <b>dignified</b> <b>existence</b> and identity are now demanding equal rights and recognition. Therefore, a new framework of nation-state becomes a controversial matter. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore the democratic function of the Gülen community in the socio-political realm, and the movement's activities, which seem to paradoxically promote both tolerance and an exclusive ideology...|$|E

40|$|O artigo aborda o conceito de desenvolvimento como liberdade e suas implicações na ampliação da dignidade da vida humana, especialmente no que se refere às escolhas possíveis, a partir de dois economistas contemporâneos que, com dimensões distintas da linguagem, se complementam na interpretação do tema. Amartya Sen e Sebastião Salgado se debruçam sobre o mesmo contexto histórico, procurando apreender as muitas faces do desenvolvimento e suas repercussões na vida das pessoas. Conhecendo um pouco a trajetória de ambos, o desafio desse texto é compreender a complementaridade entre as palavras e as fotografias utilizadas pelos autores. Ao utilizarmos as imagens produzidas por Sebastião Salgado, estamos considerando-as como fontes históricas de abrangência multidisciplinar, que possibilitam novas abordagens de análise a partir de seus registros, assim como as palavras de Amartya Sen nos induzem a múltiplas reflexões. Os autores referidos retratam a saúde, a educação e a seguridade social como relações instrumentais fundamentais para a existência digna da humanidade. Entretanto, a provisão das mesmas não constitui um fim por si só; essa provisão só adquire um real sentido quando tem como meta a expansão das capacidades e das liberdades das pessoas que, assim, passam a exercer a condição de agentes de mudanças. Abstract The article {{approaches}} {{the concept of}} development as freedom and its implications in the expansion of human life dignity, especially when it refers to possible choices, based on the theories of two contemporary economists who, with different dimensions of language, agree on {{the interpretation of the}} subject. Amartya Sen and Sebastião Salgado study the same historical context, where they try to understand the many meanings of the development and its repercussions in people's life. Knowing a little about their academic life, the main goal of this paper understands the complementarity among words and pictures used by the authors. When we use the images produced by Sebastião Salgado, we have to consider them as historical sources of multidisciplinary abrangence, which enable new approaching analysis from its records, as well as, the many reflections induced by Amartya Sen's words. The referred authors describe health, education and social security as essential tools for a <b>dignified</b> <b>existence</b> of the humanity. However, this provision does not constitute an end by itself; it only acquires a real meaning when its goal is the expansion of the people´s capacities and freedom that, this way, start acting as agents of change. </div...|$|E
