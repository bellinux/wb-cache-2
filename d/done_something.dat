5|$|One {{person could}} say that 'Hero' is a schmaltzy piece of garbage, but another person can write to me a letter and say, 'I've {{considered}} committing suicide {{every day of my}} life for the last ten years until I heard that song, and I realized, after all, I can be my own hero,' and that, that's an unexplainable feeling, like I've <b>done</b> <b>something</b> with my life, you know? It meant something to someone.|$|E

Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have <b>done</b> <b>something</b> really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E

5|$|On June 20, Jaws opened across North America on 464 screens—409 in the United States, the {{remainder}} in Canada. The coupling of this broad distribution pattern with the movie's then even rarer national television marketing campaign yielded a release method virtually unheard-of at the time. (A month earlier, Columbia Pictures had <b>done</b> <b>something</b> similar with a Charles Bronson thriller, Breakout, though that film's prospects {{for an extended}} run were much slimmer.) Universal president Sid Sheinberg reasoned that nationwide marketing costs would be amortized at a more favorable rate per print relative to a slow, scaled release. Building on the film's success, the release was subsequently expanded on July 25 to nearly 700 theaters, and on August 15 to more than 950. Overseas distribution followed the same pattern, with intensive television campaigns and wide releases—in Great Britain, for instance, Jaws opened in December at more than 100 theaters.|$|E

25|$|Self-forgiveness {{happens in}} {{situations}} where an individual has <b>done</b> <b>something</b> that they perceive to be morally wrong and they consider themselves {{to be responsible for}} the wrongdoing. Self-forgiveness is the overcoming of negative emotions that the wrongdoer associates with the wrongful action. Negative emotions associated with wrongful action can include guilt, regret, remorse, blame, shame, self-hatred and/or self-contempt.|$|E

25|$|Baumeister {{and colleagues}} {{also note that}} volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of {{counterfactual}} thinking. This is worrying because counterfactual thinking ("If I had <b>done</b> <b>something</b> different...") {{is an important part}} of learning from one's choices, including those that harmed others. Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.|$|E
25|$|On 5 March 2011, Mayall {{appeared}} on Let's Dance for Comic Relief {{in which he}} came on stage and attacked Ade Edmondson with a frying pan during his performance of The Dying Swan ballet.

It would be the last time the duo performed together in public.|$|E
25|$|The {{plots and}} subplots of the episodes are {{established}} in an outline written by David, and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors (a technique known as retroscripting). As with Seinfeld, which David co-created, {{the subject matter}} in Curb Your Enthusiasm often involves the minutiae of American daily social life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, {{as well as his}} annoyance with other people's behavior. The character has a hard time letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he has <b>done</b> <b>something</b> morally terrible or disgusting.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{negative}} and constructive criticism have their appropriate uses, but {{often it is}} considered a requirement of criticism that they are combined. Thus, it is often considered that those who find fault with something should also offer an option for putting it right. More generally, any rule for behavior of any kind usually implies both [...] "do's" [...] and [...] "don't s". <b>Doing</b> <b>something</b> usually also implies not <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else, and, not <b>doing</b> <b>something,</b> often implies <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> else. There is therefore a conscious choice [...] "to do this, or do that", but not {{both at the same}} time.|$|R
5000|$|The Jonas Brothers {{have been}} strong {{supporters}} of <b>Do</b> <b>Something.</b> In 2007, the brothers filmed {{a public service}} announcement raising awareness about teenage homelessness and encouraging teens to begin [...] "jeans drives" [...] in their communities to donate to the homeless. In 2010, Nick further volunteered his efforts for <b>Do</b> <b>Something</b> by offering his time as a prize to teens who donated jeans to <b>Do</b> <b>Something</b> and Aeropostale's [...] "Teens for Jeans" [...] campaign.

25|$|In {{the later}} novels, the only crime {{which he can}} be seen to commit might be illegal entry, when he and Paul Drake are searching for evidence. And even then, he would expect to put up a strong and {{effective}} defense leading to an acquittal. Hamilton Burger is constantly under the impression that Mason has <b>done</b> <b>something</b> illegal, but is never able to prove it. Gardner prefaced many of his later novels with tributes to coroners and forensic pathologists whose work was instrumental to solving cases. Gardner inserts his ideas about the importance of proper autopsies into many of his Mason novels. In The Case of the Fugitive Nurse, for instance, close scrutiny of dental records in the identification of burned bodies is a key point. In that same story, the possible use of additives to track illegal resale of medical narcotics is examined.|$|E
25|$|The Binou sect uses totems: common {{ones for}} the entire village and {{individual}} ones for totem priests. A totem animal is worshiped on a Binou altar. Totems are, for example, the buffalo for Ogol-du-Haut and the panther for Ogol-du-Bas. Normally, no one is harmed by their totem animal, even {{if this is a}} crocodile, as it is for the village of Amani (where there is a large pool of crocodiles that do not harm villagers). However, a totem animal might exceptionally harm if one has <b>done</b> <b>something</b> wrong. A worshiper is not allowed to eat his totem. For example, an individual with a buffalo as totem is not allowed to eat buffalo meat, allowed to use leather from its skin, nor even to see a buffalo die. If this happens by accident, he has to organise a purification sacrifice at the Binou altar. Boiled millet is offered, and goats and chickens are sacrificed on a Binou altar. This colours the altar white and red. Binou altars look like little houses with a door. They are bigger when the altar is for an entire village. A village altar has also the 'cloud hook', that will catch clouds and make it rain.|$|E
