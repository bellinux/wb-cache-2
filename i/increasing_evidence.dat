There is evidence that HRT reduces tic severity, but there are methodological limitations in the studies, and a need for more trained specialists and better large-scale studies.|$|E
5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America are generally hypothesized to have migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though <b>increasing</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests an even earlier arrival. The Paleo-Indian archeological sites at Old Crow Flats and Bluefish Caves are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada. The characteristics of Canadian indigenous societies included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks. Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.|$|E
5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is <b>increasing</b> <b>evidence</b> of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E

5|$|The first {{inhabitants}} of North America migrated from Siberia {{by way of}} the Bering land bridge and arrived at least 15,000 years ago, though <b>increasing</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests an even earlier arrival. After crossing the land bridge, the first Americans moved southward, either along the Pacific coast or through an interior ice-free corridor between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets. The Clovis culture appeared around 11,000 BC, and it is considered to be an ancestor of most of the later indigenous cultures of the Americas. While the Clovis culture was thought, throughout the late 20th century, to represent the first human settlement of the Americas, in recent years consensus has changed in recognition of pre-Clovis cultures.|$|E

The autophagy machinery interfaces not only with most cellular stress-response pathways, but also entails direct interaction between autophagy proteins and immune signaling molecules [6]. The relationship between autophagy and inflammation is complex, both inductive and suppressive.|$|R

It is hard to establish with certainty which diseases jumped from other animals to humans, but there is <b>increasing</b> <b>evidence</b> from DNA and RNA sequencing, that measles, smallpox, influenza, HIV, and diphtheria came to humans this way.

25|$|According to some authorities, <b>increasing</b> <b>evidence</b> {{suggests}} that early skin-to-skin contact (also called kangaroo care) {{between mother and}} baby stimulates breastfeeding behavior in the baby. Newborns who are immediately placed on their mother’s skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of birth. Immediate skin-to-skin contact may provide a form of imprinting that makes subsequent feeding significantly easier. In addition to more successful breastfeeding and bonding, immediate skin-to-skin contact reduces crying and warms the baby.|$|E
