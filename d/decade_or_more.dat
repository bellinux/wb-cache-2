5|$|Sometime between Michaelmas 1178 and {{the start}} of 1179, Reginald retired from public life and became a monk at Lewes Priory, which had been founded by his family. When he retired, the Exchequer began to {{pressure}} him to repay his debts to the king, which for the previous <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> they had ignored. Reginald died in 1179, and his heir was his son William de Warenne. Besides his son, Reginald also had several daughters. One was Gundrada who married three times– first to Peter de Valognes, son of Roger de Valognes, second to William de Courcy, son of William de Courcy and Avice de Rumilly the daughter of William Meschin, and third to Geoffrey Hose, the son of Henry Hose. Another daughter was Alice who married Peter, constable of Mealton. A possible third daughter was Muriel, who was a nun at Carrow Abbey. Another possible daughter was Ela, who married Duncan the Earl of Fife. At his death, Reginald still owed {{a large portion of the}} fine levied against him for the inheritance of his father-in-law's estates.|$|E
5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>more</b> in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E

50|$|The {{position}} may {{be different}} {{in the case of}} long-range planning, since it may look decades ahead.

25|$|Ovarian cancer {{survival}} varies {{significantly with}} subtype. Dysgerminomas {{have a very}} favorable prognosis. In early stages, they have a five-year survival rate of 96.9%.

Stage-III dysgerminomas have a five-year survival of 61%; when treated with BEP chemotherapy after incomplete surgical removal, dysgerminomas have a 95% two-year survival rate. Sex-cord-stromal malignancies also have a favorable prognosis; because they are slow-growing, even those with metastatic disease can survive a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> Low malignant potential tumors usually only have a bad prognosis when there are invasive tumor implants found in the peritoneal cavity.|$|E

25|$|Rosé making has a {{long history}} in the Loire valley, {{particularly}} in the Anjou wine region around the town of Angers where two AOCs, Rosé d'Anjou and Cabernet d'Anjou exist. The former, made from the Groslot (Grolleau) grapes that are often harvested to very high yields around 50 hl/ha, tends to be lighter and often sweet. The latter, made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon, is often drier (though some styles can be sweet), with grapes that are limited to smaller harvests of no more than 40 hl/ha. Cabernet d'Anjou are usually noted for their high acidity levels that give these rosé the rather unusual capability of being able to age for a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 219,000 {{water rights}} claims in 85 sub-basins were filed before {{the close of}} the filing period in 1982.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the {{application}} of the " 2 % mie, " which predicts convergence in three <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> is overly pessimistic in the case of eastern Germany. First, it ignores discrete improvements in initial conditions related to the transition, which have been significant to date. Because labor productivity in manufacturing exhibits wide sectoral dispersion, structural change is likely to firther increase aggregate productivity. Second, convergence is also driven by physical and human capital mobility, which in contrast to labor mobility appears to be high in eastern Germany. Finally, an unusually high rate of physical investment in eastern Germany will accelerate convergence...|$|R

By employing the idea of induced technical change, and the skilled wage premium, this paper tries to link skilled immigration with observed rise in college enrolment, rise in skilled wages, and further acceleration of skilled wage premium. Through creation of demand for skill complimenting capital goods, skilled immigration raise the incentive for skill directed technical change which fuel up skilled wage in North, international wage differential, and the incentive for human capital formation. The results of the model are consistent with broad empirical regularities observed for three <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|The {{common law}} is more {{malleable}} than statutory law. First, common law courts are not absolutely bound by precedent, but can (when extraordinarily good reason is shown) reinterpret and revise the law, without legislative intervention, {{to adapt to}} new trends in political, legal and social philosophy. Second, the common law evolves {{through a series of}} gradual steps, that gradually works out all the details, so that over a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> the law can change substantially but without a sharp break, thereby reducing disruptive effects. In contrast to common law incrementalism, the legislative process is very difficult to get started, as legislatures tend to delay action until a situation is totally intolerable. For these reasons, legislative changes tend to be large, jarring and disruptive (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, and sometimes with unintended consequences).|$|E
25|$|The {{decolonization}} of Africa {{started with}} Libya in 1951, although Liberia, South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia were already independent. Many countries {{followed in the}} 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the Year of Africa, which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including {{a large part of}} French West Africa. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> <b>more.</b> The last African countries to gain formal independence were Guinea-Bissau (1974), Mozambique (1975) and Angola (1975) from Portugal; Djibouti from France in 1977; Zimbabwe from the United Kingdom in 1980; and Namibia from South Africa in 1990.

40|$|In this paper, I study long-run {{population}} changes across U. S. metropolitan areas. First, I argue that changes {{over a long}} period of time in the geographic distribution of population can be informative about the so-called "resilience" of regions. Using the censuses of population from 1790 to 2010, I find that persistent declines, lasting two <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> <b>more,</b> are somewhat rare among metropolitan areas in U.

Incorporating data on historical factors, I find that metropolitan areas that have experienced extended periods of weak population growth tend to be smaller in population, less industrially diverse, and less educated. These historical correlations inform the construction of a regional resilience index...|$|R
