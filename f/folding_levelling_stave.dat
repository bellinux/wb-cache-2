40|$|Motivation: Currently, {{the most}} {{accurate}} fold recognition method is to perform profile-profile alignments and estimate the statistical significances of those alignments by calculating z-score or E-value. Although this scheme is reliable in recognizing relatively close homologs related at the family level, it has difficulty in finding the remote homologs that are related at the superfamily or <b>fold</b> <b>level.</b> Results: Here, we present an alternative way to estimate {{the significance of the}} alignments. The alignment between a query protein and a template of length n in the fold library is transformed into a feature vector of length n+ 1, which is then evaluated by support vector machine (SVM). The output from SVM is converted to a posterior probability that a query sequence is related to a template given SVM output. Results show that a new method shows significantly better performance than PSI-BLAST and profile-profile alignment with z-score scheme. While PSI-BLAST and z-score scheme detect 16 % and 20 % of superfamily-related proteins, respectively, at 90 % specificity, a new method detects 46 % of these proteins, resulting in more than two fold increase in sensitivity. More significantly, at the <b>fold</b> <b>level,</b> a new method can detect 14 % of remotely related proteins at 90 % specificity, remarkable result considering the fact that the other methods can detect almost none at the same level of specificity.

40|$|Background: Recognizing {{the correct}} {{structural}} fold among known template protein structures for a target protein (i. e. fold recognition) {{is essential for}} template-based protein structure modeling. Since the fold recognition problem {{can be defined as}} a binary classification problem of predicting whether or not the unknown fold of a target protein is similar to an already known template protein structure in a library, machine learning methods have been effectively applied to tackle this problem. In our work, we developed RF-Fold that uses random forest- {{one of the most powerful}} and scalable machine learning classification methods- to recognize protein folds. Results: RF-Fold consists of hundreds of decision trees that can be trained efficiently on very large datasets to make accurate predictions on a highly imbalanced dataset. We evaluated RF-Fold on the standard Lindahl’s benchmark dataset comprised of 976 × 975 target-template protein pairs through cross-validation.

40|$|Sequence-based protein {{homology}} detection {{has been}} extensively studied and so far the most sensitive method is based upon comparison of protein sequence profiles, which are derived from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of sequence homologs in a protein family. A sequence profile is usually represented as a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) or an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and accordingly PSSM-PSSM or HMM-HMM comparison is used for homolog detection. This paper presents a new homology detection method MRFalign, consisting of three key components: 1) a Markov Random Fields (MRF) representation of a protein family; 2) a scoring function measuring similarity of two MRFs; and 3) an efficient ADMM (Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers) algorithm aligning two MRFs. Compared to HMM that can only model very short-range residue correlation, MRFs can model long-range residue interaction pattern and thus, encode information for the global 3 D structure of a protein family. Consequently, MRF-MRF comparison for remote homology detection shall be much more sensitive than HMM-HMM or PSSM-PSSM comparison. Experiments confirm that MRFalign outperforms several popular HMM or PSSM-based methods {{in terms of both}} alignment accuracy and remote homology detection and that MRFalign works particularly well for mainly beta proteins. For example, tested on the benchmark SCOP 40 (8353 proteins) for homology detection, PSSM-PSSM and HMM-HMM succeed on 48 % and 52 % of proteins, respectively, at superfamily level, and on 15 % and 27 % of proteins, respectively, at <b>fold</b> <b>level.</b> In contrast, MRFalign succeeds on 57. 3 % and 42. 5 % of proteins at superfamily and <b>fold</b> <b>level,</b> respectively.

With the growing number of experimentally resolved protein structures, the focus shifted from sequences to structures. The area of structure similarity forms a big challenge since even no standard definition of optimal structure similarity exists in the field.

SProt’s features are based on spherical spatial neighborhood of amino acids where similarity can be well-defined.

Finally, indexing is applied making the search process by an order of magnitude faster.

40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{alignments}} are {{an essential}} tool for many bioinformatics analyses. While sequence alignments are accurate for proteins of high sequence similarity, they become unreliable {{as they approach}} the so-called 'twilight zone' where sequence similarity gets indistinguishable from random. For such distant pairs, structure alignment is of much better quality. Nevertheless, sequence alignment is the only choice {{in the majority of}} cases where structural data is not available. This situation demands development of methods that extend the applicability of accurate sequence alignment to distantly related proteins. Results We develop a sequence alignment method that combines the prediction of a structural profile based on the protein's sequence with the alignment of that profile using our recently published alignment tool SABERTOOTH. In particular, we predict the contact vector of protein structures using an artificial neural network based on position-specific scoring matrices generated by PSI-BLAST and align these predicted contact vectors. The resulting sequence alignments are assessed using two different tests: First, we assess the alignment quality by measuring the derived structural similarity for cases in which structures are available. In a second test, we quantify the ability of the significance score of the alignments to recognize structural and evolutionary relationships. As a benchmark we use a representative set of the SCOP (structural classification of proteins) database, with similarities ranging from closely related proteins at SCOP family level, to very distantly related proteins at SCOP <b>fold</b> <b>level.</b> Comparing these results with some prominent sequence alignment tools, we find that SABERTOOTH produces sequence alignments of better quality than those of Clustal W, T-Coffee, MUSCLE, and PSI-BLAST. HHpred, one of the most sophisticated and computationally expensive tools available, outperforms our alignment algorithm at family and superfamily levels, while the use of SABERTOOTH is advantageous for alignments at <b>fold</b> <b>level.</b> Our alignment scheme will profit from future improvements of structural profiles prediction. Conclusions We present the automatic sequence alignment tool SABERTOOTH that computes pairwise sequence alignments of very high quality.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies {{three classes}} of estimators for the asymptotic variance parameter of a stationary stochastic process. All estimators {{are based on}} the concept of data "re-use" and all transform the output process into functions of an approximate Brownian motion process. The first class of estimators consists folded standardized time series area and Cramér-von Mises (CvM) estimators. Detailed expressions are obtained for their expectation at <b>folding</b> <b>levels</b> 0 and 1; those expressions explain the puzzling increase in small-sample bias as the <b>folding</b> <b>level</b> increases. In addition, we use batching and linear combinations of estimators from different levels to produce estimators with significantly smaller variance. Finally, we obtain very accurate approximations of the limiting distributions of batched folded estimators. These approximations are used to compute confidence intervals for the mean and variance parameter of the underlying stochastic process. The second class [...] - folded overlapping area estimators [...] - are computed by averaging folded versions of the standardized time series corresponding to overlapping batches. We establish the limiting distributions of the proposed estimators as the sample size tends to infinity. We obtain statistical properties of these estimators such as bias and variance. Further, we find approximate confidence intervals for the mean and variance parameter of the process by approximating the theoretical distributions of the proposed estimators. In addition, we develop algorithms to compute these estimators with only order-of-sample-size work. The third class [...] - reflected area and CvM estimators [...] - are computed from reflections of the original sample path. We obtain the expected values and variance of individual estimators. We show {{that it is possible to}} obtain linear combinations of reflected estimators with smaller variance than the variance of each constituent estimator, often at no cost in bias. A quadratic optimization problem is solved to find an optimal linear combination of estimators that minimizes the variance of the linearly combined estimator. For all classes of estimators, we provide Monte Carlo examples to show that the estimators perform as well in practice as advertised by the theory. Ph. D.

Among various {{efforts to improve the}} database of Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP), automation has received particular attention. Herein, we predict the deepest SCOP structural level that an unclassified protein shares with classified proteins with an equal number of secondary structure elements (SSEs). Results We compute a coefficient of dissimilarity (Ω) between proteins, based on structural and sequence-based descriptors characterising the respective constituent SSEs. For a set of 1, 661 pairs of proteins with sequence identity up to 35 %, the performance of Ω in predicting shared Class, <b>Fold</b> and Super-family <b>levels</b> is comparable to that of DaliLite Z score and shows a greater than four-fold increase in the true positive rate (TPR) for proteins sharing the Family level. On a larger set of 600 domains representing 200 families, the performance of Z score improves in predicting a shared Family, but still only achieves about half of the TPR of Ω. The TPR for structures sharing a Super-family is lower than in the first dataset, but Ω performs slightly better than Z score. Overall, the sensitivity of Ω in predicting common <b>Fold</b> <b>level</b> is higher than that of the DaliLite Z score. Conclusion Classification to a deeper level in the hierarchy is specific and difficult. So the efficiency of Ω may be attractive to the curators and the end-users of SCOP.

It is believed that the dynamical folding of a protein to its native conformation is determined by the amino acid sequence of the protein. Given the usefulness of known protein structures in such valuable tasks as rational drug design, protein structure prediction is a highly active field of research in bioinformatics [2, 8]. During recent decades various methods have been developed along the following two main lines [2]. The first line of methods, called homology modeling, rely on assembling structures of proteins using structural fragments of similar sequences available in sources such as PDB [3]. The second line of methods, called ab initio methods, predict the structure from sequence alone, without relying on similarity at the <b>fold</b> <b>level</b> between the modeled sequence and any of the known structures. The folding of any particular protein is an extremely complex process; and simulation of the folding of even a small protein remains an insurmountable challenge to state-of-the-art computers. Many ab initio methods adopt reduced models [16] such as lattice models which alleviate the complexity of the process because of the reduced number of degrees of freedom. Reduced models canno...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic ductal tumors invade local {{parenchyma}} and metastasize {{to distant}} organs. Src-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling pathways promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) metastasis, though the molecular mechanisms supporting this invasive process are poorly understood and represent important and novel therapeutic targets. The large GTPase Dynamin 2 (Dyn 2), a Src-kinase substrate, regulates membrane-cytoskeletal dynamics {{although it is}} yet to be defined if this mechanoenzyme contributes to tumor cell migration and invasion. Therefore the goal {{of this study was to}} test if Dyn 2 is upregulated in human pancreatic tumors and to define its role in cell migration and metastatic invasion using in vitro assays and nude mouse models. Histological analysis showed that 81 % of the 85 patients tested had elevated Dyn 2 in PDAC tissue. To test if Dyn 2 overexpression alters metastatic properties of human pancreatic tumor cells, stable clones of BxPC- 3 cells overexpressing either wild-type Dyn 2 or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant Dyn 2 Y(231 / 597) F known to attenuate Dyn 2 function, were generated and analyzed for migratory capacity. Importantly, tumor cells expressing 2 - 3 <b>fold</b> <b>levels</b> of Dyn 2 protruded lamellipodia at twice the rate, migrated faster (180 %) and farther (2. 5 -fold greater net distance) o...|$|R
