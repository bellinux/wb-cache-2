30|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the <b>joint</b> <b>user</b> {{association}} and cache content placement problem in cache-enabled HetNets. By introducing a utility function {{defined as a}} weighted sum of user download delay and the caching cost, the <b>joint</b> <b>user</b> association and content placement problem is formulated as a utility function optimization problem which is transformed equivalently into three convex subproblems by applying McCormick envelopes and Lagrange partial relaxation. We then propose an iterative algorithm which compute the Lagrange multipliers and the optimal solution of the subproblems iteratively. Numerical results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithm.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Twitter {{introduced}} <b>user</b> <b>lists</b> in late 2009, allowing {{users to}} be grouped according to meaningful topics or themes. Lists {{have since been}} adopted by media outlets {{as a means of}} organising content around news stories. Thus the curation of these lists is important – they should contain the key information gatekeepers and present a balanced per-spective on a story. Here we address this list curation process from a recommender systems perspective. We propose a variety of criteria for generating <b>user</b> <b>list</b> recommendations, based on content analysis, network analysis, and the “crowdsourcing ” of existing <b>user</b> <b>lists.</b> We demonstrate that these types of criteria are often only successful for datasets with certain characteristics. To resolve this issue, we propose the aggregation of these different “views ” of a news story on Twitter to produce more accurate user recommendations to support the curation process. ...|$|R

User association based only on signal to interference noise ratio in such dense networks can limit the user and network throughput by associating to a heavily loaded tier of cell. We propose a <b>joint</b> <b>user</b> association and rate control scheme in which user is associated to a cell tier depending on the highest achievable data rate thus maximizing the user throughput while maintaining fairness among the users. We formulate the problem as a <b>joint</b> <b>user</b> association and rate control optimization problem but decompose the original problem and solve it using gradient method. Simulation results reveal the convergence of our proposal and proportional fairness among the users. I...|$|R
