40|$|The archaeological {{investigations}} at the Getae fortified {{settlement of}} Horodca Mică revealed some {{materials from the}} medieval period. In {{the central part of}} its internal space a one-room dwelling with the floor deepened into the ground was found, characterized by two phases of habitat. At the first stage it was warmed by a clay oven located {{in the middle of the}} east wall, and at the second - by a rounded open hearth located in the central part of the room. In the filling and on the floor of the house, besides rather interesting collection of ceramics, there were found the following objects: an iron knife, an sub-rectangular iron buckle, a leaf-shaped arrowhead and a fragment of a whetstone with <b>hanging</b> <b>hole.</b> On the floor of the house there was also found a medieval coin issued by Moldavian Prince Iliaş (1432 - 1443), which was attributed to type V and dated approximately from 1442. The discovery of the coin makes possible dating the dwelling with the first half of 15 th century. Further investigation of the internal space of the Getae fortified settlement will show whether it was an isolated dwelling or it was part of the medieval settlement arranged on the place of an ancient fortress by virtue of the military-political circumstances. ...|$|E
50|$|Bags {{are also}} made with {{carrying}} handles, <b>hanging</b> <b>holes,</b> tape attachments, or security features. Some bags have provisions for easy and controlled opening. Reclosable features, including press-to-seal zipper strips, are common for kitchen bags bought empty {{and for some}} foods. Some bags are sealed for tamper-evident capability, including some where the press-to-reseal feature becomes accessible only when a perforated outer seal is torn away.|$|R
50|$|An {{uncommon}} {{version of}} scoring {{also includes a}} 2-point option. A bag is worth 2 points if {{it is on the}} board and <b>hanging</b> over the <b>hole,</b> but has not fallen through the hole.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{painting}} depicting the front courtyard, priests' and old tombs of the Mission San Gabriel, 1888. The tall adobe complex of the mission is pictured in the background, its bells visible <b>hanging</b> from <b>holes</b> in the central wall from which long, roofed buildings extending to either side. A smaller adobe building stands in the left foreground behind a leafless tree, while two rectangular tombs are pictured at center. A second tree {{can be seen to}} the right...|$|R
50|$|Made in 1890 in Berlin, Germany, by Rudolf Stirn, the Wonder Panoramic Camera {{needed the}} {{photographer}} for its motive power. A string, {{inside of the}} camera, <b>hanging</b> through a <b>hole</b> in the tripod screw, wound around a pulley inside the wooden box camera. To take a panoramic photo, the photographer swiveled the metal cap away from the lens to start the exposure. The rotation could be set for a full 360-degree view, producing an eighteen-inch-long negative.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} {{figure of}} the young workman is shovelling soil from a platform <b>hanging</b> in a <b>hole</b> onto a large pile behind him. Beneath him in the underground shaft another workman is digging the soil and shovelling it onto the platform. He is only visible {{in the form of}} a hand and a shovel appearing from the hole. To his right an older navvy is seen shovelling unsifted lime into a sieve. The fine powder accumulates in a pile on the left.|$|R
50|$|An ancient wild-olive tree also {{gained a}} talismanic {{character}} at Megara, according to Theophrastus, who noted how {{the wood of}} a tree overgrows and buries within its wood a stone placed in a hole made in its trunk:This happened with the wild-olive in the market-place at Megara; there was an oracle that, if this were cut open, the city would be taken and plundered, which came to pass when Demetrius took it. For when this tree was split open, there were found greaves and certain other things of Attic workmanship <b>hanging</b> there, the <b>hole</b> in the tree having been made {{at the place where}} the things were originally hung on it as offerings. Of this tree a small part still exists.|$|R
5000|$|The THX {{certification}} of Screen 1 was reinstated in 2006, {{with the sound}} system completely replaced, using 5 JBL 4632 Custom ScreenArray screen speakers, each with dual 18" [...] drivers, and 16 18" [...] JBL 4645C subwoofers, all flush with a baffle wall; a rear array comprising 42 JBL 8340A surround speakers, dbx DriveRack 4800 digital active crossovers, and 56 kW of Crown CTs series amplification; the screen was also replaced by one 4 m wider, measuring 18.2 x 7.68 m. In May 2009, Screen 1 was fitted with the UK's first Dolby 3D large screen system, which used a Barco digital cinema twin-projector. The UK's first public Dolby Atmos sound system was installed in Screen 1 in July 2012, which provides up to 128 discrete sound tracks and up to 64 unique speaker feeds; new ceiling speakers were installed, <b>hanging</b> down through <b>holes</b> in the ceiling, but covered over with grey fabric, and additional side wall speakers were installed towards the front.|$|R
500|$|Spielberg {{devised the}} three trials that guard the Grail. For the first, the blades under which Indiana ducks like a {{penitent}} man were {{a mix of}} practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM. For the second trial, in which Indiana spells [...] "Iehova" [...] on stable stepping stones, {{it was intended to}} have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on [...] "J". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman <b>hanging</b> through a <b>hole</b> that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by forced perspective, was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than building a full-size set. A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the [...] by [...] model because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the shaft of light from the entrance.|$|R
40|$|Deodorization and {{volatile}} organic compound abatement from polluted air streams can be accomplished with the biological plate tower (BPT), which {{has proved to be}} a reliable alternative to biofilters and biotrickling filters. Unlike those, the BPT is a non-clogging device, with constant active surface, and steady performance, making it ideal for scale-up and modelling. The initial BPT design needed improvement for better performance. The cylindrical body (circular plates) was replaced by a rectangular cuboid (rectangular plates). Holes in the plates did augment the amount of active biomass (<b>hanging</b> from the <b>holes</b> and under the plates), without reducing the transfer of toluene from the gaseous to the liquid phase. The diminished distance between plates was well tolerated in cocurrent flow, allowing much higher quantities of biomass in the same reactor volume. With 18 and 14 mm spacing between adjacent plates, the BPT, with and without holes, was tested for flooding, holdup and pressure drop. Several gas and liquid flows were tested, both in co-current and countercurrent. In hydrodynamic terms, the BPT-HB with co-current flow was clearly the best option. Higher stability with higher flow rates, and lower pressure drops were observed. The inoculum was obtained from wastewater plant activated sludge (petrochemical industry) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{integrated}} geophysical and geological {{methods to}} evalute the structural {{evolution of the}} active Teton normal fault, Wyoming, {{and its role in}} the development of the dramatic topography of Teton Range and Jackson Hole. Comparison of variations in surface offsets with the topographic expression of the Teton range crest and drainage divide, and the overall structure of the range, suggests that the effects ofpostglacial faulting cannot be discriminated from the influence of pre-extensional structures and differential; erosion on the footwall topography. In contrast, the effects of multiple scarp-forming normal faulting earthquakes are expressed by the anomalous drainage pattern and westward tilt of the <b>hanging</b> wall, Jackson <b>Hole,</b> toward the Teton fault. Kinematic boundary element fault models suggest that the westward tilt of the valley floor is the product of 110 - 125 m of displacement on a 45 deg- 75 deg E dipping Teton fault in the past 25, 000 - 75, 000 years. Comparisons with historic normal faulting earthquake displacements imply that this range of displacement corresponds to 10 - 50, M greater than 7 scarp-forming earthquakes. A total throw of 2. 5 to 3. 5 km across the Teton fault is suggested by inverse ray-tracing and forward gravity models. These models also suggest that Laramide age structures have been offset across the Teton fault and obscure its geophysical signature but also continue to influence the structural and topographic expression of the footwall and hanging wall blocks. Paleomagnetic analyses of the approximately 2. 0 Ma Huckelberry Ridge Tuff suggest that the overall westward tilt of the Teton Range is a result ofabout 10 deg of west side down tilt across the Teton fault since tuff emplacement. This suggests that much if not all of the throw across the Teton fault has accumulated in the past 2 m. y. Complex demagnetization and rock magnetic behavior and local emplacement of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff on preexisting topogrpahy preclude determination of the amount or variations in throw along strike of the Teton fault from the paleomagnetic data...|$|R
5000|$|Downhill {{longboarding}} involves riding down hills as fast {{as possible}} and keeping the board under control. Speeds in excess of 80 mph have been obtained. These boards are usually 95 - 110 cm (35 - 44 inches) long, featuring wheel bases from 28-35 inches, and very stiff to improve control at speed. [...] "Speed wobbles" [...] pose a problem for beginner downhill riders but intermediate and advanced users overcome this by learning to relax and control their muscles. Downhill decks usually fall into Six categories: topmount, micro drop, drop thru, drop deck, double drop and flush mount. Topmount boards provide the most traction, but tend to be less forgiving. Micro Drops lower the ride height slightly, which results in a great all around board. Drop thru decks consist of mounting the baseplates of the trucks on top of the board with the trucks <b>hanging</b> through a <b>hole.</b> Like micro drops these tend to be all around boards and were very popular 2009-2011. Drop Decks get the rider very close to the ground, providing an easy to push and drifty ride. Double Drop decks are a drop deck with drop thru truck mounts. These decks were fairly popular in the mid 2000s but have largely fallen out of favor due to their unresponsiveness. Flush mounts seek to lower the ride height by mounting the trucks in a recessed area on the board. This minimally lowers ride height but increases the chance for wheel bite (which is where the wheels rub against the board in a turn, usually resulting in a crash). The vast majority of downhill long boards are built from wood. The three most common woods used are Maple, Baltic Birch and Bamboo. Maple is less prone to fracturing during construction than Baltic Birch, and as such is used in almost all high end boards. Other materials used in long board construction are: 1) Carbon fiber with a foam, balsa or hollow core. 2) Aluminum, either pressed or milled. And 3) Carbon Nano Tubes, although this proved prone to failure and no current company is using this material.|$|R
