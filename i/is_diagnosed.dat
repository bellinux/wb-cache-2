5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed,</b> investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed</b> later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron emission tomography scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder in children and adolescents, the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed.</b> ADHD <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed</b> approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|Heart disease <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by {{the taking}} of a medical history, a cardiac examination, and further investigations, {{including}} blood tests, echocardiograms, ECGs and imaging. Other invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterisation can also play a role.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{national}} {{report of}} the First Nations Regional Health Study found that of respondents who attended residential schools {{were more likely than}} those who did not to have <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with at least one chronic medical condition.

50|$|It is {{estimated}} that only 15-20% of children with 47,XYY syndrome <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> within their lifetime. Of these, approximately 30% <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> prenatally.

5000|$|Stand Up to Cancer (shortened to S↑2C or SU2C) is {{a charity}} program {{designed}} {{to raise funds for}} cancer research. It was established by media, entertainment, and philanthropic leaders who <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with cancer. Their premise is to spread awareness that everyone is affected by cancer. They use the statistic “One out of two men, and one out of three women, will <b>be</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with cancer” to emphasize that cancer affects everyone, whether they <b>are</b> <b>diagnosed</b> or know someone who has <b>been</b> <b>diagnosed.</b>|$|R

5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number {{may be as}} high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be further complicated by concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. Weeks or months may go by before the injury <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed,</b> even though the injury is better known {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
5|$|Dyslexia is {{believed}} to be caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Some cases run in families. It often occurs in people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and is associated with similar difficulties with numbers. It may begin in adulthood {{as the result of a}} traumatic brain injury, stroke, or dementia. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia are problems within the brain's language processing. Dyslexia <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed</b> through a series of tests of memory, spelling, vision, and reading skills. Dyslexia is separate from reading difficulties caused by hearing or vision problems or by insufficient teaching.|$|E
5|$|HIV/AIDS <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed</b> via {{laboratory}} testing and then staged {{based on the}} presence of certain signs or symptoms. HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15years to 65years of age including all pregnant women. Additionally, testing is recommended for those at high risk, which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness. In many areas of the world, a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent.|$|E

5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} (HD) is {{a common}} genetic disease that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age. Hip dysplasia <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed</b> by X-rays, {{but it is not}} usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe HD, X-rays may not always indicate the disease. In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.|$|E

40|$|This {{study had}} been planned to see the histomorphological pattern of gastric mucosal biopsy, {{demonstrate}} the organism H. Pylori and correlate with endoscopic findings.

5|$|Schizophrenia <b>is</b> <b>diagnosed</b> {{based on}} {{criteria}} {{in either the}} American Psychiatric Association's (APA) fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5), or the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a mental health professional. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity and level of impairment, before a diagnosis is made. As of 2013 there is no objective test.|$|E

Consequently, 7 of the 67 cases <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with FS-DFSP, and the remaining 60 cases <b>were</b> <b>diagnosed</b> with O-DFSP with resected specimen.|$|R
