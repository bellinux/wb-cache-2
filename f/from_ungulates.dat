5000|$|The leading {{ungulate}} prey for brown bears {{is normally}} deer. Up {{to a dozen}} species have been eaten by brown bears but the main prey species are the larger species they encounter: elk (Cervus canadensis), moose (Alces alces) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Larger deer are preferred {{because they tend to}} be less agile and swift than small or medium-sized deer (although a caribou can handily outpace a grizzly bear in the open), they are found in large quantities in several areas inhabited by brown bears and provide a larger meal per carcass. Moose may be preferred where found in large numbers because of their solitary habits and tendency to dwell in wooded areas, both of which makes them easier to ambush. Despite its diminished reputation as a predator, the brown bear is the most dangerous solitary predator of moose, with only packs of wolves a more regular predator; even Siberian tigers take other prey, primarily (elk and boar), in areas where they co-exist with the giant deer. Brown bears normally avoid the potential risks of hunting large deer, which can potentially fight back but usually escape bears by running, by picking out young calves or sickly adults from deer herds. In northeastern Norway, it was found that moose were the most important single food item (present in up to 45% of scats and locally comprising more than 70% of the bear's dietary energy) for local brown bears and several local bears appear to be specialized moose hunters, most often picking off sickly yearling moose and pregnant but healthy cows. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears who derived much of their food energy <b>from</b> <b>ungulates</b> were studied, and 30% of the ungulates consumed were through predation, the remaining amount from scavenging of carcasses. Elk, bison and moose (the three largest native ungulates in the region) each constituted nearly a quarter of the overall ungulate diet. 13% of the total of ungulates actively hunted and killed per that study in Yellowstone were elk calves, while 8% of the actively and successfully hunted prey there were adult cow elk. Despite their lack of preference for smaller deer, other species including red deer (Cervus elaphus), sika deer (Cervus nippon [...] ), axis deer (Axis axis), European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), Siberian roe deer (Capreolus pygargus), fallow deer (Dama dama), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) have turned up in their diet.|$|E

The purpose of this proposal is to suggest that with NEON’s help, we will examine the rich agricultural setting of the San Joaquin Valley and how methane production <b>from</b> <b>ungulates</b> relates to the South Central Valley Smog phenomenon. This information will be collected in order to share it with the public. This will allow the public to make more informed decisions {{in order to reduce the}} impact that human-caused climate change is having on the planet.

These observational studies are projected to last several decades. Collectively, it is our hope to bring awareness to the public, decision-makers, and industry of the harmful effects of climate change and pollution that promotes South Central Valley Smog. Dairy farms in the San Joaquin Valley have been transformed from small family-run operations to an industry that has become the leading source of methane emissions in the region. Smog forms from a chemical reaction between volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} ungulates on epigeal arthropod communities in two common plant communities of the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada (southeast Spain). We have compared the abundance, biomass, diversity and specific composition of arthropod communities in grazed and ungrazed plots experimentally excluded <b>from</b> <b>ungulates.</b> In general, we found that arthropods were more abundant and diverse in grazed than in ungrazed plots. However, the effect of ungulates depended on the variable considered (diversity versus abundance versus biomass). Moreover, ungulates also affected species composition. This means that without affecting diversity, ungulates can still have a strong effect on arthropod communities by changing species composition. Also, the relationship between ungulates and arthropods differed depending on the year of study and the sampling period. In conclusion, our study indicates that to extrapolate the results obtained {{for a group of}} insects, a habitat or a sampling period is not appropriate for the conservation of arthropod communities...|$|E
40|$|Astroviruses {{are known}} to infect humans and {{a wide range of}} animal species, and can cause {{gastroenteritis}} in their hosts. Recent studies have reported astroviruses in bats in Europe and in several locations in China. We sampled 1876 bats from 17 genera at 45 sites from 14 and 13 provinces in Cambodia and Lao PDR respectively, and tested them for astroviruses. Our study revealed a high diversity of astroviruses among various Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera bats. Evidence for varying degrees of host restriction for astroviruses in bats was found. Furthermore, additional Pteropodid hosts were detected. The astroviruses formed distinct phylogenetic clusters within the genus Mamastrovirus, most closely related to other known bat astroviruses. The astrovirus sequences were found to be highly saturated indicating that phylogenetic relationships should be interpreted carefully. An astrovirus clustering in a group with other viruses from diverse hosts, including <b>from</b> <b>ungulates</b> and porcupines, was found in a Rousettus bat. These findings suggest that diverse astroviruses can be found in many species of mammals, including bats. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

It is proposed that these putative SINEs are not 'generic' SINEs but mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs).

40|$|SummaryCountershading {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{proposed}} mechanisms of camouflage [1, 2]. A dark dorsum and light ventrum counteract the gradient created by illumination from above, obliterating cues to 3 D shape [3 – 6]. Because the optimal countershading varies strongly with light environment [7 – 9], pigmentation patterns give clues to an animal’s habitat. Indeed, comparative evidence <b>from</b> <b>ungulates</b> [9] shows that interspecific variation in countershading matches predictions: in open habitats, where direct overhead sunshine dominates, a sharp dark-light color transition high up the body is evident; in closed habitats (e. g., under forest canopy), diffuse illumination dominates and a smoother dorsoventral gradation is found. We can apply this approach to extinct animals in which the preservation of fossil melanin allows reconstruction of coloration [10 – 15]. Here we present a study of an exceptionally well-preserved specimen of Psittacosaurus sp. from the Chinese Jehol biota [16, 17]. This Psittacosaurus was countershaded [16] with a light underbelly and tail, whereas the chest was more pigmented. Other patterns resemble disruptive camouflage, whereas the chin and jugal bosses on the face appear dark. We projected the color patterns onto an anatomically accurate life-size model in order to assess their function experimentally. The patterns are compared to the predicted optimal countershading from the measured radiance patterns generated on an identical uniform gray model in direct versus diffuse illumination. These studies suggest that Psittacosaurus sp. inhabited a closed habitat such as a forest with a relatively dense canopy. Video Abstrac...|$|E
40|$|For {{reasons that}} are unclear the {{production}} of embryonic stem cells <b>from</b> <b>ungulates</b> has proved elusive. Here, we describe {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSC) derived from porcine fetal fibroblasts by lentiviral transduction of 4 human (h) genes, hOCT 4, hSOX 2, hKLF 4, and hc-MYC, the combination commonly used to create iPSC in mouse and human. Cells were cultured on irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and in medium supplemented with knockout serum replacement and FGF 2. Compact colonies of alkaline phosphatase-positive cells emerged after ≈ 22 days, providing an overall reprogramming efficiency of ≈ 0. 1 %. The cells expressed porcine OCT 4, NANOG, and SOX 2 and had high telomerase activity, but also continued to express the 4 human transgenes. Unlike human ESC, the porcine iPSC (piPSC) were positive for SSEA- 1, but negative for SSEA- 3 and - 4. Transcriptional profiling on Affymetrix (porcine) microarrays and real time RT-PCR supported the conclusion that reprogramming to pluripotency was complete. One cell line, ID 6, had a normal karyotype, a cell doubling time of ≈ 17 h, and has been maintained through > 220 doublings. The ID 6 line formed embryoid bodies, expressing genes representing all 3 germ layers when cultured under differentiating conditions, and teratomas containing tissues of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm origin in nude mice. We conclude that porcine somatic cells can be reprogrammed to form piPSC. Such cell lines derived from individual animals could provide a means for testing the safety and efficacy of stem cell-derived tissue grafts when returned to the same pigs at a later age...|$|E

40|$|Plant–animal {{interactions}} imply {{costs and}} benefits with net balance depending on interacting species and ecological context. Ungulates, in particular, confer costs (e. g., plant leaf consumption, flower bud predation) and benefits (e. g., plant overcompensation, seed dispersal) to plants. Magnitude of {{costs and benefits}} may be altered by habitat management or ecological conditions favoring high density ungulate populations. Little is known however on whether plant costs or benefits predominate over the years, or the long-term outcomes of plant-animal interactions in habitat types sustaining high density ungulate populations. We investigated how high density ungulate populations alter plant costs and benefits by quantifying ungulate long-term effects on the shrub Cistus ladanifer (Cistaceae) individual size, seed weight and number, seed bank, and population density, through a 12 -year ungulate exclusion experiment in a Mediterranean scrubland. We monitored plant size and flower buds in plants exposed or protected <b>from</b> <b>ungulates</b> and number of developed capsules and seeds consumed (potential seed dispersal) by ungulates during three reproductive seasons. We found that ungulates negatively affected shrub size {{and led to a}} dramatically decline of shrub reproductive structures and seed production, affecting the plant reproductive cycle.

The genus Simonsiella is morphologically {{distinct from the}} genus Alysiella by its convex (dorsal) - concave(ventral) differentiation. The incidence of these bacteria in the oral cavity of domesticated ungulates was established in surveys of 88 horses, 9 sheep, 12 cows, and 22 goats. Simonsiella was detected microscopically in oral swabbings of 34 % of the horses, 50 % of the goats, and 16 % of the cows, whereas Alysiella was detected in 9 % of the horses, 95 % of the goats, and in 100 % of the sheep and cows. The characterization of Simonsiella and Alysiella from these ungulates was approached by isolating a represent. ative collection of axenic strains. Simonsiella strains were obtained from 8 horses (n= 35) and 1 go~t (n= 2). Alysiella strains were obtained from 11 goats (n=l 6), 3 sheep (n= 4), and 9 cows (n= 30). Isolation of Simonsiella from cows and of Alysiella from horses was unsuccessful. Phenotypically, the horse Simonsiella strains formed two clusters that differed from the type strains S. muelleri ICPB 3636 of human orgin, s. crassa ICPB 3651 of sheep origin, and S. steedae ICPB 3604 of dog origin. The discovery of oral bacteria with unquestionable simonsiella morphology growing anaerobically (GasPak Anaerobic System) and lacking catalase activity requires taxonomic reevaluation of the genus Simonsiella. The two strains from a goat shared traits with S. steedae. The Alysiella strains formed three clusters that differed from the type strain A [...] filiformis ICPB 3653 of sheep origin.

40|$|Trivers and Willard's {{suggestion}} that natural selection favors maternal control of offspring sex ratio {{in relation to}} maternal condition has been much debated. The theoretical plausibility of the idea, under some conditions, is firmly established, and there is strong empirical support for conditional sex allocation in some taxa. However, the extend to which this hypothesis {{can be applied to}} mammals, particularly ungulates, has been more controversial. We used meta-analysis to review published studies of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis within ungulates and to assess the overall level of empirical support for the hypothesis. Overall, data from 37 studies of 18 species suggested a weak but significant positive correlation between maternal condition and sex ratio (r = + 0. 09). However, average effect size differed markedly between different categories of studies. Studies using measures of maternal condition that were taken preconception and on the basis of behavioral dominance provided strong evidence for a relationship between maternal condition and the sex ratio (r= + 0. 17 - 0. 25). In contrast, studies that used morphological or physiological measures of condition that were measured postconception provided little or no evidence for a relationship between maternal condition and sex ratio (r= + 0. 05 - 0. 06). There are several reasons to suggest that data collected postconception and relying on morphological measures of condition are less likely to captuer variables that cause selection for biased sex allocation. In addition, we found that the relationship between sex ratio and maternal condition depended on life-history characteristics; relationships were stronger when sexual size dimorphism was more male biased and when gestation periods were longer. Overall, our analyses suggest that data <b>from</b> <b>ungulates</b> are consistent with the Trivers-Willard hypothesis but only when appropriate measures are used. Citation: Sheldon, B.

The geography and chronology of the occurrences of these subsistence phenomena may indicate expanding dietary breadth in Upper Paleolithic foragers. Evidence of bone grease rendering begins with the early Gravettian period at Vale Boi, based on the co-occurrence of abundant fire-cracked rock, stone anvils, and the systematic fragmentation spongy bone. Tests for density-mediated attrition in rabbits and ungulates indicate that the patterns of body part representation in the ungulate remains were not biased substantially by post-depositional processes. The onset of resource intensification and dietary expansion in the Algarve is in general agreement with patterns observed for the northern Mediterranean Rim.

40|$|Regeneration {{involving}} birch and Norway spruce is {{the most}} common mixture on clearcuts in southern Sweden. Sometimes the mixture is unintentional, and the naturally regenerated birch is often regarded as a weed-species in planted Norway spruce monocultures. In other cases, the additional seedlings from spontaneous natural regeneration are, perhaps, not planned for, but are still used, as a convenient way to create mixed forests with management for production and other services. The objectives of the research described in this thesis all refer to the establishment and early management of mixtures with planted Norway spruce and naturally regenerated birch. Hypotheses were tested in field experiments in the counties of Kronoberg and Halland. A better knowledge of seed supply, by estimating seed sources and seed dispersal, could be used when planning future stands and in the choice of management. The effect of soil scarification on seed emergence and seedling survival was tested in field experiments and modeled together with distance to seed supply. The combination of spatial information about standing volume and specific site variables produced birch regeneration estimates that could be useful for practical management and planning. Once the seedling population was established, after three to five years, the density, height structure and species composition were tested as variables for further selections in precommercial thinnings. The retained stems, 1000 - 3000 trees ha- 1, responded positively to a reduction in competition even when stand heights were as low as 1 - 2 meters. The size of neighbors was more important than the species for the individual growth of both birch and Norway spruce. The competition release in the early stand is important if the target is to retain a mixed forest throughout the full stand rotation, otherwise the retained birches will have difficulty competing with the planted Norway spruce in later stages of the rotation. Other common broadleaved species and pine regenerate on the same clearcuts but the current browsing pressure <b>from</b> <b>ungulates</b> reduces the possibility to allow these species to be present in the future stand...|$|E
