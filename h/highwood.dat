5|$|In 1826, Wilberforce {{moved from}} his large house in Kensington Gore to <b>Highwood</b> Hill, {{a more modest}} {{property}} in the countryside of Mill Hill, north of London, where he was soon joined by his son William and family. William had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and {{spend the rest of}} his life visiting family members and friends. He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1919, {{when the}} rest of the state highway system was first signed, M-61 ran between M-18 at Gladwin to M-30 at White Star. A decade later in 1929, M-61 was {{extended}} south to Winegars along M-30 and then northeasterly zig-zagging through <b>Highwood</b> and Bentley to Standish. This eastern extension was straightened in 1932, bypassing the route south through Winegars and Bentley to use a direct course between White Star and Standish. At the same time, a second, discontinuous section of M-61 was created when a section of the contemporary M-63 was redesignated M-61 between US131 at Tustin and M-115 near Marion. At the same time, additional county roads were upgraded to state highways, extending the western M-61 to US127 in Harrison. The gap between Harrison and Gladwin was eliminated in 1940 when the roadway was built between the two towns. At the end of the 1950s, M-61's designation was removed between M-115 and US131. The western end was realigned in 1974 to bypass Marion, shortening the route of M-61.|$|E

Even before the imposition of rationing of fuel and rubber made auto travel difficult, the North Shore saw its freight and passenger traffic rise to record levels, {{in part due to}} the railroad serving important military facilities: the Army's Fort Sheridan just north of <b>Highwood,</b> and the Navy's Great Lakes Naval Training Station, just south of North Chicago.

25|$|In 1891, Arthur, Clara, {{and their}} new son Edward Oliver Wheeler headed west to New Westminster, British Columbia where Wheeler went into private {{practice}} as a surveyor. His private surveying work was supplemented by work for the Department of the Interior, and he was joined in his surveying business by his younger brothers Hector and Willie. A real estate crash nearly wiped them out, and in 1894 he rejoined the Topographical Survey Branch of the Department of the Interior. Wheeler spent six years surveying the area south of Calgary, Alberta and in 1898 moved {{his wife and son}} to Calgary. During this period he surveyed the watersheds of the Elbow, Sheep, <b>Highwood,</b> Oldman, Belly, Waterton, Little Bow, St. Mary and Milk Rivers. In 1900, the Department of the Interior announced it was going to close its office in Calgary, so Wheeler spent the summer surveying the Crowsnest Pass area in Alberta, and in 1901 the Wheelers returned to Ottawa.|$|E

A Tracker from Melbourne located the disabled Dutch vessel Impala Princess in the Gulf of Aden on 25 May and directed a French destroyer to assist. Two Bofors naval guns were deposited by Melbourne at Souda Bay, Crete on 2 June, marking the first visit of an Australian warship to Crete since June 1941. These weapons were donated to the Australian War Memorial at Stavromenos, in Crete's Rethymno regional unit. The highlight of the deployment saw the three ships represent Australia and New Zealand at the Silver Jubilee Naval Review on 28 June 1977. A two-seat Harrier jump jet demonstrator undertook a series of trial takeoffs and landings aboard Melbourne on 30 June: a trial organised as part of the project overseeing the ship's potential replacement. Following the Jubilee Review and participation in Exercise <b>Highwood</b> in July, Melbourne and her escorts returned to Australia, arriving in Fremantle on 19 September and Sydney on 4 October.

[...] About 13,000 BCE, as the glacier retreated, Glacial Lake Great Falls emptied catastrophically in a glacial lake outburst flood. The current course of the Missouri River essentially marks the southern boundary of the Laurentide ice sheet. The Missouri, Yellowstone and Musselshell rivers flowed eastward around the glacial mass, eventually settling into their present courses.
