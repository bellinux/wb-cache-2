40|$|A {{technique}} for <b>designing</b> optimal <b>inputs</b> for aerodynamic parameter estimation was flight tested on the F- 18 High Angle of Attack Research Vehicle (HARV). Model parameter accuracies calculated from flight test data were compared {{on an equal}} basis for optimal <b>input</b> <b>designs</b> and conventional <b>inputs</b> at the same flight condition. In spite of errors in the a priori <b>input</b> <b>design</b> models and distortions of the input form by the feedback control system, the optimal inputs increased estimated parameter accuracies compared to conventional 3 - 2 - 1 - 1 and doublet inputs. In addition, the tests using optimal <b>input</b> <b>designs</b> demonstrated enhanced design flexibility, allowing the optimal <b>input</b> <b>design</b> technique to use a larger input amplitude to achieve further increases in estimated parameter accuracy without departing from the desired flight test condition.

40|$|The new AASHTO Mechanistic–Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) {{provides}} pavement {{analysis and}} performance predictions for various feasible design scenarios. The MEPDG performance predictions for the anticipated climatic and traffic conditions {{depends on the}} values of the input parameters that characterize the pavement materials, layers, design features, and condition. This paper focuses on comprehensive global sensitivity analyses of flexible pavement performance predictions to MEPDG <b>design</b> <b>inputs</b> under five climatic conditions and three traffic levels. <b>Design</b> <b>inputs</b> evaluated in the analyses include traffic volume, layer thicknesses, material properties, and groundwater depth. Correlations between <b>design</b> <b>inputs</b> were considered as appropriate. The global sensitivity analysis varied all inputs simultaneously across the problem domain for each of the 15 base cases (five climates and three traffic levels). Two response surface modeling approaches—multivariate linear regressions and artificial neural networks—were developed for modeling the analysis results for evaluation of MEPDG input sensitivities across the problem domain. The response surface modeling approaches based on artificial neural networks were particularly effective in providing robust and accurate representations of the complex relationships between MEPDG inputs and distress outputs. The design limit normalized sensitivity index adopted in the study provided a practical interpretation of sensitivity by relating a given percentage change in an MEPDG input to the corresponding percentage change in predicted distress relative to its design limit value.

Matte supervisor Chris Evans attempted to create paintings that felt less contrived and more real—while the natural instinct of filmmaking is to place important elements in an orderly fashion, Evans said that photographers would [...] "shoot things that [...] are odd in some way" [...] and end up with results that look natural instead. The task of establishing the location and atmosphere at Starfleet Headquarters fell to the matte department, who had to make it feel like a bustling futuristic version of San Francisco. The matte personnel and Ralph McQuarrie provided <b>design</b> <b>input.</b> The designers decided to make actors in the foreground more prominent, and filmed them on a large area of smooth concrete runway at the Oakland Airport.

2500|$|Steamers came late to {{the upper}} river, the section {{stretching}} from Yichang to Chongqing. Freshets from Himalayan snowmelt created treacherous seasonal currents. But [...] summer was better navigationally and the three gorges, described as an [...] "150-mile passage which is like the narrow throat of an hourglass", posed hazardous threats of crosscurrents, whirlpools and eddies, creating significant challenges to steamship efforts. Furthermore, Chongqing is 700 – 800 feet above sea level, requiring powerful engines to make the upriver climb. Junk travel accomplished the upriver feat by employing 70 - 80 trackers, men hitched to hawsers who physically pulled ships upriver {{through some of the}} most risky and deadly sections of the three gorges. Achibald John Little took an interest in Upper Yangtze navigation when in 1876, the Chefoo Convention opened Chongqing to consular residence but stipulated that foreign trade might only commence once steamships had succeeded in ascending the river to that point. Little formed the Upper Yangtze Steam Navigation Co., Ltd. and built Kuling but his attempts to take the vessel further upriver than Yichang were thwarted by the Chinese authorities who were concerned about the potential loss of transit duties, competition to their native junk trade and physical damage to their crafts caused by steamship wakes. [...] Kuling was sold to China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for lower river service. [...] In 1890, the Chinese government agreed to open Chongqing to foreign trade {{as long as it was}} restricted to native crafts. [...] In 1895, the Treaty of Shimonoseki provided a provision which opened Chongqing fully to foreign trade. [...] Little took up residence in Chongqing and built Leechuan, to tackle the gorges in 1898. [...] In March Leechuan completed the upriver journey to Chongqing but not without the assistance of trackers. [...] Leechuan was not designed for cargo or passengers and if Little wanted to take his vision one step further, he required an expert pilot. [...] In 1898, Little persuaded Captain Samuel Cornell Plant to come out to China to lend his expertise. [...] Captain Plant had just completed navigation of Persia's Upper Karun River and took up Little's offer to assess the Upper Yangtze on Leechuan at the end of 1898. With Plant's <b>design</b> <b>input,</b> Little had SS Pioneer built with Plant in command. [...] In June 1900, Plant was the first to successfully pilot a merchant steamer on the Upper Yangtze from Yichang to Chongqing. [...] Pioneer was sold to British Royal Navy after its first run due to threat from the Boxer Rebellion and renamed HMS Kinsha. [...] Germany's steamship effort that same year on SS Suixing ended in catastrophe. [...] On Suixing's maiden voyage, the vessel hit a rock and sunk, killing its captain and ending realistic hopes of regular commercial steam service on the Upper Yangtze. [...] In 1908, local Sichuan merchants and their government partnered with Captain Plant to form Sichuan Steam Navigation Company becoming the first successful service between Yichang and Chongqing. [...] Captain Plant designed and commanded its two ships, SS Shutung and SS Shuhun. Other Chinese vessels came onto the run and by 1915, foreign ships expressed their interest too. [...] Plant was appointed by Chinese Maritime Customs Service as First Senior River Inspector in 1915. [...] In this role, Plant installed navigational marks and established signaling systems. [...] He also wrote Handbook for the Guidance of Shipmasters on the Ichang-Chungking Section of the Yangtze River, a detailed and illustrated account of the Upper Yangtze's currents, rocks, and other hazards with navigational instruction. [...] Plant trained hundreds of Chinese and foreign pilots and issued licenses and worked with the Chinese government to make the river safer in 1917 by removing some of the most difficult obstacles and threats with explosives. In August 1917, British Asiatic Petroleum became the first foreign merchant steamship on the Upper Yangtze. [...] Commercial firms, Robert Dollar Company, Jardine Matheson, Butterfield and Swire and Standard Oil added their own steamers on the river between 1917 - 1919. [...] Between 1918 -1919, Sichuan warlord violence and escalating civil war put Sichuan Steam Navigational Company out of business. Shutung was commandeered by warlords and Shuhun was brought down river to Shanghai for safekeeping. In 1921, when Captain Plant died tragically at sea while returning home to England, a Plant Memorial Fund was established to perpetuate Plant's name and contributions to Upper Yangtze navigation. [...] The largest shipping companies in service, Butterfield & Swire, Jardine Matheson, Standard Oil, Mackenzie & Co., Asiatic Petroleum, Robert Dollar, China Merchants S.N. Co. and British-American Tobacco Co., contributed alongside international friends and Chinese pilots. [...] In 1924, a 50-foot granite pyramidal obelisk was erected in Xintan, on the site of Captain Plant's home, in a Chinese community of pilots and junk owners. [...] One face of the monument is inscribed in Chinese and another in English. [...] Though recently relocated to higher ground ahead of the Three Gorges Dam, the monument still stands overlooking the Upper Yangtze River near Yichang, a rare collective tribute to a westerner in China.|$|E
