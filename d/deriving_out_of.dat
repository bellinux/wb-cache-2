40|$|The paper {{examines}} the corporate governance {{mechanism of the}} control model (or insider control system) by looking at both the motivation for management to deviate from following their principal’s wishes and whether the supervising body, {{the board of directors}} would correct them. Some opportunistic actions <b>deriving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the principle-agent relation between owners and management are preventable; others are not and can only be minimized by a strong participation of the owner in the affairs of the company...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge {{has been}} upheld {{as the key}} {{resource}} to create sustainable advantage in the strategic management field. In quest for sustainable performance, theorists in the environmental management domain advocate taking the learning route. However, the extant studies examined only the direct effect of environmental practices on a firm 2 ̆ 7 s competitiveness and performance and hence ignored the intervening learning processes. Framed within the Resource-based view (RBV) of the firm, the current inquiry investigated into resource inputs as determinants accounting for a firm 2 ̆ 7 s environmental knowledge integration, and competitive outcomes <b>deriving</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> such integration. While the RBV shed notable insights on {{the main effect of}} resources/capabilities on competitiveness that aims to justify environmental practices and related expenses from an economic perspective, the Resource Dependence Theory (RDT) introduced the intriguing notion that organizational strategies pertaining to sustainability may be determined by power dependency rather than by profits. The current inquiry extended the RBV by examining the moderating context of top-green-buyer initiated communications on the linkage between environmental practices (resource) and environmental knowledge integration (capability). By examining how resource-based, dynamic capabilities, and relational views work together to address the key concerns of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s customers as a major stakeholder and hence enhance its performance, and simultaneously studying direct, mediation and moderation effects among them, this study documents the combined effect of these factors in achieving international market performance. In short, this study makes a two-fold significant contribution to the strategic management literature by demonstrating the importance of firm-specific resources and relational capabilities in promoting firm performance...|$|E

40|$|The study {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} product usage, satisfaction <b>derived</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the same and the brand switching behaviour in several product categories while looking at the product involvement level in the Indian marketplace. A fair amount of {{work has been done}} in the area of customer satisfaction and loyalty and many customer satisfaction indexes are available in the market using different variables and characteristics. The study attempts to understand the brand switching behaviour of the customers and its relation not with just satisfaction <b>derived</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the product but also connects to the usage pattern of the customers and product involvement. Five categories (vehicles, television, soap, hair oil, and ice cream), involving varying levels of involvement were chosen. Cluster analysis was used to understand the grouping of the characteristics across the categories and their effect on brand switching behaviour in correlation with satisfaction and involvement level. It was observed that product usage and related level of satisfaction fail to explain the brand switching behaviour. Product involvement was found to have moderate impact on readiness to switch. The study emphasises that marketers will have to keep a constant eye to understand the usage pattern associated with their products and the satisfaction <b>derived</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it and also at how customers involve themselves with the product to lessen the brand switching behaviour among their customers...|$|R

For example an impulse blading of a turbine is <b>derived</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> multi circular arcs of different radii for, suction surface and pressure surface with a suitable leading and trailing edge radii. The reaction bladings were designed purely <b>out</b> <b>of</b> empirism based {{on the amount of}} acceleration or Gulf factor i. e., the ratio of throat opening to pitch (Ref-l),where as compressor blade profiles were derived by imposing a suitable c r on a known base profile with a chosen thickness distribution. The performance of these profiles were assessed by conducting series of experiments which involves the measurement of surface velocity distribution and profile loss. From the experimental results each profile can be given a tag of operating range. Selection of blade profile for a given velocity distribution involves the complete scanning of experimental results, which becomes tedious and time consuming. Now a days many theoretical methods are available to evaluate the performance of the blade profile. These methods were extensively used to update the blade profiles originated during the early decades. ...|$|R
