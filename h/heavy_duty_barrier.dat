5000|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> (voiced by Keith Ferguson) - Corporal Hershel Dalton is the estranged {{cousin of}} Roadblock. Flint {{recruits}} Dalton {{to bring in}} Roadblock in exchange for membership into his Falcons team and says to Flint, [...] "Call me Heavy Duty." [...] It's revealed that <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> doesn't like Roadblock because of something that went wrong in the past. That's why <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> moved away from his hometown of Biloxi, Mississippi and moved away {{to go to college}} and later live in Idaho. While on the hunt for his cousin, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> manages to ambush Roadblock after their grandfather's remembrance (Captain Jefferson Hinton, who served as a pilot in the Tuskegee Airmen and considered an honored son of Biloxi). Then the two are ambushed by Major Bludd and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> handcuffs himself to Roadblock. He drags Roadblock into his vehicle which leads them into a car chase until Major Bludd blows up the bridge. Due to Major Bludd firing his laser onto the car as it was sinking, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> loses the keys to his handcuffs. But manages to pull himself and Roadblock out of the river, however they end up in the swamp while evading alligators. Luckily, Roadblock was able to fight off the alligator by wrestling it much to the surprise of <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty.</b> Major Bludd then attacks them in a swamp boat as Roadblock saves <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> from a large snake. After a brief fight, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> try to break the handcuffs as Major Bludd arrives and captures them. While Major Bludd prepares a trap for the others, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> work to get out of the handcuffs. At the same time, <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> realizes that his cousin was telling the truth when Bludd confirms that he's freelancing with Cobra. The same alligator attacks them, but Snake Eyes rescues them and scares the alligator away. Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> then join the other Joes in fighting off Major Bludd and the Baroness who shows up unexpectedly. After the fight, Roadblock and <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> return to their grandma's house where she revealed that their grandpa had given his inheritance to both of them, making <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> animosity towards his cousin to end. After Ripcord thinking <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty's</b> name meant did a lot of tours of duty, it was revealed that Hershel had been nicknamed by Grandma Hinton stating when he was a baby, he could fill a diaper so fast.

40|$|AbstractOverweight {{goods are}} kind of special goods and must be loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars when transported by railway. However, this sort of car is not taken {{consideration}} when the track structure is designed. In order to have knowledge regarding {{the action of the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars on the track structure and correctly organize the transportation of the overweight goods, the strength of track was studied with the action of the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars according to the basic theory of static mechanical calculation. Taking the D 2 car as an example of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and selecting the traditional track of railway, the finite element calculation model of track was established. With the software ANSYS, the forces and deformations of track structure were calculated under several parameters and conditions of different load position, spring rigidity coefficient and rail type. Then, the D 32, D 38 type of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars and several common locomotives were selected and the forces and deformations with these loads were calculated and compared. The results show that the static extrema of forces and deformations of track structure have different laws under different parameters and conditions. The <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars loaded overweight goods generally make the track structure engender greater forces and deformations than those common locomotives do, and the D 2 car is of all the most adverse to the track. This indicates that <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars probably bring the bad effect to the lines. Therefore, when transporting overweight goods loaded on the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> freight cars, adaptable measures and correct transport scheme are to be taken to decrease the damage to the lines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{culture of}} riding heavy {{motorcycles}} originates from advanced countries and mainly comes from Europe, North America, and Japan. <b>Heavy</b> <b>duty</b> motorcycle riders {{are different from}} people who view motorcycles as a convenient mean of transportation. They regard riding them {{as a kind of}} enjoyment and high-level taste. The activities of riding <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> motorcycles have formes a distinctive landscape in domestic land in Taiwan. Previous studies which explored motorcycle culture in Taiwan still focused on the objects of motorcycle engine displacement under 50 cc [...] The study aims to study the <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> motorcycles of engine displacement over 550 cc. and explores where their attractiveness is. For finding the attractiveness of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> motorcycle, the study chooses Miryoku Engineering (Preference-Based Design) approach. Two steps are adopted to proceed the research. First, through arranging the letters obtained from interviewing experts, EGM (The Evaluation Grid Method) was applied to find out the structure of attractiveness. The attractive styles are eye-dazzling, leisure, classic, and racing competitive styles. Secondarily, Quantification Theory Type I analysis was adopted as a tool for analyzing the importance of attractiveness. The relationship between style and attractive parts was also discussed. The results could contribute to the design and research development of <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> motorcycle industry in Taiwan.
