The new context reveals all the fragility of our societies. In this paper, a platform is introduced by combining social-oriented communities and complex-event processing concepts: SELFSERV. Its aim is to complement the "old recipes" with smarter forms of social organization based on the self-service paradigm and by exploring culture-specific aspects and technological challenges.

40|$|To {{fight against}} <b>info-exclusion</b> in an aging society, it is {{important}} to make website information available to all generations. If we want to achieve this goal we need to know the impact of not only age but also gender, educational background and frequency of internet use. Therefore, this paper presents the results of an explorative Dutch eye-tracking case study, which focuses on information search behaviour (reading patterns and use of the search box), effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. 29 younger and 29 older participants completed a search task on 3 websites. It was found that the greatest factor impacting on information search behaviour is not always age. In one case, heatmaps showed clearly that the navigation patterns of older participants with a frequency of internet use were quite similar to those of younger ones. Finally, I present some implications for organizations wanting to (re) design their own website...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the multimedia mark-up languages SMIL and HTML+TIME were used to publish three types of online presentations of multi-modal artwork by mental health service users. This technology {{has the potential to}} bring the work of artists working with mental health services to a wider audience, at low cost, with fuller participation and also offers a number of new creative possibilities. The presentations included artwork, biography and audio transcripts in static files with the aim of reducing the <b>info-exclusion</b> of multimedia service user artists. The potential of server-side scripting integrating MySQL database contents dynamically into SMIL templates was investigated for its capacity to generate random or topical art displays 'on the fly'. In two prototype server-side applications, PHP scripts used user input to activate multimedia file pointers contained in the database. The feasibility of server-side scripting in terms of browser/player support and other issues is discussed...|$|E

The event {{web site is}} [URL] {{increase}} in rich and interactive content on the web has allowed {{the growth of the}} number and type of users that access them. This implies that such content should be accessible to anyone, including people with disabilities. Therefore, it should be accompanied with media alternatives (captions, audio description), which should be handled by an accessible user agent that provides support for them. This paper presents: 1) an approach with accessibility requirements following standards to include accessibility in a user agent for delivering accessible multimedia content, and based on it, 2) a conceptualization that provides an abstract user interface model with the ability to be integrated into the development process.

The Salamanca Declaration {{promotes}} {{the integration of}} {{students with special needs}} in the regular education. To achieve this goal is fundamental to assist these students with different mechanisms some of which technology based. Students with motor difficulties face obstacles of diverse order like the execution of tasks that require handwriting (e. g. copies, dictations and worksheet resolution). Some of these students use portable computers equipped with text processors and rate enhancement systems that accelerate writing in the computer. However, our experience says that these tools are not enough. The management of the produced information has revealed itself a very challenging task for these children. Therefore we think that is of paramount importance the development of an application that helps students in the management of all produced information.

40|$|There {{is a huge}} {{availability}} of videos that have been produced in a very fast and wide way, along with the popularity of Internet. This scenario should be carefully considered by the video authors since many users have different needs. It {{is important to keep}} in mind the accessibility requirements so that any user can overcome the barriers to access content regardless of their limitations imposed by either impairment or some temporary restriction. The current video players present barriers for many people, especially to the elderly, and one of the main barriers is the restriction to reproduce videos accessible on the Web. This paper describes a research, and the design and evaluation of an accessible video player (called Facilitas), in which a user test with older people is conducted. As a result, we discuss the issues reported by older people and the controls that were developed to assist them.

40|$|The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) play {{a crucial}} role in the world today. Globalization as we know it and the {{emergence}} of so-called Information and Knowledge Society are the direct consequence of radical technological innovations that led to the development of the Internet and revolutionized the dominant paradigm for accelerating the flow and increasing the intensity of contacts and exchanges. However, in this new society old problems remain, the exclusion takes new forms, the <b>info-exclusion,</b> generating a Digital Divide. Noting the importance of ICT to a wider integration, the EU has given emphasis to actions on this issue, in particular with the Lisbon Strategy and the eEurope Action Program. In Portugal this interest has been felt with the establishment of an Operational Program Topic in the CSF III (originally called POSI then renamed POS_C). This work aims to summarize the end of this issue by introducing a look on the Algarve region, compared with other regions of the Atlantic Area in central aspects as the behavior of citizens, firms, municipalities, schools, museums and the tourist accommodation. ...|$|E

The {{web site is}} [URL] Chat is being used {{for more than one}} decade in {{learning}} environments as a useful Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) Tool. However, nowadays some students still usually face accessibility barriers when using Chats and, as a result, they cannot learn {{in the same way as}} their classmates. Thus, some of the equality principles of education are not accomplished. This paper shows a study of chat's characteristics and analyzes if commercial Chats with general purposes can be used for learning environments in an accessible way. This study has been carried out from the point of view of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) guidelines 2. 0. The study analyzes fifteen commercial chats (desktop, mobile and web chats) and provides some recommendations in order to improve the accessibility of chats in learning environments.

40|$|With {{the growth}} of {{software}} engineering disciplines and visual languages like the UML (Unified Modeling Language) and consequently increase of modeling activities that use this visual languages, the access of the visually impaired is harmed and they need the assistance of other people both for reading and editing this models. In this paper we present a case study conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a prototype tool developed by the authors and was designed to allow users to model using UML class diagrams using two distinct views: a traditional graphical view that sighted users are used to work with and an equivalent textual view where blind or visually impaired users can read, create models and also collaborate on models created by the graphical view. The study was conducted with one totally blind subject and counted with a previous pilot with a visually impaired subject to validate the study design. Results indicate that the AWMo approach was successful and well accepted by the users while they see potential that it could actually be used on professional environments.

40|$|Recently, the {{production}} and availability of multimedia Web content, as videos, have increased. In this scenario {{it is important to}} consider accessibility requirements so that any user can whelm the barriers to access content regardless of the limitations imposed by either deficiency or some temporary restriction. One of the main barriers found in the current players is the restriction to make videos accessible on the Web and little research on how to overcome those limitations has been conducted. This paper describes the three phases of User Centered Design, in which an evaluation with real users of an accessible video player is conducted. A video player, called Facilitas, is proposed in order to provide the rationale of how some of those barriers or limitations could be overcome. Its controls are new and different from the ones in other players. We have observed that by reducing accessibility barriers, the design process leads to an improved product in terms of usability. A user testing is described to explain which controls users frequently use to complete a task.

However, {{technology}} is always one step ahead and new devices appear before we can address the accessibility problems for the older ones. People with disabilities {{are not the only ones}} that are being excluded by technologies. Indeed, there is an exponential growth of the elderly population that suffers from age-related disabilities. Accessibility issues should be in mind for developers. Unfortunately, addressing these issues is even harder in new devices like mobile phones and tablets where there is not a proper set of guidelines focusing on this domain. This work provides: (1) a set of guidelines to keep in mind in order to achieve accessibility in mobile interfaces for older people. This checklist is the result of a review study of the literature, standards and best practices that are being performed in this area of knowledge, (2) use of this accessibility checklist aimed at elderly people, a survey of three mobile native Apps on android platform has been carried out, these Apps have as aim to modify the default interface for another more accessible one.

40|$|AbstractInformation and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are {{considered}} {{a powerful tool for}} economic development and the growth of societies. However, instead of helping overcome society's inequalities caused by the digital era, they have instigated an increase of the people that rested aside of the information age. The digital divide refers to the difficulty info- excluded people have in keeping up with technological advances. This phenomenon was triggered by the rapid growth and dissemination of technological equipment, as a portion of society did not have the proper time or knowledge to adjust. This paper sets forth a new approach to help fight the Portuguese digital divide by presenting new ways of interaction. Resorting to multi-touch technology, we examine how this new natural interaction paradigm can have a positive influence in the struggle against <b>info-exclusion.</b> For this purpose, we present a multi-touch game envisioned to encourage and teach digitally excluded people on how to use an important and needed everyday equipment – the ATM (Automated Teller Machine) – as it is still avoided by some. We believe that our pilot case study can show preliminary results on how natural user interfaces may be beneficial to help overcome some difficulties enforced by the digital divide. We consider that our findings may be valuable to show a possible path of how the new natural user interfaces can help bring technology and people closer. After being asked about their user experience, the participants of this exploratory study agreed that the game encouraged them to explore more about new technologies...|$|E
