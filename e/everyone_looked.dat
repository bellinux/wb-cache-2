500|$|IGN's Chris Carabott {{rated the}} premiere 9/10, calling the [...] "peek {{into the life}} of The Others... {{exceptionally}} done" [...] and the non-appearance of the other survivors [...] "a smart move". Carabott also praised Jack's flashbacks, writing [...] "Previously, Jack has been written as the white knight and reluctant hero who <b>everyone</b> <b>looked</b> to in their time of need. The more chinks they show in Jack's armor, the better - the more human he becomes." [...] He called [...] "Juliet... a promising new character who will hopefully add a new dimension to The Others this season" [...] and concluded his review by calling the episode [...] "a solid season opener". Robert Bianco from USA Today praised the opening scene and called the episode [...] "a fine start for a great series" [...] but with reservations. Bianco wished Jack would [...] "win one again for the team", and was fearful that Lost could eventually become like Alias, [...] "a series that became so entranced by its puzzle and its villains that it let the main characters vanish behind them".|$|E
500|$|Filmed in real time, {{the episode}} is {{designed}} to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute takes. Carter explained, [...] "I said [...] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And <b>everyone</b> <b>looked</b> at me like I was nuts." [...] To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a steadicam. However, the steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary. Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, [...] "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it." [...] The cuts were usually made during whip pans or in scenes when the screen would go dark. With the exception of Mulder jumping off the Queen Anne, the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods. Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.|$|E
