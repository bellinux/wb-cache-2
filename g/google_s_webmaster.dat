The idea is to extract {{as much information as}} possible during the divide step, and to exploit the gathered information as efficiently as possible within the conquer step. Focusing on both of these steps, we discuss potential enhancements of Bernstein’s cache-timing attack against the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). Concerning the divide part, we analyze the impact of attacking different key-chunk sizes, aiming at the extraction of more information from the overall encryption time. Furthermore, we analyze the most recent improvement of time-driven cache attacks, presented by Aly and ElGayyar, according to its applicability on ARM Cortex-A platforms. For the conquer part, we employ the optimal key-enumeration algorithm as proposed by Veyrat-Charvillon et al. to significantly reduce the complexity of the exhaustive key-search phase compared to the currently employed threshold-based approach.

30|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{of information is}} dependent on the context of application and user preference. Protecting sensitive data in the cloud era requires identifying them in the first place. It typically needs intensive manual efforts. More importantly, users may specify sensitive information only through an implicit manner. Existing research efforts on identifying sensitive data from its descriptive texts focus on keyword/phrase searching. These approaches can have high false positives/negatives as they do not consider the semantics of the descriptions. In this paper, we propose S 3, an automated approach to identify sensitive data based on users’ implicit specifications. Our approach considers semantic, syntactic and lexical information comprehensively, aiming to identify sensitive data by the semantics of its descriptive texts. We introduce the notion concept space to represent the user’s notion of privacy, by which our approach can support flexible user requirements in defining sensitive data.

40|$|Speech {{recognition}} (SR) {{systems such}} as Siri or Google Now have become an increasingly popular human-computer interaction method, and have turned various systems into voice controllable systems(VCS). Prior work on attacking VCS shows that the hidden voice commands that are incomprehensible to people can control the systems. Hidden voice commands, though hidden, are nonetheless audible. In this work, we design a completely inaudible attack, DolphinAttack, that modulates voice commands on ultrasonic carriers (e. g., f > 20 kHz) to achieve inaudibility. By leveraging the nonlinearity of the microphone circuits, the modulated low frequency audio commands can be successfully demodulated, recovered, and more importantly interpreted by the speech recognition systems. We validate DolphinAttack on popular speech recognition systems, including Siri, <b>Google</b> Now, Samsung <b>S</b> Voice, Huawei HiVoice, Cortana and Alexa. By injecting a sequence of inaudible voice commands, we show a few proof-of-concept attacks, which include activating Siri to initiate a FaceTime call on iPhone, activating Google Now to switch the phone to the airplane mode, and even manipulating the navigation system in an Audi automobile. We propose hardware and software defense solutions. We validate that it is feasible to detect DolphinAttack by classifying the audios using supported vector machine (SVM), and suggest to re-design voice controllable systems to be resilient to inaudible voice command attacks.

40|$|Proteins {{and their}} {{interactions}} are fundamental to cellular life. Disruption of protein-protein, protein-RNA, or protein-DNA interactions {{can lead to}} disease, by affecting the function of protein complexes or by affecting gene regulation. A better understanding of these interactions on the molecular level gives rise to new methods to predict protein interaction, and is critical for the rational design of new therapeutic agents that disrupt disease-causing interactions. This thesis consists of three parts that focus on various aspects of protein interactions and their prediction {{in the context of}} disease. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we classify interfaces of protein-protein interactions. We do so by systematically computing all binding sites between protein domains in protein complex structures solved by X-ray crystallography. The result is SCOPPI, the Structural Classification of Protein Protein Interfaces. Clustering and classification of geometrically similar interfaces reveals interesting examples comprising viral mimicry of human interface binding sites, gene fusion events, conservation of interface residues, and diversity of interface localisations. We then develop a novel method to predict protein interactions which is based on these structural interface templates from SCOPPI. The method is applied in three use cases covering osteoclast differentiation, which is relevant for osteoporosis, the microtubule-associated network in meiosis, and proteins found deregulated in pancreatic cancer. As a result, we are able to reconstruct many interactions known to the expert molecular biologist, and predict novel high confidence interactions backed up by structural or experimental evidence. These predictions can facilitate the generation of hypotheses, and provide knowledge on binding sites of promising disease-relevant candidates for targeted drug development. In the second part, we present a novel algorithm to search for protein binding sites in RNA sequences. The algorithm combines RNA structure prediction with sequence motif scanning and evolutionary conservation to identify binding sites on candidate messenger RNAs. It is used to search for binding sites of the PTBP 1 protein, an important regulator of glucose secretion in the pancreatic beta cell. First, applied to a benchmark set of mRNAs known to be regulated by PTBP 1, the algorithm successfully finds significant binding sites in all benchmark mRNAs. Second, collaborators carried out a screen to identify changes in the proteome of beta cells upon glucose stimulation while inhibiting gene expression. Analysing this set of post-transcriptionally controlled candidate mRNAs for PTBP 1 binding, the algorithm produced a ranked list of 11 high confident potential PTBP 1 binding sites. Experimental validation of predicted targets is ongoing. Overall, identifying targets of PTBP 1 and hence regulators of insulin secretion may contribute to the treatment of diabetes by providing novel protein drug targets or by aiding in the design of novel RNA-binding therapeutics. The third part of this thesis deals with gene regulation in disease. One of the great challenges in medicine is to correlate genotypic data, such as gene expression measurements, and other covariates, such as age or gender, to a variety of phenotypic data from the patient. Here, we address the problem of survival prediction based on microarray data in cancer patients. To this end, a computational approach was devised to find genes in human cancer tissue samples whose expression is predictive for the survival outcome of the patient. The central idea of the approach is the incorporation of background knowledge information in form of a network, and the use of an algorithm similar to <b>Google</b> <b>s</b> PageRank. Applied to pancreas cancer, it identifies a set of eight genes that allows to predict whether a patient has a poor or good prognosis. The approach shows an accuracy comparable to studies that were performed in breast cancer or lymphatic malignancies. Yet, no such study was done for pancreatic cancer. Regulatory networks contain information of transcription factors that bind to DNA in order to regulate genes. We find that including background knowledge in form of such regulatory networks gives highest improvement on prediction accuracy compared to including protein interaction or co-expression networks. Currently, our collaborators test the eight identified genes for their predictive power for survival in an independent group of 150 patients. Under a therapeutic perspective, reliable survival prediction greatly improves the correct choice of therapy. Whereas the live expectancy of some patients might benefit from extensive therapy such as surgery and chemotherapy, for other patients this may only be a burden. Instead, for this group, a less aggressive or different treatment could result in better quality of the remaining lifetime. Conclusively, this thesis contributes novel analytical tools that provide insight into disease-relevant interactions of proteins. Furthermore, this thesis work contributes a novel algorithm to deal with noisy microarray measurements, which allows to considerably improve prediction of survival of cancer patients from gene expression data...|$|R

40|$|Near field {{communication}} (Nfc), a contact-range and short-lived message exchange technology, has {{in recent years}} become popular in relation to payment-cards, key-cards and ski-passes. With the release of, in particular, the <b>Google</b> Nexus <b>S,</b> which is capable of reading and writing Nfc tags as well as exchanging messages between devices by touch, the roles of consumers have changed from carriers of passive cards to that of active readers. This publicly available hardware technology, embedded into relatively cheap connected smartphones, creates a new field of possibilities in which a complete and complex Nfc-based system can be developed solely by means of software. In this thesis work, the research is {{in relation to the}} field of Nfc, ranging from the physical characteristics of the technology to the design of the Nfc API on the Android platform. Nfc-based apps, library and systems are designed, developed and evaluated in terms of performance. The Android apps which are implemented are WiFi and Bluetooth connectors as well as an Nfc-sensor value visualizer. Additionally, two full systems are developed which consists of an Android app, backend server, database and web or PC-client frontend. These two systems are: a web-based high-performance live statistical visualizer of Nfc sensor values and an Nfc-scan based product endorsement, Like-event, presenting the picture and name of a user endorsing a product on the in-store advertisement displays on top of the ads. The system for scanning, distributing and presenting statistics on sensor-values from a specially crafted NfcV-enabled sensor is evaluated in terms of performance along the chain of events starting at the Nfc tag introduction and being dispatched on the mobile phone and ending with the calculations and plot-generation carried out by the browser connected to the backend via a WebSocket. The evaluations show that in a use-case in which the user holds a tablet in one hand and an Nfc-enabled smartphone in the other, the user would experience a mean-delay of 515 milliseconds between putting the device against an NfcV-sensor and seeing the statistical plot, containing the last 1000 values, updated in the browser on the tablet. Additionally, the user would experience a mean-delay of 74 milliseconds between the values being presented on the mobile device itself until they are presented on the tablet in the case of constant streaming from an NfcV connected sensor. The conclusion is that this delay of 74 milliseconds is sufficiently low for the user to feel that the devices are tightly coupled, making it natural {{to pay attention to the}} tablet when scanning sensors. Possible use-cases for this include a technician walking between built-in passive NfcV sensors on the factory floor or a nurse walking between patients wearing bandages with built-in passive health-sensors. Finally, the work is discussed in terms of ethics and social impact as development in the tele-healthcare field continues, and a set of Nfc-based applications are suggested including Nfc-tags for interactive product customization, company car management and app deployment...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of today's smartphones is heavily limited by their batteries. To meet the increasing demands from end-users on smartphones with better battery life, Android mobile manufacturers are hunting for {{new approaches to}} improve their phones' batteries. For example, they use smart battery interfaces on their existing batteries, and they also render more usable power-saving features and settings that mobile users can use to minimize the power consumption of smartphones. But unfortunately, users always have inadequate knowledge about power characteristics and features of their mobile devices. This highlights the necessity to let users know how they should deal with limited battery lifetime and thus perform the optimal and effective energy management. Especially when the battery gets critically low, users should have {{a good understanding of}} how to better manage the remaining battery and take appropriate measures to make their phones last longer for at least keeping basic email and call communication. The objective of this thesis is to provide Android mobile users with a series of control points on maximizing the lifetime of their low-battery smartphones when they desire to maintain basic communication for emailing and calling. To achieve this goal, a detailed analysis will be performed on an Android smartphone, Samsung <b>Google</b> Nexus <b>S.</b> In the beginning, I will introduce an overview of energy profiling on the Android platform, where Carat will be presented as a practical example of energy profilers aiming for detecting energy bugs on users' smartphones and providing them with diagnosis reports to reduce the power consumed by their phones. After that, I attempt to find out how general hardware subsystems (eg. screen backlight and internet connections) and background application processes will impact battery life of smartphones by undertaking physical power measurements of the tested phone under a wide range of realistic usage scenarios. At last, I will evaluate the experimental results from users' perspectives to figure out under which circumstances battery life of smartphones will be maximized, and then based on the obtained findings I will design actionable recommendations for users on battery management. From this study, I have found that screen backlight, Internet connections and background application processes indeed impact battery life when users are emailing and calling through low-battery smartphones. In addition, to improve the lifespan of smartphones used for emailing, users should connect to WiFi, adjust screen backlight to the minimum level and stop running those application processes in the background, which have been identified by Carat as energy hogs or bugs. Moreover, if users want to have Internet calls through the Skype, they are recommended to choose WiFi connections and kill background application processes. At the same time, if Dialer is used for calling, users should disable any Internet connections to reduce the power consumption of their smartphones. Vain tiivistelmä.

Tais m´etricas foram criadas para orientar a produc¸ ao textual e recentemente tamb´em foram empregadas em simplificadores textuais autom´aticos experimentais para leitores inexperientes. Nesse trabalho aplicam-se essas m´etricas a texto originais livres, recuperados da Internet, para buscar correlacionar o grau de inteligibilidade textual com a relev ancia que lhes ´e conferida pelos buscadores utilizados. A premissa inicial a estimular a comparac¸ ao entre inteligibilidade e relev ancia ´e o enunciado conhecido como Princ´&# 305;pio de Occam, ou princ´&# 305;pio da economia. Observa-se uma tend encia centralista que ocorre a partir do pequeno afastamento m´edio dos grupos de arquivos melhor colocados no ranking em relac¸ ao `a m´edia da categoria a que pertencem. ´E com a medida do afastamento m´edio que se consegue verificar correlac¸ ao com a posic¸ ao do arquivo no ranking e ´e tamb´em com essa medida que se consegue {{registrar}} diferenc¸as entre o m´etodo de calcular a relev ancia do Google e do Yahoo. Um experimento que decorre do primeiro estudo procura determinar se a medida de inteligibilidade pode ser empregada para auxiliar o usu´ario da Internet a escolher arquivos mais simples ou se a sua indicac¸ ao junto `a listagem de links recuperados ´e ´util e informativa para a escolha e navegac¸ ao do usu´ario. Em um experimento final, embasado no conhecimento previamente obtido, s ao comparadas as enciclop´edias Brit anica eWikip´edia por meio do emprego da m´etrica de inteligibilidade Flesch-Kincaid Grade LevelText {{retrieved from}} the Internet through Google and Yahoo queries are evaluated using Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, a simple assessment measure of text readability. This kind of metrics {{were created to}} help writers to evaluate their text, and recently in automatic text simplification for undercapable readers. In this work we apply these metrics to documents freely retrieved from the Internet, seeking to find correlations between legibility and relevance acknowledged to then by search engines. The initial premise guiding the comparison between readability and relevance is the statement known as Occam s Principle, or Principle of Economy. This study employs Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level in text documents retrieved from the Internet through search-engines queries and correlate it with the position. It was found a centralist trend in the texts recovered. The centralist tendency mean that the average spacing of groups of files from {{the average of the}} category they belong is meaningfull. With this measure is possible to establish a correlation between relevance and legibility, and also, to detect diferences in the way both search engines derive their relevance calculation. A subsequent experiment seeks to determine whether the measure of legibility can be employed to assist him or her choosing a document combined with original search engine ranking and if it is useful as advance information for choice and user navigation. In a final experiment, based on previously obtained knowledge, a comparison between Wikipedia and Britannica encyclopedias by employing the metric of understandability Flesch-Kincai...|$|R

People always carry their smartphones with them and rely on mobile applications for most of their tasks: from checking emails for personal or business purposes, to engaging in social interactions via social networks, from trading online or checking their bank accounts to communicating with families and friends through instant messaging applications. It is therefore clear to anyone that these devices and these applications handle, store and process a huge amount of people’s personal data, and therefore confidential and sensitive. Whether the person is famous or not, whether he/she is an important public personality or not, whether he or she manages and possess a big amount of money or not, the protection of his/her personal data should be of great importance, since threats can target anyone, with consequences ranging from defamation of person to economic losses due to a compromised bank account, to identity theft, location tracking, and many more. In this scenario it becomes very important that mobile applications are a) secure from a program code point of view, written following secure coding and Secure Software Development Life Cycle (S- SDLC) guidelines and best practices, and b) capable of handling, storing and processing user data in a proper and stringently secure manner to maintain user’s privacy. Secure Coding and S-SDLC concepts are well known and have been inherited from the classical software engineering development domain, although not too much widespread and applied in the mobile world. However, even the most secure application, from a code point of view, can pose threat to the security and privacy of users if the data are not handled properly. An application very well written from a code point of view (i. e. without presence of evident bug which may lead to its exploitability) may, for example, store user credentials or other personal data in plaintext inside the device. In case that a device is lost, stolen or compromised via other channels (i. e. other vulnerable applications or through the mobile OS itself), those data are completely exposed. A simple, standard vulnerability or penetration test against the application may not reveal such vulnerability. Thus, this thesis addressed and solved the problems related to the following three research questions for mobile environment and applications: What are data and where can such data exist? How is personal data handled? How can one properly assess the security and privacy of mobile applications? The research work started with studying and identifying every possible state at which data can exist, which is a fundamental prerequisite {{in order to be able}} to properly treat them. The lack of understanding of this aspect is where most of the existing approaches failed by focusing mainly on finding bugs in the code instead of looking at sources and transfers of data too. After this step, we analysed how real life mobile applications and operating systems handle users’ personal data for each of the states previously identified. Based on the results of these two steps, we developed a novel methodology for analysis of security and privacy level of mobile applications, which focuses more on user data instead of application code and its architecture. The methodology, which we named MobiLeak, also combined concepts and principles from the digital forensics discipline. Some of the solutions presented in this dissertation may sound a bit more obvious compared to when they have been developed within the MobiLeak Methodology. However, this research work started in January 2011 and back in 2010, when the research proposal that led to this Ph. D. was presented, the mobile application security landscape was quite different, at a very early rudimentary stage. At that time iPhone 4 and iOS 4 had just been released; now we have reached iPhone 6 and iOS 8. In December 2010 the first Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled smartphone was released, the Samsung <b>Google</b> Nexus <b>S.</b> Until that moment the only mobile phone (not smartphone) with NFC capabilities was a particular version of the Nokia 6131 released in 2006. Incredibly enough, at that time there were not yet publicly known Android malware. In fact, the first Android Trojans, FakePlayer and DroidSMS, were discovered in August 2010 and now, according to a recent report released by the security firm Kaspersky 1 in February 2015, the number of financial malware attacks against Android counts up to 2, 317, 194 in 2014. Part of the significant contribution from the research work reported in this dissertation, was in the initial development of the Mobile Security Testing Guidelines developed by Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) for the Mobile Security Project, pushing the need of mobile digital forensics methodology to be a mandatory part of a mobile application security assessment methodology. It also contributed to the works of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO/IEC SC 27) committees related to digital forensics and, last but not least, it resulted in eleven peer-reviewed publications, one book chapter and one book co-authored.   For this Ph. D., a three year grant was given from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (Grantholder cat. 20). As a result, the research activities for the three year period have been carried out at the Institute of Protection and Security of the Citizen, Digital Citizen Security Unit, in Ispra, Italy.
