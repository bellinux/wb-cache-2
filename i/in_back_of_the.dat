25|$|Eventually, Union {{soldiers}} {{found the}} uncompleted short trench <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fort which allowed them an easier opportunity to climb onto the fort's parapet. The mass {{of men in}} the ditch had to move or be killed so they started to scale the walls or rushed around the moat to find the unfinished trench or sally port in the rear. Attackers were able to gain entry to the fort from the rear {{at the same time that}} a large number of Union troops finally managed to gain the top of the parapet. Soldiers of the 12th West Virginia Infantry Regiment were reported to be the first to cross into the fort after their flag had been planted at the top of the wall. After several bayonet charges, the Union attackers finally carried the works by sheer force of numbers and, after desperate hand-to-hand combat, forced the surviving defenders to surrender.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} other {{important}} art museums in Montevideo. The National Museum of Visual Arts in Parque Rodó has Uruguay's {{largest collection of}} paintings.

The Museo de Historia del Arte, located in the Palacio Municipal, features replicas of ancient monuments and exhibits a varied collection of artifacts from Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, Greece, Rome and Native American cultures including local finds of the pre-Columbian period. The Museo Municipal Precolombino y Colonial, in the Ciudad Vieja, has preserved collections of the archaeological finds from excavations carried out by Uruguayan archaeologist Antonio Taddei. These antiquaries are exhibits of pre-Columbian art of Latin America, painting and sculpture from the 17th and 18th century mostly from Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The Museo de Arte Contempo has small but impressive exhibits of modern Uruguayan painting and sculpture.|$|E

2500|$|Dupré {{created an}} elegant design, {{especially}} interesting {{for the position}} of the wings, which are more horizontal ("extended" [...] in heraldic terms) than most other emblazonments. The eagle itself was unmistakably a bald eagle, without a crest. The five-pointed stars were arranged in a six-pointed star pattern (like the future 1841 die). The clouds are in an inverted arc, much like the official die, but the rays of the glory extend down beyond the clouds and <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eagle. [...] Dupré added a UNITED STATES OF AMERICA legend around the sides, and a small rosette of leaves in the exergue below the eagle. For the reverse, Dupré apparently followed one of Jefferson's suggestions, depicting a scene of international commerce portrayed as Mercury (the god of diplomacy) in conference with the genius of America (shown as an Indian chief, similar to some early American copper coins).|$|E

The company had produced the plate {{in the hopes that}} President Pierce would like it and buy a set of china based on its look. The [...] "Pierce Plate" [...] was a creamy white porcelain emblazoned with the arms of the United States. These depicted an America eagle in the Napoleonic style (slender wings outspread, slender neck and head, facing right, leaning left), gripping a shield emblazoned with the U.S. colors (white band at top rimmed in blue, with blue stars on the field, and narrow red and white stripes below). [...] The shield tilted to the right, and the lower southeast corner was lost in rosy clouds which surrounded and were <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eagle. [...] Drifting through the clouds left and right of the shield was a ribbon with the national motto ("E pluribus unum"). [...] An olive branch extended to the left, and a sheaf of arrows to the right. [...] A wide dark blue border, its outer rim dotted with tiny white stars, encircled the plate. The beyond that was a twisted gold rope ("in the Alhambra style"). The edges of the demonstration plate were lightly scalloped.|$|E
2500|$|Cardinals regain sole {{possession}} of first place. Opening a critical stretch of 13 games against their two top contenders, the Pittsburgh and Cincinnati, {{the game on}} August 26 had the Cardinals climb out of a steep 4–0 deficit after two innings, on two big home run blasts by Matt Holliday and Allen Craig. Holliday's 3-run HR {{in the third inning}} was a mammoth 442-foot blast into Big Mac land, cutting the deficit to only 4–3. Craig's very first grand slam in the seventh was a memorable one, highlighting a five-run inning, giving them the lead, 8–5 at the time. He is 6-for-7 with the bases loaded with two outs, and 7-for-10 with the bases loaded, giving him 15 RBIs of his 95 total. It was Craig's 50th career home run, and increased his now MLB-leading [...]452 average (57-for-126 with 4 HRs and 82 RBIs with a [...]500 OBP and [...]643 SLG) with runners in scoring position. His 95 RBIs are second in the NL only to the 103 by Paul Goldsmith of the Arizona Diamondbacks and tied with Brandon Phillips of the Reds. Jon Jay helped with two great catches in centerfield, and Edward Mujica got his 35th save out of 36 opportunities. The Reds with the tough loss fell 3 1/2 games <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals, with the Cardinals winning 9 of 13 against them so far this season. The final score was 8–6, with Carlos Martinez getting his first major league win, on a hot night with 93 degrees at the 6:05 game time (on ESPN), and 35,159 in attendance.|$|E

2500|$|After {{hiding out}} {{for nearly a}} week, Duane Peak was arrested for the crime on August 28. [...] In his first {{statement}} to police, without having consulted an attorney, Peak {{said that there was}} an envelope for him at NCCF headquarters on Sunday, August 16. Inside, a note told him to go <b>in</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lothrop Drug store and pick up a suitcase, which he did before 5 p.m. He was instructed to take the suitcase to an address near 28th and Ohio at 11 p.m. that night and leave it on the field side of a fence. The note told him to go to a particular payphone before 2 a.m. and wait for a phone call. The phone rang and a woman's voice told him to call 911 and report a woman dragged into 2867 Ohio. The police report indicates that he admitted to placing the 911 call. Peak implicated neither Rice nor Poindexter in his first statement. [...] There are no police reports for August 29 or August 30, so it is unknown who talked to him over the weekend, though in his February 4, 1971 deposition, Peak said that Lt. James Perry interrogated him several times over that weekend. On Monday, August 31, Peak told the County Attorney Art O'Leary in a deposition, that Poindexter had made the bomb at Rice's house, told him to plant it, and then lure the police to the vacant house with an anonymous 911 call. (Peak allegedly carried a suitcase bomb with a clothespin triggering device into three vehicles and to two different residences from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. that day, at one point putting it in the trunk of a car because there were seven passengers in the car including his two small nieces.) ATF Agent Tom Sledge, brother of the Omaha police officer assigned to the call, was present during Peak's deposition, as were two Omaha Police officers, Bill Coleman and Pitmon Foxall and Peak's attorney, Tom Carey, although Peak had to ask the County Attorney who Carey was.|$|E
