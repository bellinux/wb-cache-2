40|$|High thermal {{efficiency}} and {{low levels of}} environmental emissions are priorities in the design of modern power plants. The M. W. Kellogg Company under funding from the Department of Energy, has recently completed a study of a new coal fueled system that would achieve these objectives. During the course of study, Pinch Technology was used to assist in the optimization of the process. The "hybrid cycle" is a second generation PFBC system, employing both gasification and combustion processes. <b>High</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>transport</b> reaction technology, developed originally for Fluid Catalytic Cracking plants, is used in the coal conversion steps; and pulverized limestone is circulated with the coal to capture the sulfur that is released during this process. Both gas turbines and steam turbines are used for power generation. Results from the study indicate that thermal efficiencies in excess of 45 % are attainable, with very low NOx and SOx emissions and attractive capital costs. In this paper the hybrid cycle is described and key aspects of this new technology are explained. The benefits of using Pinch Technology as an optimization tool in this project are also presented...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focus on}} the sand wave field along the canyon axis in the upper 4 km of the Monterey Submarine Canyon revealed by high-resolution multibeam bathymetry collected by MBARI/Mapping Lab of the California State University ([URL] spanning six years period (spring 2003 to fall 2008). The goal of the research is to understand submarine processes linking erosion, gravitative processes, sediment liquefaction by storm events, sediment transport by tidal currents, and deposition of the reworked sediment in distal basins with quasi-horizontal floors. Morphometric analysis has been conducted on the sand wave on the canyon head and main axes comparing the waves shape of nearest surveys by means of smoothing filtering and geostatistical techniques. The analysis has allowed to classify the canyon floor in upstream migration zones, downstream migration zones, and completely reworked zones. In the first two zones a sand migration velocity has been inferred, {{and in the last}} ones, where the wave field is completely reworked between each surveys, a minimum admissible migration velocity has been deducted. A simple mathematical model has then permitted to reproduce the main features of sand wave inception and growth. In particular the model {{focus on the}} prediction of the migration rates that sand waves undergo because of tidal currents. The model output has been compared versus the morphometric analysis results and match and mismatch are discussed. Results of the research show that the sand waves migrate in a predominantly up-canyon direction with tidal and internal tidal currents, despite different behaviour along the canyon. However the research shows that these are not the dominating flows within the canyon. Seismic profiles interpretation, other morphometric analysis results like local channel widening causing lateral erosion of older channel and extension of gully head on canyon walls and rim, point out <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> <b>transport</b> processes in the canyon main axes. This mechanism is possibly triggered by seismic events and storm events, as suggested by the slope stability and liquefaction potential analyses. Results of these latter in fact shows that earthquakes with peak ground acceleration (PGA) > 0. 18 (about 50 % of the PGA related to the 1989 M 7. 1 Loma Prieta earthquake) can lead to mass movements involving large volumes of materials and/or to seismic liquefaction of the fluvial, estuarine and beach shallow sediments at the canyon’s head and in the nearshore region...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} very simple model of {{sediment}} transport. A bed of particles is simulated with the conventional event-driven simulation method. The effect of the flowing water is modeled by imposing a force on each particle that depends on its height above the bed and its velocity. The effect of the particles on the water is neglected. For steady flow, we observe a minimum flow velocity necessary to initiate transport, {{and a decrease in}} <b>transport</b> efficiency at <b>high</b> <b>velocities.</b> The sediment <b>transport</b> by waves can be easily modeled by making the applied force also depend on time.

While water floods and debris flows typically follow the existing channel network, debris flows behave as a viscous mass which {{is capable of}} achieving <b>high</b> <b>velocities</b> and <b>transporting</b> large woody and rock debris (Pierson [2005]; Restrepo et al. [2008]). Consequently, debris flows are capable of inflicting damage or destruction by impact, inundation or burial along their flow path with very little warning. This destructive capability {{is compounded by the}} long distance from their sources areas that channelized debris flows may travel within a burned area. In some instances, this distance may range from 0.7 to 23.0  km and result in flows passing beyond the burn perimeter into adjacent unburned areas (Giraud and McDonald [2007]; De Graff et al. [2011]). Debris flow impacts not only can affect areas beyond the burned area perimeter but frequently take place up to 2  years after the fire has occurred (Wagner et al. [2013]).|$|R

To examine the effect of the diameter of a particle on its motion, the trajectories and velocities of different-sized particles, from 0. 5 to 500 μm in mass median diameter, are analyzed using images captured by a high-speed microscope camera. The results show that larger particles bounce higher, whereas smaller particles easily agglomerate and bounce only slightly, owing to the low restitution caused by their loosely packed structure.

30|$|Mass {{transport}} deposits (MTDs) are {{the major}} components of depositional systems in deep-sea environments. For instance, when a large trench-type earthquake occurs in a subduction zone, {{it has the potential}} to initiate a large submarine mass transport process, which can in turn generate a hazardous tsunami (e.g., Gennesseaux et al. 1980; Ward 2001; Harbitz et al. 2006; Ogata et al. 2012; Festa et al. 2016). Understanding the development of MTDs is therefore an important goal for landslide hazard mitigation (e.g., Morgan et al. 2009). The concept of mass transport deposits contains a broad spectrum of depositional facies, including undeformed slide blocks facies, slump facies composed of folded and boudinaged successions, and debris flow facies characterized by block-in-matrix structures. Among these MTD facies, this study aims to understand the formative processes of the debris-flow type facies, focusing on a role of excess pore pressure in the flow. Various field observations of modern examples and outcrops have suggested that fluid overpressure represents the most significant mechanism to account for the long run-out and the <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> of mass <b>transport</b> events (e.g., Canals et al. 2004). Here, we try to measure the extent of this excess pore pressure from outcrops by quantitative textural analysis.|$|R

The region was characterized by upwelling over the shelf, a single strong offshore geostrophic jet to the north, and a meandering equatorward flow which advected upwelled water from the coastal region up to 150 km offshore. Geostrophic velocity profiles referenced to 500 dbar were adjusted to the ADCP-measured velocity in the 190 - 274 m layer. Comparison of the unadjusted and adjusted profiles sets showed generally good agreement below 200 m but marked differences {{in several of the}} profiles above 200 m. Sections of geostrophic and ADCP velocity indicated that the flow in the region was highly geostrophic, but ageostrophic flow components were also present, particularly in the <b>high</b> <b>velocity</b> regions.

The study demonstrates {{the ability of}} XCMT to non-invasively measure the fracture walls and aperture {{during the course of}} a reactive flow experiment. The method allows estimation of both the local and global scale dissolution kinetics of a fractured limestone sample percolated by acidic water. The measured fracture geometry was then used as an input for flow modelling, in order to compare the hydraulic aperture calculated by numerical simulation with different evaluations of the aperture: hydraulic aperture measured from pressure drop during the flow experiment, mechanical aperture measured with XCMT, and chemical aperture deduced from calcium removal in the sample. The effects of reactive transport on geometry and fluid flow are discussed. Dissolution appears heterogeneous at both the small scale due to the presence of insoluble clays in the rock, and at larger scales with the formation of preferential flow pathways. These heterogeneous dissolution patterns are not predictable simply by the identification of the areas of <b>higher</b> fluid <b>velocity,</b> where <b>transport</b> of the chemical reaction products (i. e. rate of aperture increase) is presumed to be higher...|$|R

Their precision {{is based on the}} assumption that they accurately represent the overlying watercolumn properties and faunas. In this paper, we assess the possibility of a pre-depositional bias in sediment assemblages caused by horizontal drift, due to differential settling velocities of sedimenting particles based on their shape, size and density. We calculate the lateral transport undergone by planktic foraminifera and a range of other proxy carriers in several regions with <b>high</b> current <b>velocities.</b> Lateral <b>transport</b> of different planktic foraminiferal species is minimal due to high settling velocities; no significant shape- or size-dependent sorting occurs before reaching the sediment, making planktic foraminiferal ideal proxy carriers. Diatoms, radiolaria and faecal pellets can be transported up to 500 km in some areas. This transport bias suggests that sediment assemblages could contain different proportions of local and imported particles, decreasing the precision of proxies based on these groups and the accuracy of the temperature reconstruction. For example in the Agulhas current, transport can lead to differences of up to 2 °C in temperature reconstructions between different proxies. For future palaeoenvironmental reconstructions, further sediment-trapping studies and multi-proxy analyses should attempt to quantify the margin of error associated with particle transport...|$|R
40|$|Current {{strategies}} to protect groundwater sources from microbial contamination (e. g., wellhead protection areas) rely upon natural attenuation of microorganisms between wells or springs and {{potential sources of}} contamination and are determined using average (macroscopic) groundwater flow velocities defined by Darcy's Law. However, field studies of sewage contamination and microbial transport using deliberately applied tracers provide evidence of groundwater flow paths that permit the transport of microorganisms by rapid, statistically extreme velocities. These paths can be detected because of (i) the high concentrations of bacteria and viruses that enter near-surface environments in sewage or are deliberately applied as tracers (e. g., bacteriophage); and (ii) low detection limits of these microorganisms in water. Such paths must comprise linked microscopic pathways (sub-paths) that are biased toward <b>high</b> groundwater <b>velocities.</b> In media where microorganisms may be excluded from the matrix (pores and fissures), the disparity between the average linear velocity of groundwater flow and flow <b>velocities</b> <b>transporting</b> released or applied microorganisms is intensified.

The site hydrology {{and the effects of}} the spatial distribution of hydraulic and transport properties in the Yucca Mountain subsurface are considered. The study of migration and retardation of colloids accounts for the complex processes in the unsaturated zone of Yucca Mountain, and includes advection, diffusion, hydrodynamic dispersion, kinetic colloid filtration, colloid straining, and radioactive decay. The results of the study indicate that the most important factors affecting colloid transport are the subsurface geology and site hydrology, i. e., the presence of faults (they dominate and control transport), fractures (the main migration pathways), and the relative distribution of zeolitic and vitric tuffs. The transport of colloids is strongly influenced by their size (as it affects diffusion into the matrix, straining at hydrogeologic unit interfaces, and <b>transport</b> <b>velocity)</b> and by the parameters of the kinetic-filtration model used for the simulations.

Force transmission through newly formed contact sites is a highly dynamic process requiring a stable link between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular environment. To simultaneously investigate cellular traction forces in several individual maturing adhesion sites within the same cell, we established a custom-built multiple trap optical tweezers setup. Beads functionalized with fibronectin or RGD-peptides were placed onto the apical surface of a cell and trapped with a maximum force of 160 pN. Cells form adhesion contacts around the beads as demonstrated by vinculin accumulation and start to apply traction forces after 30 seconds. Force transmission was found to strongly depend on bead size, surface density of integrin ligands and bead location on the cell surface. Highest traction forces were measured for beads positioned on the leading edge. For mouse embryonic fibroblasts, traction forces acting on single beads {{are in the range}} of 80 pN after 5 minutes. If two beads were positioned parallel to the leading edge and with a center-to-center distance less than 10 µm, traction forces acting on single beads were reduced by 40 %.

These stars are speculated to reflect the stellar orbits in the Galactic bar. In this study, we use two N-body models of a Milky Way-like disk galaxy with different bar strengths to critically examine this possibility.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringEfficient {{cuttings}} {{transport and}} hole cleaning {{is very important}} for obtaining an effective drilling operation. In inclined and horizontal drilling, hole cleaning issues is a common and complex problem. This thesis explores the impact of various drilling parameters, and how they affect the required flow velocity and flow rate required for effective cuttings transport. The main objectives of the thesis are outlined as follows: - To make a sufficient review of previous studies; - Explain the fundamentals of the cuttings transport parameters and definitions; - To introduce and explain in great details the empirical model focusing on the models of Larsen and Rubiandini; - To make an introduction to the mechanistic modeling approach focusing on demonstrating the complexity of these models; - To apply Larsen‟s and Rubiandini‟s models in order to compare and identify similarities and differences between the models; - To present some field experience from offshore; - To draw conclusions about what we can learn from earlier studies and research. The thesis employs two models developed by an empirical approach, namely Larsen‟s model and Rubiandini‟s model. Two simulation scenarios have been considered. First, we have compared the models using the cases defined by Larsen from his experimental work. Then, an example well has been considered which mimics more operational conditions. Moreover, the thesis presents the mechanistic two-layer model developed by Kamp and Rivero, and demonstrates how the model has to be reformulated mathematically before a numerical method can be used for solving the model. The analysis of the two empirical models showed that both models show the same trend for required cuttings <b>transport</b> flow <b>velocity</b> and flow rate when drilling parameters, such as mud weight, ROP, mud rheology and drill-pipe diameter varied. For the horizontal case, we observe that Larsen predicts flow rate that are not far from the flow rates typical seen in operations, however it slightly over predicts required cuttings <b>transport</b> <b>velocity.</b> Rubiandini‟s model seems to predict high flow rate required for cuttings transport. However, for the vertical case, the predicted rate seems to coincide with flow rates typical in operations. The main advantage of Rubiandini‟s model is that in his work, he considered RPM as a variable that could affect the cuttings transport. The results also indicate that Larsen‟s model and Rubiandini‟s model show the opposite effect on required cuttings <b>transport</b> <b>velocity</b> when the cuttings size is a variable parameter. In the Larsen‟s model, smaller cuttings required <b>higher</b> flow <b>velocity</b> to be <b>transported,</b> while in the Rubiandini‟s model, the opposite is observed, namely larger cuttings need a <b>higher</b> flow <b>velocity</b> for <b>transport</b> in the wellbore. In the conclusion, several recommendations on how to achieve better cuttings transport and hole cleaning are listed...|$|R
