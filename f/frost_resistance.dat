40|$|Cereal crops {{can suffer}} {{substantial}} damage if frosts occur at heading. Identification of post-head-emergence <b>frost</b> (PHEF) <b>resistance</b> in cereals poses {{a number of}} unique and difficult challenges. Many decades of research have failed to identify genotypes with PHEF resistance that could offer economically significant benefit to growers. Research and breeding gains have been limited by the available screening systems. Using traditional frost screening systems, genotypes that escape frost injury in trials due to spatial temperature differences and/or small differences in phenology can be misidentified as resistant. We believe that by improving techniques to minimize frost escapes, such 'false-positive' results can be confidently identified and eliminated. Artificial freezing chambers or manipulated natural frost treatments offer many potential advantages but are not yet at the stage {{where they can be}} reliably used for frost screening in breeding programmes. Here we describe the development of a novel photoperiod gradient method (PGM) that facilitates screening of genotypes of different phenology under natural field frosts at matched developmental stages. By identifying frost escapes and increasing the efficiency of field screening, the PGM ensures that research effort can be focused on finding genotypes with improved PHEF resistance. To maximize the likelihood of identifying PHEF resistance, we propose that the PGM form part of an integrated strategy to (i) source germplasm;(ii) facilitate high throughput screening; and (iii) permit detailed validation. PGM may also be useful in other studies where either a range of developmental stages and/or synchronized development are desired. ...|$|R

40|$|Blast {{furnace slag}} cement {{concrete}} is used extensively {{in a number}} of countries. In comparison with OPC, it is particularly well known for its excellent performance in marine environments. One dis-advantage of slag cement is its vulnerability to scaling under the combined load of freezing-thawing and de-icing salts. The current investigation was triggered by positive observations regard-ing certain grinding agents used in slag cement production to improve <b>frost</b> salt scaling <b>resistance.</b> The investigation was aimed at explaining the cause of this improvement, at finding alternative methods to improve scaling resistance and at developing a model that would be suitable for the simulation of frost salt scaling behaviour. The investigation conclusions are essentially confined to high slag cement, particularly type CEM III 42, 5 /B which has a 67 % granulated slag content. The w/c ratio of the paste, mortar and concrete specimens is generally maintained at 0, 45. Carbonation, known as the critical parameter in frost salt scaling, constituted the key area of inter-est. From previous investigations it is known that carbonation increases porosity and coarsens the pore system in slag cement paste while it actually does the reverse in OPC paste. In the light of lit-erature a new hypothesis has been suggested that the transition zones, which are the weakest points in normal-performance cement-based materials, critically determine frost salt scaling resis-tance. These zones are even more indicative in the case of slag cement pastes because of the sig-nificant amount of transition zones that can be weakened by carbonation unlike with low-slag ce-ment or OPC pastes. In the present investigation it was observed that carbonation causes significant slag cement paste shrinkage. It was especially the transition zones between non-reacted slag particles and hydration products that were found to be affected. Consequently this process leads to the paste having a coarser pore structure thus making it prone to greater water uptake when compared to non-carbonated slag cement paste or OPC paste. The new hypothesis was supported by findings emerging from the ESEM study. It was observed that frost salt scaling attack generates cracks in the microstructure which adhere to slag-matrix interfacial zones. This was confirmed by nano-indentation tests which demonstrated that carbonation creates a significant number of weak zones in the slag cement paste. In the case of OPC paste the picture that emerged was quite different. Natural air carbonation influences the mineral characteristics of cement pastes. The XRD study re-vealed that both slag cement paste and OPC paste possess various types of carbonate minerals, namely: calcite, aragonite and vaterite. However, accelerated carbonation creates overwhelmingly stable calcite phases in both types of cement pastes which are subsequently transformed from me-tastable carbonates. This observation draws attention to the role played by Ca(OH) 2 in the good scaling resistance of OPC or low-slag cement systems. A curing regime, especially curing in lime water, appears to be favourable for slag cement materials. However, when compared to the effect of carbonation, the influence that the curing water quality has on scaling resistance is minimal. The contribution made by prolonged water curing to scaling resistance could have been greater but, as it was, the curing periods were limited to 5 weeks in the interests of remaining realistic and practi-cal. The main goal of the project was to investigate the improvements in <b>frost</b> salt scaling <b>resistance</b> in-stigated by chemical grinding agents {{on the basis of the}} various positive results gained from the preliminary tests. The intention was to study the effects that the chemicals had on the cement paste microstructure in order to understand <b>frost</b> salt scaling <b>resistance</b> in slag cement concrete and so as to contribute to structural improvements in that area. A microstructural comparative study was carried out on slag cement pastes that contain alkanola-mines/hydrocarboxylates (the best performing ones) and diethylene glycolâbased (the worst per-forming example) grinding agents. The most notable difference was in the pore structure of the paste samples. Alkanolamines/hydrocarboxylates-based grinding agents were found to produce smaller pore sizes when compared to the ones containing diethylene glycol. This is consequently likely to give rise to higher carbonation resistance, lower water uptake and, eventually, to higher <b>frost</b> salt scaling <b>resistance.</b> However, the improvement achieved by alkanolamines / hydrocarboxy-lates is not sufficient to enhance the scaling resistance of the slag cement materials investigated in similar detail to OPC pastes. Another technique that was investigated was sodium monofluorophosphate (Na-MFP) surface treatment. Remarkable improvements in <b>frost</b> salt scaling <b>resistance</b> were achieved by applying a 10 % Na-MFP solution to the surface of the carbonated slag cement paste and concrete. The scal-ing resistance improved by about 95 % after 7 freeze-thawing cycles. Evidence was found pertain-ing to the reaction between Na-MFP and metastable carbonates in the carbonated slag pastes. The application appears to significantly increase the tensile strength of the carbonated slag cement paste which is extremely favourable in terms of scaling resistance. The study finally resulted in the development of a new integrated model. The model mainly takes into account the glue-spall theory and the hypothesis developed in this thesis and it runs on the Delft Lattice Model platform. The model successfully demonstrates the experimental observations and the crack patterns created by the scaling action. The glue-spall theory suggests that cement-based material surface scaling derives from external ice layer cracking due to further cooling. Cooling consequently generates tensile stress due to the shrinkage of ice and causes cracking when the stress exceeds the tensile strength of the ice. This theory can explain many phenomena including the pessimum effect. On the basis of this theory, the new integrated model proved to be capable of simulating two important experimental observa-tions. Under identical conditions the model can predict higher surface scaling at a 3 % salt concen-tration level in relation to higher and lower values. The effect of ice layer thickness is furthermore found to be crucial with respect to frost salt scaling. Under identical material and environmental conditions the thicker external ice layer creates more damage than thinner ice layers. This observa-tion was also successfully demonstrated with the new integrated model. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Lipids {{extracted}} from seeds of Camelina sativa {{have been successfully}} used as a reliable source of aviation biofuels. This biofuel is environmentally friendly because the drought <b>resistance,</b> <b>frost</b> tolerance and low fertilizer requirement of Camelina sativa allow it to grow on marginal lands. Improving the species growth and seed yield by genetic engineering is therefore a target for the biofuels industry. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of purple acid phosphatase 2 encoded by Arabidopsis (AtPAP 2) promotes plant growth by modulating carbon metabolism. Overexpression lines bolt earlier and produce 50 % more seeds per plant than wild type. In this study, we explored the effects of overexpressing AtPAP 2 in Camelina sativa. Results Under controlled environmental conditions, overexpression of AtPAP 2 in Camelina sativa resulted in longer hypocotyls, earlier flowering, faster growth rate, higher photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance, increased seed yield and seed size {{in comparison with the}} wild-type line and null-lines. Similar to transgenic Arabidopsis, activity of sucrose phosphate synthase in leaves of transgenic Camelina was also significantly up-regulated. Sucrose produced in photosynthetic tissues supplies the building blocks for cellulose, starch and lipids for growth and fuel for anabolic metabolism. Changes in carbon flow and sink/source activities in transgenic lines may affect floral, architectural, and reproductive traits of plants. Conclusions Lipids {{extracted from}} the seeds of Camelina sativa have been used as a major constituent of aviation biofuels. The improved growth rate and seed yield of transgenic Camelina under controlled environmental conditions have the potential to boost oil yield on an area basis in field conditions and thus make Camelina -based biofuels more environmentally friendly and economically attractive. </p...|$|R
