5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly was <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> horse, I {{asked him}} where he was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out â€“ the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

It was better than kissing her, {{it was better than}} anything." [...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I remember we went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed.

500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all together, and I {{think it was very}} quick, like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing room like a proud dad, <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E
500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> gun and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, and the way you hold yourself, the way you look at things. I tried to put that in there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E

Glen Campbell's version {{appeared on}} his 1971 album The Last Time I Saw Her, Eddy Arnold's on his 1972 album Lonely People, and George Strait's on his 1992 album <b>Holding</b> <b>My</b> Own. Steagall performed it with Reba McEntire on his 2007 Here We Go Again album, {{but she did}} not include it on her 2007 duets album , which was released four weeks later. Their collaboration was favorably reviewed, and McEntire was said to reinvigorate this country standard by Nathalie Baret of ABQ Journal. Martin's version was 3:07, and it later appeared on compilation albums, starting with the 1996 Dean Martin Gold, Vol. 2. It has appeared on a handful of other Martin compilation albums. Campbell's version was only 2:26. Strait's version is 2:53 and appears later on his 2004 Greatest Collection at a 2:55 length. Steagall's version with McEntire (who Steagall discovered at a 1974 county fair) is 3:10.

2500|$|Strait {{began the}} decade {{with the release}} of his tenth studio album, Livin' It Up, which {{featured}} two No.1 hits including [...] "Love Without End, Amen", his first multi-week hit, and [...] "I've Come to Expect It From You". Both songs remained No.1 for five weeks in 1990. Chill of an Early Fall shortly followed in 1991, and received positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly noted that the album marked a shift for Strait from [...] "repeating himself" [...] in his previous works to producing different material. It produced the No.1's [...] "If I Know Me" [...] and [...] "You Know Me Better Than That", but ended his streak of 31 straight top ten hits with the cover of [...] "Lovesick Blues", which peaked at No.24. The record blocked his run of eight top charting albums with its peak of No.4. In the spring of 1992, <b>Holding</b> <b>My</b> Own was released.

2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{letters from}} Violet Keppel from Paris assuring her she only had feelings for her, Sackville-West had almost fainted {{when she read}} an announcement in a newspaper of Violet's engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Sackville-West's response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel, taking her to the Hotel Roosevelt where she wrote in her diary: [...] "I treated savagely, I made love to her, I had her, I didn't care, I only wanted to hurt Denys". Keppel had used the engagement {{as a way of}} eliciting the response from Sackville-West she had wanted, and the next day Major Trefusis [...] "almost turned white" [...] when he discovered his fiancee and Sackville-West together in bed, a discovery that came as a great shock as he believed the two were just friends, and had apparently believed that women were incapable of falling in love with one another. That night, Sackville-West had dinner alone at the Ritz while Keppel watched her lovingly from the window in her room at an adjoining hotel while Denys Trefusis laid on the bed crying. Under strong pressure from her mother Alice Keppel, a deeply depressed and suicidal Keppel did marry Major Trefusis, though she made it clear that she did not love him. Sackville-West called the marriage her greatest failure as she made a plan for Keppel to escape with her to avoid marrying Trefusis, but was too cowardly to carry it out, later writing [...] "I sat quite dazed in my room <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> watch in my hand and watching the hands tick past the hour of Violet's wedding. All the time, I knew, she was expecting a prearranged message from me, which I never sent".|$|E
2500|$|In a February 2008 {{interview}} with Movieweb.com, actor Ray Stevenson stated that a Rome film was in development, with Heller {{working on a}} script. Heller confirmed in December that there was [...] "talk of doing a movie version", adding that [...] "It's moving along. It's not there until it is there. I would love to round that show off". In an April 2009 {{interview with}} the Associated Press, Actor Kevin McKidd stated the [...] "Rome" [...] film was [...] "in development", and Lucius Vorenus will likely {{be a part of}} it. In March 2010, Entertainment Weekly stated that Heller had completed the script for Morning Light Productions, the film's financiers, and was now awaiting a director and a studio, since HBO Films [...] "won't be involved". However, in a more recent interview with Entertainment Weekly, Heller indicated the project had stalled â€“ [...] "I'm not <b>holding</b> <b>my</b> breath". [...] On April 15, 2014 ScreenRant received reports from Entertainment Weekly in which it was confirmed that a movie based on HBO Rome is indeed on the way. Quote [...] "As reported in 2009 Bruno Heller, who wrote and executive produced the series, is writing the movie script as well; the film will be produced by Morning Light Productions. The only question that remains is which epoch of Rome will the movie focus on and which cast members will be featured on the big screen?" [...] Kevin McKidd (Lucius Vorenus) himself spoke in September 2013 about it. [...] "There is a script that is being shopped and it's supposedly very good, I haven't seen it, but I am definitely {{going to be a part}} of the movie... He is very much alive, so that should be a fun story to tell." ...|$|E
