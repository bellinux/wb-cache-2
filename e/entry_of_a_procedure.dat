40|$|AbstractWe {{define a}} new decidable logic for expressing and {{checking}} invariants {{of programs that}} manipulate dynamically-allocated objects via pointers and destructive pointer updates. The main feature of this logic {{is the ability to}} limit the neighborhood of a node that is reachable via a regular expression from a designated node. The logic is closed under boolean operations (entailment, negation) and has a finite model property. The key technical result is the proof of decidability. We show how to express preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants for some interesting programs. It is also possible to express properties such as disjointness of data-structures, and low-level heap mutations. Moreover, our logic can express properties of arbitrary data-structures and of an arbitrary number of pointer fields. The latter provides a way to naturally specify postconditions that relate the fields on the <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> to the field on the exit of a procedure. Therefore, it is possible to use the logic to automatically prove partial correctness of programs performing low-level heap mutations...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{algorithmic}} {{extension of the}} classical call-strings approach to mitigate substantial performance degradation caused by spurious interprocedural cycles. Spurious interprocedural cycles are, in a realistic setting, key reasons for why approximate call-return semantics in both context-sensitive and-insensitive static analysis can make the analysis much slower than expected. In the traditional call-strings-based context-sensitive static analysis, because the num-ber of distinguished contexts must be finite, multiple call-contexts are inevitably joined at the <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> and the output at the exit is propagated to multiple return-sites. We found that these multiple returns frequently create a single large cycle (we call it “butterfly cycle”) covering almost {{all parts of the}} program and such a spurious cycle makes analyses very slow and inaccurate. Our simple algorithmic technique (within the fixpoint iteration algorithm) identifies and prunes these spurious interprocedural flows. The technique’s effectiveness is proven by experiments with a realistic C analyzer to reduce the analysis time by 7 %- 96 %. Since the technique is algorithmic, it can be easily applicable to existing analyses without changing the underlying abstract semantics, it is orthogonal to the underlying abstract semantics’ context-sensitivity, and its correctness is obvious. ...|$|E

Links may be created, manipulated, and destroyed dynamically to provide complete runtime control over the interconnections among processes. Message type checking is performed at run time. Messages may be received explicitly or may trigger the execution <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> <b>procedures.</b> <b>A</b> control-flow mechanism similar to coroutines simplifies the ordering <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> procedures...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{topic of}} this dissertation is {{the application of}} array signal processing to angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of multiple plane waves. Assuming that a passive linear array of uniformly spaced sensors is {{used to measure the}} radiation field, a digital signal processing system is proposed which determines the number of narrowband sources and their respective bearings;The proposed direction-finding system integrates several algorithms in a cohesive arrangement to exploit their mutually similar structures. The Modified forward-backward linear prediction (MFBLP) spectral analysis method of Tufts and Kumaresan is used to obtain high spatial resolution, and the eigenanalysis which is central to its operation provides <b>an</b> excellent point <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> for <b>a</b> <b>procedure</b> to estimate the number of plane waves detected by the array. This procedure utilizes the AIC or MDL information theoretic criteria in an ensemble manner to generate <b>a</b> reliable estimate <b>of</b> the rank of the signal subspace of the deterministic correlation matrix of the array snapshot;Two algorithms are presented for determining the spatial frequencies of the incoming plane waves, based on the MFBLP method: one uses <b>an</b> iterative version <b>of</b> Newton 2 ̆ 7 s method to locate the spectral peaks, and the other uses an iterative method to locate the equivalent complex poles;Statistical processing of the bearing estimates from <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> array snapshots is then used to maintain accuracy and precision in noisy array environment; two different estimators are proposed for this ensemble averaging, and their performance is characterized when applied to a single-source scenario. This utilizes both analytical and Monte Carlo computer simulation. The distributions are characterized in both wavenumber and bearing domains. Expressions for the bearing CRLB, expected standard deviation, and bearing estimate confidence interval are developed, {{believed to be the first}} known formulations of overall DF system performance as <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> array spacing, number of elements, true source bearing, and sensor signal-to-noise ratio. The statistical precision is shown to be related to the effective aperture of the antenna array, revealing the degradation in performance as the angle-of-arrival approaches endfire...|$|R

Grinshpon’s theorem is immediate {{from the following}} result by taking B = A − 1 and using {{the fact that a}} square matrix over a commutative ring is invertible iff its determinant is invertible. For X ∈ Mn(R), let C(X) = {Y ∈ Mn(R) : XY = Y X}. Theorem. Let A, B ∈ Mn(R) be such that C(A) = C(B).
