40|$|Relations between Turkey and European {{integration}} institutions {{began with}} Turkey's application for associate {{membership in the}} European Economic Community (EEC) in 1959. Turkey applied for full membership in the EEC in 1987 but did not gain candidate status until 1999. Since 1999, relations between Turkey and the European Union (EU) have gained momentum, and <b>Turkey's</b> <b>EU</b> accession negotiations began in 2005. Since that time, discussions {{about the implications of}} <b>Turkey's</b> prospective <b>EU</b> membership have become more serious and extensive in both <b>Turkey</b> and the <b>EU.</b> This thesis analyzes the potential advantages and drawbacks of <b>Turkey's</b> <b>EU</b> membership for both <b>Turkey</b> and the <b>EU.</b> It considers economic, social, political, and security factors. The main conclusion of the thesis is that, taking into account all the possible effects, the possible advantages of this membership outweigh the potential drawbacks for both <b>Turkey</b> and the <b>EU.</b> Greater efforts to conclude the negotiation process with full <b>EU</b> membership for <b>Turkey</b> would therefore be highly desirable.

40|$|The article investigates Turkey’s {{impact on}} the Turkish Cypriot {{political}} parties before, {{during and after the}} Annan Plan referenda. It is argued that before the referenda on the “Annan Plan”, a variety of reasons (the most important being the strong prospects for <b>Turkey’s</b> <b>EU</b> candidacy) led Ankara to support a compromising solution to the Cyprus issue. In contrast, in the post-Annan era, the slower pace of <b>Turkey’s</b> <b>EU</b> integration as well as the staggering negotiations on the Cyprus issue have not allowed for an equally decisive role of Ankara in Turkish Cypriot political partie...|$|R

The authors analyze Eurobarometer public opinion survey data on EU enlargement (and particularly <b>Turkey's</b> <b>EU</b> membership) across the 27 polities of the enlarged EU as well as in Turkey itself. The analysis of the data points to clear regional differences in support for <b>Turkey's</b> <b>EU</b> membership. Moreover, the authors' statistical analysis indicates two major components around which public perceptions of <b>Turkey's</b> <b>EU</b> membership coalesce. The first, identified as a "thick" component, based on the idea that EUrope embodies a specific cultural identity, opposes Turkish membership, whereas a second "thin" component, comprised of institutional-procedural norms, leaves the door open to Turkey. They argue that it is at the complex intersection of these two opposing views that <b>Turkey's</b> bid for <b>EU</b> membership should be located and eventually decided...|$|R

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} explore how {{religion}} and culture were used {{as an indicator of}} European identity in the media representation of Turkey-EU relations in the British media. The study focuses on religious and cultural discussions in the news rather than on the overall tone of the coverage.

Thenews about <b>Turkey's</b> <b>EU</b> bid published in five British newspapers and one news portal will be examined. While the qualitative analysis on news items will show how religion and culture are used in excluding <b>Turkey</b> from the <b>EU,</b> the quantitative analysis will demonstrate how much Turkey is associated with different labels (e. g. Muslim, secular). The findings concerning these labels were backed up by in-depth interviews with journalists.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{internal}} and external factors that influence Germany’s policy concerning <b>Turkey’s</b> <b>EU</b> membership bid. Firstly, it explains the theoretical framework and historical background of Germany’s policies regarding <b>Turkey’s</b> <b>EU</b> membership. Secondly, it analyses the role of internal and external factors related to the EU as well as external factors related to Turkey. The internal factors include the integration problems of Turkish immigrants and the rise of Islamophobia in Europe. Their influence {{on the role of the}} German public opinion is analysed. Then, the perceptions of Germany’s political elites and civil society are discussed, based on face-to-face, in-depth interviews conducted by the author with representatives of several politicians from different political parties in the German federal parliament. Additional interviews were conducted with representatives of several foundations and business organisations in Berlin and one German-Turkish business organisation in Istanbul. Finally, the article argues that Germany has been trying to develop a policy which is in between the idea of a ‘privileged partnership’ and the full membership of Turkey and tries to evaluate the reasons behind that. ...|$|R
