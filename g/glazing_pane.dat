40|$|Regarding {{the thermal}} {{resistance}} of the external envelop of buildings, windows are the weakest places. This {{is especially true for}} historic windows with original single pane glazing in historic buildings. To reduce the energy consumption and to improve thermal comfort of historic buildings, replacing these windows by modern double glazed windows would be a logical choice. The authentic character of these buildings, however, would be affected too much. Therefore, special effort has to be given to this kind of windows. There are a number of ways to improve the thermal performance of these windows. One approach is to add a single <b>glazing</b> <b>pane</b> from the inside or outside to the existing single pane glazing, making use of a (ventilated) cavity. Apart from that, special glazing has been developed, e. g. vacuum glazing, to replace the single <b>glazing</b> <b>pane,</b> with a vacuum glazing with comparable thickness. To predict the thermal performance of these windows, a multi-physical simulation approach is necessary. The paper will deal with the modeling approach of these types of glazing. The typical total thermal transmittance of these windows will be calculated, making use of the three-dimensional thermal bridge coupling effects on the thermal performance of the glazing panes. COMSOL will be used to solve the multi-physical coupling of the differential equations for Heat, Air and Moisture (HAM). The results of the three-dimensional simulations are compared with relatively simple 1 -dimensional calculations by hand and measurements in a so-called hot-box measurement laboratory device and also with in-situ measurements. Generally, good results are obtained by numerical simulation, compared to measurement results. For a number of glazing types, 1 -dimensional calculations by hand give a good impression of the thermal performance of rather complex glazing configurations. Surface temperatures of the glazing panes, risks on condensation and energy losses can be estimated with a reasonable accuracy. If the boundary conditions are more complex and if ventilation of air in the cavity is introduced, calculations by hand are not sufficient or possible anymore and more complex computer simulations are necessary...|$|E

40|$|Being {{responsible}} for {{a significant proportion of}} total heat loss in façade dominated buildings, the design and specification of the envelope, particularly the building’s glazing system, is a key factor in determining overall energy consumption. To address this, an innovative double glazed façade system comprising parallel transparent/translucent plastic slats sandwiched between the glass panes to form a Parallel Slat Transparent Insulation Material (PS-TIM) system is proposed as a potential solution. This PS-TIM system reduces heat transfer between the <b>glazing</b> <b>panes</b> whilst maintaining access to solar radiation and daylight. The presence of the PS-TIM structure significantly affects the thermal and optical performance of the window system in which it is employed. This presents a further significant challenge when trying to predict its performance using dynamic building simulation approaches. Using a typical small office as a case study subject to varying climatic conditions, we investigate the thermal and optical behaviour of a range of PS-TIMs with respect to their daylight and energy performance. We find that when compared to a conventional double glazed system, the application of PS-TIMs can result in a more visually comfortable and uniformly lit environment, which might be desired in an office space, and, in the specific case of the small office under test, can result in a reduction in energy consumption of up to 35. 8...|$|R

Shading systems such as Venetian blinds, louver shades, draperies etc. enhances the control of solar gain through windows.

The two configurations of the ATF (a Climate Façade integrated with the HVAC system) differ in the technology of the inner glazing (extra-clear single glass or double <b>pane</b> <b>glazing</b> with low-e coating), while share all the other features - i. e. external glazing, shading system, airflow path and ventilation rate, control strategies. The aim of the research activity is both to define a methodology to assess energy and light performance of each configuration, through elaboration of experimental data, and an attempt to apply the methodology to the specific case, in order to test it. Experimental investigations in test cells and/or real scale mock-up provide high quality data, but their representativeness and direct application is not always straightforward. Dedicated data analysis procedures and methods need thus to be developed in order to translate experimental data in useful information. Moreover, investigations are usually carried out on either the thermal or the light aspects, while combined analyses are not common, since this increases the degree of complexity of the analysis and measurement requirements are often quite different. The ATF module equipped with extra-clear single glass pane (Module A) shows, compared to that with a low-e coated double <b>pane</b> <b>glazing</b> (Module B), an increase in the average luminance, over the analyzed surfaces, in the range 20 %- 52 % and 16 %- 81 %, in absence and in presence of the shading systems respectively.

40|$|AbstractThe {{implementation}} of innovative materials for energy saving {{is among the}} most compelling topics in the building sector worldwide. In this regard, silica aerogels have received an increasing interest in the last years thanks to their exceptionally low thermal conductivity, generally around 0. 01 - 0. 02 W/(m·K). Aerogel panels laminated to drywall boards have started being adopted in highly energy-efficient buildings. However, the most promising application of silica aerogels seems to be in highly-insulating glazing systems. During the last years, double <b>pane</b> <b>glazing</b> systems with both granular and monolithic aerogel in the glass cavity have been developed and tested. Firstly, this paper reviews existing glazing systems designed with monolithic panels or granular aerogel and show their possible applications. Constrains of these systems, such as the low light transmissibility, cost, and fragility, are discussed. Then, the paper describes the development of a glazing system designed for the retrofitting of an educational building. Lighting and energy simulations allowed comparing window design options with different percentages of glazing area with aerogel. The analysis of the tradeoff between the goals of guaranteeing sufficient daylighting, clear perception of the external environment, and energy saving helps finalizing the design of the new monolithic aerogel glazing system...|$|R

40|$|BS>Various {{types of}} wood, steel, and {{aluminum}} window construction, glazed with plastic and {{different kinds of}} glass, were installed on four sides of a test structure during the greenhouse tests {{in order to determine}} their relative resistance to an atomic blast. The degree of protection from flying glass provided by mounting Venetian blinds, insect screens, and 1 / 4 -in. mesh wire netting on the inside of window openings was also determined. The best results seem to indicate that the resistances of different types of glass to an atomic blast are approximately proportional to their strength in supporting static loads. Glass mounted in a rigid frame is less likely to be broken than if mounted in a flexible frame which may be distorted by the blast. Fragments from wire or safety glass are less dangerous to personnel than fragments from other types of glass, and plastic is less likely to break than glass, Commercial types of Venetian blinds and insect screens afforded littie or no protection against flying glass fragments at the distance at which tested; however, a blind with some of the parts reinforced and properly anchored to the window opening would. probably give some protection at a distance of 3 miles from the explosion or if closed, would probably give tull protection against heat waves at 2 miles.

40|$|There are {{concerns}} {{on the behavior}} of glass façade under a big fire in tall buildings. As reported, flame ejected from a compartment fire would spread up to high levels and ignite combustibles in there. The fire source would then jump up the tall building one floor by one floor, giving a "jumping fire scenario. " Real-scale experiments were carried out at a big laboratory in Southern China to confirm this identified scenario. Part of a single skin façade with double glazing of height 7. 5 m was burned. A fire was set up in an adjacent compartment and the glass pane of the façade next to the chamber was taken out. Flashover in the chamber was onsetted by setting up a gasoline pool fire. Another pool of same size and amount of gasoline was put in a chamber in the upper level above the first chamber. The adjacent glass pane next to the upper chamber was not removed. Upon igniting the pool fire at the lower chamber, flame spread out from the opening to act at the <b>glazing</b> system. Glass <b>pane</b> at the upper level was broken, igniting the gasoline pool in the upper chamber and onsetting another flashover fire. Flame then spread out from that upper chamber. The process would repeat if there are combustibles stored at the upper levels. Air temperature outside the glazing above the fire chamber was measured and will be reported in this article. This scenario with fires jumping up one by one was justified from results on the measured air temperatures.
