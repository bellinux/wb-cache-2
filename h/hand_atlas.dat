40|$|SummaryObjective:The {{different}} radiographic {{procedures and}} methods for reading films and assessing {{the status and}} progression of hand osteoarthritis (OA) were reviewed. Methods:The methods that relate {{to each of the}} above procedures were assigned to categories upon which there was or was not general agreement. Results:It was agreed that the radiographic method should use published standardized radiographic protocols; that X-ray features should be graded separately for determining the extent of the disease and that changes in osteophyte size was the most sensitive indicator of progression. For epidemiological studies films should be read blind and randomly, but for assessing progression films should be read in pairs and in sequence. No agreement was obtained on the value of the lateral radiographic view of the hand nor on which radiographic atlas would be best for long-term longitudinal studies. Conclusions:Further work was required to evaluate the role of MRI and scintigraphy in <b>hand</b> OA; radiographic <b>atlases</b> could be improved by incorporating diagrams to illustrate the change in grade for each feature; validation was required for methods of assessment in long-term trials...|$|R

Later, other series came along, such as science fiction literature (Goldmanns Space Handbooks), and non-fiction books and guides. In the Hardcover areas, Goldmann continued to publish art books, work editions and from 1955, atlases (Goldmann's Big World Atlas, Goldmann's <b>Hand</b> <b>Atlas)</b> (Luigi Visintin, Herbert Bayer, Wilhelm Goldmann).|$|E

40|$|This {{work has}} been {{fulfilled}} within the ATLAS collaboration. I present here two studies, both related with the ATLAS detector and its operation. The ATLAS detector is described in chapter 1 whereas chapter 2 shows {{an introduction to the}} ATLAS tile calorimeter and the TileCal Read-Out Drivers (ROD) where {{the first part of the}} thesis is developed. In chapter 3 I present the study and the implementation of the Optimal Filtering algorithm in the TileCal Read-Out Drivers. The ROD provides the energy and the arrival time of the digital signal that is generated in the tile calorimeter. These parameters are reconstructed online using the Optimal Filtering algorithm, the RODs also provide a quality factor of the reconstruction. This information is sent to the standard ATLAS acquisition data flow with a specific data format defined in this thesis. Chapter 4 contains a short introduction to the Standard Model, presents its problems and describes other theories like Supersymmetry, Little Higgs or Extra Dimension models that try to solve them. The ATLAS experiment is enhanced to detect the Higgs boson and to study the physics at the TeV scale. Chapter 5 shows the study of the Kaluza-Klein gluon resonances predicted by models with extra dimensions. These searches are investigated through the decays of the excited gluons to high transverse momentum jets (pT) measured in the tile calorimeter. In this chapter I also propose the measurement of the polarization of the top quark from the excited gluon decay to discriminate between different models with similar final signatures. A summary and the main conclusions of the analyses are presented in the last part of the thesis. On one hand the implementation of the Optimal Filtering algorithm in the ROD DSPs of TileCal and the validation of this algorithm using cosmic muons from the ATLAS commissioning has been done. And on the other <b>hand</b> the <b>ATLAS</b> sensitivity to observe signatures predicted by extra dimension models has been presented...|$|R
40|$|The most {{characteristic}} topographic {{features of}} Morocco are the Atlas Mountains and the Rif Coordillera. These two orogenic belts are {{the response of}} different geodynamic processes acting at lithospheric scale caused by a unique driver, the collision between two tectonic plates. Both are located within the diffuse plate boundary zone separating Africa and Europe. The boundary zone {{is characterized by a}} relatively broad zone of deformation that includes Mountain chains in southern Iberia, the Betics and the Rif cordillera in Morocco. The zone delineates the arcuate arc system of Gribraltar. Within the last decade a large international effort have been devoted to the area mostly leaded by Spanish groups with the collaboration of international research teams (including scientist form Europe and USA). Key multi-seismic projects have been developed that aim to constrain the structure, composition and tectonic scenario from south of the Atlas to the Betics, across the Rif cordillera and the Alboran basin. The multidisciplinary research program includes: natural source (earthquakes) recording with temporal deployments of broad band (BB) instrumentation and, controlled source seismic acquisition experiments where, spatially dense recording of wide-angle seismic reflection shot gathers were acquired. The passive experiments consisted on: a transect from Merzouga across the Gibraltar arc and into the Iberian peninsula (untill south of Toledo); a nearly regular grid of BB which was achieve by multiple deployments of a number of BB. The controlled source datasets were able to constrain the crustal structure and provide seismic P-wave propagation velocity models from the coast across the Rif and the Atlas. Travel-time inversion of the controlled source seismic data across the Atlas constraints a crustal root to the south of the High Atlas, and reveals mantle wedge. A limited crustal imbrication also appears in the Middle Atlas. The crustal thickness, does not exceeded 40 km in the root zone and is less than 35 km elsewhere. Approaching the Rif, the controlled source data reveals a prominent crustal root over 50 km depth which is located where the topography does not exceed 1400 m. These features indicate that complex structure and processes beneath the crust {{play a key role in}} supporting the particular geometry of the surface topography of this part of the western Mediterranean. On one <b>hand</b> the <b>Atlas</b> is being supported by the mantle, on the other the abrupt change in crustal thickness at the Nekkor fault and the deep Rif crustal root can be attributed to interaction of the subducting Alboran slab with the North African Neo-Tethys passive margin.

40|$|The recent National Review of Mental Health Programmes and Services by the National Mental Health Commission {{has drawn}} {{attention}} to the need of local planning of care for people with a lived experience of mental illness in Australia and the relevance of a bottom-up approach to understanding “services available locally [in] the development of national policy”. It also calls for responsiveness to the diverse local needs of different communities across Australia. THE FINDINGS FROM THE NATIONAL REVIEW ARE IN LINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS PRESENTED BY THE NSW MENTAL HEALTH COMMISSION IN THE REPORT LIVING WELL: A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR MENTAL HEALTH IN NSW 2014 - 2024. Living Well identified that Local Health Districts should implement strategies to ensure that scarce clinical skills are employed to the best effect {{and the need to}} harness new technology to support clinicians and service providers with new tools to improve care, data collection and information sharing. The Integrated Mental Health Atlas of the Far West aligns with these recommendations. The Atlas is the region’s first inventory of available mental health services, from which {{it will be possible to}} derive benchmarks and comparisons with other regions of NSW. This will inform services planning and the allocation of resources where they are most needed. It is a tool for evidence-informed planning that critically analyses the pattern of mental health care provided within the boundaries of Far West Local Health District. We used a standard classification system, the "Description and Evaluation of Services and Directories in Europe for long-term care" model (DESDE-LTC), to describe and classify the services; as well as geographical information systems to geolocate the services. Use of the DESDE-LTC, widely used in Europe, has enabled a more robust understanding of what services actually provide and will enable planners to make comparisons across areas and regions, once this methodology is more widely available. This atlas has identified some major strengths in the provision of mental health care in the Far West:  the good availability of inpatient residential and outpatient care; although 85 per cent of the services are located in Broken Hill (where 61 per cent of the population resides), there are substantial efforts to increase accessibility to the surrounding areas; and the crucial role of effective partnerships. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>Atlas</b> also identified some gaps:  a lack of specific services for older people;  an absence of core components of the balanced model of mental health care, as seen in other LHD across NSW (such as absence of day care and long term accommodation for people with a lived experience of mental illness); and a low capacity of the workforce, in particular a shortage of skilled/qualified workers, including psychiatrists. Taken together the information in this Atlas highlights key areas for consideration for future planning for the provision of mental health services Far West. The findings reflect some of the findings and recommendations in the recent report of the National Review of Mental Health Programmes and Services made by the National Mental Health Commission.

40|$|Naples {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{vulnerable}} cities in the world because it is threatened by several natural and man-made hazards: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, landslides, hydrogeological disasters, and morphologic alterations due to human interference. In addition, the risk is increased by the high density of population (Naples and the surrounding area are among the most populated in Italy), and by the type and condition of buildings and monuments. In light of this, it is crucial to assess the ground shaking suffered by the city. To create a ShakeMap atlas for the region and to reconstruct the seismic history of the city from historical to recent times, we gather information from the most reliable and complete databases of macroseismic intensity records dating back to the eleventh century. The events felt in Naples cover a time span ranging from 1293 to 1999. The first event (Mw 5. 8) was an earthquake in 1293, located in the southern Apennines, at a distance of 100 km from Naples. The most recent event was an earthquake of moderate magnitude in 1999, located beneath Vesuvius (Fig. 1). In the previous release of the macroseismic databases, two additional events associated with the volcanic activity of Vesuvius in 62 and 79 A. D. were included. They are not included in the new release of the databases because they occurred before 1000 A. D., and likewise they have been not included in this atlas because they are too ancient to be incorporated into any time and magnitude window of completeness. For instrumental events (e. g., after 1980), we merge these macroseismic records with strong-motion data. Basically, we integrate information from five Italian databases and catalogs. This gives us the opportunity to explore several sources of information, expanding the completeness of our data set in both time and magnitude. A total of 84 earthquakes have been analyzed. For each event, we compute the shakemap set (Wald et al., 1999; Michelini et al., 2008; Worden et al., 2010) using an ad hoc implementation developed for this application, with (1) specificground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) accounting for the different attenuation properties in volcanic areas compared with the tectonic ones, and (2) detailed local microzonation to include the site effects. These shakemaps are provided in terms of Mercalli–Cancani–Sieberg intensity (MCS hereinafter) and peak ground acceleration (PGA). For PGA, the maps are provided in terms of median values and 16 th and 84 th percentiles, to quantify the epistemic uncertainties associated with the ground-motion measurements. In our prospective, the ShakeMap atlas has a dual application. On one hand, it is an important instrument in seismic risk management because it quantifies the level of shaking suffered by a city during its history, and it could be implemented to the quantification of the number of people exposed to certain degrees of shaking (Allen et al., 2009). Intensity data provide the evaluation of the damage caused by earthquakes; the damage is closely connected with the ground shaking, building type, and vulnerability, and it is not possible to separate these contributions. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>atlas</b> can be used as starting point for Bayesian estimation of seismic hazard. This technique allows for the merging of the more standard approach adopted, for example, in the compilation of the national hazard map of Italy used in this Bayesian framework as prior mode, with the site-type approach to the purpose of likelihood function (Selva and Sandri, 2013). The site-type technique is based on ground shaking data recorded in a given area; because the majority of earthquakes occurred when no seismometers were available, site data are mainly from macroseismic evaluation, that is, the felt effect is reconstructed from historical documents. The first two sections of the paper describe the databases and catalogs used, and the specific shakemap configuration applied. In the final section, we analyse the completeness of the atlas in terms of time for different magnitude/intensity thresholds, adopting and comparing two different strategies, one based mainly on historical analysis and the other on statistical evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the risk}} {{communication}} literature, considerable attention {{has focused on}} messages delivered by "official" messengers. This research pursues an alternative course, examining unintentional risk messages and their "unofficial" carriers. Referred to in this study as "accidental risk communicators" (ARCs), these individuals routinely discuss health and environmental risks with the public as a secondary, not formally recognized part of their job. From the tanning salon owner explaining the "safety" of UV radiation, to the auto mechanic performing a routine inspection, to the commercial painter handling lead-based paint, ARCs span a variety of occupations. Since ARCs often represent for-profit businesses, the public may be suspicious of their message, perhaps assuming that the information reflects corporate avarice rather than "impartial" scientific information. Yet often blue-collar laborers, ARCs may appear more similar to some sectors of the public, and thus more credible than "remote" government officials. In some cases, the pressure to sell a product may lead the ARC to deemphasize risks, whereas an occupational injury may make certain risk factors more salient. To begin explicating this concept empirically, this research examined the communicative practices of one sector of ARCs: turf and lawn care workers in New York State who are trained and certified to apply pesticides, and often expected to discuss health and environmental risks with both paying clients and curious onlookers. Licensed by the state, these individuals receive extensive training covering application methods and workplace safety, as well as basic principles of toxicology. The questions guiding this research were as follows: How do applicators {{make sense of the}} role they (do or do not) play in delivering risk-related information? How do CPAs make decisions about when, what, and how to communicate with their clients and the general public about pesticide-related risks? And, what are the dominant stories and themes used to characterize, make sense of, and discuss pesticide-related risks? In-depth interviews were conducted with 29 respondents affiliated with the Green Industry in New York State, and short written questionnaires were received from 24 participants at the 2007 Empire State Green Industry Show. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, then coded line-by-line both by <b>hand</b> and with <b>Atlas.</b> ti qualitative data analysis software. Emergent themes were grouped into the following categories: the institutional culture of the applicator's workplace, the perception of a "successful" applicator, the perception of the applicator's role, and the perception of risk and "Western" science, as related more centrally to turf and lawn pesticides. Among these themes, the idea of the applicator's work as "emotional labor" and/or "background work," and the effect of his occupational "expertise" on ideas of democratic citizenship are discussed in length. To continue building a theoretical foundation for the ARC concept, future research questions in these areas are posed. Practical implications for both Cooperative Extension and the Green Industry in the areas of applicator training, pesticide product labeling, and the "framing" of the industry are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Bone age {{assessment}} is a procedure frequently performed in pediatric patients {{to evaluate their}} growth disorder. A simple method commonly used in bone age {{assessment is}} atlas matching by a radiological examination of a left-hand radiograph against a small reference set of Greulich±Pyle atlas patterns of normal standards. The method however can lead to signi®cant deviation in age assessment, due {{to a variety of}} observers with different levels of training. The Greulich±Pyle atlas developed in the 1950 s based on middle upper class white populations, is also not fully applicable for children of today, especially regarding the standard development in other racial groups. In this paper, we present our system design and initial implementation of a digital <b>hand</b> <b>atlas</b> and computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for Web-based bone age assessment. The CAD system is built on top of existing picture archiving and communication system (PACS), as well as recent advances in Internet technology. It consists of a <b>hand</b> <b>atlas</b> database, a CAD module and a Java-based Web user interface. The digital atlas is based on a large new set of clinically normal hand images of diverse ethnic groups. A relational image database system is used to organize hand images, their extracted quantitative features and patient data. The digital atlas removes the disadvantages of the currently out-of-date Greulich±Pyle atlas and allows the bone age assessment to be computerized. The Java-based Web user interface allows users to interact with the hand image database from browsers. Users can use a Web browser to push a clinical hand image to the CAD server for a bone age assessment. Quantitative features on the examined image, which re¯ect the skeletal maturity, are then extracted and compared with patterns from the atlas database to assess the bone age.

These are compared to a standardized reference and scores determining the skeletal maturity are calculated. For computer-aided diagnosis, automatic ROI extraction and analysis is done so far mainly by heuristic approaches.

In this first approach to bone age assessment by CBIR, we conduct leaving-oneout experiments on 1, 102 left hand radiographs and 15, 428 metacarpal and phalangeal eROIs from the USC <b>hand</b> <b>atlas.</b> The similarity of the eROIs is assessed by cross-correlation of 16 x 16 scaled eROIs. The effects of the number of eROIs, two age computation methods as well as the number of considered CBIR references are analyzed. The best results yield an error rate of 1. 16 years and a standard deviation of 0. 85 years. As the appearance of the hand varies naturally by up to two years, these results clearly demonstrate the applicability of the CBIR approach for bone age estimation...|$|E
40|$|Skeletal {{maturity}} is assessed visually {{by comparing}} hand radiographs to a standardized reference image atlas. Most common are the methods by Greulich & Pyle and Tanner & Whitehouse. For computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), local image regions of interest (ROI) {{such as the}} epiphysis or the carpal areas are extracted and evaluated. Heuristic approaches trying to automatically extract, measure and classify bones and distances between bones suffer from the high variability of biological material and the differences in bone development resulting from age, gender and ethnic origin. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) provides a robust solution without delineating and measuring bones. In this work, epiphyseal ROIs (eROIS) of a hand radiograph are compared to previous cases with known age, mimicking a human observer. Leaving-one-out experiments are conducted on 1, 102 left hand radiographs and 15, 428 metacarpal and phalangeal eROIs from the publicly available USC <b>hand</b> <b>atlas.</b> The similarity of the eROIs is assessed {{by a combination of}} cross-correlation, image distortion model, and Tamura texture features, yielding a mean error rate of 0. 97 years and a variance of below 0. 63 years. Furthermore, we introduce a publicly available online-demonstration system, where queries on the USC dataset as well as on uploaded radiographs are performed for instant CAD. In future, we plan to evaluate physician with CBIR-CAD against physician without CBIR-CAD rather than physician vs. CBIR-CAD. 1...|$|E

40|$|Radiological {{bone age}} {{assessment}} {{is based on}} global or local image regions of interest (ROI), such as epiphyseal regions or the area of carpal bones. Usually, these regions are compared to a standardized reference and a score determining the skeletal maturity is calculated. For computer-assisted diagnosis, automatic ROI extraction is done so far by heuristic approaches. In this work, we apply a high-level approach of scene analysis for knowledge-based ROI segmentation. Based {{on a set of}} 100 reference images from the IRMA database, a so called structural prototype (SP) is trained. In this graph-based structure, the 14 phalanges and 5 metacarpal bones are represented by nodes, with associated location, shape, as well as texture parameters modeled by Gaussians. Accordingly, the Gaussians describing the relative positions, relative orientation, and other relative parameters between two nodes are associated to the edges. Thereafter, segmentation of a hand radiograph is done in several steps: (i) a multi-scale region merging scheme is applied to extract visually prominent regions; (ii) a graph/sub-graph matching to the SP robustly identifies a subset of the 19 bones; (iii) the SP is registered to the current image for complete scene-reconstruction (iv) the epiphyseal regions are extracted from the reconstructed scene. The evaluation is based on 137 images of Caucasian males from the USC <b>hand</b> <b>atlas.</b> Overall, an error rate of 32 % is achieved, for the 6 middle distal and medial/distal epiphyses, 23 % of all extractions need adjustments. On average 9. 58 of the 14 epiphyseal regions were extracted successfully per image. This is promising for further use in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) and CBIR-based automatic bone age assessment...|$|E
