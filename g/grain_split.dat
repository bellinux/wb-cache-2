During the splitting operation, the top-grain and drop split are separated. The drop split can be further split (thickness allowing) into a middle split and a flesh split. In very thick hides, the middle split can be separated into multiple layers until the thickness prevents further splitting.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to understand particle redistribution and matrix microstructure development during hot extrusion of aluminium matrix composites {{and the influence of}} process parameters on these two key microstructural features. Cast composite billets have been partially extruded to study the sequence of microstructure development. Strain and strain rate distribution in the partial extrudates have been measured using a `visioplasticity' technique. Results indicate that strain and strain rate distribution are more homogeneous in the composites than in the unreinforced alloy. Extrudate microstructures reveal the presence of particle bands and deformation bands aligned in the extrusion direction. It is noted that shearing of SiC particle clusters leads to particle banding, and an increase in extrusion ratio and/or a decrease in particle size enhances particle band formation. This phenomenon is attributed to increasing strain partitioning between the cluster and the matrix with increasing strain and/or decreasing particle size.

40|$|We {{describe}} the shear flow of a disordered granular {{material in the}} presence of grain fracture using the shear-transformation-zone (STZ) theory of amorphous plasticity adapted to systems with a hard-core inter-particle interaction. To this end, we develop the equations of motion for this system within a statistical-thermodynamic framework analogous to that used in the analysis of molecular glasses. For hard-core systems, the amount of internal, configurational disorder is characterized by the compactivity X = ∂ V / ∂ S_C, where V and S_C are respectively the volume and configurational entropy. Grain breakage is described by a constitutive equation for the temporal evolution of a characteristic grain size a, based on fracture mechanics. We show that grain breakage is a weakening mechanism, significantly lowering the flow stress at large strain rates, if the material is rate-strengthening in character. We show in addition that if the granular material is sufficiently aged, spatial inhomogeneity in configurational disorder results in strain localization. We also show that <b>grain</b> <b>splitting</b> contributes significantly to comminution at small shear strains, while grain abrasion becomes dominant at large shear displacements.

Developments in macro texture were investigated by X-ray ODFs (orientation distribution functions) and were simulated by Taylor type models, while actual microtextural developments were studied by OIM (orientation imaging microscopy). Although a gradual increase in or-fiber (RD//[110]) was observed with increased reductions, gamma-fiber (ND//[111]) increased till 40 - 50 % reduction and then remained almost the same.

40|$|A large-grained Nb {{polycrystal}} was successively uniaxially compressed {{to different}} cumulative strains {{to study the}} evolution of both the microstructure and the orientation of individual grains. After each deformation step, one grain which shows a banded structure was characterized in detail using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) {{to better understand the}} formation process of the deformation band (DB). The generation of the DB, which is observed after 11. 5 % reduction, involves the splitting of a transition band (TB) into two rotation fronts moving in opposite directions. These rotation fronts subseuqently evolve into the boundary of a DB whose alignment is associated with the observed primary and secondary slip systems. Post-analysis consists not only of slip system analysis based on image quality maps but also of lattice rotation analysis based on EBSD data. The latter shows that the orientation evolutions in the matrix and the DB are around the same rotation axis, but with opposite sense of rotation. In addition, grains with similar orientation but different deformation behaviors are compared to investigate the underlying difference in the mechanism of <b>grain</b> <b>splitting.</b> It is found that the formation of a DB occurs where a long-range stress field was created at a lower strain. Since the location of this long-range stress field is orientation dependent, whether or not a grain shows a banded structure strongly depends on its initial orientation.

For the approach that showed to be better describing grain crushing a complete model was prepared together with all the measurements needed to track the sample behaviour during simulation. At the end the model was tested. It turned out that the application of parallel bonds in modelling grain crushing is unnecessary. The main reason for parallel bond application in the model was good description of tensile grain failure. Due to the high coordination numbers the tensile <b>grain</b> <b>splitting</b> is unlikely to occur. Instead, shear grain failure at contact is the most common grain failure. Therefore, contact bonds, which are much more computationally efficient, should be used instead. The sample preparation procedure with application of elementary particle expansion method turned out to be unsuitable. Since for different grain size distributions with the same initial porosity, the stresses induced with this procedure can vary significantly.

One of the possible routes is severe plasticdeformation. The efficiency of the grain size reduction during severe plasticdeformation is associated with grain fragmentation process which is also ofinterest in the field of crystallographic textures. An accurate textureprediction requires a deep understanding of the grain scale microstructureevolution. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the process of grainfragmentation and its influencing factors such as the intrinsic orientationeffect and the extrinsic grain-grain interaction. The aimof this study is to use electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) to characterizethe microstructure and texture evolution in niobium single and polycrystalsupon cold plastic deformation up to large strains, in order to betterunderstand the mechanisms of grain fragmentation on the grain-scale. Specialattention is paid to the interpretation of the deformation structures on themesoscopic level, i. e. orientation gradients and mesoscopic bands. A niobiumpolycrystal is subjected to successive uniaxial compression tests at roomtemperature up to 30 % reduction. After each deformation step, EBSD is used toscan the local orientations and the microstructure on one and the samelongitudinal section for comparison. Grains with an inner orientation gradientare characterized by a moving fragmentation boundary. Its alignment andmobility are associated with the dislocation activities on both sides. On thecontrary, one grain with a similar orientation shows a mesoscopic bandingstructure as a result of continuous splitting. With a detailed comparison of thegrain subdivision behavior in both grains, a deformation mechanism of themesoscopic banding structure is proposed in terms of the arrangement of excessdislocations. Three niobium singlecrystals with different orientations are processed by equal channel angularpressing (ECAP) at room temperature for a single pass. EBSD is used tocharacterize the evolution of the microstructures and the local orientations onboth the transversal and the longitudinal cross sections. The influence ofgrain orientation is manifested by the extent of <b>grain</b> <b>splitting</b> on both the micronand the mesoscopic level. Two of the crystals with mesoscopic bandingstructures have been studied with respect to the slip activity, orientationevolution, their alignment and the sequence in time of their formation. Finally, a deformation mechanism for the banding structure in ECAP is proposed. /* Style Definitions */ table.

The discrete model of this kind consists of Voronoi cells representing the grains of a heterogeneous structure, which are interconnected by cohesive forces modeled by beam-like links capable of taking properly into account both brittle dynamic fracture and large displacement of a still connected pack of <b>grains</b> that might <b>split</b> from the structure. The brittle behavior of cohesive links requires that the dynamic analysis of such a model be treated with care, and the best possible integration scheme be selected. Four di®erent schemes are explored and compared in application to a dynamic traction test, including Newmark explicit and implicit schemes, HHT- ® scheme and energy-decaying scheme.

40|$|The {{substructure}} {{development in}} f. c. c. monocrystals and polycrystal grains under cold rolling is modelled {{with the help}} of evolution equations for the densities of redundant cell wall and non-redundant fragment boundary dislocations as well as of mobile and immobile disclinations in six cell wall and fragment boundary families. The slip rates for the 12 f. c. c. slip systems are calculated by a full constraints Taylor algorithm. The critical resolved shear stresses are derived from the dislocation and disclination densities. Substructure and crystal orientation are updated alternately in each integration step. The model is able to predict cell wall and fragment boundary spacings as well as misorientations in reasonable agreement with experimental data obtained in TEM studies on aluminium. The subset of preferably <b>splitting</b> <b>grains</b> in a polycrystal is found in reasonable agreement with OIM results...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of damaged grains was studied in 12 barley genotypes in a three-year period. The {{occurrence of}} <b>grains</b> with physiological <b>split</b> of lemma and endosperm was generally low. Split of palea and endosperm was mostly {{affected by the}} genotype (10 %) and it was recorded most frequently in the genotype Heris. Incomplete overlapping of husks was also markedly affected by the genotype (10 %) and it occurred most frequently in the genotype Scarlett. Sprouted grains and grains of green color occurred minimally. Black points were affected by year (21 %) and genotype (15 %). This damage was most frequently reported for the genotypes Camera and Jersey. Surprisingly, the occurrence of grains with apparently moldy husks was markedly affected by the genotype (25 %), less substantially by the location (10 %) and minimally by year (3 %) ...|$|R
30|$|Pigeonpea {{is widely}} grown as an {{intercrop}} with maize in southern Malawi, {{but it is}} mainly grown as a boundary marker in northern Malawi. Although known for its soil fertility enhancement attributes, Snapp et al. (2002) report that farmers are primarily interested in pigeonpea as a market crop and as a weed suppression agent and that soil fertility benefits are secondary. As expressed by Orr et al. (2015) Malawi was formerly the world’s largest exporter of pigeonpea but its share in the world market has fallen because of yield losses from Fusarium wilt. Pigeonpea exports from Malawi reach Mumbai, India before the Indian harvest in October, when prices are highest. Exports comprise both dry grain and de-hulled and <b>split</b> <b>grain</b> (Tur dhal). India’s imports of pigeonpea are projected to reach 636, 000 tonnes by 2020 (Abate et al., 2012), providing Malawian growers an opportunity to increase exports.|$|R
