5|$|The film {{serves as}} a satire of the social conditions, {{dominant}} practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, {{as well as the}} film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Filmmaking was becoming more expensive and requiring larger technical resources, particularly with the rise of sound production, making it increasingly difficult for amateur filmmakers to enter the profession. This deepened a divide between amateurs and Hollywood professionals, and as a result, a growing number of amateurs started lampooning Hollywood in their films, including A Hollywood Extra. The subject of the film is an extra who starts his Hollywood career with <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams,</b> but ultimately finds himself used and discarded by the industry, and his artistic ambitions destroyed. At the start of the film, the protagonist has a name (Mr. Jones) and a letter of recommendation outlining his talents, but his abilities are ignored and he is reduced to a number, symbolizing his dehumanization.|$|E
25|$|The {{canonical}} {{songs of}} this genre often deal with Zionist <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> and glorify {{the life of}} idealistic Jewish youth who intend on building a home and defending their homeland. A common theme is Jerusalem {{as well as other}} parts of Eretz Israel. Tempo varies widely, as do the content. Some songs show a leftist or right-wing bent, while others are typically love songs, lullabies or other formats; some are also socialist in subject, due to the long-standing influence of socialism on Jews in parts of the Diaspora.|$|E

Saruman was the servant and helper of Aulë, and so learned {{much in the}} art of craftsmanship, mechanics, and metal-working, as was seen in the later Third Age. Gandalf was the servant of Manwë or Varda, but was a lover of the Gardens of Lórien, and so knew much of the <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> of Men and Elves. Radagast, servant of Yavanna, loved the things of nature, both Kelvar and Olvar. As each of these Istari learned from their Vala, so they acted in Middle-earth.|$|E

Find Our Missing provides insight into these victims’ lives–their <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams,</b> what makes them tick, and how they have touched those around them—from the people who know them best. The episodes chronicle the investigations into their disappearances, and why the search for them so far has only turned up dead ends.|$|E

500|$|Mouna Ragam {{provides}} {{insight into}} the issues faced by married couples, exploring the plight and perception of divorce and how societies need to view the desires of women. Film critic Baradwaj Rangan compared the film to J. Mahendran's Nenjathai Killathe (1980), another {{story of a woman}} torn between the man she loves and the man she marries, Antha Ezhu Naatkal (1981) and its Hindi remake, Woh Saat Din (1983). Rakesh Mehar of The News Minute noted that one thing differentiating Mouna Ragam from Antha Ezhu Naatkal and similar films is that it remains focused on Divya. Kumuthan Maderya, writing for PopMatters, described Mouna Ragam a [...] "chick flick", because like other chick flicks, the film allowed romance to blossom between Divya and Chandrakumar, rather than let divorce split them; according to him, [...] "chick flicks center on the romantic worldview of females while gratifying their <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> usually through a warm and fuzzy denouement".|$|E
500|$|Wellek and Warren {{describe}} three {{views of}} a biographical approach, of which only one– the biographical aspects relating {{to the production of}} a work– can be of use; this use, however, is limited. They reject the views that works accurately reflect the author's life or that the author's life must be understood in order to understand a particular work. According to Wellek and Warren, works may indeed reflect the author's experiences, but they may also reflect an author's <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams,</b> or literary tradition and convention, and as such are [...] "not a document for biography". Likewise, an understanding of personal style (what makes a work [...] "Miltonic", [...] "Keatsian", [...] "Shakespearean", or [...] "Virgilian") does not rely on knowledge of the author's life. They conclude that [...] "it seems dangerous to ascribe to [...] any real critical importance", and that such approaches, if undertaken at all, should be done with a [...] "sense" [...] of the distinctions outlined above.|$|E
500|$|With little {{practical}} {{support from}} CEMA, Imogen's organisational talents, {{according to her}} friend Ursula Vaughan Williams, [...] "developed brilliantly". According to Imogen's account, her duties included conducting local brass bands, leading hymn-singing practice ("fourteen very old women in hats sitting round {{the edge of a}} dark, empty hideous tin hut"), and organising sing-songs for evacuee children. She arranged [...] performances by professional groups, and what she termed [...] "drop-in-and-sing" [...] festivals in which anyone could join. [...] Imogen also writes of [...] "idyllic days" [...] spent over cups of tea, discussing the <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> of would-be music makers. Her compositional activity in these years was limited by time and pressures of work, but she produced two recorder trios—the Offley and Deddington suites—and made numerous arrangements for female voices of carols and traditional songs. By the summer of 1942 the workload and concomitant bureaucracy was such that she was exhausted, and in need of a lengthy rest.|$|E

I wished that I had never made this fatal discovery, that I might have continued still <b>hoping</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreaming,</b> <b>and</b> wearing out my heart with striving after the impossible, since any fate would have been preferable to the blank desolation which now confronted me. I even wished to possess the power of some implacable god or demon, that I might shatter the sacred houses of this later race, and destroy them everlastingly, and repeople the peaceful world with struggling, starving millions, as in the past, so that the beautiful flower of love which had withered in men's hearts might blossom again.|$|R
500|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} film, Barton speaks {{constantly}} of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to [...] "the common man". In one speech he declares: [...] "The <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life– [...] why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? [...] Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? [...] Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater." [...] Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate the humanity of the [...] "common man" [...] living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because [...] "you DON'T LISTEN!" [...] In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying [...] "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block {{the sound of his}} ringing telephone.|$|E
500|$|NHK {{announced}} a seven-episode live-action television drama adaptation on March 30, 2009, produced {{in cooperation with}} the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, the country's national aerospace agency. Sixteen-year-old actress Nanami Sakuraba was cast for the role of Asumi Kamogawa, and filming for the series began on April 2. The drama was scheduled to air on June 11 but was eventually postponed by one week until June 18. Its airing coincided with the celebration of the International Year of Astronomy. Screenplay for the series was written by Shūko Arai and Daigo Matsui. While writing the script, Arai found himself encouraged by the characters who must overcome various struggles in order to achieve their dreams. He also specified <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> as central themes in the story. Among the changes made in this adaptation is the removal of Lion-san as a central character. Yaginuma did not make any restrictions for Arai and Matsui as he believed they knew the television audience best. [...] "Nevertheless," [...] he said, [...] "I think the little Asumi I know and the Asumi portrayed by Ms. Nanami are both looking at the same sky." [...] A three-disc DVD compilation box set of the adaptation was released by Geneon Universal Entertainment on December 23, 2009.|$|E
500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2010. The episode serves primarily as a satire of pop culture criticism. Although the South Park boys wrote The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs simply to shock and offend people, readers delve too deeply into the meaning behind the book, finding hidden allegories and symbolism that the actual authors insist are not present. People with conflicting philosophies, including liberals and conservatives, and pro-choice and pro-life advocates, attempt to claim that the same work conveys and validates their own ideology. The script serves as a criticism of people who take such works of pop culture too seriously. Although this is demonstrated specifically through literary criticism in the episode, the theme can be extended to film criticism and television criticism as well. The episode suggests people are so desperate for inspiration, they are willing to impose their <b>hopes</b> <b>and</b> <b>dreams</b> into works of art, even if they completely lack those qualities. Some commentators thought South Park creators Parker and Matt Stone were implicitly mocking the amount of analysis into deeper meaning South Park itself often receives in its reviews. Others have suggested this over-analysis is a reference to the number of adult themes identified in the Harry Potter and Twilight young adult novel series.|$|E
40|$|Culture lies at {{the heart}} of human {{development}} and civilisation.

Culture should be regarded as a set of distinctive spiritual and material traits that characterize a society and social group. It embraces literature and arts as well as ways of life, value systems, traditions and beliefs...|$|R
