5|$|On 27 June 1685, {{the forces}} of the Duke of Monmouth camped in Frome, {{following}} their defeat in a skirmish with the King's forces at Norton St Philip. Large numbers of his army deserted during the few days he stayed in the town before his eventual defeat at the Battle of Sedgemoor. Following the putting <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monmouth Rebellion, 12 men were hanged in the town.|$|E
5|$|On 9 December 1983, a U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentry {{collided}} with a KC-135A Tanker aircraft over Saudi Arabia during Operation ELF-1. Both aircraft were recovered back to Riyadh Air Base. The Tanker received substantial damage, with parts impact and loss of pressure, as well as shut <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two starboard engines. The E-3 received severe damage with the partial loss of a left wing section.|$|E
5|$|The {{shooting}} <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane {{served as}} the catalyst for the Rwandan genocide, which began within a few hours. An interim government took over, headed by de facto-leader Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, {{as well as some}} politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.|$|E

5|$|As the {{vandalism}} {{had shut}} down {{service at the}} central hub, a police squad was organized and dispatched to protect repairmen while they fixed the overhead cables at the main terminal building. The repairmen and the police were quickly surrounded by the strikers who hurled bricks and beat them with clubs. The police and repairmen were forced to flee and were prevented from restoring power to the terminal's lines. By the afternoon of November 1, the strikers were able to force a complete shut <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> urban central hub and halt all city streetcar operations. The shut down also stopped most of Indiana's inter-city light rail transportation, but regional routes outside of Indianapolis continued to operate. The shut down caused widespread disruption of public transportation and its effects were immediately felt by the public.|$|E
5|$|Following Tennessee's touchdown, the {{two teams}} traded possessions, each going three and out. Virginia Tech regained the ball after a Tennessee punt to its 20-yard line with 7:31 {{remaining}} in the quarter. After a Tech fumble that was recovered by the Hokies, Tech running back Dwayne Thomas ran nine yards for the first Tech first <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. After an incomplete pass, DeShazo and Thomas connected on an eight-yard pass before Thomas broke free for an 11-yard run and another first down. Thomas continued advancing the ball, picking up eight yards on two rushing plays. DeShazo then completed a four-yard pass for a first down at the Tennessee 39-yard line. There, however, Tennessee's defense stiffened and did not allow the Hokies another first down. The Tech punt was downed at the Tennessee 7-yard line, where the Volunteers began their third possession of the game.|$|E
5|$|Harrison, Scott and Mitchell soon {{developed}} a mutual rapport, according to L.A. Express bassist Max Bennett. In addition to carrying out further sessions for Shankar Family & Friends in Los Angeles, in March 1974, Harrison had begun spending time {{there trying to}} set up his own record label, with the winding <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Beatles' Apple Records from mid 1973 onwards. In August 1973, rumours in the music industry claimed that Harrison, Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Paul Simon were forming a label together; in fact, Harrison founded Dark Horse Records, one of the first releases of which was the Shankar album, and Dylan temporarily signed with David Geffen's Asylum Records, which was Mitchell's label.|$|E

A year later, returning from the Sejm and from the engagement ceremony with Gryzelda, he gathered a 4,000 strong division that participated in putting <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ostrzanin Uprising and arrived at the region affected by the unrest in June that year. Together with Hetman Potocki he defeated the insurgents at the Battle of Żownin, which turned into a rather difficult siege of the Cossack camp that lasted from 13 June till the Cossack relief forces were defeated on 4 August, and the Cossacks capitulated on 7 August.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's Jermaine Chaney fielded the post-score kickoff and {{returned}} it 51yards, setting up Indiana inside Tech territory. On the Hoosiers' first play, Paci completed a 34-yard pass to tight end Ross Hales for Indiana's second first <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Just outside the Tech 10-yard line, Indiana was stopped short and prevented from scoring a touchdown. Indiana's head coach sent in placekicker Bill Manolopolous, whose 26-yard kick soared through the uprights and cut Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 8:47 remaining before halftime.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} argued that this results in the {{different}} treatment of persons in like situations, and thus violates Article 12(1). Although a rational connection exists between the classification adopted and the legislative object, the effect of an under-inclusive classification is to accord different treatment to persons similarly placed. However, the courts have often justified under-inclusiveness on the ground that the legislature is free to recognize degrees of harm, to confine its restrictions to cases where the need is felt to be the greatest, and to advance its policies step by step. Despite this, resort to legislative wisdom to justify under-inclusiveness, if used indiscriminately, may result in the watering <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> equal protection guarantee provided by Article 12(1).|$|E

5|$|Nichols was {{promoted}} to brigadier general on 22 January 1946. Following the departure of Major General Thomas Farrell, Nichols became Groves' deputy, although he also continued as district engineer. Asked {{to spend more time}} on weapons production and storage, Nichols established a new underground assembly plant at the Mound Laboratories in Miamisburg, Ohio, and recommended that Sandia Base be transferred from the United States Army Air Corps to the Manhattan District. In December, Nichols recommended the closing <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> alpha tracks of the Y-12 plant, thereby cutting the payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2 million a month. Henceforth, uranium enrichment would be performed by the gaseous diffusion plants, the wartime K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946.|$|E
5|$|Tech punted, and Stanford's offense {{returned}} to the field. The two teams traded possessions one more time, with Stanford turning the ball over on downs after a failed fourth-down conversion attempt, and Virginia Tech returning the ball with another punt. Following the kick, Stanford's offense began work from its 14-yard line with 8:08 remaining in the quarter. Two plays gained fiveyards, then Luck completed a 21-yard pass to wide receiver Doug Baldwin for just the second first <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. On the next play, Stanford running back Jeremy Stewart broke free of the Virginia Tech defense {{and ran down the}} field 60yards for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave Stanford a 7–0 lead with 6:16 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The {{first play}} of the {{possession}} resulted in a five-yard penalty against Tech.

After the first down, Williams picked up two yards on a running play, but Texas lost that short gain when Brown fumbled the ball during the next play. Brown lost seven yards, but recovered the ball. On third down, Brown attempted to scramble for the first down, but was stopped short {{of the line of}} scrimmage. Texas' punt was fair caught at the 29-yard line, and Virginia Tech began its second possession.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{withdrawal}} of HMS Ark Royal in 1978, the Phantoms of the Fleet Air Arm were {{turned over to the}} RAF and used to form a second squadron at Leuchars. At the time, 111 Squadron was stationed there operating the FGR.2 version of the Phantom, having been there since 1975. In 1979, to save costs resulting from the differences between the FG.1 and FGR.2, the squadron converted to the ex-Navy aircraft and the FGR.2 airframes were distributed to other Phantom units. Both 43 and 111 Squadrons retained the FG.1 until 1989, when they converted to the new Tornado F.3. Following the standing <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two operational squadrons and the final withdrawal of the type from service, the bulk of the RAF's FG.1 Phantoms were scrapped. The RAF lost eight of their FG.1s in crashes throughout the type's twenty year service.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the Clemson 26-yard line, and the drive began with an incomplete pass from Dantzler.

A run by Dantzler gained three yards, then Zachery gained five more with a run to the left side. Zachery's run ran the final seconds off the clock in the first quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 140.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-score kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback, and Florida State's second {{possession}} of the game began at its 20-yard line. On first down, running back Greg Jones gained four yards. A second-down pass from Rix to Gardner gained 11 yards and the Seminoles' first first <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. They were unable to gain another first down, however, and punted {{for the second time in}} the game. During the return, Florida State was penalized five yards for violating the halo rule that required two yards between the player catching the ball and the nearest defender.

5|$|Following the turnover, Indiana's offense {{began work}} at its 32-yard line. Despite the {{opportunity}} {{presented by the}} interception, the Hoosiers were unable to gain a first down and punted back to Virginia Tech. Tech's Steve Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 27-yard line, and Tech's offense returned to the field. The Hokie offense was no more successful than Indiana's had been, and Tech punted after going three and out. Following the kick and a short return, the Hoosiers began work at their 41-yard line. After being stopped for no gain on two consecutive plays, Paci completed a long pass to Tech's 40-yard line for the Hoosiers' first first <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second half. Indiana continued advancing the ball via short passes, but came up oneyard short of a first down. Instead of punting on fourth down, Indiana attempted to gain the first down via a rush up the middle. Tech's defense held fast, and Indiana turned the ball over after failing to gain the needed yard.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group {{composed}} of nearly 500,000 Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the Rwandan Civil War. The group condemned the Hutu-dominated government {{for failing to}} democratize and confront the problems facing these refugees. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 Arusha Accords with the RPF. The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when Habyarimana's plane was shot down near Kigali Airport, killing him. The shooting <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane served as the catalyst for the Rwandan Genocide, which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government. Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.|$|E
5|$|Life {{expectancy}} in India is at 68 years, {{with life}} expectancy for women being 69.6 years and for men being 67.3. There are around 50 physicians per 100,000 Indians. The number of Indians living {{in urban areas}} has grown by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. Yet, in 2001, over 70% lived in rural areas. The level of urbanisation increased from 27.81% in 2001 Census to 31.16% in 2011 Census. The slowing <b>down</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall growth rate of population {{was due to the}} sharp decline in the growth rate in rural areas since 1991. According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population. The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among females and 82.14% among males. The rural urban literacy gap which was 21.2 percentage points in 2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011.
