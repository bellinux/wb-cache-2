Predicting <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> defects by analyzing changes in vibration signal of <b>gears</b> <b>pairs</b> in operation is a very reliable method. Therefore, a suitable vibration signal processing technique is necessary to extract defect information usually covered under noise of other <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> dynamic factors.

40|$|The {{lubrication}} regime in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> is usually elasto-hydrodynamic, i. e. solid deformations {{due to the}} fluid pressure are not negligible. It {{is well known that}} lubrication in <b>gear</b> <b>pairs</b> depends upon a number of kinematical parameters, so that it is a non stationary EHD problem. Moreover, it depends upon the dynamic response (i. e. the dynamic load) of the <b>gear</b> <b>pair</b> [1 - 5]. The problem of finding the dynamic response in gear systems, especially spur gears, has been studied by many research works. Most of them consider as the main source of vibration the time variation of the number of teeth pairs that are in contact at the same time. This fluctuation makes the transmission more stiff, when two pair of teeth are in contact, more deformable when only one pair is in contact. This behaviour can cause oscillations of the gears, and eventually detachment of the teeth in contact, with impacts and noise.
