5|$|A new remastered and {{expanded}} version of Live And Dangerous {{was released in}} 2011. As well as the full album, remastered by Andy Pearce and Matt Wortham, it featured two additional tracks that were not used, and a DVD with the Rainbow Theatre footage. The sleeve notes were written by Malcolm Dome and included a debate of <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> much of the album was live, and what was overdubbed.|$|E

5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|During an {{encounter}} with Jupiter in 1992, the Ulysses spacecraft detected a stream of dust-sized particles being ejected from the Jovian system. The dust in these discrete streams travels away from Jupiter at speeds upwards of several hundred kilometres per second, has an average particle size of 10Î¼m, and consists primarily of sodium chloride. Dust measurements by Galileo showed that these dust streams originate from Io, but <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> these form, whether from Io's volcanic activity or material removed from the surface, is unknown.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Dalton orally {{presented}} his first list of relative atomic weights {{for a number}} of substances. This paper was published in 1805, but he did not discuss there <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> he obtained these figures. The method was first revealed in 1807 by his acquaintance Thomas Thomson, in the third edition of Thomson's textbook, A System of Chemistry. Finally, Dalton published a full account in his own textbook, A New System of Chemical Philosophy, 1808 and 1810.|$|E

5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> this sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be {{the size of the}} territory of an individual. Other species of birds are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 11th century {{dispute over}} the cathedral {{graveyard}} had continued unabated and in 1217 Henry III's government decided to announce that the disputed land would be granted to the cathedral. A panel met to agree <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> the land should be divided, concluding that the division should run straight across the bailey; the far side was returned to the cathedral, making {{the remainder of the}} castle unusable from a military perspective. Henry thus ingratiated himself with the church and broke the power of the Beauchamps in the city by crippling their local fortress.|$|E

5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that when news arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} {{of this system}} with the rigid meter, and the stress patterns this implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his pronunciation with some precision; making the reasonable assumption that Orm's pronunciation {{was in no way}} unusual, this permits scholars of history of English to develop an exceptionally precise snapshot of <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> Middle English was pronounced in the Midlands {{in the second half of}} the twelfth century (Matthew 2004, p.936).|$|E
5|$|A {{transitional}} fossil is any fossilized {{remains of}} a life form that exhibits traits common to both an ancestral group and its derived descendant group. This is especially important where the descendant group is sharply differentiated by gross anatomy and mode of living from the ancestral group. These fossils serve {{as a reminder that}} taxonomic divisions are human constructs that have been imposed in hindsight on a continuum of variation. Because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, there is usually no way to know <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> close a transitional fossil is to the point of divergence. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that transitional fossils are direct ancestors of more recent groups, though they are frequently used as models for such ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Although 0 is {{divisible}} by 2 {{more times}} than any other number, it is not straightforward to quantify <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> many times that is. For any nonzero integer n, one may define the 2-adic order of n to be {{the number of times}} n is divisible by 2. This description does not work for 0; {{no matter how many times}} it is divided by 2, it can always be divided by 2 again. Rather, the usual convention is to set the 2-order of 0 to be infinity as a special case. This convention is not peculiar to the 2-order; it is one of the axioms of an additive valuation in higher algebra.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is {{the manner in which}} random battles are encountered. Like other Final Fantasy games, random battles occur on the world map. However, in Final Fantasy Tactics, random battles only occur in pre-set locations, marked in green on the world map. Passing over one of these spots may result in a random encounter. Another major aspect of battles is magical attacks. Certain magical attacks cause area of effect damage, and many of the more powerful magical attacks require several turns of charging. Hit Points of enemy units are also visible to the player (except in the case of certain bosses), allowing the player to know <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> much damage they still have to inflict on a particular unit.|$|E
5|$|As the {{electrons}} pass through this complex, four protons are pumped from the matrix into the intermembrane space. <b>Exactly</b> <b>how</b> this occurs is unclear, {{but it seems}} to involve conformational changes in complex I that cause the protein to bind protons on the N-side of the membrane and release them on the P-side of the membrane. Finally, {{the electrons}} are transferred from the chain of ironâsulfur clusters to a ubiquinone molecule in the membrane. Reduction of ubiquinone also contributes to the generation of a proton gradient, as two protons are taken up from the matrix as it is reduced to ubiquinol (QH2).|$|E

5|$|Deanesly and Grosjean's thesis was {{addressed}} and refuted by the textual research of Paul Meyvaert, following whose work most scholars {{have come to}} accept the Libellus as a genuine letter of Gregory. The only portion of the Libellus that Meyvaert could not accept as genuine was the chapter on marriage, which Meyvaert (like Boniface before him) believed {{could not have been}} written by Gregory. Meyvaert therefore pronounced this chapter to be the single interpolation in an otherwise genuine document. All subsequent scholarship up until the year 2008 has followed him on this point. In 2008 Ubl not only showed that the marriage chapter was in fact authored by Gregory, but he also explained <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> it was the Boniface and later historians came to misunderstand its meaning.|$|E
5|$|Many mental states {{seem to be}} {{experienced}} subjectively in different ways by different individuals. And it is characteristic of a mental state that it has some experiential quality, e.g. of pain, that it hurts. However, the sensation of pain between two individuals may not be identical, since {{no one has a}} perfect way to measure how much something hurts or of describing <b>exactly</b> <b>how</b> it feels to hurt. Philosophers and scientists therefore ask where these experiences come from. The existence of cerebral events, in and of themselves, cannot explain why they are accompanied by these corresponding qualitative experiences. The puzzle of why many cerebral processes occur with an accompanying experiential aspect in consciousness seems impossible to explain.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{surrounds}} Lake Phelps, North Carolina's {{second largest}} natural made lake. The lake, on a peninsula between Albemarle Sound and the Pamlico River, {{is one of}} a series of Carolina bay lakes that stretch from New Jersey to Florida along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. <b>Exactly</b> <b>how</b> the lakes were formed remains a mystery. What is known is that Lake Phelps is not fed by any stream, but relies entirely upon rain and springs to maintain its water level. Since the lake is not fed by a stream that could carry pollutants from nearby farms and factories, the water is very clean. Lake Phelps is five miles (8km) across, with an average depth of just 4.5feet (1.5m). The lake is thought to be more than 38,000 years old.|$|E
