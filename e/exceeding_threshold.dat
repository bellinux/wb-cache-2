5000|$|The Stever is a {{tributary}} of the Lippe which is fed by water out of the Dortmund-Ems Canal and has a huge meaning for drinking water supply for the northern Ruhr region. To balance the whole system the Stever - after being fed out of the canal in Senden - is backed-up in two water reservoirs (Talsperre Hullern and Halterner Stausee) of 32 Mio. m³ capacity. Two-thirds of the Stever flow is discharged downstream; one-third is used by the drinking water supplier Gelsenwasser AG for drinking water processing via soil infiltration from groundwater wells (of all together approximately 129 Mio. m³/year). Additionally the municipal utilities Stadtwerke Münster use water from the Dortmund-Ems Canal to supply the groundwater wells for drinking water processing. In total, via several water works annually 250 Mio. m³ of water are transported in pipework from the Ruhr to the area at the canals. [...] The regionally diversified origin and processing of drinking water - pumped water from Rhine and Ruhr, various groundwater wells, replenishment with infiltrated canal water - guarantees constantly the regional supply with water of highest quality in Ruhr and Münsterland region. Hereby it is also possible in case of calamities (like <b>exceeding</b> <b>threshold</b> values at certain groundwater wells) to substitute the water supply from other sources (like the infiltration of canal water).|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} tall {{buildings}} subject to wind actions {{can be developed}} {{in the framework of}} Performance-Based Wind Engineering (PBWE). The structural performances are described by a set of measurable attributes, the decision variables, which are functionally related to proper measures of the structural damage, in turn dependent on proper engineering demand parameters characterizing the structural response, and measures of the intensity of the wind field. In this paper, PBWE is applied to the assessment of the comfort requirement and the structural reliability for a 74 storey building. Probabilistic calculations of the structural response are carried out in frequency and time domains, and the parameters of the wind velocity field are calibrated {{on the basis of the}} time-histories of the global floor forces derived by experimental tests on a rigid 1 : 500 scale model of the building. The occupant comfort is related to the motion perception under moderate winds, and quantified by the probability of <b>exceeding</b> <b>threshold</b> values of the across-wind acceleration at the top of the building. The structural reliability is related to the lateral deformation capacity under strong winds, and quantified by the probability of <b>exceeding</b> <b>threshold</b> values of the maximum inter-storey drift ratio. The results of numerical analyses suggest the use of a tuned mass damper to enhance the building performances. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The COST Action TU 1406, Quality Control Specifications for Roadway Bridges – Standardization at a European Level (BridgeSpec) brings {{together}} experts from across Europe, to provide guidelines {{for setting up}} the Quality Control Plans by defining key performance indicators and corresponding performance goals with the purpose to ensure adequate service quality to road users at minimum costs. This Action started in June 2015. Management of road bridges comprises coordinated activities in order to generate the maximum value to the society, which involves the balance of costs, risks, opportunities and performance goals. Whether a performance goal is achieved or not, is given by the corresponding key performance indicators, which in turned can be evaluated from various underlying performance indicators. This requires a clear insight into {{the influence of the}} performance indicators to key performance indicators. Performance indicator may be a quantitative, measured parameter or a qualitative abstraction related to e. g. the condition of a bridge or its components. It can be therefore expressed either {{in the form of a}} dimensional parameter or as an ordinal index. The former quantitatively describes a specific property of the bridge (e. g. crack width), whereas the latter represent a combination of observations on and/or expert knowledge related to a particular bridge and/or its components (e. g. importance of a bridge component in the whole bridge structure). In order to determine whether the performance goals are met, thresholds or criteria must be set. A threshold constitutes a limiting criterion for purposes such as: (i) monitoring (e. g. <b>exceeding</b> <b>threshold</b> triggers different monitoring program), (ii) assessing (e. g. <b>exceeding</b> <b>threshold</b> triggers in-depth investigation), and (iii) maintenance (e. g. <b>exceeding</b> <b>threshold</b> triggers maintenance actions). A criterion can be also formulated as extremizing criterion: For instance, the criterion is met at the maximum reliability level for a given budgetary constraint. For purpose of defining the crisp key performance indicators, the identified performance indicators are categorized into technical, sustainable and socio-economic indicators. Furthermore, the performance indicators are coupled to component, system and network. This enables to more easily identify methods for their quantification and to determine their impact on a specific performance goal. This contribution provides an overview of a current effort to identify performance indicators, to define key performance indicators, to set-up corresponding performance goals and to provide a framework for the Quality Control Plan...|$|E

Examples of data processing and analysis are given to expound upon the ideas of how to describe precipitation patterns.

30|$|From the {{simulation}} {{we can see}} that the channel models are of randomness and multipath effect, so that the difference result corresponding to the right timing index is not always the maximum one. What's worse, when a threshold is selected, quantity of difference result <b>exceeding</b> <b>threshold</b> may be more than one or none on the contrary. For example, if we set the threshold as 60, the algorithm could obtain more than one timing samples in the situation of Figure 5 A, C, D. When we set a larger threshold, maybe the difference results are out of range, and no sample could be found out. Therefore, threshold is a key point for timing. And threshold should change as the channel environment changing.
