25|$|Aerogels are {{produced}} by extracting the liquid component of a gel through supercritical drying. This allows the liquid to be slowly dried off without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from capillary action, as would happen with conventional evaporation. The first aerogels were produced from silica gels. <b>Kistler's</b> later work involved aerogels based on alumina, chromia and tin dioxide. Carbon aerogels were first developed in the late 1980s.|$|R

He sang Schubert for Mottl, who was deeply impressed, and started {{planning}} {{to get him to}} Munich. Graf Spork, a friend of the Wahnfried house, was also interested, and Erb and Frau Boy-Ed attended a Bayreuth Parsifal with him.

5000|$|While {{some of the}} {{remaining}} cottages and estate outbuildings did become second homes, the resort plans were not successful as the four ski areas at nearby Aspen were attracting all the skiers and contributing to that city's renaissance {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. <b>Kistler's</b> death in 1960 also stalled the plans. In 1974 the mansion was purchased by Kenneth E Johnson a newspaper publisher from Grand Junction Colorado. He oversaw a major restoration of the buildings and for a time kept it as a family home. During this time tours of the building were open to the public. The mansion was later opened as a Bed and Breakfast and for special events such as weddings and conferences. In 1997 Johnson sold the property to a Canadian company. They soon defaulted on the mortgage for the property, and it was foreclosed and sold at auction.

As Gainer gets the hang of piloting a real Overman, he and Gain encounter shut-in Princess Anna, the Duke's daughter, who supports the Exodus and wants to see the world and people other than her tutor, Lioubov Smettana. Using an annual festival presented by idol singer and co-Exodus leader, Meeya Laujin, as cover, the Exodus executes their plan: take much of the Domepolis, block by block, using heavy hauler machines called Silhouette Mammoths and move them over 3000 km across the Siberian tundra to their ancestral homeland, [...] "Yapan".

5000|$|The Nutcracker {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Based on seven reviews, the film holds a rotten rating of 57% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, {{with an average}} rating of 6.3/10. The film was criticized by James Berardinelli for not capturing the excitement of a live performance; he wrote that it [...] "opts to present a relatively mundane version of the stage production... utilizing almost none of the advantages offered by the (film) medium." [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times criticized the film for not adapting the dance for a film audience and also its casting of Culkin who, he writes, [...] "seems peripheral {{to all of the}} action, sort of like a celebrity guest or visiting royalty, nodding benevolently from the corners of shots." [...] In The Washington Post, Lucy Linfield echoed Eberts criticism of Culkin, stating that [...] "its not so much that he cant act or dance; more important, the kid seems to have forgotten how to smile... All little Mac can muster is a surly grimace." [...] She praised the dancing, however, as [...] "strong, fresh and in perfect sync" [...] and <b>Kistlers</b> Sugar Plum Fairy as [...] "the Balanchinean ideal of a romantic, seemingly fragile beauty combined with a technique of almost startling strength, speed and knifelike precision." [...] The New York Times Stephen Holden also criticized Culkin, calling his performance the films [...] "only serious flaw", but praised the cinematography as [...] "very scrupulous in the way it establishes a mood of participatory excitement, then draws back far enough so that the classic ballet sequences choreographed by Balanchine and staged by Peter Martins can be seen in their full glory." ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the gait patterns of volunteers affected by hallux valgus and compares the results with volunteers free from {{this or any other}} foot related deformity. The reason for this study was to analyze the differences in gait patterns from a strictly biomechanical perspective by studying the various forces acting on a foot during locomotion and to determine the factors which {{play a major role in}} the gait of hallux valgus affected people. The study also aims to determine the impact of this deformity on the gait patterns of affected individuals, the chances of injury, potential for adverse impact of this deformity as the person gets older and available remedial solutions. The primary action studied was a normal walk executed by the volunteers at a normal walking speed. The various forces generated by the volunteers were measured using a <b>Kistler’s</b> force platform and the data generated was stored using a data acquisition board (DAQ). Further analysis of the graphs obtained was done using the Bioware software. The ground reaction forces, center of pressure, co-efficient of friction were the parameters which were analyzed and compared for both sets of individuals. The result of the investigation was that gait of hallux valgus individual gets altered, with a change in the center of pressure, ground reaction forces and co-efficient of friction as compared to normal healthy subject. The affected individuals walk was found to be less balanced and jerky. The people who have this deformity are most prone to ankle and knee injuries with increased risk of falling as the person gets older and the deformity is aggravated. The treatments methods available, their impact and after-effects are also considered. Only surgery is a long term solution and the diagnosis and treatment of the deformity requires a detailed study into every individual case...|$|R

25|$|The second film {{adaptation}} was a 1993 {{film of the}} New York City Ballet version, titled George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, with David Zinman {{conducting the}} New York City Ballet Orchestra. The director was Emile Ardolino, who had won the Emmy, Obie, and Academy Awards for filming dance, and was to die of AIDS later that year. Principal dancers included the Balanchine muse Darci <b>Kistler,</b> who played the Sugar Plum Fairy, Heather Watts, Damian Woetzel, and Kyra Nichols. Two well-known actors also took part: Macaulay Culkin appeared as the Nutcracker/Prince, and Kevin Kline served as the offscreen narrator. The soundtrack features the interpolated number from The Sleeping Beauty that Balanchine used in the production, and the music is heard on the album in the order that it appears in the film, not in the order that it appears in the original ballet.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, {{to develop}} the first aerogels, <b>Kistler</b> used {{a process known as}} {{supercritical}} drying which avoids a direct phase change. By increasing the temperature and pressure he forced the liquid into a supercritical fluid state where by dropping the pressure he could instantly gasify and remove the liquid inside the aerogel, avoiding damage to the delicate three-dimensional network. While this can be done with ethanol, the high temperatures and pressures lead to dangerous processing conditions. A safer, lower temperature and pressure method involves a solvent exchange. This is typically done by exchanging the initial aqueous pore liquid for a CO2-miscible liquid such as ethanol or acetone, then onto liquid carbon dioxide and then bringing the carbon dioxide above its critical point. A variant on this process involves the direct injection of supercritical carbon dioxide into the pressure vessel containing the aerogel. The end result of either process exchanges the initial liquid from the gel with carbon dioxide, without allowing the gel structure to collapse or lose volume.|$|E
