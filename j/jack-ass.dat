40|$|This {{piece of}} work {{objectified}} a historical analysis on the introduction and the widespread of coffee in the southern region of Minas Gerais. Considered as objects of historygraphic study were literary works, documents, journalistic, memorialistic, biographic, documental and didactic oriented texts. Yet another method used was the quantitative one, besides orally reported pieces of historical nature as well as life history which completed the official documentation. Our empiric investigation object was the southern side of Minas Gerais, the study’s theme being the historic development of coffee in such region. The widespread of coffee in the region caused the arisal of a new landscape profile- the coffee landscape. Self-supporting farms arised on sites formerly covered with untouched vegetation. It also caused many towns to expand, and railroads were multiplied substituting for the trails on which <b>jack-asses</b> were predominant. The first coffee cultures in the region were settled in Aiuruoca, JacuÃ­ and Baependi, by the SapucaÃ­ and Grande rivers valley in the late 1700 ’s, by the troopers which made the the limk between the south of Minas Gerais {{and the state of}} Rio de Janeiro. We inferred that the greatest barrier against the expansion of coffee in the south of Minas was the difficulties concerning transportation. The means of communication were then precarious and the distances to be covered were too long. Up {{until the end of the}} 19 th century both production and exportation were only modest due to rival producing areas which were closer to the embarkation harbours. With the beginning of the 20 th century came a new production dynamism, due to the railroads. It has been 200 years of coffee culture in the south of Minas Gerais, the greatest justification for the denomination â€œtraditional coffee producing region. â€coffee, rural complex, regional history,...|$|R

"The {{solitude}} seems {{intensified by}} the strange sounds of reptiles, [...] birds, and insects, {{and by the}} absence of larger creatures; of which [...] in the day-time, the only audible signs are the stampede of a herd [...] of kangaroo, or the rustle of a wallabi, or a dingo stirring the [...] grass as it creeps to its lair.

6000|$|On {{the morning}} of the sixteenth day out from St. Joseph we arrived at the {{entrance}} of Rocky Canyon, two hundred and fifty miles from Salt Lake. It was along in this wild country somewhere, and far from any habitation of white men, except the stage stations, that we came across the wretchedest type of mankind I have ever seen, up to this writing. I refer to the Goshoot Indians. From what we could see and all we could learn, they are very considerably inferior to even the despised Digger Indians of California; inferior to all races of savages on our continent; inferior to even the Terra del Fuegans; inferior to the Hottentots, and actually inferior in some respects to the Kytches of Africa. Indeed, I have been obliged to look the bulky volumes of Wood's [...] "Uncivilized Races of Men" [...] clear through in order to find a savage tribe degraded enough to take rank with the Goshoots. I find but one people fairly open to that shameful verdict. It is the Bosjesmans (Bushmen) of South Africa. Such of the Goshoots as we saw, along the road and hanging about the stations, were small, lean, [...] "scrawny" [...] creatures; in complexion a dull black like the ordinary American negro; their faces and hands bearing dirt which they had been hoarding and accumulating for months, years, and even generations, according to the age of the proprietor; a silent, sneaking, treacherous looking race; taking note of everything, covertly, like all the other [...] "Noble Red Men" [...] that we (do not) read about, and betraying no sign in their countenances; indolent, everlastingly patient and tireless, like all other Indians; prideless beggars--for if the beggar instinct were left out of an Indian he would not [...] "go," [...] any more than a clock without a pendulum; hungry, always hungry, and yet never refusing anything that a hog would eat, though often eating what a hog would decline; hunters, but having no higher ambition than to kill and eat <b>jack-ass</b> rabbits, crickets and grasshoppers, and embezzle carrion from the buzzards and cayotes; savages who, when asked if they have the common Indian belief in a Great Spirit show a something which almost amounts to emotion, thinking whiskey is referred to; a thin, scattering race of almost naked black children, these Goshoots are, who produce nothing at all, and have no villages, and no gatherings together into strictly defined tribal communities--a people whose only shelter is a rag cast on a bush to keep off a portion of the snow, and yet who inhabit one of the most rocky, wintry, repulsive wastes that our country or any other can exhibit.|$|E

It lies 25 mi upriver of the Humen Strait and {{historically}} about 12 mi east of the walled city of Guangzhou proper, although Guangzhou has since expanded so greatly that Puzhou forms part of its city center.

5000|$|In the 19th century {{this species}} was {{commonly}} called the [...] "laughing jackass", a name first recorded (as Laughing <b>Jack-Ass)</b> in An Account of the English Colony in New South Wales by David Collins {{which was published}} in 1798. In 1858 the ornithologist John Gould used [...] "great brown kingfisher", a name that had been coined by John Latham in 1782. Another popular name was [...] "laughing kingfisher". The name in several Australian indigenous languages were listed by European authors including Go-gan-ne-gine by Collins in 1878, Cuck'anda by René Lesson in 1828 and Gogera or Gogobera by George Bennett in 1834. In {{the early years of the}} 20th century [...] "kookaburra" [...] was included as an alternative name in ornithological publications but it was not until 1926 in the second edition of the Official Checklist of Birds of Australia that the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union officially adopted the name [...] "laughing kookaburra". The name comes from Wiradhuri, an Aboriginal language now effectively extinct.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was never}} {{revealed}} throughout the series how Cotton became such a nasty and rude character, {{or if he}} ever was a different person. It is most likely his childhood (the only things known about Cotton's childhood are: that he {{started out with a}} gun at an early age according to Hank in the episode [...] "How to Fire A Rifle Without Really Trying", that he attended Fort Birk when he was very young and spent much of his childhood there as he reveled in [...] "An Officer and A Gentle Boy", that he apparently joined the army when he was only 14 years old, and that Cotton's mother apparently died giving birth to him, as he exaggerates in [...] "Death Picks Cotton"). Almost nothing is known about Cotton's father, except that he may have been German, as Peggy tells Bobby in the episode [...] "Tears of an Inflatable Clown", and it is possible that Cotton's father may have also been a war hero who may have served in the First World War and is the one who inspired Cotton to become one himself. The only time Cotton ever himself refers to his father during the entire series is when he shouts at Hank: [...] "You ain't my daddy, I'm your daddy!" [...] Cotton also has an unnamed brother (Dusty's father). Cotton has shown on multiple episodes that he suffers from mild to severe post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) ("Returning Japanese" [...] & [...] "Death Picks Cotton") which can explain for majority of his [...] "violent outbursts". Whatever the reason is, Cotton never sought recognition for how he treated Hank, Peggy, Tilly and many others throughout the series. In the episode [...] "Hank gets Dusted" [...] Hank says straight up to his cousin Dusty that Cotton is in fact a <b>jack-ass.</b>|$|E
