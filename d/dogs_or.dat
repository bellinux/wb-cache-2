5|$|In the 1830s, the 10th Earl of Home and his nephews the 5th Duke of Buccleuch and Lord John Scott, had {{imported}} progenitors of {{the breed}} from Newfoundland to Europe {{for use as}} gundogs. Another early advocate of these Newfoundland <b>dogs,</b> <b>or</b> Labrador Retrievers as they later became known, was the 2nd Earl of Malmesbury who bred them for their expertise in waterfowling.|$|E

5|$|Cagebirds such as canaries, budgerigars, cockatoos, lovebirds, quails, finches, and parrots {{are popular}} pets, whether for their song, their behaviour, their {{colourful}} plumage, or {{their ability to}} mimic speech. Among reasons for their popularity {{is that they can}} be kept in homes too small or otherwise unsuitable for <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> cats. The cagebird trade {{in some parts of the}} world threatens certain species with extinction, when birds are illegally captured in the wild. For example, in Indonesia, at least 13 species are close to extinction including the Indonesian national bird, the Javan hawk-eagle, while five subspecies including the scarlet-breasted lorikeet may have become extinct in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Cats have {{excellent}} hearing and can detect an extremely {{broad range of}} frequencies. They can hear higher-pitched sounds than either <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> humans, detecting frequencies from 55Hz to 79,000Hz, a range of 10.5octaves, while humans and dogs both have ranges of about 9octaves. Cats can hear ultrasound, which is important in hunting because many species of rodents make ultrasonic calls. However, they do not communicate using ultrasound like rodents do. Cats' hearing is also sensitive and among the best of any mammal, being most acute {{in the range of}} 500Hz to 32kHz. This sensitivity is further enhanced by the cat's large movable outer ears (their pinnae), which both amplify sounds and help detect the direction of a noise.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contests}} between {{animals are}} now regarded as sports for example, horse racing {{is regarded as}} both a sport and {{an important source of}} entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on Melbourne Cup Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, camel racing requires human riders, while greyhound racing does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or <b>dogs,</b> <b>or</b> untrained, like cockroaches.|$|E

5|$|The Saluki was {{historically}} bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated. Images {{of running}} dogs with long, narrow bodies adorn pottery found in Susa {{that dates back}} to 6,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia, with one writer suggesting that these might depict the ancestor of the Saluki, despite the depictions bearing erect, pointed ears. Salukis and Greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom (2134 BC–1785 BC) onward, however it was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to prominence, replacing the Tesem (thought to be similar to modern Pariah <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> a generic term for a dog) in ancient Egyptian art. The breed spread southward into the Sudan.|$|E
5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is thought}} to be monogamous, though its {{breeding}} habits have not been much studied. There is evidence of cooperative breeding, with some mated pairs being assisted by up to several other helper birds. These individuals help feed young and defend the nest. These pairs or small groups defend their territory from intruders, mobbing and chasing raptors and other birds, and occasionally <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> people. They may attack animals (and people) that venture too close to the nest, with one bird coming front-on while the other may approach from behind.|$|E

5|$|Although {{potentially}} dangerous objects and money were confiscated and stored when a prisoner first entered the Bastille, most wealthy prisoners continued {{to bring in}} additional luxuries, including pet <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> cats to control the local vermin. The Marquis de Sade, for example, arrived with an elaborate wardrobe, paintings, tapestries, a selection of perfume, {{and a collection of}} 133 books. Card games and billiards were played among the prisoners, and alcohol and tobacco were permitted. Servants could sometimes accompany their masters into the Bastille, as in the cases of the 1746 detention of the family of Lord Morton and their entire household as British spies: the family's domestic life continued on inside the prison relatively normally. The prisoners' library had grown during the 18th century, mainly through ad hoc purchases and various confiscations by the Crown, until by 1787 it included 389 volumes.|$|E
5|$|According to the UK Government review, the Burns Inquiry (published in 2000), hare {{coursing}} {{was taking place}} in Pakistan, Portugal and Spain. Pakistan has officially prohibited the use of <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> hawks for coursing unless a special licence is issued for carrying out such activity although, according to some reports, {{hare coursing}} is still practised and popular. Hare coursing in Portugal is run in both forms: open (Prova de Galgos a Campo), and closed (park) coursing where it is known as lebre a corricão. Hare coursing in Portugal may only be legally undertaken with two dogs and operates under the same ethos as coursing in the United States. In Spain, the hare coursing is open coursing, and the areas where the activity takes place includes the Medinrua area. Coursing has long been undertaken in Spain, where Spanish galgos rather than greyhounds are used. These dogs have a precarious life after their coursing careers, with World Animal Protection suggesting that many tens of thousands die cruelly each year. Hare coursing also takes place in Russia but is illegal in most European countries and in Australia, where it {{had a long history}} from 1867 until it was banned in 1985 following a long decline in popularity.|$|E
5|$|Schnauzers have a {{specific}} groom cut that is standard among the Schnauzer breed. Schnauzers require regular grooming, either by stripping (mostly seen in show <b>dogs),</b> <b>or</b> by clipping (a short-cut usually reserved for family pets). Stripping removes the loose, dead coat; it may be done by hand, called finger stripping, or plucking, or with a stripping knife; either way, it is a laborious process. Many Miniature Schnauzers who are family pets have regular grooming appointments to have their hair clipped; clipping, using a mechanical clippers (or shaver), produces a soft, silky, skin-close trim. Whether stripped or clipped, the coat is close at the body, and falls into a fringe-like foundation on its undercarriage, called furnishings, which can be left to grow, but must be combed regularly. All Schnauzers, whether they are Miniatures, Standards, or Giants, often sport a beard, created by allowing the hair around their noses to grow out. Left unclipped or unstripped, the body hair will grow two to four inches, and will often tangle into mats and curls.|$|E

5|$|While most ants have poor eyesight, Myrmecia ants have {{excellent}} vision. This trait {{is important to}} them, since Myrmecia primarily relies on visual cues for navigation. These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away. Winged alates are only active during the day, as they can see better. Members of a colony have different eye structures due to each individual fulfilling different tasks, and nocturnal species have larger ommatidia in comparison to those that are active during the day. Facet lenses also vary in size; for example, the diurnal species M. croslandi has a smaller lens in comparison to M. nigriceps and M. pyriformis which have larger lenses. Myrmecia ants have three photoreceptors that can see UV light, meaning {{they are capable of}} seeing colours that humans cannot. Their vision is said to be better than some mammals, such as cats, <b>dogs</b> <b>or</b> wallabies. Despite their excellent vision, worker ants of this genus find it difficult to find their nests at night, due to the difficulty of finding the landmarks they use to navigate. They are thus more likely to return to their nests the following morning, walking slowly with long pauses.|$|E
5|$|With {{her right}} leg held {{straight}} and her left leg bent a little (the pratyalidha stance), Chhinnamasta stands in a fighting posture on the love-deity couple of Kamadeva (Kama)– a symbol of sexual lust– and his wife Rati, who are engaged in copulation with the latter usually on the top (viparita-rati sex position). Kamadeva is generally blue-complexioned, while Rati is white. Below the couple is a lotus with an inverted triangle, and in the background is a cremation ground. The Chhinnamasta Tantra describes the goddess sitting on the couple, rather than standing on them. Sometimes, Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine couple of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath the couple is sometimes replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling couple is sometimes omitted entirely. Sometimes Shiva– the goddess's consort– is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him. <b>Dogs</b> <b>or</b> jackals drinking the blood sometimes appear in the scene. Sometimes Chhinnamasta is depicted standing on a lotus, a grass patch, or the ground.|$|E
