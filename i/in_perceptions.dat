5|$|Although {{problems}} with sexual function {{that result from}} SCI {{play a part in}} some divorces, they are not as important as emotional maturity in determining the success of a marriage. People with SCI get divorced more often {{than the rest of the}} population, and marriages that took place before the injury fail more often than those that took place after (33% vs. 21%). People married before the injury report less happy marriages and worse sexual adjustment than those married after, possibly indicating that spouses had difficulty adjusting to the new circumstances. For those who chose to become involved with someone after an injury, the disability was an accepted part of the relationship from the outset. Understanding and acceptance of the limitations that result from the injury on the part of the uninjured partner is an important factor in a successful marriage. Many divorces have been found to be initiated by the injured partner, sometimes due to the depression and denial that often occurs early after the injury. Thus counseling is important, not just for managing changes in self-perception but <b>in</b> <b>perceptions</b> about relationships.|$|E

Four categories of alterations <b>in</b> <b>perception</b> could be identified: increase in the quality of perception, comprehension of interdependences <b>in</b> <b>perception</b> processing, cessation of subject/object-based perception, and nonconceptual perception.

25|$|Much of the {{symbolism}} Jesus {{used in the}} New Testament revolved around the pastoral culture of Israel, and explained {{his relationship with his}} followers as analogous to that of a good shepherd protecting his flock from wolves. An innovation in the popular image of wolves started by Jesus includes the concept of the wolf in sheep's clothing, which warns people against false prophets. Several authors have proposed that Jesus's portrayal of wolves, comparing them to dangerous and treacherous people, was an important development <b>in</b> <b>perceptions</b> on the species, which legitimized centuries of subsequent wolf persecution in the western world. Subsequent medieval Christian literature followed and expanded upon Biblical teachings on the wolf. It appeared in the seventh century edition of the Physiologus, which infused pagan tales with the spirit of Christian moral and mystical teaching. The Physiologus portrays wolves as being able to strike men dumb on sight, and of having only one cervical vertebra. Dante included a she-wolf, representing greed and fraud, in the first canto of the Inferno. The Malleus Maleficarum, first published in 1487, states that wolves are either agents of God sent to punish the wicked, or agents of Satan, sent with God's blessing to test the faith of believers.|$|E

Prior to the attack, targeted killing was a criminal offense.|$|E
500|$|Between the 8th and 11th centuries, [...] "three major {{cultural}} divisions" [...] {{had emerged}} in Great Britain: the English, the Scots and the Welsh, the earlier Brittonic Celtic polities in what are today England and Scotland having finally been absorbed into Anglo-Saxon England and Gaelic Scotland {{by the early}} 11th century. The English had been unified under a single nation state in 937 by King Athelstan of Wessex after the Battle of Brunanburh. Before then, the English (known then in Old English as the Anglecynn) were under the governance of independent Anglo-Saxon petty kingdoms which gradually coalesced into a Heptarchy of seven powerful states, {{the most powerful of}} which were Mercia and Wessex. Scottish historian and archaeologist Neil Oliver said that the Battle of Brunanburh would [...] "define the shape of Britain into the modern era", it was a [...] "showdown for two very different ethnic identities – a Norse Celtic alliance versus Anglo Saxon. It aimed to settle once and for all whether Britain would be controlled by a single imperial power or remain several separate independent kingdoms, a split <b>in</b> <b>perceptions</b> which is still very much with us today". However, historian Simon Schama suggested that it was Edward I of England who was solely [...] "responsible for provoking the peoples of Britain into an awareness of their nationhood" [...] in the 13th century. Scottish national identity, [...] "a complex amalgam" [...] of Gaelic, Brittonic, Pictish, Norsemen and Anglo-Norman origins, was not finally forged until the Wars of Scottish Independence against the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.|$|E

2500|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{called the}} teen timetable {{has been used}} to measure the age at which individuals believe adolescents should be able to engage in behaviors associated with autonomy. This questionnaire {{has been used to}} gauge differences in cultural perceptions of adolescent autonomy, finding, for instance, that White parents and adolescents tend to expect autonomy earlier than those of Asian descent. [...] It is, therefore, clear that cultural differences exist <b>in</b> <b>perceptions</b> of adolescent autonomy, and such differences have implications for the lifestyles and development of adolescents. In sub-Saharan African youth, the notions of individuality and freedom may not be useful in understanding adolescent development. Rather, African notions of childhood and adolescent development are relational and interdependent.|$|E
2500|$|Boys' love manga has {{received}} considerable critical attention, especially after translations of BL became commercially available outside Japan in the 21st century. Different critics and commentators have had very {{different views of}} BL. In 1983, Frederik L. Schodt, an American manga writer and translator, has observed that portrayals of gay male relationships had used and further developed bisexual themes already in existence in shoujo manga to appeal to their female audience. Japanese critics have viewed boys' love as a genre that permits their audience to avoid adult female sexuality by distancing sex from their own bodies, {{as well as to}} create fluidity <b>in</b> <b>perceptions</b> of gender and sexuality and rejects [...] "socially mandated" [...] gender roles as a [...] "first step toward feminism."

The [...] "think manager – think male" [...] phenomenon reflects gender stereotypes and status beliefs that associate greater status worthiness and competence with men than women. Gender status beliefs shape men's and women's assertiveness, the attention and evaluation their performances receive, and the ability attributed {{to them on the}} basis of performance. They also [...] "evoke a gender-differentiated double standard for attributing performance to ability, which differentially biases the way men and women assess their own competence at tasks that are career relevant, controlling for actual ability." ...|$|E

2500|$|There was {{a gender}} gap <b>in</b> <b>perceptions</b> to the case. According to a USA Today/Gallup Poll of 1,010 respondents, {{about two-thirds of}} Americans (64 percent) {{believed}} Casey Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] or [...] "probably" [...] murdered her daughter; however, women {{were much more likely}} than men to believe the murder charges against Anthony and to be upset by the not-guilty verdict. The poll reported that women were more than twice as likely as men, 28 percent versus 11 percent, to think Anthony [...] "definitely" [...] committed murder. Twenty-seven percent of women said they were angry about the verdict, compared with nine percent of men. On the day Casey Anthony was sentenced for lying to investigators in the death of her daughter, supporters and protesters gathered outside the Orange County Courthouse, with one man who displayed a sign asking Anthony to marry him. Two men who drove overnight from West Virginia held signs that said, [...] "We love and support you Casey Anthony," [...] and [...] "Nancy Grace, stop trying to ruin innocent lives. The jury has spoken. P.S. Our legal system still works!" [...] The gender gap has partly been explained by [...] "the maternal instinct". The idea of a mother murdering her own child is a threat to the ideal of motherhood. For example, the trial was compared to the 1960s trial of Alice Crimmins, who was accused of murdering her two small children.|$|E

In addition, the results suggested that perceptual training paradigms have behavioral benefits and genes can influence the effect of perceptual training on brain function.
