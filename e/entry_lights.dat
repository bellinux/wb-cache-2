50|$|The term PEL is a {{generalized}} trademark of the Physics and Engineering Laboratory which {{was part of}} the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR), a New Zealand public research facility. Vega Industries was established in 1972, to design the first PEL to safely navigate into the Paremata Harbour in New Zealand. When viewed from above the water, the entrance to Paremata Harbor appears wide however a semi submerged reef makes it very hazardous. Traditionally a 2 tower lead light system would be used for such an approach however this was not possible because of a cliff which made construction unsuitable for the front tower. Norman Rumsey, an optical designer and astronomer was head of the Physics and Engineering Laboratory (PEL) at the time and used his background in telescope design to create the PEL for the Paremata Harbor project. The solution was a weather proof projector sector light which used colored filters instead of slides to illuminate safe passage during the day. If the mariner could see white light, they knew they were approaching the harbor on the correct heading. If the mariner saw red light, they would need to change course immediately to avoid collision with the Tokaapapa Reef which is semi submerged at high tide. Consequentially of having their origins in the Physics and Engineering Department, projector style beacons are now called PELs although they are often marketed as Port <b>Entry</b> <b>Lights.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} role of calcium in anxiety {{and its effect on}} {{anxiolytic}} activity of diazepam and verapamil. Materials and Methods: Study was conducted using female albino rats in light and dark arena; a nonconflicting animal experimental model for anxiety. Animals were divided into six groups with six animals in each group. Test drugs, calcium gluconate (10 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), verapamil (5 mg/kg), calcium &#x 002 B; diazepam, and calcium &#x 002 B; verapamil were administered intraperitoneally. Percentage of time spent in light arena and number of <b>entries</b> into <b>light</b> arena were the two parameters observed for 5 min after 30 min of drug administration. ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Compared to the control group, diazepam group, and calcium group, only calcium &#x 002 B; diazepam group showed considerable increase in mean percentage of time spent in light arena. However, this increase was statistically insignificant. In the case of total number of <b>entries</b> into <b>light</b> arena, animals in calcium &#x 002 B; diazepam group showed statistically significant increase in total number of <b>entries</b> into <b>light</b> arena when compared to calcium group and diazepam group. Conclusion: Results of the study suggest that calcium may enhance the anxiolytic activity of diazepam, but has no effect on anxiolytic activity of verapamil...|$|R

60|$|The parsonage was of {{only one}} story, with a steep, sloping roof.

Then a door opened softly, a white vision stole into the little <b>entry</b> <b>lighted</b> by the fan-window, above, seized the book and stole back. Had the minister been a prying man about his household, he would have noticed next day that Cynthia's candle was burned down to the socket.

40|$|A simple {{description}} of the disruption and deceleration of 100 -m- to 5 -km-diameter comets striking Jupiter is combined with numerical simulations of the subsequent explosions to predict the fate of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9. Detailed numerical simulations of the first 3 min of the explosion were performed. Our numerical simulations begin either with hot cylinders with dimensions suggested by the disruption and deceleration model or with an initial wake constructed from a moving line charge. In all cases, extensive plumes of hot gas are expelled from the atmosphere. The models with wakes evolve about {{twice as fast as}} the initially confined models. Models of both types generate similar pressure waves into the planet. Temperatures and negative hydrogen ion opacities were computed. For atmospheric <b>entry,</b> <b>light</b> curves were computed. On entry the largest bolides could be very bright, possibly as bright as Jupiter for observers placed to see them, although for kilometer-size impactors the luminosity peak is obscured by clouds. For the fireball, light curves were computed from the numerical simulations. Metals from the vaporized comet provide electrons that dramatically increase the opacity of Jovian air at low temperature. The fireball rises through and above the atmosphere, brightening at first as its surface area increases, but later fading to invisibility as its temperature drops and its opacity plummets...|$|R

50|$|Because {{the light}} rail network {{evolved from the}} tram network instead of {{replacing}} it, there were numerous stations served by both light rail and tram vehicles for almost three decades. While high platforms for stepless <b>entry</b> into <b>light</b> rail vehicles could be built on the outer branches, stations in the city center had to have low platforms to support trams as well. The introduction of low-floor technology in the early 1990s promised wheelchair-accessible entry throughout the network without having to build several hundred high platforms. To allow the introduction of low-floor trains without having to demolish existing high platforms, the network was divided into two sub-networks of different floor heights.|$|R
