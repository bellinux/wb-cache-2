50|$|His {{books and}} {{articles}} on fur farming accelerated the industry's potential. With the depletion of the beaver in Canada, the growing demand for <b>fur</b> <b>articles,</b> {{and the development of}} new dyeing techniques (which allowed mock furs to be made from cheaper pelts), the easily obtained, how-to information that Harding offered helped to quickly expand the home enterprise of raising furbearers. Harding's motives for supporting this business were not entirely profit-driven: he believed that fur farming would help reduce the pressure on wild populations, which were being destroyed through habitat depletion, and save the furbearers from extinction.|$|E
50|$|Jacobs {{was often}} mocked by fellow radio personalities and {{audience}} members {{because of his}} odd personality quirks. He was known to have an enormous collection of hats (a lot of them fur) that he wore on the air along with other <b>fur</b> <b>articles</b> of clothing he can be seen wearing at Laker home games. He wears his hair long and usually out or in a ponytail. According to Jacobs, his hair growth comes from a bet he made with Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. According to Jacobs, the bet states that Jacobs will cut his hair when Bryant retires from basketball {{as a member of}} the Lakers. He also has a large walrus mustache and muttonchops.|$|E
50|$|The Warsaw-based {{store was}} the largest shop in Poland and both stores were {{considered}} to be among the most luxurious and reputable in Poland, much like their foreign counterparts, Galeries Lafayette, Harrods or Selfridges. There were tourist attractions of both cities. The company dealt with garments, underwear, textiles, silk, bedding, china, perfumes, as well as shoes, <b>furs</b> and <b>articles</b> for daily use. In addition, both stores housed art galleries and small cinemas.|$|R

50|$|Poland-Lithuania {{played a}} {{significant}} role in the supply of 16th century Western Europe by the export of three sorts of goods, notably grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and <b>fur.</b> These three <b>articles</b> amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland- and maritime trade.|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of the traditional domestic leather processing methods used in Estonia throughout history, as well as the research papers on leather processing that have been published or have yet to be published in Estonian. There is also an overview of the main leather processing and tanning methods (vegetable tanning, alum tawing and flour tanning). Based  on her own experience, the author gives a detailed description of traditional leather processing with fermented cereal puddle (flour tanning) as {{one of the oldest and}} most widespread methods of processing hides with <b>fur.</b> The <b>article</b> also gives an overview of the current situation of traditional leather processing using domestic methods in Estonia...|$|R
6000|$|... "This great trade, {{carried on}} by caravans to Santa Fe, {{annually}} loads one hundred wagons with merchandise, which is bartered {{in the northern}} provinces or Mexico for cash and for beaver <b>furs.</b> The numerous <b>articles</b> excluded as contraband, and the exorbitant duties laid upon all those that are admitted by the Mexican government, present so many obstacles to commerce, that I am well persuaded, that if a post, such as is here suggested, should be established on the Arkansas, it would become the place of deposit, {{not only for the}} present trade, but for one infinitely more extended. Here the Mexicans might purchase their supplies, and might well afford to sell them at prices which would silence all competition from any other quarter.|$|R
50|$|In 1569 the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth {{formed through}} {{the union of}} the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was {{dominated}} by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland-Lithuania {{played a significant role}} in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and <b>fur.</b> These three <b>articles</b> amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade. The Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called Constitution of 3 May, declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the United States Constitution). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the Szlachta, were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged.|$|R
5000|$|Winterberg {{published}} a refutation of these conclusions in 2004, observing that the galley proofs of Hilbert's articles had been tampered with [...] - [...] {{part of one}} page had been cut off. He argued that the removed part of the article contained the equations that Einstein later {{published a}}nd alleged that {{it was part of}} a [...] "crude attempt by some unknown individual to falsify the historical record." [...] He alleged that Science had refused to print the article and thus he was forced to publish it in Zeitschrift <b>für</b> Naturforschung. Winterberg's <b>article</b> argued that despite the missing part of the proofs, that the correct crucial Field Equation is still imbedded on other pages of the proofs, in various forms, including Hilbert's variational principle with correct Lagrangian from which the Field Equation is immediately derived. Winterberg presented his findings at the American Physical Society meeting in Tampa, Florida in April 2005.|$|R
50|$|On 10 September 1855 Bernstein arrived {{again in}} Java. Here he {{immediately}} {{became the first}} physician of the Health Establishment at Gadok near Buitenzorg (Jakarta), and remained in post until 31 October 1860. Directly after arriving in Indonesia, Bernstein began collecting (either alone or with local guides) and on 8 October 1856 the first consignment of skins arrived at Leiden (some 300 birds). Bernstein also started publishing <b>articles</b> in Journal <b>für</b> Ornithologie. His <b>articles</b> there between 1859-1861 on the nests and eggs of Javanese birds so impressed Hermann Schlegel, director of the museum at Leiden, that he invited Bernstein {{to work for the}} museum to collect zoological items. Bernstein was duly appointed in March 1859 as official collector for the Dutch government, and in this new role he began to collect a wide range of both flora (now in the herbaria of Wrocław) and fauna. In November 1860 he got permission from the Governor-General Jan Jacob Rochussen granted to travel to New Guinea, the first researcher in this region after the departure from Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn and the death of Carl Anton Ludwig Maria Schwaner in 1851. On 7 November Bernstein departed for the Moluccas, arriving a month later at Ternate (Halmahera), where he collected birds for eight days and set up “home”.|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, West Germany {{started with}} {{preparations}} for rearmament (Wiederbewaffnung) in 1950, as ordered by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer. After {{the outbreak of}} the Korean War, the United States called for a West German contribution to the defence of Western Europe (against the Soviet Union). Initially Gerhard Graf von Schwerin, a former Wehrmacht General, advised the Chancellor on these issues and led the preparations, but after Count Schwerin had talked to the press about his work, he was replaced by Theodor Blank, who was appointed as [...] "Special Representative" [...] of the Chancellor. As the rearmament plans met with harsh opposition by a wide circle within the West German population and contradicted the occupation statute, the government office responsible for the rearmament acted secretly, unofficially known as Amt Blank. By 1955, the number of employees had surpassed 1,300. On 7 June 1955 the office became the Ministry of Defence, or Bundesministerium für Verteidigung in German. The Bundeswehr was established and Germany joined the NATO the same year. In 1956, Germany reintroduced conscription, and the German military force quickly became the largest conventional military force in Western Europe. To confirm the ministrys importance, it was renamed Bundesministerium der Verteidigung on 30 December 1961, similar to the German names of the [...] "classic" [...] ministries of Finance, the Interior and Justice [...] - [...] though the federal minister is still denoted as Bundesminister <b>für</b> Verteidigung in <b>Article</b> 65a of the German Constitution.|$|R
5000|$|The Germans {{rolled into}} the city on 24-26 June 1941 amid bombing and shelling. No Jewish relocations were ordered, but anti-Jewish {{measures}} were imposed right away to ensure isolation. Hundreds of men were rounded up and brought into the municipal stadium where they were beaten and killed during interrogations which lasted for one week. Soon thereafter, Gebietskommissar Gerhard Erren, the German commandant of Słonim, appointed in August, ordered {{the creation of the}} Judenrat with eleven members, to carry out his orders. Judenrat [...] president, Wolf Berman, an 80-year-old former bank director, was forced to collect a ransom of 2 million roubles in gold. The lump-sum payment went into private hands and the entire Jewish council was executed. Other prominent members of the community feared to join the Judenrat lest they share their fate. The new council was made responsible for organizing and supplying forced labour. The Jewish Ghetto Police was also created, with 30 uniformed men. As of 12 July 1941 Słonim Jews were ordered to wear the Star of David on their outer garments. All Jews living around the city centre were evicted, and moved across the bridge over the Szczara River to a brand new ghetto in the Na Wyspie (literally On Island) neighbourhood, surrounded by barbed wire and guards at both gates. Meanwhile, the second group of Judenrat members were all, like their predecessors, executed on 14 November 1941. After each shooting, self-enrichment among the perpetrators began immediately. On one occasion, Oberleutnant Glück sent a full boxcar with Jewish valuables to his hometown of Rosenheim under armed escort, particularly <b>fur</b> coats and <b>articles</b> made from precious metals.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} usage of the new {{spelling}} rules in the complex area of separate and compound spelling. This area was a main topic in the reform of German orthography 1996 / 98. The old rules {{can be characterized as}} a complex and incoherent system. The primary ambition in defining new rules for separate and compound spelling was to simplify the writing process in order to facilitate an easier usage of written language for the German speaking community. The basic concept of the new rules is the declaration of separate spelling as the default, making compound spelling the exception. As a consequence, most words of the German vocabulary, which were spelled as compounds before, are now to be spelled separately. The publication of the new rules for this orthographic area in the year 1996 caused a lot of criticism amongst linguists, the main point of criticism being that words, which grew together on the basis of grammatical processes, had been robbed of their status as words. They are now word-groups in which the two parts do not belong together and have their own individual status and meaning in the sentence. These rules are in opposition to the productive tendency of ?Univerbierung? in the German written language. This means a process whereby words, which stand next to each other in a written text, grow together under special conditions. This thesis has two main aims: The first aim is to define the system of separate and compound spelling as a combination of grammatical and orthographic aspects. It will be shown how grammatical categories are influencing the orthography of these words. Additionally, it will be shown how the new rules produce spellings which are grammatically incorrect. The second is to verify the prognosis that the new rules were not accepted by the German language community. This thesis presents the results of a corpus analysis drawn from the text corpora of contemporary German language which is available on the website of the Institut <b>für</b> deutsche Sprache. <b>Articles</b> from six different newspapers were analyzed to see if and how the new rules for the groups verb and verb, adjective and verb and noun and verb were used in these texts. The results of this research have been compiled for the period of time from August 1999 to December 2000 (Corpus 1) and August 1999 to June 2003 (Corpus 2). It was uncovered that {{for more than half of}} the analyzed verbs the new rules were not used consistently. The divergence from the spelling norms ranged from 10 to 50 percent. In particular the group adjective and verb showed a high deviation from the new rules for compound and separate spelling. These results can be explained both with semantic and syntactic reasoning...|$|R
