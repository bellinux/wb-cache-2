5000|$|The terms 'Witan' and 'Witenagemot' are {{increasingly}} avoided by modern historians, although few would {{go as far}} as Geoffrey Hindley, who described 'witenagemot' as an [...] "essentially Victorian" [...] coinage. The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England prefers 'King's Council', but adds that it was known in Old English as the 'witan'. John Maddicott regarded the word witan with suspicion, even though it is used in sources such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: But the word carries with it, however unjustifiably, a fustian air of decayed scholarship, and, in addition, its use may seem to prejudge the answer to an important question: <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> an institution, a capitalized 'Witan', as it were, or merely a lower-case ad hoc gathering of the wise men who were the king's councillors? ...|$|E

40|$|Cinema Theory has for a {{long time}} been haunted by the question: is noir a genre of its own kind or a kind of {{anamorphic}} distortion affecting different genres? From the very beginning, noir was not limited to hard-boiled detective stories: reverberations of noir motifs are easily discernible in comedies (Arsenic and Old Lace), in westerns (Pursued), in political and social dramas (All the King’s Men, The Lost Weekend), etc. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> a secondary impact of something that originally constitutes a genre of its own (the noir crime universe), or is the crime film only one of the possible fields of application of the noir logic? That is, is noir a predicate that entertains toward the crime universe the same relationship as toward comedy or western, a kind of logical operator introducing the same anamorphic distortion in every genre to which it is applied, so that finding its strongest application in the crime film turns on nothing but historical contin...|$|E
40|$|This list of open {{problems}} is incomplete, {{and will be}} continuously improved and updated. The degrees of difficulty or importance may vary significantly from problem to problem. I however believe that a solution {{of any of these}} problems, if written in a satisfactory manner, would make a publication in a decent journal. 1. Remark 7 of [6] claims that the cirquent calculus system CL 5 without duplication has polynomial size proofs (every provable formula F has a proof whose size is polynomial in the size of F). Verify this claim. What kind of a polynomial <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here?</b> Does such a system have any reasonable semantics? 2. Consider the system CCC from [6] but without the Weakening rule. Does it have an interesting semantics? (Hint: think of Relevance Logic). 3. The same question as above for CCC with both Weakening and Contraction deleted (such a system is still stronger than linear logic as, for instance, it proves Blass’s principle). 4. Verify Conjecture 10. 2 of [14], at least for uniform (strong) validity (this case is much simpler than the case of just (weak) validity, yet it is at least equally important). 5. Strengthen the results of [10] (the soundness and completeness of the implicative fragment of intuition-istic logic) by adding ⊥ to the vocabulary.

40|$|Evidence for the {{conflict}} between two rival candidates for the bishopric of Rome {{following the death of}} Zosimus at the end of 418 comes from a group of twenty-five letters, most of which are official letters to and from Emperor Honorius (the rest being from other imperial officials and the emperor 2 ̆ 7 s sister), all but one of which are found in the Collectio Avellana. Interestingly, we have nothing preserved from the two episcopal claimants about this matter. The group of letters chronicle imperial concern for the preservation of public order. <b>Do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> an example of imperial interference in episcopal elections in Rome? In this article a careful examination of the letters reveals that Honorius was concerned only that the Roman church 2 ̆ 7 s procedures had been followed (Collectio Avellana, Ep. 15), which should determine who was lawful bishop. Sociological Conflict Theory is employed to investigate the nature of the evidence to address issues {{of the nature of the}} dispute and its participants, what values were contested, how it escalated, and how it was resolved. Such an approach makes clear that our evidence focuses on the role of the emperor and only incidentally tells us of the thinking and strategy of the two candidates. The final decision was made not on the merits of the candidates and the legality of one of the two elections, but upon Eulalius 2 ̆ 7 violation of the conditions imposed upon the two rivals while the dispute was to be settled. Despite the emperor 2 ̆ 7 s concern only to facilitate the church settling this conflict itself, in the end it was an imperial measure that determined the outcome of the disputed election...|$|E

It {{was indeed a}} welcomed gift, I assure you and I want to express my sincere appreciation from way up here in Alaska. The reason for the delay of the package was caused through my shipment from Seymour Johnson Field, N. C. I have been stationed live in Alaska some two months + probably will be here for the duration. The country live is really “ruff”, although <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> some of the conveniences of the camps back in the states. Since I’ve been in the service I have seen some really beautiful scenery, but nothing cam compare with this! However it does get quite cold here, stays between 25 ° + 50 ° below zero most of the time! We are well dressed {{for this kind of}} climate + so we don’t mind it too much! I am stationed at Ladd Field, somewhere near Fairbanks Alaska. Just recently I have been transferred into an Air Transport Command, and as yet have not been assigned. I suppose there aren’t many of the old Bryant boys + girls around now, but I send all my old friends there, my best. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> women <b>here</b> though, but not my kind!
