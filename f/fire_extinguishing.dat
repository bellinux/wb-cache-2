5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering of a <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), dibromotetrafluoroethane gas into them. According to survivors, those {{affected by the}} gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E
5|$|This {{reaction}} is exothermic and releases enough heat to ignite the resulting hydrogen {{in the presence}} of oxygen, possibly explosively splashing onlookers with potassium hydroxide, which is a strong alkali that destroys living tissue and causes skin burns. Finely grated potassium ignites in air at room temperature. The bulk metal ignites in air if heated. Because its density is 0.89 g/cm3, burning potassium floats in water that exposes it to atmospheric oxygen. Many common <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> agents, including water, either are ineffective or make a potassium fire worse. Nitrogen, argon, sodium chloride (table salt), sodium carbonate (soda ash), and silicon dioxide (sand) are effective if they are dry. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are also effective. These agents deprive the fire of oxygen and cool the potassium metal.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and <b>fire</b> <b>extinguishing</b> equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{in order}} to {{extinguish}} large scaled of forest fire efficiently many helicopters tend to be mobilized. In this situation, the most consideration for the rapid extinguish is the effective arrangement and management of helicopters, which is regard {{as the most important}} forest <b>fire</b> <b>extinguish</b> equipment. In this paper, client/serve based forest <b>fires</b> <b>extinguish</b> equipment management system is constructed by using GPS(Global Positioning System) and GIS(Geographic Information System) technology. This system considers not only extinguish equipment such as helicopters including manpower arrangement but also extinguish environment such a storing reservoir. For this, the real time recognition of helicopter location is first put GPS technology then user-friendly in terface is implemented based on GIS concept. The result of this study, efficient helicopter arrangement against forest fire can be obtained then a large sized damage by forest fire can be reduced using this system.

40|$|Working with {{volatile}} chemicals creates numerous hazards {{for scientists}} in laboratory. Therefore, it {{is restricted to}} do such works in a fume hood, {{which is designed to}} draw fresh air from the room into the hood and then out into the ventilation system, in order to prevent the accidents happened. According to the laboratory fire incidents investigation, the authors observed that a fire occurred in fume hood will be a serious problem which has the potential to get much worse in the future as more and complex laboratories are used and as the hood usage density increase. In this paper, the authors conducted the numerical experiments by using 3 D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method to evaluate the <b>fire</b> <b>extinguish</b> performance of CO 2 system in fume hood. The simulation results showed that the position of CO 2 nozzle, exhaust air volume, position of sash had a significant effect on <b>fire</b> <b>extinguish</b> in hood.

These additional internal fuel tanks increased the fuel capacity from 250 l to 400 l. The new engine is the same as that used in one bank of that fitted to the T-54. With the new engine and additional fuel tanks, the range of the vehicle has been increased to 480km on the road, (590km with external fuel tanks) and 120km on the water. The 76.2mm D-56TS rifled tank gun can fire a new undercaliber AP projectile piercing up to 75mm at 60° from 2,000 meters. One such round has been added to a PT-76B typical ammunition load and so it can now carry 41 rounds. It was produced between 1959–1967.|$|E
