The cost of in-line defect inspections is increasing at an exponential rate, particularly for a 300 mm fabrication facility.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to develop and}} validate laser ultrasonic inspection methods for on-line testing of microelectronic devices. Electronic packaging technologies such as flip chips and BGAs utilize solder bumps as electrical and mechanical connections. Since they are located hidden from view between the device and the substrate, defects such as cracks, voids, misalignments, and missing bumps are difficult to detect using non-destructive methods. Laser ultrasonic inspection is capable of detecting such defects by utilizing a high power laser pulse to induce vibrations in a microelectronic device while measuring the out of plane displacement using an interferometer. Quality can then be assessed by comparing the vibration response of a known-good device to {{the response of the}} sample under inspection. The main limitation with the implementation of laser ultrasonic inspection in manufacturing applications is the requirement to establish a known-good reference device utilizing other non-destructive methods. My work will focus on developing a method to inspect flip chip devices without requiring a previously established reference. The method will automatically examine measurement data from a large sample set to identify those devices which are most similar. The selected devices can then be utilized to compose a hybrid reference signal which can be used for comparison and defect detection. Current trends in the electronic packaging industry continue to drive toward increased solder bump density, making it increasingly difficult to generate strong ultrasonic signals in these stiffer devices. To overcome this difficulty, I propose a new excitation method which places the source of ultrasound at the <b>inspection</b> <b>location</b> for each test point on the device surface. This ensures that the same power is available for each <b>inspection</b> <b>location</b> while also increasing the signal to noise ratio. The hardware implementation of this method reduces the system complexity and required automation, which can significantly reduce equipment cost and inspection time. The implementation of the proposed excitation method in conjunction {{with the use of a}} hybrid reference signal for defect detection will improve the utility of the laser ultrasonic inspection technique to on-line inspection applications where no other non-destructive methods are currently available.

The recording capability of the MOI instrument output images was addressed by digitizing the video signal in video or image files.

The use of the encoder allowed the identification of the <b>inspection</b> <b>location</b> with respect to a reference position, such as the beginning of the scan.

40|$|Inspections under {{international}} agreements related to nonproliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons place sensitive commercial and national-defense information at risk.

Similarly, exposure of inspectors and facility personnel to radiation or hazardous environments can be reduced, and damage to sensitive processing environments {{can be avoided}} if inspection objectives can be achieved {{without the need for}} direct physical access by inspectors. A system developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) enables inspectors to achieve inspection objectives in sensitive or hazardous areas by providing virtual presence at an <b>inspection</b> <b>location</b> in place of physical presence. The system has two parts, a mobile unit operated by facility personnel and a stationary base station operated by inspectors. The mobile and stationary units are connected by a fiber-optic communications link. The mobile unit is equipped with two video cameras, a global positioning system (GPS) with dead-reckoning capability, distance measuring equipment (DME), and a theodolite.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a mobile tracking scheme that exploits the predictability of user mobility patterns in wireless PCS networks. In this scheme, a mobile’s future location is {{predicted by the}} network, {{based on the information}} gathered from the mobile’s recent report of location and velocity. When a call is made, the network pages the destination mobile around the predicted location. A mobile makes the same location prediction as the network does; it inspects its own location periodically and reports the new location when the distance between the predicted and the actual locations exceeds a threshold. To more realistically represent the various degrees of velocity correlation in time, a Gauss–Markov mobility model is used. For practical systems where the mobility pattern varies over time, we propose a dynamic Gauss–Markov parameter estimator that provides the mobility parameters to the prediction algorithm. Based on the Gauss–Markov model, we describe an analytical framework to evaluate the cost of mobility management for the proposed scheme. We also present an approximation method that reduces the computational complexity of the cost evaluation for multidimensional systems. We then compare the cost of predictive mobility management against that of the regular, nonpredictive distance-based scheme, for both the case with ideal Gauss–Markov mobility pattern and the case with time-varying mobility pattern. The performance advantage of the proposed scheme is demonstrated under various mobility patterns, call patterns, <b>location</b> <b>inspection</b> cost, <b>location</b> updating cost, mobile paging cost, and frequencies of mobile <b>location</b> <b>inspections.</b> As a point of reference, prediction can reduce the mobility management cost by more than 50 % for all systems, where a the mobile users have moderate mean velocity and where performing a single location update is as least as expensive as paging a mobile in one cell.
