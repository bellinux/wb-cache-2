40|$|Argentina concessioned {{its most}} {{important}} airports to a single operator (AA 2000) in 1997. The regulatory framework and the concession contract do not establish any limit to vertical relations between the airport operator and airlines. This paper analyzes the effects that vertical integration between the airport operator and an airline (assuming the air transport market is deregulated) has on competition. Given the international experience and the regulatory design adopted and implemented in Argentina, we recommend two policies: the explicit prohibition of vertical integration (vertical separation) or limits to the exercise of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conducts</b> –open access and accounting separation-. The process of awarding concession contracts for 33 of the 57 most important airports of Argentina began in 1997. Hereby, the provision of airport services was privatized.

40|$|Following the 2007 Sector Inquiry {{into the}} energy sector, the EU Commission has {{actively}} enforced Article 102 TFEU to sanction {{different forms of}} abuse of dominance by energy operators. Most of the cases have been concluded via commitments decisions which mainly included far-reaching structural (i. e. divestiture of capacity) rather than behavioural remedies. Moreover, in its commitment decisions the EU Commission has mainly targeted <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conducts</b> by energy undertakings, rather than directly sanctioning the excessive pricing in the wholesale and retail markets as exploitative abuses of dominance. Unlike the EU Commission, the National Competition Authorities (NCAs) of the EU Member States have directly sanctioned excessive pricing both at the wholesale and retail level as exploitative abuses of dominance. In particular, a number of NCAs have sanctioned withdrawals of capacity by electricity generators as abuses of dominance, since such conduct caused a direct rise of wholesale electricity prices. Secondly, NCAs {{of a number of}} EU Member States have also sanctioned the excessive prices in the retail energy markets imposed by undertakings on final customers. Besides the different focus in the enforcement of Article 102 TFEU in the energy markets in comparison to the EU Commission, the NCAs have mostly opted for imposition of fines on the sanctioned undertakings, rather than imposing structural remedies via commitment decisions. The chapter aims to analyse the enforcement trends of Article 102 TFEU by the NCAs with regard to excessive prices applied by energy operators in the wholesale and retail markets. In particular, the chapter compares such pattern of enforcement with that followed by the EU Commission in this sector during the past few years. The chapter tries to identify the reasons for the different focus of the authorities at national and EU level. It also discusses whether such divergences in the enforcement of Article 102 TFEU are justified {{in the light of the}} decentralized enforcement system of EU competition law...|$|R

40|$|This essay {{analyzes}} the three papers presented {{on a panel}} I organized {{as chair of the}} AALS Antitrust Section entitled Evolving Antitrust Treatment of Dominant Firms for the 2005 Annual Meetings. Steve Salop’s and Doug Melamed’s papers recommend standards for government intervention while David McGowan argues why the government should not. I create a framework within which to understand the three papers’ relationship to each other, by building on McGowan’s characterization of courts’ antitrust decisions. Since antitrust decisions are based on inherently incomplete real world information, they are subject to “error costs”: Courts are at risk of “false positives” (finding a violation when the behavior is not anticompetitive) and “false negatives” (finding no violation when the behavior is anticompetitive.) In light of these error costs, McGowan acknowledges that whether the court chooses to intervene or not depends on its ideology. He, himself, advocates that courts avoid false positives by not intervening and allow the marketplace to correct antitrust problems. This “market corrections approach” also alleviates concerns for false negatives. Taking a more interventionist view, Melamed recommends a “profit sacrifice test” to determine whether the exit of rivals is essential to <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct’s</b> profitability, thereby capturing more of the “false negatives” with little increase in “false positives. ” Salop, taking an interventionist view as well, recommends a more comprehensive evaluation to determine the conduct’s impact on consumer welfare – thereby expanding greatly the capture of false negatives. I believe, however, that differences in viewpoints are affected not only by which correction tool a scholar or court finds more effective (the market or the government), but also by the differences in their evaluation of the consequences of the false positives versus the false negatives in the specific instance under consideration. Inherent in any real-world antitrust decision are not just error costs but also a trade-off between the risk of a false positive and the risk of a false negative. Differences in valuation of those consequences may lead scholars and courts to differ in their reluctance to undertake particular outcomes when they choose to guard against one error as opposed to the other in a particular case. Therefore, I suggest that one 2 ̆ 7 s antitrust position is not only informed by one 2 ̆ 7 s belief in the ability of the marketplace relative to the government to correct anticompetitive problems, but also to the degree, in any particular circumstance, one is more risk-averse to the consequences of one error cost over the other. As a result, we can see a continuum of antitrust approaches rather than a stark categorization into two camps. This allows for a distinction between Melamed 2 ̆ 7 s and Salop 2 ̆ 7 s interventionist papers. Thus, I would place McGowan 2 ̆ 7 s market-place reliance toward one end; Salop 2 ̆ 7 s broad and more fine-tuned government evaluation of conduct, toward the other; and Melamed 2 ̆ 7 s perspective of specific finite criteria somewhere in the middle...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> in two-sided {{markets with}} [indirect] network effects is {{investigated}} in this dissertation. The dissertation addresses these issues by making three main contributions. First, a profitability function for independent South African community newspaper businesses is quantified {{and used to}} consider the effectiveness of possible exclusionary strategies. For <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> to be an attractive mechanism for a dominant firm it must undermine the ability of independent newspapers to be effective competitors such as through reducing their revenue by inducing customers not to deal with them, and/or raising their costs {{such as those of}} printing. In other instances, <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> may be used to artifically raise entry costs by raising barriers to entry associated with building a credible readership base. Second, the economics of different types of conduct are assessed based on a critical evaluation of competition cases. These include, in particular, the fighting brand predatory pricing strategy, in the presence of product/customer differentiation and as applied to the economic characteristics of community newspapers, notably their two-sided nature. Third, given South Africa’s history and high levels of concentration, the dissertation considers the appropriate standards to be applied in competition law enforcement to ensure a fair environment for the participation of small businesses and those owned by historically disadvantaged individuals. It is found that the application of competition policy in assessing <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> is skewed in favour of incumbent firms, particularly in the case of predatory pricing cases, because the economics of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> are inappropriately translated into legal tests. The conclusion is that the average variable cost or marginal cost measure specified in the law and the ‘as efficient’ competitor standard applied for assessing exclusionary below-cost pricing do not afford sufficient protection for small firms and provides leeway for dominant incumbents to engage in succesful exclusionary strategies.

40|$|Unreasonably <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct,</b> {{the element}} common to monopolization and {{attempted}} monopolization offenses under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, remains essentially undefined. Federal courts, including the U. S. Supreme Court, have purported {{to define the}} term, but the definitions they have offered are so indeterminate as to be, {{in the words of}} one prominent commentator, “not just vague but vacuous. ” Seeking to fill the void left by the courts, antitrust scholars have in recent years proposed four universal definitions of unreasonably <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct.</b> Each, however, is deficient: One would fail to deter a substantial amount of anticompetitive conduct, and the other three would provide business planners with little guidance and no safe harbors and would likely chill efficient but novel business practices. In light of these deficiencies, some commentators have recently suggested abandoning the search for a universal definition of unreasonably <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> and instead adopting non-universal standards. Such an approach, though, would either offend rule of law norms or, if implemented as some non-universalists have suggested, reduce to one of the aforementioned - and deficient - universal definitions. This Article examines the proposed definitions or tests for identifying unreasonably <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> (including the non-universalist approach) and, finding each lacking, suggests an alternative definition. The proposed approach would deem conduct to be unreasonably exclusionary if it would exclude from the defendant’s market a “competitive rival,” defined as a rival that is both as determined as the defendant and capable, at minimum efficient scale, of matching the defendant’s efficiency. The “exclusion of a competitive rival” definition identifies the common thread running through instances of unreasonable exclusion, comports with widely accepted intuitions about what constitutes improper competitive conduct, and generates specific safe harbors and liability rules that collectively would maximize monopolization doctrine’s net benefits by minimizing the sum of its “decision” and “error” costs...|$|E

40|$|The {{showing of}} predatory or <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> is a {{necessary}} element to prove an attempted monopolization claim under section 2 of the Sherman Act. Predatory hiring {{as a form of}} <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> has not been extensively analyzed from legal or economic perspectives. Most litigated cases have followed Universal Analytics, Inc. v. MacNeal-Schwendler Corp., where the court held that unlawful predatory hiring occurs when talent is acquired not for purposes of using that talent, but for purposes of denying it to a competitor. An anticompetitive act by a single firm is an act that is not profit maximizing but for the monopoly rents the act creates or maintains, but that is profit maximizing inclusive of those monopoly rents. However, a monopolist likely will use and derive profits from important labor talent once acquired, even if the effect of the hiring is anticompetitive. Thus, the current legal standard for proving predatory hiring as an element of an attempted monopolization claim may prevent plaintiffs from successfully prosecuting cases in which antitrust impact and injury exist. Therefore, we argue that the current legal standard required to prove a predatory-hiring claim should be revised. We use a recently litigated matter in the ambulance industry, ICare-EMS v. Rural/Metro, as a case study to make our argument. This case study is particularly revealing because, unlike most litigated matters, internal company documents and deposition testimony from plaintiff and defendant firm witnesses were not designated confidential.

40|$|This essay {{considers}} the general definition of unlawful exclusionary practices under Section 2 of the Sherman Act as acts that: (1) are reasonably capable of creating, enlarging or prolonging monopoly power by impairing the opportunities of rivals; and (2) that either (2 a) do not benefit consumers at all, or (2 b) are unnecessary {{for the particular}} consumer benefits claimed for them, or (2 c) produce harms disproportionate to any resulting benefits. An important purpose of this progression of queries is to permit the court to avoid balancing, although balancing certainly cannot be avoided in some close cases. The given definition is very general, {{in the sense that}} it does not provide precise tests for specific practices, such as improper patent infringement suits or predatory pricing. Numerous definitions of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> have been proposed that are more focused or more technical, and some of these may be more useful for analyzing specific exclusionary practices than the very general definition offered here. However, as this paper develops, these definitions are also incomplete, in the sense that they do not account for every type of <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> that the law of monopolization should condemn. Proof of actual consumer harm is generally unnecessary to the definition, but the challenged conduct must be of a type that the anticipated end result is actual consumer harm.

In a standard two-sided market model with two competing shopping centers, we analyze incentives to introduce exclusivity clauses and the likely effects on social welfare. We show that exclusivity agreements are especially profitable for shopping centers and detrimental to social welfare if competition is intense between the two shopping centers. We argue that the focus of courts on market definition is misplaced in markets determined by competitive bottlenecks...|$|E
40|$|This article aims to {{introduce}} the Guidance Paper’s key features in applying Article 82 EC to abusive <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct</b> by dominant undertakings. It will therefore examine the concepts of consumer welfare, anticompetitive foreclosure, consumer harm, the efficiency-based defence and balancing test, and some issues that apply to predation and tying. It will also discuss how the Guidance Paper could be perceived {{from the perspective of}} German competition law and policy and what kind of transitional regime might be required for the effective implementation of its major analytical concepts. The central issue is therefore to answer the questions of how efficient it really is to reform Article 82 by means of a soft-law instrument, and whether the GP presents an efficient means of compliance for Germany...|$|E

Moreover, according to Nielsen estimates, as {{of the end of}} 2011 the average American spent nearly seven hours per month on Facebook, which is more time than they spent on Google, Yahoo!, YouTube, Microsoft, and Wikipedia combined. LinkedIn’s May 19, 2011 initial public offering (“IPO”) surpassed expectations, placing the value of the company at nearly 9 billion, and approximately a year later, its stock price had risen another 20 percent. Facebook followed suit a year later with an IPO that placed the value of the company at over 100 billion. Other social networking sites remain hot properties, and other Internet companies are struggling to catch up. In what may be considered a rite of passage previously faced by such high-tech giants as IBM, AT 2 ̆ 6 T, Microsoft, and most recently Google, social networking companies are now facing increasing scrutiny under the antitrust laws. Early private antitrust cases have begun to appear. Anyone attempting to predict how the antitrust laws will apply to leading social networking providers must remember that a successful monopolization claim requires proof of two elements: (1) market power and (2) what is often called <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct.</b> This Article offers a few preliminary thoughts about whether leading social networking sites satisfy these requirements. Part I considers one of the most likely sources of market power: network effects. Part II evaluates whether a social network’s refusal to facilitate data portability can create an entry barrier and constitute <b>exclusionary</b> <b>conduct.</b> Part III examines Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., which is a recent case that presented both of these issue...|$|E

In the European Union (EU), the European Commission published the “Guidance on the Commission’s Enforcement Priorities in Applying Article 82 of the EC Treaty to Abusive <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>Conduct</b> by Dominant Undertakings” (the Guidance) in February 2009 as yet the final formal stage during the “modernisation” of Art. 102 TFEU. As an official candidate for EU membership, Turkey is unlikely to distance itself from the developments in the EU. Within this context, “Guidelines on the Assessment of Abusive <b>Exclusionary</b> <b>Conduct</b> by Dominant Undertakings” (the Guidelines on Art. 6) were published on April 7, 2014. Evident from their structure and substantive content, the Guidelines on Art. 6 are closely modelled on the Guidance. Although the transposition of the Guidance into Turkish competition law seems prima facie desirable in terms of the harmonisation of Turkey’s domestic competition law with the EU acquis, the question as to whether the Guidelines on Art. 6 have suited to Turkey’s own needs gains significance. Despite being the first secondary legislation on Art. 6 of the Act on the Protection of Competition 1994 in Turkey, a lack of much-needed guidance on the problematic areas in the enforcement of Art. 6 may well result in the Guidelines on Art. 6 being a missed opportunity to establish a coherent policy on Art. 6. This thesis explores whether {{there is a need for}} adopting Guidelines in relation to Art. 6 in Turkish competition law, examines whether the Guidance can or should be used as a model, and finally gives reflections on how the legal regime and content of these Guidelines can be best tailored to the enforcement of Art. 6 in Turkey...|$|E
