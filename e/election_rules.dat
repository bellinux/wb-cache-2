25|$|In early 1949, Simhoni {{was part}} of the {{political}} storm {{that took place in the}} early years of the state. The <b>election</b> <b>rules</b> at the time were much less restrictive. There were no rules that prohibited the candidacy of officers on active duty. In turn a number of officers, including Simhoni, ran for the Constituent Assembly which took place on January 25, 1949. Mapai was the only party to include four military men in high spots on its ticket. The two highest spots were: Moshe Dayan, in the 10th place followed by Simhoni in 12th place. Both were invited to the Constituent Assembly. Simhoni resigned immediately after the elections and did not attend.|$|E
25|$|Irregularities {{were found}} to be a {{consequence}} of flawed electoral registers, lack of knowledge on <b>election</b> <b>rules</b> by those appointed to integrate the polling bureaus, a lack of means for the active monitoring of the election process and the inefficient structure of the electoral administration, coupled with the detection of some illicit votes in several wards. While these flaws had been present in past elections, the closeness of results in the 1989 election {{and the fact that the}} PSOE overall majority depended on a disputed seat meant that these ended up being exposed. As a result, the electoral law was subsequently amended in 1991 in order to introduce improvements in the efficiency of the electoral administration.|$|E
25|$|In August, the Conservative Campaign Fund of Washington, D.C. filed a {{complaint}} with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) naming Petrelis, ACT UP/DC, and other boycott organizers. The complaint charged the boycott organizers with interfering with the North Carolina Senate race in violation of federal <b>election</b> <b>rules.</b> In February 1991, the FEC announced it would pursue the case, and in 1993, the FEC pressured ACT UP to enter into a conciliation process to negotiate the civil fine the organization would pay. ACT UP determined to keep fighting. Citing the length of time that had passed and the fact that the ACT UP chapters named in the complaint no longer existed, FEC general council Larry Noble eventually recommended the commissioners drop the case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recounting {{introduces}} multiple pivotal {{events in}} two-candidate elections. In addition to determining which candidate is elected, an in-dividual’s vote is pivotal when the vote margin is {{just at the}} levels that would trigger a recount. In large elections, the motive to avoid recount cost can become the dominant consideration for rational voters, inducing them to vote informatively according to their private signals. In envi-ronments where elections without recount fail to aggregate information efficiently, a modified <b>election</b> <b>rule</b> with small recount cost can produce asymptotically efficient outcomes with a vanishing small probability of actually invoking a recount. In environments where efficient informa-tion aggregation obtains in elections without recount, a modified <b>election</b> <b>rule</b> with recount cost can increase {{the speed at which}} the information efficient outcome is approximated.

2500|$|The Commune, the {{government}} of Paris, also held elections, but these were won by the more moderate members, known as the Girondins, rather than the more radical faction, the Montagnards, largely because the election, unlike the Convention vote, was by secret ballot.

They were particularly concerned by the Southern states' disenfranchisement of blacks starting with Mississippi's passage of a new constitution in 1890. Through 1908, southern legislatures dominated by white Democrats ratified new constitutions and laws creating barriers to voter registration and more complex <b>election</b> <b>rules.</b> In practice, this caused the exclusion of most blacks and many poor whites from the political system in southern states, crippling the Republican Party {{in most of the}} South. Black voter registration and turnout dropped markedly in the South as a result of such legislation.

This gain accompanied a large decline in the Labour vote, and the election reduced Labour's majority from 167 to 68 and {{its share of the}} vote to 35.2%. The campaign, based on the slogan [...] "Are you thinking what we're thinking?", was designed by Australian pollster Lynton Crosby.
