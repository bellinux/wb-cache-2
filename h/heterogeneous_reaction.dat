40|$|The {{importance}} of stratospheric dynamics for the stratospheric ozone {{distribution in the}} Northern Hemisphere is investigated using multi-annual simulations of the coupled dynamic-chemical general circulation model ECHAM 3 /CHEM. This model includes a parameterization for <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> on polar stratospheric clouds (PSC) and on sulphate aerosols. A warm and a cold stratospheric winter are examined to estimate the range of chemical ozone loss due to <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> on PSCs. Ozone depletion in the model mainly occurs inside the polar vortex. An additional ozone reduction due to <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> on PSCs is found as well outside the polar vortex. Secondary vortex formation and vortex contraction after an elongation lead to a transport of airmasses with chemically reduced ozone values out of the vortex. Except for such events, {{the edge of the}} modelled polar vortex acts as a barrier to transport. During the formation of secondary vortices no additional <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>reactions</b> occur therein. Other dynamic events like the elongation of the polar vortex and its displacement to lower latitudes lead to an intense ozone depletion. A modelled minor stratospheric warming causes a total deactivation of chlorine components and prevents further ozone depletion.

The extent to which N₂O₅ reactivity impacts atmospheric oxidant loadings depends on the <b>heterogeneous</b> <b>reaction</b> rate of N₂O₅ with a given surface.
