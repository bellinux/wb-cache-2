40|$|Issue of Big Data {{was already}} raised by Fremont Rider, an American Librarian from Westleyan University, in 1944. He {{predicted}} that the volume of American universities collection would reach 200 million copies in 2040. As a result, it brings to fore multiple issues such as big data users, storage capacity, {{and the need to}} have <b>data</b> <b>analysts.</b>   In Indonesia, <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> is still a rare profession, and therefore urgently needed. One of its distinctive tasks  is to conduct visual analyses from various data resources and also to present the result visually as interesting knowledge. It becomes science enliven by interactive visualization. (Thomas and Cook, 2005). In response to the issue, librarians have already been equipped with basic information management. Yet, they can see the opportunity and improve themselves as <b>data</b> <b>analysts.</b> In developed countries, it is common that librarian are also regarded as <b>data</b> <b>analysts.</b> They enhance  themselves with various skills required, such as cloud computing and smart computing. In the end librarian with <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> competency are eloquent to extract and present complex data resources as “interesting and discernible” knowledge...|$|R

40|$|In 2002, an {{international}} survey on reading graphs and tables of rates and percentages {{was conducted by}} the W. M. Keck Statistical Literacy Project. Respondents included US college students, college teachers worldwide and professional <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> in the US and in South Africa. The survey focused on reading informal statistics – rates and percentages in tables and graphs. Some high error rates were encountered. In reading a 100 % row table, 44 % of students misread {{a description of a}} single percentage. In reading a pie chart, 65 % of <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> misread a comparison of two slices. In reading an X-Y plot, 81 % of college teachers misread a “times more than ” comparison. The average error rate was 49 % for college students, 44 % for <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> and 28 % for college teachers. At the 80 th percentile, the error rate was 45 % for college students, 20 % for <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> and 10 % for college teachers. Using the 80 th percentile score for <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> as a desired goal (80 % correct), then only 2 % of the students, 20 % of <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> and 43 % of these college teachers achieved that goal. Statistical educators should review the survey instrument, the rules used to determine the correct answers and the error rates by group to see if the survey instrument or the rules contributed in any way to the respondent errors.

40|$|Blinding in {{randomized}} controlled trials (RCTs) {{is a strategy}} that is widely endorsed {{as a method of}} reducing the biases that can result from people's awareness of study participants' treatment group status. Blinding of participants and interventionists is often impossible in nursing RCTs, but <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> can almost always be blinded. Yet, such blinding seldom occurs, perhaps because of misperceptions about the objectivity of statistical analysis. <b>Data</b> <b>analysts</b> make many semi-subjective decisions about such issues as handling missing data, transforming variables, undertaking subgroup analysis, and selecting covariates. These decisions ideally should be made without the analyst's knowledge of how treatment groups are coded. Strategies for achieving blinding among <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> are discussed.

40|$|The authors {{describe}} a research group {{that supports the}} needs of investigators seeking data from an electronic medical record system. Since its creation in 1972, the Regenstrief Medical Records System has captured and stored more than 350 million discrete coded observations on two million patients. This repository has become a central data source for prospective and retrospective research. It is accessed by six data analysts—working closely with the institutional review board—who provide investigators with timely and accurate data while protecting patient and provider privacy and confidentiality. From January 1, 1999, to July 31, 2002, <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> tracked their activities involving 47, 559 hours of work predominantly for physicians (54 %). While data retrieval (36 %) and analysis (25 %) were primary activities, <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> also actively collaborated with researchers. Primary objectives of data provided to investigators were to address disease-specific (35. 4 %) and drug-related (12. 2 %) questions, support guideline implementation (13. 1 %), and probe various aspects of clinical epidemiology (5. 7 %). Outcomes of these endeavors included 117 grants (including $ 300, 000 per year salary support for <b>data</b> <b>analysts)</b> and 139 papers in peer-reviewed journals by investigators who rated the support provided by <b>data</b> <b>analysts</b> as extremely valuable...|$|R
