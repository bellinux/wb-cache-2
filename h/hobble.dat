5|$|Kirk {{reveals that}} the dinosaurs were brought to their time by an {{experiment}} he was running using his Third Energy technology. A rift in space was created and a pocket of the island from their time was exchanged with the same from the past, bringing dinosaurs back into their time. Kirk then tells them that if the reactors are set to overload, the energy coming from them and the vortex should {{cancel each other out}} if they come into contact. After Regina gets the stabilizer and initializer and uses them to overload the reactors, the energy shakes the base, causing a vent to fall on Gail allowing Kirk to get free again. The team heads towards the waterway to escape the blast, but Gail says they still need to capture the doctor. He starts to <b>hobble</b> away on his gun to go after Kirk, and orders Regina and Rick to leave without him if he does not return in thirty minutes. Regina is given the choice to either go after Dr. Kirk with Gail, or escape with Rick.|$|E

25|$|A corset dress (also {{known as}} <b>hobble</b> corset because it {{produces}} similar restrictive effects to a <b>hobble</b> skirt) {{is a long}} corset. It is like an ordinary corset, but it is long {{enough to cover the}} legs, partially or totally. It thus looks like a dress, hence the name. A person wearing a corset dress can have great difficulty in walking {{up and down the stairs}} (especially if wearing high-heeled footwear) and may be unable to sit down if the boning is too stiff.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{participate}} in this system, a union must have a legal registration (registro), must have an officially recognized right to negotiate collective bargaining agreements (titularidad), and must periodically re-register its officers and be accepted by the state (toma de nota). This system can be used to <b>hobble</b> independent unions not associated with the CTM or other federations that have established relations with the state, since all three members of these boards often have self-interested reasons for denying or delaying registration to rival unions.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposed}} constitution {{allows the}} NCPO to appoint an {{eight to ten}} person panel who will choose parliament's 250-member senate, to include six seats reserved for {{the head of the}} army, navy, air force, and national police, plus the military's supreme commander, and defense permanent secretary. The senate can stage a no-confidence vote against a future elected government. The bicameral parliament could also select a candidate as prime minister who is not an MP or even a politician. That person could become prime minister if the appointed senate approves. Some suspect that with the new constitution the military seeks to <b>hobble</b> political parties in order to create disposable coalition governments. The military would then remain the real power, whatever the outcome of the referendum and the election.|$|E
25|$|The {{silhouette}} changed {{once again}} as the Victorian era drew to a close. The shape was essentially an inverted triangle, with a wide-brimmed hat on top, a full upper body with puffed sleeves, no bustle, and a skirt that narrowed at the ankles (the <b>hobble</b> skirt was a fad shortly {{after the end of}} the Victorian era). The enormous wide-brimmed hats were covered with elaborate creations of silk flowers, ribbons, and above all, exotic plumes; hats sometimes included entire exotic birds that had been stuffed. Many of these plumes came from birds in the Florida everglades, which were nearly made entirely extinct by overhunting. By 1899, early environmentalists like Adeline Knapp were engaged in efforts to curtail the hunting for plumes. By 1900, more than five million birds a year were being slaughtered, and nearly 95 percent of Florida's shore birds had been killed by plume hunters.|$|E
25|$|Arriving in Longreach in August, 1919, they {{acquired}} a Model T Ford, as a transport for the survey, and {{were accompanied by}} a mechanic, George Gorham. Leaving Longreach on 18 August 1919, the group traveled through Winton, Kynuna and McKinlay, reaching the town of Cloncurry on 20 August 1919. They were {{the first people to}} travel across the Gulf of Carpentaria, using an automobile. The team traveled through Burketown, the stations of Westmoreland and Wollorgorang, before reaching <b>Hobble</b> Chain Creek. From there, they traveled through Big Running Creek, Calvert River, Warbys Lagoon, Snake Lagoon, Fulch River, Werrin River, Fletcher River, Feathertop Creek. As none of the rivers have bridges, the group had to wade across the rivers. Following a route taken by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1845, they reached Borroloola. Fysh began a diary of maps and photography, to record their journey across Northern Australia.|$|E
50|$|Pacing races {{constitute}} 80% to 90% of {{the harness}} races conducted in North America. Pacing horses are faster and (most {{important to the}} bettor) less likely to break stride (a horse which starts to gallop must be slowed down and taken to the outside until it resumes trotting or pacing). One of the reasons pacers {{are less likely to}} break stride is that they often wear <b>hobbles</b> (straps connecting the legs on each of the horse's sides). The belief that <b>hobbles</b> are used to create this gait is a common misunderstanding. The pace is a natural gait for many horses, and <b>hobbles</b> are an aid in supporting the gait at top speed; trotting <b>hobbles</b> (which employ a different design, due to the difference in the gait) are becoming increasingly popular for the same reason.|$|R
50|$|Some {{owners of}} young foals handle them excessively, leading the foal to {{consider}} the human a member of its own species, which can cause serious behavioural problems. <b>Hobbles</b> are used on some large farms to provide semi-freedom, preventing horses from going too far. In addition to forcing them to move in step, <b>hobbles</b> cause pain.|$|R

25|$|Raúl's last {{touch with}} the ball as Real Madrid player before an injury ruled him out of action {{for the rest of}} that season was to score his last goal, an opening goal scored on 24 April 2010 in a 2–1 away victory against Real Zaragoza in La Romareda, coincidentally the stadium where he made his debut in 1994. It was scored in the 50th minute after Raúl (himself only on the pitch as a {{substitute}} for Rafael van der Vaart after 15 minutes) had signalled he could not physically continue and was prepared to be substituted off for Karim Benzema one minute after the goal. Before the substitution could be made, Real Madrid launched a counter-attack to create a goal. Though Raúl ran to a slow <b>hobble,</b> he shuffled into the box and was able to poke the ball from Cristiano Ronaldo's pass.|$|E
25|$|As a result, {{with the}} {{exception}} of the largest markets, ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations, usually via off-hours clearances (a notable exception during this time was WKST-TV in Youngstown, Ohio, now WYTV, despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to Cleveland and Pittsburgh even decades before the city's economic collapse). According to Goldenson, this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors. However, the network's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production. Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to <b>hobble</b> it for the next two decades; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s, which allowed stations like WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before.|$|E
500|$|Unfriendly sources {{described}} Morton in exceedingly negative terms. [...] "With a superabundance of {{the quality}} called 'force,' Senator Morton possesses {{one of the most}} terrible natures in public life," [...] and as news correspondent George Alfred Townsend described him: [...] "A dark, determined, brooding and desperate mind is reflected in his warthy complexion and introspective eyes. His powerful frame, prematurely wrecked, yet carrying alive the savage will, towers on his crutch, and in his very <b>hobble</b> is the tyrant's pace.... He wants to be terrible for the sake of freedom. His conscience and fortitude are thus fed from his fanaticism. Like all bloody bigots, he thinks he feels God's mercy moving in him." ...|$|E

500|$|Although retired, Goodman {{remained}} {{active in}} Order of the Arrow affairs during the 1960s and 1970s. Acclaimed as an eloquent orator, his keynote addresses at the OA's biennial National Order of the Arrow Conferences reportedly made an unforgettable impression upon his youthful audiences. Nelson Block writes in A Thing of the Spirit, {{that even in}} the 1970s the octogenarian founder [...] "crisscrossed the country to attend lodge and section events... surrounded by young Arrowmen...witty and charming, keeping everyone enthralled with his stories." [...] Displaying his self-deprecating humor, Goodman himself was more prosaic about all of the adulation he received at OA gatherings, writing that, [...] "to many of the young men I was a museum piece. In fact I have been informed that there was considerable surprise because I didn't <b>hobble</b> in on a cane and mumble in my dentures." [...] But, he added, [...] "I looked upon them with deep emotion, for there was a spiritual bond".|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 1847, Pierce was {{promoted}} to brigadier general, and took command of a brigade of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies to take to Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, {{in time for the}} Battle of Contreras. The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against his saddle. The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and leaving him with a debilitating knee injury. The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, [...] "General Pierce is a damned coward." [...] Pierce returned for the following day's action, but again injured his knee, forcing him to <b>hobble</b> after his men, {{and by the time he}} caught up, the battle had mostly been won.|$|E
500|$|With the {{lull in the}} fighting, and {{the onset}} of autumn rains, coupled with endless hills and {{deepening}} mud, Middleton's left knee, which had been uncomfortable {{for more than a}} year, was now becoming agonizing. He had hurt his right knee many years earlier playing football, but there was no immediate explanation for the pain in his left leg. Medics studied his leg, but had no answers. In late November Middleton went to the hospital in Naples, staying well into December, still without adequate diagnosis. He was able to <b>hobble</b> around, and did some staff work, then flew to General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa. He stayed there until mid-January, when he was sent to Walter Reed Hospital back in the United States. While Middleton was at Walter Reed, General Eisenhower communicated to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he needed Middleton back overseas. Acknowledging Middleton's difficulty with his knees, Eisenhower said, [...] "I don't give a damn about his knees; I want his head and his heart. And I'll take him into battle on a litter if we have to." [...] Command of the 45th Division went to Major General William W. Eagles.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} negative {{reviews in}} trade publications {{and it was}} deemed a distinct departure from the nature of other Thanhouser releases. The film's plot was criticized by reviewers for being concerned main character's misery. In response to the illogical plot, the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer stated, [...] "Why the cripple should go West {{as soon as he}} is able to <b>hobble</b> isn't clear; perhaps the West is such a delightfully vague term that it induces haziness of reasoning." [...] The reviewer also noted the inexplicable reason why Allen, who originally fled, would suddenly consent to be willingly murdered by John. The reviewer opined that the story was almost maudlin in places and the acting was not sincere because the actors knew the plot was absurd. The Moving Picture World also reviewed the film quite negatively, [...] "Possibly the dramatic qualities of this picture are sufficient reason for its existence; but it has no other reason. It is not entertaining. It is not instructive. It cannot amuse. The shadow of death pervades it and the horror tragedy is the principal factor. It is such a departure from the usual Thanhouser that it seems as though the regular producer was absent when it flipped past the company's censor." [...] Advertisers for the film listed it {{in a variety of ways}} from a strong drama to having real mining activities. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
