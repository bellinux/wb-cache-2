5|$|Although the Richard III Society {{remained}} interested <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> possible {{location of}} the king's grave, they did not search for his remains. Individual members suggested possible lines of investigation, but neither the University of Leicester nor local historians and archaeologists took up the challenge, probably because it was widely thought that the grave site had been built over or the skeleton had been scattered, as John Speed's account suggested.|$|E
5|$|Robinett, as a {{means to}} {{maintain}} his name on his game, included a hidden message in Adventure identifying himself as the creator, inspired by the supposedly hidden messages left on various songs recorded by The Beatles. <b>In</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> game in 2015, Robinett considered the message {{as a means}} of self-promotion, noting that he had been paid only around $22,000 a year from Atari without any royalties, while Atari would sell a million units of a game at $25 a piece. This secret is one of the earliest known Easter eggs in a video game.|$|E
5|$|Writing in Storyteller: The Classic that Heralded America's Storytelling Revival, <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> {{difference}} between stories that lend themselves well to telling and stories that lend themselves well to reading, Ramon Ross explains Peter Rabbit {{is a story}} created for reading. He believes Potter created a good mix of suspense and tension, intermixed with lulls in the action. He goes on to write that the writing style—"the economy of words, the crisp writing"—lends itself well to a young audience.|$|E

5|$|Criticism often arises after single acts of {{violence}} committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, Colton Orr of the New York Rangers fought with Todd Fedoruk of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk unconscious. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight {{earlier in the season}} with Derek Boogaard. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players acknowledge that there is no harm <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> issue; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> more lighthearted {{elements}} of the plot, such as Dr. Morris, a character who tells corny jokes, the developers commented that these elements accentuated the dark {{elements of}} the game rather than detracted from them, as well as showing {{the stability of the}} survivors' mental conditions. The decision to include more dialogue than previous entries in the series was to ensure that this new world and the new characters were understandable by the player, though the developers acknowledge that it could also distract from the strategic gameplay. The developers felt that the dialogue made the story more enjoyable for the players, as opposed to being a vehicle to move the gameplay forward. When asked if Days of Ruin was an attempt to bridge this series with fellow Intelligent Systems series Fire Emblem, developers commented that while the increase in volume may make it seem like this, it was not their intention. They explained that while Fire Emblem placed importance on individual units, Advance Wars was about improving as a commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|Other {{additions}} {{include the}} Rig and the Anti-Tank; the Rig is {{a modified version}} of an APC from the previous titles modified to be able to build temporary buildings, while the Anti-Tank is both a direct and long-range weapon specifically designed to do damage to tanks. Two modifications include the Battleship, which can now move and attack in one round, and the Aircraft Carrier, which can produce low-fuel aircraft called Seaplanes. Another new unit is the Gunship, which can attack and carry units as well. <b>In</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> online play of the game, the developers felt that it was necessary to limit online battles to only two people per battle, explaining that they felt it would be too boring for a player to have to sit and stare at a screen while three other people made their moves.|$|E

Although there is still uncertainty about the motives of the gunman, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau—possibly a deranged outcast, possibly a religious extremist—the United States is reviewing security along the 5,525-mile (8,890km) line which separates the two countries (including the Alaskan land border).|$|E
25|$|However, negotiators {{need not}} {{sacrifice}} effective negotiation {{in favor of}} a positive relationship between parties. Rather than conceding, each side can appreciate that the other has emotions and motivations of their own and use this to their advantage <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> issue. In fact, perspective-taking can help move parties toward a more integrative solution. Fisher et al illustrate a few techniques that effectively improve perspective-taking in their book Getting to Yes, and through the following, negotiators can separate people from the problem itself.|$|E

The viewer is asked to consider what constitutes the soul, and what happens to it after death. <b>In</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> film, Kiarostami said that he is the person who raises questions, rather than answers them.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, Aboriginal {{women are}} {{more than five times}} more likely to die from {{cervical}} cancer than non-Aboriginal women, suggesting that Aboriginal women are less likely to have regular Pap tests. There are several factors that may limit indigenous women from engaging in regular cervical screening practices, including sensitivity <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> topic in Aboriginal communities, embarrassment, anxiety and fear about the procedure. Difficulty in accessing screening services (for example, transport difficulties) and a lack of female GPs, trained pap smear providers and trained female Aboriginal Health Workers are also issues.|$|E
25|$|The next {{change to}} Isostylis came in 1981, when Alex George {{promoted}} {{it back to}} subgenus rank, and published a second species, B.cuneata. <b>In</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> subgenus, George commented {{that there had been}} calls to transfer Isostylis into Dryandra, which was then a distinct genus. He argued, however, that the similarities between Isostylis and Dryandra were largely superficial, whereas the similarities with Banksia were much more important taxonomically. His conclusion was that the taxon should remain in Banksia, although he did not rule out promoting it into a separate genus. A third B.subg. Isostylis species, B.oligantha, was published by George in 1988.|$|E

25|$|Also {{during the}} early 1920s, Eugen Relgis {{came into contact with}} the Bucharest-based Sburătorul circle, which stood for modernist {{literature}} and aesthetic relativism. The eponymous magazine published samples of his lyrical poetry. With his humanitarian literature, Relgis was a singular figure among the many Sburătorul factions, as later noted by literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> studied eclecticism of Sburătorul doyen Eugen Lovinescu. Another Romanian researcher, Henri Zalis, notes that Relgis was one of the many Jewish intellectuals whom Lovinescu cultivated in reaction to the tradition of ethno-nationalist discrimination. However, according to critic Eugen Simion, Lovinescu also greatly exaggerated Relgis' literary worth.|$|E
25|$|She {{has also}} been praised for her overall role in the series and as a Nintendo character. She ranked at fifth place on the top ten best female video game {{characters}} by members of Official Nintendo Magazines forum. The ONM staff added that she was well loved by Nintendo fans, and her back story {{made it difficult to}} dislike her. G4TV editor Michael Leffler called her a wonderful addition to the series, adding that she balances Link out. Nintendo Power, <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> ending to Twilight Princess, describes the relationship between Link and Midna {{as one of the most}} compelling in The Legend of Zelda history. IGN editor Lucas M. Thomas refers to her as essentially the second playable character in Twilight Princess.|$|E
25|$|The Church {{has a role}} <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> {{issues related}} to the social order. Social and {{economic}} issues are vital to her not from a technical point of view but in terms of moral and ethical issues involved. Ethical considerations include the nature of private property. Within the Catholic Church several conflicting views had developed. Pope Pius XI declares private property essential for the development and freedom of the individual. Those who deny private property, deny personal freedom and development. But, said Pius, private property has a social function as well. Private property loses its morality, if it is not subordinated to the common good. Therefore, governments have a right to redistribution policies. In extreme cases, the Pope grants the State a right of expropriation of private property.|$|E

25|$|While he {{supported}} the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing truth in language, and honesty was of paramount importance. Even in facial expression, truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. <b>In</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors {{are considered to be}} taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.|$|E
25|$|A recent ABC-TV 20/20 {{report on}} Healthcare, based on footage taken {{from within the}} island, criticized Michael Moore's portrayals of the Cuban Healthcare system in the movie Sicko. In that film, Moore took a number of Americans to a {{hospital}} in Havana where they bought affordable drugs, and were given treatments for free that they could not afford in America. The report highlights the dilapidated conditions of some hospitals that are accessible to regular Cubans by pointing to the bleak conditions of hospital rooms and the filthy conditions of the facilities. The report also addressed the quality of care available to Cubans by arguing that patient neglect was a common phenomenon. Finally, <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> infant mortality rate, the report highlights the government's alleged efforts to promote abortions of potentially infirm fetuses and other alleged government efforts to manipulate the rate.|$|E
25|$|In The Book of J (1990), he and David Rosenberg (who {{translated}} the Biblical texts) portrayed {{one of the}} posited ancient documents that {{formed the basis of}} the first five books of the bible (see documentary hypothesis) as the work of a great literary artist who had no intention of composing a dogmatically religious work (see Jahwist). They further envisaged this anonymous writer as a woman attached to the court of the successors of the Israelite kings David and Solomon—a piece of speculation which drew much attention. Later, Bloom said that the speculations didn't go far enough, and perhaps he should have identified J with the Biblical Bathsheba. In Jesus and Yahweh: The Names Divine (2004), he revisits some of the territory he covered in The Book of J <b>in</b> <b>discussing</b> <b>the</b> significance of Yahweh and Jesus of Nazareth as literary characters, while casting a critical eye on historical approaches and asserting the fundamental incompatibility of Christianity and Judaism.|$|E
