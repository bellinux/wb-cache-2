5|$|Van Dijk was {{selected}} to represent her country at the Olympic Games in London, and she competed in the road race and the individual time trial {{on the road and}} in the team pursuit on the track. In the road race, Van Dijk was a <b>domestique</b> for Marianne Vos, who won the gold medal. Van Dijk attacked five times but finished outside the time limit. Because the victory of Marianne Vos was seen as a team performance, Van Dijk, Loes Gunnewijk and Annemiek van Vleuten were all subsequently honoured in both the Holland Heineken House and the Ridderzaal. In the time trial, Van Dijk finished eighth. She said afterwards that she was afraid to start too fast and subsequently lost {{a lot of time in}} the first part of the race. In the team pursuit, Van Dijk finished sixth together with Kirsten Wild, Amy Pieters and Vera Koedooder. In the qualification heats, the team had held the Olympic record for a short period and they rode a new Dutch national record in round one. According to Van Dijk, sixth place was the highest attainable place the team could have hoped to achieve.|$|E
5|$|While the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders, {{including}} six former Grand Tour winners, the odds-on favorite was always 's Alberto Contador. The 2008 Giro champion, who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three {{editions of the}} Tour de France, announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011. Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and {{able to return to}} racing, though the case still pended a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011. Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory. Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return, preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season. He briefly considered riding as a <b>domestique</b> for Vincenzo Nibali, but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time and the feeling that doing so would be disrespectful to the race. The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition, and fourth in the last five, in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship.|$|E
25|$|At {{the close}} of 1987, Roche moved to Fagor MBK, {{bringing}} English riders Sean Yates and Malcolm Elliot, 1984 Tour de France King of the Mountains winner Robert Millar and <b>domestique</b> Eddy Schepers. The team was criticised for containing too many English speakers.|$|E

However, riders now get points for their finish position. This presses <b>domestiques</b> to also consider their own performance {{in addition to their}} leader's.|$|R

25|$|Leipheimer was {{favored to}} lead the team in California again for 2011, but became the team's chief <b>domestique</b> instead, riding in support of Chris Horner's {{eventual}} victory, after the latter posted a stronger time on mountainous stage four into San Jose. Leipheimer also won the stage finishing at the Mount Baldy ski area, and was second in the individual time trial. In his next race, the Tour of Switzerland, Leipheimer won, overhauling the race leader Damiano Cunego by 2 minutes in the final time trial stage, to win the tour by 4 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The 1925 Giro d'Italia saw the {{emergence}} of a new star, Alfredo Binda. Despite winning six legs of the event, Costante Girardengo did not win the race. Binda gained the lead after the fifth stage, after he and a few other general classification contenders attacked while Girardengo was repairing a flat tire. Binda won the Giro in his first attempt. Reigning champion Binda started off the following year's race with a crash in the first stage, which caused him to lose lots of time. Due to the crash, Binda worked as a <b>domestique</b> for his teammate Giovanni Brunero. With Binda's aid, Brunero won the whole event, while Binda won six stages.|$|E
25|$|Sky {{entered the}} spring {{classics}} campaign with the perennial aim of claiming their first monument race. New recruit, Michał Kwiatkowski, {{took his first}} victory for the team in the E3 Harelbeke semi-classic. As the classics campaign progressed the team showed great consistency, but fell short of their goal again, taking second in Milan–San Remo, fifth at the Tour of Flanders and third at Paris–Roubaix. Upon entering the Ardennes classics the team pinned their hopes on Kwiatkowski at La Fleche Wallonne, to no avail. Entering the final monument of the spring, Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the team again led with Kwiatkowski. Sky finally achieved their coveted monument win, but it wasn't Kwiatkowski, but rather, <b>domestique</b> Wout Poels who emerged victorious on a day with poor weather conditions and enduring snow.|$|E

25|$|Kelly's first {{professional}} race was the Étoile de Bessèges. It started on 7 February 1977 and lasted six days. Kelly came 10th {{on the first}} day. The Flandria team was in two parts: the strongest riders, {{such as the world}} champion Freddy Maertens, were in the main section, based in Belgium. Kelly rode with the second section, based more in France because Flandria wanted to sell more of its mopeds, scooters and bicycles there. The strongest riders in both camps came together for big races. Kelly was recruited as a <b>domestique</b> for Maertens in the main team for year's Paris–Nice– shortly afterwards he won his first race, the opening stage of the Tour of Romandy– and stayed in it for the Tour de France, in which he also won a stage.|$|E
25|$|Froome {{entered the}} Vuelta a España {{as the main}} <b>domestique</b> for Bradley Wiggins in the mountains. After being inseparable from Wiggins {{throughout}} the first week, he gained credit for his ride in stage nine, helping close down {{an attack on the}} final climb and finishing in fifth place, three seconds behind Wiggins, leaving both in the top 20 overall. The following day in stage ten, however, Froome out-rode Wiggins to finish second in the time-trial behind 's Tony Martin and to take an unexpected lead in the race. Froome averaged 405 watts over 56 minutes in this time-trial, proving himself as a strong time-trialist. During stage eleven he helped his team neutralise some attacks but soon found himself unable to follow the main group. However, he managed to hang onto second place in the general classification.|$|E
500|$|In 1992, LeMond won the Tour DuPont. It {{would be}} the last major win of his career. In the 1992 Tour de France he quit the race in the mountains, {{on the same day that}} his compatriot and former <b>domestique</b> Andrew Hampsten won atop Alpe d'Huez. While LeMond claimed a serious saddle sore caused him to abandon, he had earlier stated, [...] "My {{climbing}} is not like usual. I've climbed much better in the past Tours.

500|$|The {{race was}} won by Great Britain's Chris Froome of – the third {{successive}} {{year that the}} squad had won the race, after Bradley Wiggins' victories in 2011 and 2012. [...] Froome took the overall lead of the race after winning the fifth stage, and maintained his advantage {{to the end of}} the race to win his fourth stage race of the 2013 season. Ultimately, Froome won the general classification by 58 seconds over runner-up and team-mate Richie Porte, a <b>domestique</b> for Froome in the mountainous stages on the route. The podium was completed by Daniel Moreno of , who finished 74 seconds in arrears of Porte, and two minutes 12 seconds behind Froome.|$|E

Towards the end of the year, she competed in a qualifying race for the 1990 Commonwealth Games on a hilly course that [...] "suited [...] perfectly" [...] after her hill training. She finished half a length after Madonna Harris, which secured her a place in the New Zealand team.

500|$|For {{the second}} ascent of the Col de Peyresourde during the race, the riders {{would take the}} climb in the {{opposite}} direction from what they had done on the previous day, before a slight descent and then the final climb to Peyragudes.

's Jurgen Van den Broeck tried to attack, but was pulled back by the Froome and Wiggins tandem, which then accelerated away from their rivals and set off after Valverde. Ultimately, they came up short due to Froome having to wait three times for Wiggins as the race leader was several metres behind his <b>domestique</b> on certain parts of the climb. Valverde achieved his fourth career stage victory at the Tour, nineteen seconds ahead of Froome and Wiggins, who in turn extended their advantage over the rest of the field.|$|E

With a talent for multiple sports disciplines, she won the canoeing events New Zealand White Water Downriver and Slalom Championships in 1987 and represented her country at the 1988 Canoe Slalom World Cup. Around the same time, she was also a successful triathlete, but did not continue with that sport. She bought her first mountain bike in 1988 at the age of 31 in order to compete in an adventure sport event, and within a year she had become the New Zealand national cross country champion. Around the same time, she also took up road cycling. She was included in the New Zealand team for the 1990 Commonwealth Games and was assigned as <b>domestique</b> for the top New Zealand road rider, Madonna Harris. Harris and Lynch finished in fourth and ninth places respectively. In September 1990, Lynch competed at the inaugural UCI Mountain Bike World Championships and finished tenth.
