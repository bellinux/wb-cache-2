50|$|Similar to the KART process, LRK is {{a simple}} and {{reliable}} method that allows any <b>initialisation</b> <b>mode,</b> from a static or fixed reference point, to On The Fly ambiguity resolution, when performing dual-frequency GPS positioning. LRK technology reduces initialisation times to a few seconds by efficiently using L2 measurements in every mode of operation. LRK maintains optimal real-time positioning accuracy to within a centimetre at a range up to 40-50 kilometres, even with a reduced number of visible satellites.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, a {{synchronisation}} technique {{based on}} matched cameras sharing a single clock is presented. The system affords {{a very high}} degree of synchronisation â€“ in fact, much higher than is actually demanded by the driver monitoring application. Synchronisation difficulties arising during <b>initialisation</b> and camera <b>mode</b> changes are also addressed in this paper using a novel frozen-clock programming technique.|$|R
25|$|The Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) is the 32-bit {{protected}} mode kernel {{at the core}} of Windows 9x. Its primary responsibility is to create, run, monitor and terminate virtual machines. The VMM provides services that manage memory, processes, interrupts and protection faults. The VMM works with virtual devices (loadable kernel modules, which consist mostly of 32-bit ring 0 or kernel mode code, but may include other types of code, such as a 16-bit real <b>mode</b> <b>initialisation</b> segment) to allow those virtual devices to intercept interrupts and faults to control the access that an application has to hardware devices and installed software. Both the VMM and virtual device drivers run in a single, 32-bit, flat model address space at privilege level 0 (also called ring 0). The VMM provides multi-threaded, preemptive multitasking. It runs multiple applications simultaneously by sharing CPU (central processing unit) time between the threads in which the applications and virtual machines run.|$|R
