5|$|Upon the Beatles' {{return to}} England, rumours began to {{circulate}} {{that they had}} decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance {{that there would be no}} more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How <b>I</b> <b>Won</b> the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.|$|E

25|$|In {{this part}} of the country, snake is named Bhujang, which is also the Sanskrit name for snake, in the Kutch region. The name is {{attributed}} to the city of Bhuj which is located below the hill named Bhujiya, after Bhujang, as it was the abode of snakes. On top of this hill there is a fort known as the Bhujia Fort where a temple has been built for the snake god and a second temple is {{at the foot of the}} hill known as Nani Devi. Bhujia Fort was the scene of a major battle between Deshalji I, the ruler of Kutch and Sher Buland Khan, Mughal Viceroy of Gujarat who had invaded Kutch. It was the early period of Deshalji's reign. When the army of Kutch was in a state of losing the battle, a group of Naga Bawas opened the gate of Bhujia Fort by a clever ploy of visiting Nag temple for worship and joined the fray against Sher Buland Khan's army. Eventually Deshalji <b>I</b> <b>won</b> the battle. Since that day Naga Bawa and their leader have a pride of place in the procession held on Nag Panchami day. Within the fort, at one corner, there is a small square tower dedicated to Bhujang Nag (snake god), who in folklore is said to have been the brother of Sheshnag. It is said Bhujang Nag came from Than of Kathiawar and freed Kutch from the oppression of demons known as daityas and rakshasas. The Snake Temple was also built at the time of the fortification of the hill during Deshalji I's reign and provided with a chhatri. Every year on Nag Panchami day a fair is held at the temple premises. In the Sindhi community Nag Panchami is celebrated in honour of Gogro.|$|E
