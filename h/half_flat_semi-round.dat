It uses 12 bridges of steel strings on both sides, and has three movable bridges: B <b>half</b> <b>flat</b> qaraar, E <b>half</b> <b>flat</b> and B <b>half</b> <b>flat</b> jawaab. The non-standard {{version of the}} Iraqi santur includes extra bridges so that there's no need to move those three bridges.

In {{the case of}} the scalar theory, the injective map between conformally coupled massless scalars in two spaces is reviewed. It is shown that for vector fields the injective map exists only in four dimensions. Since Euclidean AdS space is equivalent to <b>half</b> <b>flat</b> Euclidean space up to a conformal map, using the injective maps, we interpret AdS/CFT duality as a correspondence between solutions of equation of motion and the corresponding Cauchy data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} 6 -dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds M 6 {{and prove}} that any totally geodesic hypersurface N 5 of M 6 is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold, {{and so it}} has a hypo structure {{in the sense of}} [8]. We show that such a hypo structure defines a nearly Kähler structure on N 5 × R, and a compact nearly Kähler structure with conical singularities on N 5 × S 1 when N 5 is compact. Moreover, an extension of the concept of nearly Kähler structure is introduced, which we refer to as nearly <b>half</b> <b>flat</b> SU(3) -structure, that leads us to generalize the construction of nearly parallel G 2 -structures on M 6 × R given in [2].

40|$|For a k-flat F {{inside a}} locally compact CAT(0) -space X, we {{identify}} various conditions that ensure that F bounds a (k+ 1) -dimensional <b>half</b> <b>flat</b> in X. Our conditions are formulated {{in terms of}} the ultralimit of X. As applications, we obtain (1) constraints on the behavior of quasi-isometries between tocally compact CAT(0) -spaces, (2) constraints on the possible non-positively curved Riemannian metrics supported by certain manifolds, and (3) a correspondence between metric splittings of a complete, simply connected, non-positively curved Riemannian manifold and the metric splittings of its asymptotic cones. Furthermore, combining our results with the Ballmann, Burns-Spatzier rigidity theorem and the classical Mostow rigidity theorem, we also obtain (4) a new proof of Gromov's rigidity theorem for higher rank locally symmetric spaces.
