5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or not these were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E

They state that replacing the current tax system with a consumption tax would not change the tax revenue generated from the underground economy—while illicit income is not taxed directly, spending of income from illicit activity results in business income and wages that are taxed.|$|E
5|$|Predynastic Egypt {{originally}} {{consisted of}} small, independent villages. Because many deities in later times were {{strongly tied to}} particular towns and regions, many scholars {{have suggested that the}} pantheon formed as disparate communities coalesced into larger states, spreading and intermingling the worship of the old local deities. But others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most important predynastic gods were, like other elements of Egyptian culture, present all across the country despite the political divisions within it.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{conclusion}} of the final investigations, there has been heated debate about the Cerro Maravilla incident in Puerto Rico, with some groups arguing that there are still others responsible for planning and/or ordering the plot to kill the activists as well as the subsequent cover-up, while others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> incident was exaggerated by rival politicians and the media, maintaining that no conspiracy ever took place and that some of the officers incarcerated, though not all, are actually innocent.|$|E

5|$|After being {{assigned}} to cover Roosevelt during her husband's first presidential campaign, Hickok {{struck up a}} close relationship with the soon-to-be First Lady. For several years, the two corresponded almost every day, traveled together, and professed emotional and physical affection for one another. The exact nature of this relationship has been widely discussed by historians; some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> relationship was clearly romantic or erotic, while others have argued that historians have been misled by Roosevelt's exuberant letters. It is known, and was known in the White House press corps at the time, that Hickok was a lesbian. More than 3,000 letters from the pair's correspondence are preserved at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
5|$|As {{indicated}} above, it {{was through}} the writings of Dares the Phrygian that the portrayal of Troilus as an important warrior was transmitted to medieval times. However, some authors <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tradition of Troilus as a warrior may be older. The passage from the Iliad described above is read by Boitani as implying that Priam put Troilus {{on a par with}} the very best of his warrior sons. The description of him in that passage as hippiocharmên is rendered by some authorities as meaning a warrior charioteer rather than merely someone who delights in horses. The many missing and partial literary sources might include such a hero. Yet only the one ancient vase shows Troilus as a warrior falling in a conventional battle.|$|E
5|$|Kiarostami's films often {{reflect upon}} {{immaterial}} {{concepts such as}} the soul and afterlife. At times, however, {{the very concept of}} the spiritual seems to be contradicted by the medium itself, given that it has no inherent means to confer the metaphysical. Some film theorists <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Wind Will Carry Us provides a template by which a filmmaker can communicate metaphysical reality. The limits of the frame and the representation through dialogue with another that is not represented, physically become metaphors for the relationship between this world and those that may exist apart from it. By limiting the space of the mise en scène, Kiarostami expands the space of the art.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pyramids {{were laid}} out as {{a map of the}} three stars in the belt of Orion, {{although}} this theory has been criticized by reputable astronomers. The site was instead probably governed by a spectacular hierophany which occurs at the summer solstice, when the sun, viewed from the Sphinx terrace, forms - together with the two giant pyramids - the symbol Akhet, which was also the name of the Great Pyramid. Further, the south east corners of all the 3 pyramids align towards the temple of Heliopolis, as first discovered by the Egyptologist Mark Lehner.|$|E
5|$|Some historians <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ford {{administration}} {{felt the}} need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they {{felt the need}} to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Some pundits <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> top {{was not in}} fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever {{he is in a}} dream and without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his hand is shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E

5|$|The false potto (Pseudopotto martini) is a lorisoid primate of {{uncertain}} taxonomic status {{found in}} Africa. Anthropologist Jeffrey H. Schwartz named it in 1996 {{as the only}} species of the genus Pseudopotto {{on the basis of}} two specimens (consisting only of skeletal material) that had previously been identified as pottos (Perodicticus potto). The precise provenances of the two specimens are uncertain, but at least one may have come from Cameroon. Schwartz thought the false potto could even represent a separate family, but other researchers <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supposed distinguishing features of the animal do not actually distinguish it from the potto; specifically, the false potto shares several features with West African pottos.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} Tribal Hidage remains unknown: many scholars {{believe that it was}} a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested. The hidage figures may be purely symbolic and merely reflect the prestige of each territory, or they may represent an early example of book-keeping. Many historians are convinced that the Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E
5|$|Until {{recently}} {{historians have}} accepted {{an account of}} the time that Tecumseh was furious with Tenskwatawa for losing the battle, and that Tecumseh had threatened to kill his brother for making the attack. According to this story, the Prophet lost prestige after the battle and no longer served as a leader of the confederacy. In their subsequent meetings with Harrison, several Native leaders claimed that the Prophet's influence was destroyed; some accounts said that he was being persecuted by other leaders. Historians Alfred A. Cave and Robert Owens <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Natives were probably trying to mislead Harrison, in an attempt to calm the situation, and that Tenskwatawa continued {{to play an important role}} in the confederacy.|$|E

5|$|A bone {{unique to}} pterosaurs, {{known as the}} pteroid, {{connected}} to the wrist and helped to support a forward membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this forward membrane {{may have been more}} extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pteroid pointed forward, extending the forward membrane. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward, but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought. Peters (2009) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘saddle' of the radiale (proximal syncarpal) and both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia. This view of the articulation of the pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis, both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal.|$|E
5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised sodomy allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips <b>have</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
