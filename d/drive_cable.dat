Precise <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} as an alternative transmission element to gearbox, belt and pulleys, chains and sprocket in Electro-Optical Tracking system. Precise <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> has several significant advantages including backlash free, high stiffness, high efficiency, no lubrication etc. This paper develops analytical methods to predict the transverse oscillation frequency of precise <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> to enable designers to better assess dynamic performance in the design study phase. Theoretical formulation of transverse oscillation equation for precise <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> is carried out based on Hamilton’s principle taking into account flexural rigidity of cable.

50|$|The {{diskette}} drives {{installed in}} the Osborne 1 were Siemens FDD 100-5s (MPI drives were also used later), which were actually manufactured in California by GSI, a drive manufacturer that the German firm had purchased. They utilized a custom controller board that Osborne produced themselves, which among other things had a single connector for both the power and data lines. The FDD 100-5 proved to be quite trouble-prone as Osborne's quality control was lacking {{and many of the}} controller boards had soldering defects. In addition, the <b>drive</b> <b>cable</b> was not keyed and could be very easily installed upside-down, which would short out components in the computer and there were also problems with the drive head going past track 0 and getting stuck in place. The combo power/data cable also had a tendency of overheating.|$|E
50|$|The second {{generation}} K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate {{into a single}} unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor <b>drive</b> <b>cable</b> which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.|$|E

5000|$|A form {{of fraud}} is {{to tamper with}} the reading on an mileometer/odometer and {{presenting}} the incorrect number of miles/kilometers traveled to a prospective buyer; this {{is often referred to}} as [...] "clocking" [...] in the UK and [...] "Busting miles" [...] in the US. This is done to make a car appear to have been driven less than it really has been, and thus increase its apparent market value. Most [...] new cars sold today use digital odometers that store the mileage in the vehicle's engine control module making it difficult (but not impossible) to manipulate the mileage electronically. With mechanical odometers, the speedometer can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back, or the <b>drive</b> <b>cable</b> can be disconnected and connected to another odometer/speedometer pair while on the road. Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage, a property that provides the premise for a classic scene late in the comedy film Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but modern odometers add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward, thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle.|$|E

The control system design concepts of cosmonauts’ horizontal movements under non-gravity and reduced gravity environment simulation were studied.

40|$|Eighteen {{patients}} {{suffering from}} acute left heart failure were selected as candidates for Hemopump support. In 6 patients, peripheral atheromatosis prevented insertion of the device. Of the remaining 12 patients, 9 had postcardiotomy shock, 2 had acute rejection after orthotopic heart transplantation, and 1 had {{acute myocardial infarction}} complicated by a large postinfarction ventricular septal defect. During Hemopump support, hemodynamics recovered in all patients. Major complications were related to mechanical pump failure, such as fracture of the <b>drive</b> <b>cable</b> and expulsion of the cannula out of the ventricle, or to hemolysis of variable degree. Seven patients (58 %) survived and were discharged from the hospital: the 2 patients bridged to heart transplantation and 5 of the 9 postcardiotomy patients, including 1 {{who could not be}} weaned but later underwent successful transplantation. The patient with the postinfarction ventricular septal defect died after removal of the device because of hemolysis. These results indicate that the Hemopump is a relatively noninvasive and efficacious left ventricular system of moderate power. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{power of}} modal {{analysis}} reaches {{far beyond the}} structural dynamics domain which has nurtured its development. One of the areas where it has scarcely – if ever- been applied is in the electromagnetic dynamics of electrical machine windings. Because {{of the use of}} power-electronic drives, it transpires that these systems are seeing excitation at frequencies which are in the same order as resonances and a modal approach is highly relevant. Current electromagnetic dynamics models contain strong frequency-dependent properties which can be replaced by suitable discretisations and model reduction which retains modal fidelity is central. Component-mode synthesis methods also have much to offer in the modelling of the <b>drive,</b> <b>cable,</b> motor and earthing network system and in enabling measured characteristics to be substituted for component models. Identification methods based on modal parameters can apply directly but most importantly, the concept of modal participation factors at the terminals is pivotal since all excitation of these complex dynamic systems must pass through these degrees of freedom which are very few in number. This paper attempts to build an initial bridge to make the advances in structural modal analysis accessible to an engineering discipline which can benefit greatly...|$|E
40|$|Dexterous {{continuum}} manipulators (DCMs) can largely {{increase the}} reachable region and steerability for minimally and less invasive surgery. Many such procedures require the DCM {{to be capable}} of producing large deflections. The real-time control of the DCM shape requires sensors that accurately detect and report large deflections. We propose a novel, large deflection, shape sensor to track the shape of a 35 mm DCM designed for a less invasive treatment of osteolysis. Two shape sensors, each with three fiber Bragg grating sensing nodes is embedded within the DCM, and the sensors&# 39; distal ends fixed to the DCM. The DCM centerline is computed using the centerlines of each sensor curve. An experimental platform was built and different groups of experiments were carried out, including free bending and three cases of bending with obstacles. For each experiment, the DCM <b>drive</b> <b>cable</b> was pulled with a precise linear slide stage, the DCM centerline was calculated, and a 2 D camera image was captured for verification. The reconstructed shape created with the shape sensors is compared with the ground truth generated by executing a 2 D- 3 D registration between the camera image and 3 D DCM model. Results show that the distal tip tracking accuracy is 0. 40 ± 0. 30 mm for the free bending and 0. 61 ± 0. 15 mm, 0. 93 ± 0. 05 mm and 0. 23 ± 0. 10 mm for three cases of bending with obstacles.

40|$|Modem {{process control}} systems often employ {{accurate}} position or speed controlled PWM motors, which require feedback {{data for the}} drive control loop. Current methods require an independently shielded cable for feedback data transmission. This {{is due to the}} fact that high-voltage PWM signals could easily interfere with the feedback signals, which are typically one or more orders of magnitude smaller than typical PWM signals. We propose a "zero-wire" solution, in which the additional feedback cable used is eliminated, and the feedback data is sent simultaneously with the PWM signals in the same motor power conductors. In this study, we first analyzed the characteristics of typical feedback and PWM signals. Additionally, a standard representative motor <b>drive</b> <b>cable</b> was carefully measured and analyzed for its wave transport characteristics. The results lead us to select an RF modulation approach in which we modulate the data signals to 900 MHz. The data signals are injected and extracted from the power conductors using feed-through capacitors and high-pass filters. To test the performance of our approach, we build a model system in which simulated PWM signals were applied to a 30 m motor power cable fitted with data couplers and 900 MHz RF RS 232 data modems for modulation. (cont.) Tests with different cables and attenuation were performed and data error rates measured. The error rates for strong RF signals, RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values higher than - 60 dBm, were limited by RF modem performance to 0. 01 %. Error rates did not increase with or without PWM power signals when RSSI values were over - 80 dBm. A design for transmission of DC power for motor feedback electronics is presented, in which we choose an intermediate frequency carrier at 1 MHz to transmit power. The 1 MHz signals are injected and extracted through the same feed-through capacitors using band-pass filters. Measurements and simulation have shown that the new feedback data transport system design developed in this project is effective and feasible. by Jose A. Mendez. Thesis (M. Eng.)
