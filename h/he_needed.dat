5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage <b>he</b> <b>needed.</b> However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company's technical experts if {{he would be able to}} feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> for a penny per copy.|$|E
5|$|Hay {{was not a}} {{supporter}} of Lincoln for president until after his nomination in 1860. Hay then made speeches and wrote newspaper articles boosting Lincoln's candidacy. When Nicolay, who had been made Lincoln's private secretary for the campaign, found <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> help with the huge amounts of correspondence, Hay worked full-time for Lincoln for six months.|$|E

50|$|Interrogation is an interaction, and, {{even before}} {{considering}} the different attitudes the subject may have, the interrogator {{needs to know}} his own style, strengths and weaknesses. <b>He</b> <b>needs</b> to judge if <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> cultural advice, how to handle language issues, and if <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> specialist help.|$|R

Several days later, Keating was given the desired materials and two weeks to write his report by the committee.|$|E
5|$|In another essay, {{he refers}} to James Baldwin's {{struggle}} to use the English language to accurately represent his experience, and his realisation that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> {{to take control of}} the language and expand it.

50|$|Getcha Some is a {{moderate}} up-tempo with spoken-word verses. This song {{is about a}} man who is trying to achieve higher things in life. First <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> love and to get the love <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> money. Once <b>he</b> gets the money, he gets the girl but after a while he still doesn't feel fulfilled and realizes <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to have children.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} episode, [...] "King of the Mountain", Lara Parker plays a widowed ranch owner with whom Caine finds employment. She offers him {{money for his}} labors, but he refuses saying that all <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> is food and place to sleep. She presses him and insists there must be more <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> (i.e., sex). It is subtly implied that she {{eventually}} supplies what <b>he</b> <b>needs.</b> It is also implied that she is attracted by the [...] "tattoos" [...] on his forearms.|$|R
5000|$|... "There's a Hole in My Bucket" [...] (or [...] "...in the Bucket") is a children's song, {{based on}} a {{dialogue}} between two characters, called Henry and Liza, about a leaky bucket. The song describes a deadlock situation: Henry has a leaky bucket, and Liza tells him to repair it. But to fix the leaky bucket, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> straw. To cut the straw, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> an axe. To sharpen the axe, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> to wet the sharpening stone. To wet the stone, <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> water. However, when Henry asks {{how to get the}} water, Liza's answer is [...] "in a bucket". It is implied that only the leaky bucket is available, which, if it could carry water, would need no repairing in the first place.|$|R
5|$|Some {{members of}} the Lithuanian nobility opposed the growing Polish–Lithuanian union and offered the Lithuanian crown to Ivan IV. The Tsar {{publicly}} advertised this option, either because he took the offer seriously, or because <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> time to strengthen his Livonian troops. Throughout 1561, a Russo-Lithuanian truce (with a scheduled expiration date of 1562) was respected by both sides.|$|E
5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion and put down internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Newburgh {{writing in}} the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey’s early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the {{paternal}} and maternal inheritances while <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou. Henry’s brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.|$|E
50|$|The God Box is a {{stand-alone}} fantasy novel where the unlikely protagonist finds himself {{the keeper of}} a small wooden box that provides cryptic guidance from the gods. He must stay ahead of a deadly manhunt and play his role in an ancient prophecy. The box, if asked, takes what <b>he</b> does not <b>need</b> and gives him what <b>he</b> does <b>need</b> but what <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> and what <b>he</b> thinks <b>he</b> <b>needs</b> are usually very different which lends itself to humorous and unexpected situations.|$|R

5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split up once again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bacher {{returned}} to Ithaca to head Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed {{to become a}} major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, but first <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to find somewhere to put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City.|$|E
5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to {{know was}} that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E

5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Major Schmidt decided <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to see for himself what was {{happening}} at the bridges. He headed for the bridge in his SdKfz 250 halftrack with a motorcycle escort. Travelling at high speed they unknowingly passed the forward line of 'D' Company's defence and drove onto the bridge whereupon the British company opened fire. The soldier aboard the motorcycle was killed and the halftrack was forced off the road. Schmidt and his driver were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Berger told Simpson that if {{he wanted}} to be a {{successful}} road cyclist, <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> experience in track cycling, particularly in the pursuit discipline. Simpson competed regularly at Fallowfield Stadium in Manchester, where in early 1956 he met amateur world pursuit silver medallist Cyril Cartwright, who helped him develop his technique. At the national championships at Fallowfield the 18-year-old Simpson won a silver medal in the individual pursuit, defeating amateur world champion Norman Sheil before losing to Mike Gambrill.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{arrived in}} Princeton, New Jersey, in late December 1805. He had {{completed}} his final exams by April 5, {{but he declined}} his father's offer to come to Washington because <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> {{to catch up on}} his studies in arithmetic. When the next term began in May, he joined the American Whig–Cliosophic Society, a debating society founded by James Madison, Philip Freneau, Aaron Burr, and Henry Lee in 1769.|$|E

At the end of each of these, there will be a generator with a magically sphere and Casper needs to quickly shoot them down.|$|R
5|$|Brock felt <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> to go further. He was {{hampered}} by Governor General George Prevost, who had replaced Craig in late 1811. Prevost's {{orders from the}} government, and his own inclinations, were to emphasise defence. Prevost kept {{the bulk of his}} forces in Lower Canada to protect Quebec, and opposed any attack into United States. Brock also believed that he was handicapped by inertia and defeatism among the Legislature and other officials.|$|E
5|$|By late 1941, Pontecorvo {{was having}} {{difficulty}} securing the radioisotopes that <b>he</b> <b>needed.</b> Unbeknown to him, the Manhattan Project, the wartime {{effort to build}} atomic bombs, was cornering the market. In an attempt to obtain them, he met with Fermi, von Halban and George Placzek in New York in April 1942. He was unable to secure the supplies he wanted, but Fermi showed an unexpected keen interest in the Wells Surveys work.|$|E
5|$|Clement IX had {{primarily}} named Italian cardinals to the college, only appointing one French and one Spanish cardinal when <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> {{their assistance}} {{to fight back}} an invasion by the Ottoman Empire in Crete. He created his friends cardinals, with seven of the twelve that he created coming from his native Tuscany. Clement did not feel obligated to appoint a German cardinal because the Holy Roman Emperor had requested his assistance in Hungary. Within days of his death Clement IX had created seven additional cardinals, which brought the number of potential electors to its maximum number of seventy.|$|E
