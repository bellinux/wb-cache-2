50|$|Pre-echo, {{sometimes}} called a <b>forward</b> <b>echo,</b> (not {{to be confused}} with reverse echo) is a digital audio compression artifact where a sound is heard before it occurs (hence the name). It is most noticeable in impulsive sounds from percussion instruments such as castanets or cymbals.|$|E
40|$|Ghost {{artifacts}} in echoplanar imaging (EPI) arise from phase errors caused by differences in eddy currents and gradient ramping during left-to-right traversal of kx (<b>forward</b> <b>echo)</b> versus right-to-left traversal of kx (reverse echo). Reference scans {{do not always}} reduce the artifact and may make image quality worse. To {{eliminate the need for}} reference scans, a ghost artifact reduction technique based on image phase correction was developed, in which phase errors are directly estimated from images reconstructed separately using only the forward or only the reverse echos. In practice, this technique is applicable only to single-shot EPI that produces only one ghost (shifted 1 ⁄ 2 the field of view from the parent image), because the technique requires that the ghosts do not completely overlap the parent image. For higher spatial resolution, typically an even number of separate k-space traversals (interleaves) are combined to produc...|$|E
50|$|Like {{traditional}} voice-band modems, a DSLAM's integrated DSL modems {{are usually}} able {{to probe the}} line and to adjust themselves to electronically or digitally compensate for <b>forward</b> <b>echoes</b> and other bandwidth-limiting factors {{in order to move}} data at the maximum possible connection rate.|$|R
50|$|When a {{returning}} reflection strikes another discontinuity, some of {{the signal}} rebounds in the original signal direction, creating multiple <b>echo</b> effects. These <b>forward</b> <b>echoes</b> strike the receiver at different intervals {{making it difficult for}} the receiver to accurately detect data values on the signal. The effects can resemble those of jitter.|$|R
50|$|Forward echo: In a {{transmission}} line, a reflection propagating {{in the same}} direction as the original wave and consisting of energy reflected back by one discontinuity and then forward again by another discontinuity. <b>Forward</b> <b>echoes</b> can be supported by reflections caused by splices or other discontinuities in the transmission medium (e.g. optical fiber, twisted pair, or coaxial tube). In metallic lines, they may be supported by impedance mismatches between the source or load and the characteristic impedance of the transmission medium. They may cause attenuation distortion.|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{to prevent the}} formation of image and spectral Nyquist ghosts in echo-planar spectroscopic imaging is introduced. It {{is based on a}} novel Cartesian center-out echo-planar spectroscopic imaging trajectory, referred to as EPSICO, and combined with a correction of the gradient-echo phase and time shifts. Processing of homogenous sets of <b>forward</b> and reflected <b>echoes</b> is no longer necessary, resulting in an optimized spectral width. The proposed center-out trajectory passively prevents the formation of Nyquist ghosts by privileging the acquisition of the center k-space line with <b>forward</b> <b>echoes</b> at the beginning of an echo-planar spectroscopic imaging dwell time and by ensuring that all k-space lines and their respective complex conjugates are acquired at equal time intervals. With the proposed procedure, concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate, creatine, choline, glutamate, and myo-inositol were reliably determined in human white matter at 3 T...|$|R

3000|$|In the ICMP echo scheme, {{when the}} CN sends an echo reply message {{back to the}} MN, each {{intermediate}} MRT router appends its own address to the [...] "MRT" [...] field and <b>forwards</b> the <b>echo</b> packet to the MN via HA. The MN can thus obtain IP addresses of the MRT routers that have been found. In the ICMP destination-unreachable scheme, the intermediate MRT-enabled routers issue the MRT binding request messages to the HA. After replying to the MRT binding response message, the HA also uses a table to keep addresses of MRT routers and informs the MN.|$|R

40|$|Extending {{research}} {{on the performance of}} Mergers and Acquisitions (M&As), this paper seeks to explain how the post-acquisition integration phase affects acquisition performance. Despite extensive research efforts, there remains a scant understanding of how acquisition implementation, particularly in the post-acquisition integration phase, impacts the performance of M&As. Based on an extensive study of eight acquisitions, in this paper, a grounded model detailing the mechanisms by which the post-acquisition integration phase affects acquisition performance is developed. The model posits that integration-related factors do not bear directly upon acquisition performance. Instead, their effect is mediated by functional organizations in both firms. When focusing into these functional mediating dynamics, we observe that integration-related processual, behavioural and cultural factors affect the identified functional mediators in different ways. Going <b>forward,</b> we <b>echo</b> calls for integrated perspectives to the study of M&A and M&A performance in particular...|$|R

[...] The rear inflow notch (or weak echo channel) occurs to the east or north of a mesocyclone and hook <b>echo.</b> <b>Forward</b> inflow notches also occur, particularly on high-precipitation supercells (HP) and quasi-linear convective systems (QLCS).|$|R
50|$|Spy photographers {{captured}} early, {{engineering test}} mules of the U553 in late 2015, which sported a crude highly modified non-production intent F-150 SuperCrew body atop the production intent T3 platform chassis. In late 2016, spy photographers managed to capture {{photos of the}} actual first pre-production prototypes of the U553, wearing the production intent body on the production intent platform. The styling and appearance of the U553 Expedition is inspired by the U502 Explorer along with elements of the P552 F-150, the vehicle on which the new Expedition is based, and will have a more aerodynamic and streamlined silhouette, with raked windshield and sloped roofline which {{will lead to a}} rear liftgate spoiler. The U553 Expedition's C-pillar will be more <b>forward</b> slanted, <b>echoing</b> the <b>forward</b> slanted C-pillar of the U502 Explorer introduced for 2011. In addition the Expedition's body will feature sculpted sides with character lines, similar to the U502 Explorer, as opposed to the straight slab sides of the current Expedition. Expedition's front grill and headlamp design is inspired by the facelifted P552 F-150, with the front bumper retaining a similar design and appearance to its predecessor, the U324 Expedition, after its facelift. It also expanded the standard size version's wheelbase by 3 inches and its length by 4 inches while decreasing the height by one inch (losing 300 pounds in the process) in order to allow more leg room and space.|$|R
60|$|A sharp {{exclamation from}} Captain Brisket {{was the only}} reply, and he turned just as Mr. Chalk, with a rifle {{in one hand and}} a {{revolver}} in the other, appeared on deck. The captain’s cry was <b>echoed</b> <b>forward,</b> and three of the crew dived with marvellous skill into the forecastle. The boy and two others dashed into the galley so hurriedly that the cook, who was peeping out, was borne backwards on to the stove and kept there, the things he said in the heat of the moment being attributed to excitement and attracting no attention. Tredgold, Brisket, and Stobell dodged behind the galley, and Mr. Chalk was left to gaze in open-mouthed wonder at the shrinking figure of Mr. Duckett at the wheel. They regarded each other in silence, until a stealthy step behind Mr. Chalk made him turn round smartly. Mr. Stobell, who was stealing up to secure him, dodged hastily behind the mainmast.|$|R
5000|$|The {{inclusion}} part of {{the idea}} is perhaps best encapsulated by the [...] "50/50 rule", a term used by public managers in Grand Rapids, Michigan, to invoke a variety of meanings. [...] Sometimes [...] "50/50" [...] means that process and outcome are equally important, in other words {{that the effects of}} a process on community building are as important as the task completion. Sometimes it means that ideally 50% of the people involved in a process have participated in prior, related processes and 50% are newcomers, such that each policy-making effort acknowledges past conversations or decisions yet remains open to new ideas that may alter the previous consensus. From the perspective of the 50/50 rule, things like process and outcome or task and community are not in a trade-off relationship, and indeed are not even separable. [...] In this context, concluding that participation was done [...] "for the sake of participation" [...] rather than to effect the outcome would be a damning critique. Keeping process and outcome, newcomers and old-timers, and past and present in play are ways of creating connections across individuals, groups, interests, and issues. Tasks are accomplished, yet opportunities continue to be open for revising as well as for moving on to the other issues and tasks that emerge or are next in line. This sense of inclusion is part of an ongoing stream of issues and people involved in one process or concern rolling <b>forward</b> into another <b>echoes</b> theorizations of democracy and civic engagement as an ongoing inquiry and never-finished project.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{historians have}} {{described}} Ginzburg's ideas as being connected {{to those of}} Murray. Hungarian historian Gábor Klaniczay asserted that [...] "Ginzburg reformulated Murray's often fantastic and very inadequately documented thesis about {{the reality of the}} witches' Sabbath" [...] and thus the publication of I Benandanti in 1966 [...] "reopened the debate about the possible interconnections between witchcraft beliefs and the survival of pagan fertility cults". Similarly, Romanian historian of religion Mircea Eliade asserted that while Ginzburg's presentation of the benandanti [...] "does not substantiate Murray's entire thesis", it did represent a [...] "well-documented case of the processus through which a popular and archaic secret cult of fertility is transformed into a merely magical, or even black-magical practice under the pressure of the Inquisition."Conversely, other scholars sought to draw a clear divide between the ideas of Murray and Ginzburg. In 1975, Cohn asserted that Ginzburg's discovery had [...] "nothing to do" [...] with the theories put <b>forward</b> by Murray. <b>Echoing</b> these views, in 1999 English historian Ronald Hutton asserted that Ginzburg's ideas regarding shamanistic fertility cults were actually [...] "pretty much the opposite" [...] of what Murray had posited. Hutton pointed out that Ginzburg's argument that [...] "ancient dream-worlds, or operations on non-material planes of consciousness, helped to create a new set of fantasies {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages" [...] differed strongly from Murray's argument that an organised religion of witches had survived from the pre-Christian era and that descriptions of witches' sabbaths were accounts of real events.|$|R
40|$|Experimental and {{theoretical}} studies of phonon echoes in bulk and powdered materials are reviewed. Phonon echoes {{have been observed}} in many materials such as bulk piezoelectric crystals, paramagnets, glasses, doped semiconductors, and piezoelectric, magnetic, and metallic powders, etc. The echoes arise from a time reversal of the phase, like spin echoes, of a primary pulsed acoustic excitation due to a second acoustic or rf pulse. The phase reversal occurs through the nonlinear interactions of acoustic oscillations with either themselves or electromagnetic fields. The diversing phonon echo phenomena can be classified into two general classes {{depending on the type}} of nonlinear mechanism responsible for echo formation : In parametric "field-mode" interaction systems the applied rf field of the second pulse interacts with the modes excited by the primary pulse to cause phase reversal. The echo amplitude of this class decreases monotonously with the time separation of applied two pulses, τ. Backward and <b>forward</b> propagating wave <b>echoes</b> in bulk materials belong to this class. In "anharmonic oscillator" systems different oscillation modes nonlinearly couple to one another to cause subsequent echo formation. The echo amplitude initially increases with τ and takes a maximum before decreasing exponentially for large τ. Only the powder echoes are in this class. In addition to these dynamic echo phenomena there are quasistatic three-pulse echoes in which phases are stored for days and years, phenomena being applicable to mass storage devices. The essential physics of phonon echo phenomena seems to be well understood although precise quantitative descriptions of each phenomenon are still required. The phonon echo studies are now being applied to a tool for physics and to technology...|$|R
30|$|The STCW Convention {{provides}} required {{components for}} seafarer training, which use the radar simulator {{as a tool}} of training and assessment. These highlights include (Ali 2006; Organization 2006; Teel et al. 2009): factors affecting performance and accuracy; detection of misrepresentation of information, including false echoes and sea returns; setting up and maintaining displays; range and bearing; plotting techniques and relative motion concepts; identification of critical echoes; course and speed of other ships; time and distance of the closest approach to crossing, meeting or overtaking ships; detecting course and speed changes of other ships; effects on the changes of the own ship’s course or speed or both; and application of the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea. To fulfill all of these training requirements, a high performance marine radar simulator is needed. In the current marine radar simulator market, the major developing teams include Nautical Software (2016), Bridge Command (2016), Kongsberg Maritime (2016), Landfall (2016), and Dalian Maritime University Institute of Navigational Technology (2016). In addition, some previous research investigates methods to improve the marine radar simulator. For example, Arnold-Bos et al. developed a versatile bistatic and polarimetric marine radar simulator. In their simulator, realistic sea surfaces are generated using the two-scale model on a semi-deterministic basis, so as to incorporate the presence of ship wakes in the simulation (Arnold-Bos et al. 2006). Yin et al. designed a radar simulator using a PC to generate radar echoes and a radar interface board to generate radar signals. Their simulator has a more flexible and realistic operation interface than other simulators (Yin et al. 2007). Zhang et al. put <b>forward</b> a coastline <b>echo</b> intensity algorithm based on RGB and HIS color models and applied this algorithm on the marine radar simulator. The simulation results from this model are consistent with the electronic chart (Zhang et al. 2010).|$|R
40|$|Correctly {{predicting}} price {{movements in}} stock markets carries obvious economical benefits. The task is traditionally solved {{by analyzing the}} underlying company, or the historical price development of the company s stock. A third option that is undergoing active research {{is to create a}} predictive model of the stock using machine learning. This thesis follows the latter approach, in which a machine learning algorithm is presented with historical stock data. The algorithm uses this information to train a model that is expected to infer future prices given recent price information. Machine learning is a large field within computer science, and is under constant development. Breakthroughs in a family of machine learning models known as artificial neural networks have spiked an increased interest in these models, including applying them for financial prediction. With a plethora of models available, selecting between them is difficult, especially considering the constant flow of emerging models and learning techniques. This study compares a selection of artificial neural networks when applied for stock market price prediction. The networks are selected to be relevant to the problem, and aim at covering recent advances in the field of artificial neural networks. The networks considered include: Feed <b>forward</b> neural networks, <b>echo</b> state networks, conditional restricted Boltzmann machines, time-delay neural networks and convolutional neural networks. These models are also compared to another type of machine learning algorithm, known as support vector machines. The models are trained on daily stock exchange data, to make short-term predictions for one day and two days ahead. Performance is evaluated in the context of following the models directly in a financial strategy, trading every prediction they make. Additional performance measures are also considered, to make the comparison as informed as possible. Possibly due to the noisy nature of stock data, the results are slightly inconsistent between different data sets. If performance is averaged across data sets, the feed forward network generates most profit during the three year test period: 23. 13 % and 30. 43 % for single-step and double- step prediction, respectively. Convolutional networks get close to the feed forward in terms of profitability, but are found unreliable due to their unreasonable bias towards predicting positive price changes. The support vector machine delivered average profits of 17. 28 % for single-step and 11. 30 % for double-step. Low profits or large deviations were observed for the other models...|$|R
