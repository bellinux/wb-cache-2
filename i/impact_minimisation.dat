40|$|Management of {{environmental}} risks in coastal and marine waters is increasingly important, as regulatory policy moves from discharge compliance alone towards <b>impact</b> <b>minimisation.</b> Decision-making (for operational and remediation management) requires access to best quality information on key environmental quality parameters. However, current data resources are fragmented and generally sparse both spatially and temporally. They also possess varying uncertainty. The i-MARQ project is developing enhanced decision support paradigms which can optimally exploit diverse data resources, and present probabilistic {{results in the}} geographic formats required by decision-makers. Application of data fusion techniques permits forecasting of parameters, by combining latest measured values with the statistical characteristics of historic datasets. It also inherently tracks the uncertainty of those forecasts. This determination of information robustness is considered an essential ingredient of advanced environmental decision support systems...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of {{the current status of}} municipal sewage pond systems in the Free State region was undertaken to provide the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) Free State Regional Office with a strategic decision support tool to evaluate the current status of the sewage pond systems in order to have base line information from where actions should be taken. This will also contribute to a healthy environment by ensuring that strategic environmental issues associated with sewage systems are identified and that potential strategies for <b>impact</b> <b>minimisation</b> and prevention are implemented. This paper provides feedback on the background to the study, literature review conducted, the tool developed that can be utilized to assess pond systems and its outputs. This tool must be seen as a positive evaluation tool to ensure good management of pond systems to promote a healthy environment...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic impacts {{contribute}} to the global deterioration in the quality and productivity of marine and coastal environments. These impacts include over-exploitation, physical alteration, marine pollution, introduction of alien species and global atmospheric change. Marine environmental management (MEM) represents a set of interdisciplinary tools used by planners and managers to promote and enhance marine and coastal biological diversity. The components of marine environmental management include resource allocation, <b>impact</b> <b>minimisation,</b> pollution control {{and the provision of}} protected areas. This Chapter will examine how Australia and Canada have supported specific MEM activities including: environmental protection, conservation and planning; state of the environment reporting; protected areas; education and community networks; and information systems. Developments in ecologically sustainable development and coastal zone management will also be addressed. The conclusion will compare and contrast key elements of Australian and Canadian marine environmental management...|$|E
40|$|Alternate cycling of sludge in aerobic, anoxic, and {{anaerobic}} regimes is {{a promising}} strategy that {{can reduce the}} sludge yield of conventional activated sludge (CAS) by up to 50 % with potentially lower capital and operating cost than physical- and/or chemical-based sludge minimisation techniques. The mechanisms responsible for reducing sludge yield include alterations to cellular metabolism and feeding behaviour (metabolic uncoupling, feasting/fasting, and endogenous decay), biological floc destruction, and predation on bacteria by higher organisms. Though discrepancies across various studies are recognisable, {{it is apparent that}} sludge retention time, oxygen-reduction potential of the anaerobic tank, temperature, sludge return ratio and loading mode are relevant to sludge minimisation by sludge cycling approaches. The <b>impact</b> of sludge <b>minimisation</b> on CAS operation (e. g., organics and nutrient removal efficiency and sludge settleability) is highlighted, and key areas requiring further research are also identified...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, after {{reviewing}} {{the results of the}} ExternE project and its follow-up stages in the estimation of the external costs of electricity production, we look at the policy instruments for the internalisation of such costs. Emphasis is given to subsidies, such as feed-in tariffs, competitive bidding processes and tradable green certificates to stimulate the use of renewables in the production of electricity. When policy-makers are asked to choose the instrument(s) to internalise the externalities in the electricity production, they have to find a solution that gives the best outcome in terms of efficiency, cost <b>minimisation,</b> <b>impact</b> on the job market, security of energy supply, equity of the instrument, technological innovation, certainty of the level of the internalisation, and feasibility. The choice of the instrument will require some trade-offs among these criteria. Conjoint choice analysis can help in investigating how stakeholders and policy makers trade off the criteria when choosing a policy for the internalisation of the externalities. In this paper we present the first results of a questionnaire that employs conjoint choice questions to find out how policy makers an...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, a {{simplified}} Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) method has been developed, which incorporates Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) to calculate QM/MM corrections for classically obtained MM free energies. This method {{has been applied}} to the calculation of hydration free energies and protein-ligand binding free energies. The hydration free energy study showed that for small organic compounds the QM/MM method could perform as well as standard MM. Further analysis highlighted that implementing QM/MM appeared to over-polarise for compounds with hydrogen bonding moieties. This over-polarisation was caused by the embedding technique utilised. Hence, the embedding strategy was adapted to utilize a Gaussian blurring approach, which enabled the <b>minimisation</b> <b>impact</b> of this over-polarisation. For the protein-ligand studies three proteins were investigated; COX- 2, neuraminidase and CDK 2. The results from these studies showed that the QM/MM method obtain less accurate results than conventional MM. This has been attributed to several factors, including; too simplistic embedding techniques leading to over polarisation for extremely polar protein-ligand systems (neuraminidase) and poor agreement for protein-ligand systems with small pocket sizes. Also, GCMC simulations have identified that erroneous system setup for CDK 2 is the root cause of extremely poor correlation in both MM and QM/MM free energy studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Eco-efficiency Parametric Screening (EcoPaS) methodology, {{described}} in this paper, offers a systematic approach to component selection based on environmental <b>impact</b> <b>minimisation.</b> Starting from functional systems requirements, which are known in a very early design stage and often form part of the task specification, designers can browse alternative solutions with the aim to translate functional block descriptions into specific system components. For this purpose different techniques are called upon, mapping functional parameters onto environmental cost defining physical parameters. These mapping techniques, inspired by cost estimating relationships (CER’s,) offer opportunities to quickly screen system level design alternatives, resulting in early estimates for environmental performance indicators. In this paper the different mapping techniques, used as underlying building blocks for the EcoPaS system library, are described. Practical examples offer {{better understanding of the}} concepts. The functionality offered by the described methodology is illustrated by means of a comprehensive example of a machine system component...|$|E
40|$|Despite closure {{regulations}} being recent in Brazil, many {{mining companies}} {{are attempting to}} adopt best practice and are facing the challenge of closing their mines properly instead of simply complying with current legislation or abandoning the mine site. This paper summarizes mine closure according to both the Brazilian legislation and the "Deliberação Normativa" COPAM Nº 127, that establishes the directives and procedures for environmental assessment at the mine closure stage. Even {{with the lack of}} laws and regulations addressing mine closure, the Brazilian mining industry today is at the forefront of environmental <b>impact</b> <b>minimisation</b> techniques. Some case studies in Minas Gerais State, two of them located in the Iron Quadrangle, provide excellent evidence of the industry's rehabilitation expertise. This paper presents an overview of mine closure legislation in Brazil and in the State of Minas Gerais and gives some examples of mine closure programmes in effect. It is intended to highlight the changes on mine closure requirements as well as the best practices on mine closure in the State...|$|E
40|$|The {{broadening}} out {{of environmental}} assessment to also consider {{social and economic}} dimensions poses some unique challenges, {{not the least of}} which is understanding exactly what such a process might entail. This paper outlines the spectrum of possibilities and explores the issue of when and how environmental, social and economic considerations can be integrated in sustainability assessment. The integration issue is also relevant to the practice of strategic environmental assessments (SEA). A new way of conceptualising these types of assessment is put forward based on: (i) what is being assessed — the "question" that is being asked; and (ii) what approach is being used — the type of assessment selected from the spectrum of possibilities. The latter ranges from <b>impact</b> <b>minimisation</b> for each of the three sustainability pillars through to sustainability considered as an integrated concept. The combination of the question and assessment approach determines the level, extent and timing of integration of environmental, social and economic considerations that can be achieved. Additional thought needs to be given to who is performing the integration role as well as the nature of a particular proposal or its setting. This approach to thinking about SEA and sustainability assessment is illustrated with examples from Australia and the United Kingdom. Sustainability assessment, SEA, integration...|$|E
40|$|The Environmentally Sustainable Process Technology {{international}} Masters {{program at}} Chalmers University of Technology in Göteborg, Sweden, aims {{to provide students}} with the knowledge and skills necessary to improve and develop processes that are environmentally sustainable as well as economically sound. The program includes courses in core chemical engineering as well as applied environmental engineering areas. The social development aspects of sustainability for the chemical process industry are also taken up, i. e. how a process interacts with the surrounding world, including rules and regulations, public acceptance, risk, political aspects, etc. The Case Study project course is a key feature of the program, in which the knowledge acquired in the programs core course subject areas are used to solve an industrially relevant process engineering problem. The problem analysis and assessment of the proposed solution focus on various aspects of sustainability, including economical viabilityenvironmental <b>impact</b> and waste <b>minimisation.</b> This paper presents the results of a case study project that investigated the possible implementation of a SCWO (SuperCritical Water Oxidation) process plant for treatment of sludge from a Wastewater Treatment Plant in the Göteborg area. The project was related to a broader ongoing project GÖTEBORG 2050 that aims at generating long-term and sustainable future visions to be used for planning purposes in the City of Göteborg area. The paper aims at illustrating how chemical engineering education can introduce students to using process engineering methods and tools to identify sustainable solutions for e. g. energy planning and waste treatment problems. The Göteborg 2050 project provides a context for the students to relate to, thus facilitating for them to adopt the holistic attitude necessary for sustainable development...|$|R
40|$|Mining {{operations}} in arid regions of Western Australia {{are faced with}} many environmental management issues. One such issue is the disposal of mine water to the environment. Mine water is commonly discharged to nearby salt lakes under licence by the Department of Environmental Protection. Licence conditions dictate that the discharge water and the receiving environment be monitored to allow impacts on the environment to be detected. Salt lakes are associated with vegetation communities dominated by halophytic members of the Chenopodiaceae, While these plants are tolerant of salinity extremes, the germination stage of many species requires periods of lowered salinity. There is therefore potential for the recruitment stage of these vegetation communities {{to be affected by}} the discharge of hypersaline mine water. At Lake Austin, Big Bell Gold Operations discharge hypersaline mine water to this saline wetland system. This study has investigated whether this discharge has {{had an impact on the}} fringing vegetation of the lake. Secondly, the vegetation dynamics of the fringing vegetation have been investigated during a flood/drought cycle between 1998 and 2002 with the aim of increasing our understanding of these communities. Using an existing monitoring program established by the Centre for Ecosystem Management (CEM) in 1998, as well as twenty additional sites surveyed in 2002, soil and vegetation parameters were measured and assessed to test for evidence of an impact from the discharge of hypersaline mine water. A glasshouse experiment inundated soil samples from discharge and non-discharge zones with water of varying salinity to test for difference in seed germination between treatments and between zones. Halosarcia fimbriata, H. halocnemoides (form a), and H. pruinosa (form a) were dominant in the communities found at Lake Austin. Very few significant differences were found in changes of soil and vegetation parameters between location (discharge versus non-discharge sites) and/or time (1998, 2000 and 2002). The discharge water is linked to changes in soil pH and possibly soil salinity, however, there appears to be no impact on the vegetation. A number of explanations are given as to why an impact on the vegetation was not detected, including a lack of statistical power. The vegetation dynamics are described in relation to the flood/drought cycle experienced between 1998 and 2002. There are links between seed germination, seedling growth and subsequent structure of the Halosarcia fimbriata community and flooding frequency, depth and duration. There are three main management implications that have arisen from this study. Firstly, the sampling effort needs to be increased in order to be confident that significant differences will be detected, if indeed there are any. Secondly, further investigation of the vegetation dynamics is required to enhance <b>impact</b> mitigation and <b>minimisation</b> strategies. Finally, an engineering solution is suggested to prevent discharge water from coming into contact with fringing vegetation...|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{ensuring}} that the intended volume receives the intended absorbed dose in radiotherapy have been investigated. In order to optimise radiation treatment of cancer, geometric variations in the treatment chain need to be controlled. Furthermore, hazards potentially leading to unintended irradiation need to be controlled. While the required methods for optimisation of irradiation are diverse, advances in technology leading to more distinctly defined high dose volumes make the implementation of these methods crucial. Geometric variations are controlled by (a) knowledge of types and magnitude of variations; (b) minimisation of variations; (c) taking into account remaining variations by creating margins around volumes. Set-up variations have been quantified for lung cancer and breast cancer irradiation. Organ motion has also been measured in connection with treatment of lung tumours. While set-up variations are characterised for groups of patients within individual clinics, it is shown that lung tumour motion needs to be measured for the individual patient due to the range of organ positional variation and corresponding impact. Another parameter that has a high impact on the overall accuracy is the delineation variation {{in the definition of}} volumes. It is shown that various methods <b>impact</b> on the <b>minimisation</b> of this variation to different degrees. It is also shown that the delineation of clinical target volume (CTV), being different from gross tumour volume (GTV) delineation in that it also can reflect non-biological parameters such as treatment strategy, will call for the recording of CTV delineation strategy in order to capture the required information. Margins should be based on measured values of variations that are combined according to a documented model. A method of enhancing the potential for dose escalation through stratification of margins based on tumour cell density is suggested and analysed. Hazards in the treatment preparation chain are controlled by (a) identification of hazards in combination with frequency and consequence analysis, leading to (b) a risk estimation and (c) reducing these risks by introducing a multilayered system of preventive measures. Hazards in radiotherapy preparation have been identified together with corresponding frequencies. Mistakes in the calculation and creation of information were found with a frequency of 1 - 3 % of treatment courses, while the corresponding numbers for information transfer was found to be 1 - 2 %. Layers of preventive measures include (1) actions where potential deviations from intended dose and geometry can be found before the first irradiation-fraction of the patient; (2) actions where deviations can be found during or after the treatment course; (3) application of safety-technology; (4) application of safety procedures; and (5) actions where contributing factors such as staffing-levels and structure, training and communication are addressed. A method for monitoring workload in treatment preparation is explored in this context...|$|R
40|$|Coastal defence {{structures}} to protect sedimentary coastlines from erosion and flooding are increasingly common throughout Europe. They {{will become more}} widespread over the next 10 – 30 years in response to rising and stormier seas and accelerating economic development of the coastal zone. Building coastal defences results in the loss and fragmentation of sedimentary habitats and their replacement by artificial rocky habitats that become colonised by algae and marine animals. The engineering design and construction of these structures have received considerable attention. However, the ecological consequences of coastal defences have been less extensively investigated. Furthermore, due to their rapid proliferation, {{there is a growing}} need to understand the role of these man-made habitats in the coastal ecosystems in order to implement <b>impact</b> <b>minimisation</b> and/or mitigation measures. As part of the DELOS project, targeted studies were carried out throughout Europe to assess the ecological similarity of low-crested coastal defence structures (LCS) to natural rocky shores and to investigate the influence of LCS design features on the colonising marine epibiota. LCSs can be considered as a relatively poor surrogate of natural rocky shores. Epibiotic communities were qualitatively similar to those on natural rocky shores as both habitats are regulated by the same physical and biological factors. However, there were quantitative differences in the diversity and abundance of epibiota on artificial structures. Typically, epibiotic assemblages were less diverse than rocky shore communities. Also, LCSs offered less structurally complex habitats for colonisation and in some locations experienced higher disturbance than natural shores. We propose several criteria that can be integrated into the design and construction of LCSs to minimise ecological impacts and allow targeted management of diversity and natural living resources...|$|E
40|$|The {{environment}} of Aflaj system is shared between natural and old man made} created thousandth {{years ago to}} accommodate the old civilization. Howeverl this environment is disturbed by the climatic changes which affect the total area causing drought and desertification. The 2008 Stockholm World Water Week and the third Water WDR conference concluded that "The main impacts of climate change on humans and the environment occur through water". This effect of climate change is reflected by a degradation of Falaj numbers which cause drought and desertification of the soil in a valuable place such as, Oman Mountains rang. Accordingly, the impact of climate change on Aflaj environment can be identified by Fa/aj dry out and Water deficit in most Aflaj oasis, which lead to a desertification of irrigated areas and a reduction of green areas. AdditionallYl the more warmer and drier the land becomes, the more water is required. The higher temperature causes high water demand and evaporation from trees which cause rapid drying of existing crops. Moreover, drier soil is easy eroded by the rain and runoff which worsening the environment. This is being seen as a warning {{and that it is}} time to commence taking steps to reduce the effect of climate change and save the environment. This paper shows the effect of climate change on the Aflaj Oasis environment and its impacts. Given the importance of the Aflaj system to the Oman's society, the paper highlights the potential strategies to mitigate or reduce those impacts to sustain Aflaj environment. The strategy recommends better water management} <b>impact</b> <b>minimisation</b> and monitor and control. More efforts should be given for the use of water saving technology. With all of these measures, impact of climate change on Aflaj Oasis environment can be reduced...|$|E
