5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} to inherit the metric system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined them in terms of metric units – for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France kept <b>her</b> <b>system</b> of measurement intact.|$|E
5|$|Fire-control {{technology}} advanced quickly {{during the}} years immediately preceding World War I {{and the development of}} the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided gun data to the turrets via a pointer on a dial, which the turret crewmen only had to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. Lion received <b>her</b> <b>system</b> in early 1915 while undergoing repairs after the Battle of Dogger Bank and Princess Royal got hers in early 1916. A second director was added to each ship in 1918.|$|E
40|$|Comparison of {{the period}} {{distributions}} of various classes of CVs confirms an extreme bias of the synchronous AM <b>Her</b> <b>systems</b> toward short orbital periods, while the DQ <b>Her</b> <b>systems</b> do not differ significantly from the distribution of nonmagnetic systems. This suggests either strong selection effects or enhanced evolution of the AM <b>Her</b> <b>systems.</b> There is as yet no obvious bimodality in either the magnetic field distributions of isolated white dwarfs or of CV primaries. However, clear {{differences between the two}} exist: the strongest being that magnetic primaries are overrepresented among short period CVs by more than an order of magnitude in comparison to the field white dwarfs...|$|R
40|$|In the {{foreseeable}} future, {{it is likely}} that the familiar, paper-based patient medical files will become a thing of the past. On April 26, 24, President George W. Bush announced a plan to ensure that all Americans 2 ̆ 7 health records are computerized within ten years and to establish a National Health Information Network. Many advocates are enthusiastically promoting the adoption of health information technology (HIT) and electronic health record (<b>HER)</b> <b>systems</b> as a means to improve U. S. health care. <b>HER</b> <b>systems</b> often not only serve as record-keeping systems, but also have multiple capabilities, including drug ordering, decision support, alerts concerning patient allergies and potential drug interactions, reminders concerning routine tests, and various treatment management and data analysis tools. Because these capabilities require sophisticated software, significant risks of software failure exist, which can lead to life-threatening medical errors. Thus far, scholars have not provided a comprehensive assessment of the benefits and risks of this complex technology and evaluated the need for careful regulatory oversight akin to that required, in principle, by the FDA for life-critical medical devices. This paper begins to fill that gap. It analyzes <b>HER</b> <b>systems</b> from both legal and technical perspectives and focuses on how the law can be used as a tool to promote HIT. It is the first law journal article to provide an extensive proposal for regulations to maximize the technology 2 ̆ 7 s benefits and reliability. We argue that the advantages of <b>HER</b> <b>systems</b> will outweigh their risks only if these systems are developed and maintained with rigorous adherence to best software engineering and medical informatics practices. To ensure that these goals are achieved, regulatory intervention is needed. The paper carefully delineates recommendations that address the questions of who should regulate <b>HER</b> <b>systems</b> and how they should be regulated, including their approval and continual monitoring. It also proposes requirements for several significant features, including decision support mechanisms, audit trails, and interoperability. Because <b>HER</b> <b>systems</b> are safety-critical, the public 2 ̆ 7 s health and welfare will depend upon their effective oversight...|$|R

Finn is appointed acting principal while Susan recovers. When Finn's crimes are exposed, including the vitamin swap, Susan ignores her MS symptoms to return to the school to undo everything Finn implemented. Susan suffers an MS relapse and falls in the school yard. Karl persuades her to take sick leave and go to a retreat in Thailand.

An out of control Mulder demands to know how she got there, and is escorted out by security but later calms down and meets with Dr. Daly (Jay Brazeau), who reveals that no one can figure out how she got there or what's wrong with her. He tells Mulder and Mrs. Scully that she has a living will that dictates she be taken off of life support when her condition falls to specific criteria. At Scully's bedside, Mulder meets her older sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw). Scully has a vision of sitting in a boat, attached by rope to a dock where Mulder and Melissa stand, and nurse Owens behind them. Frohike visits Scully and sneaks out her medical chart, which the Lone Gunmen later investigate. Byers finds that Scully's blood contains branched DNA that may have been used for identification but now is inactive and nothing more than a poisonous waste product in <b>her</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
40|$|Electronic Health Record (<b>HER)</b> <b>systems</b> {{may soon}} become {{a fixture in}} most medical settings. President Obama’s 29 {{stimulus}} legislation includes $ 19 billion to promote their implementation. The sophisticated features and efficiencies of <b>HER</b> <b>systems</b> {{have the potential to}} improve health outcomes and enhance patient welfare considerably. However, this emerging technology also poses significant challenges and risks, {{not the least of which}} are its workplace impacts. This article provides a first of its kind analysis of the ramifications of <b>HER</b> <b>systems</b> for workers and employers. The potential effects of health information computerization on the workplace are numerous. Employers may obtain and process EHRs for purposes of fitness for duty determinations, reasonable accommodations, workers’ compensation, and payment of medical claims. Digitized records could enable employers to obtain unprecedented amounts of information in response to lawful requests and thus intensify workers’ concerns about privacy and discrimination. At the same time, employers may find EHRs to be cumbersome and difficult to interpret and, if they store health information electronically, may worry about security breaches. <b>HER</b> <b>systems</b> could also affect employers’ insurance costs, impact discovery in litigation, and profoundly affect the work habits of health care providers. This article argues that these concerns can best be addressed by specific changes to the ADA, the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules, and parallel state laws as well as by technological advances and appropriate federal oversight. As the country transitions to computerization in the medical field, proactive steps must be taken to protect stakeholders in all settings, including the American workplace...|$|R

5|$|The {{conventions}} of Moonlight are based, in part, on a unique mythology. Some {{parts of the}} mythology that are common include a sire, that is the vampire who turns a human into a vampire; though in the show the sire must teach him or her how to live as one. A vampire's bite {{is not enough to}} turn a human into a vampire; the human, when near death, must drink the sire's blood or have vampire blood in his or <b>her</b> <b>system</b> at the moment of death. The process of vampirization also affects their genetics, causing their DNA to be fundamentally altered to suit their bodies' new state. This makes genetic testing between vampires and their human relatives impossible unless the vampire has a sample of their own human DNA from before they were turned, such as a lock of hair. They must consume human blood to survive. They also develop psychic powers and can glimpse the future and the past. This ability, along with their night vision, is an extension of their heightened senses. Daylight does not kill vampires, but does make them progressively weaker. Silver and fire are toxic, whereas garlic, holy water and crucifixes are useless. A vampire's image cannot be captured with analogue cameras containing silver emulsion in the film; digital cameras are able to capture an image because they do not use silver emulsion. Though undead, vampires have a pulse, are not cold blooded (but still don't produce body heat as seen in episode 11 so as heat signature cameras won't see them), and cannot turn into a bat. The best ways to kill them are by decapitation or burning; a stake through the heart is painful but only causes paralysis. Moonlight vampires have many of the preternatural abilities as described in vampire mythology; they have superhuman strength and speed, they heal rapidly from any wound, they can defy gravity to a limited degree to perform parkour feats, their bite has hypnotic effects on weak-minded humans, and they are immortal. Their powers increase as they get older. Their blood has drug-like affects when consumed by humans; causing euphoria and temporarily heightened senses.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, Sister Elizabeth Kenny, an Australian bush nurse from Queensland, {{arrived in}} North America and {{challenged}} {{this approach to}} treatment. In treating polio cases in rural Australia between 1928 and 1940, Kenny had developed a form of physical therapy that—instead of immobilizing afflicted limbs—aimed to relieve pain and spasms in polio patients {{through the use of}} hot, moist packs to relieve muscle spasm and early activity and exercise to maximize the strength of unaffected muscle fibers and promote the neuroplastic recruitment of remaining nerve cells that had not been killed by the virus. Sister Kenny later settled in Minnesota where she established the Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute, beginning a world-wide crusade to advocate <b>her</b> <b>system</b> of treatment. Slowly, Kenny's ideas won acceptance, and by the mid-20th century had become the hallmark for the treatment of paralytic polio. In combination with antispasmodic medications to reduce muscular contractions, Kenny's therapy is still used in the treatment of paralytic poliomyelitis.|$|E
