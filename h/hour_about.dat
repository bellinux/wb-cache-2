5|$|In New York City, the Ojibwe {{attracted}} attention, gaining {{publicity and}} {{money for their}} cause. In Washington, however, they were turned away by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and told they should never have come in the first place. Luckily, they drew {{the attention of the}} Whig Congressman Briggs from New York, who was scheduled a meeting with President Millard Fillmore the next day. He invited the Ojibwa to come with him to see the president. At the meeting, Buffalo rose first. He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion. He had the younger chief Oshaga speak for more than an <b>hour</b> <b>about</b> the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal. Fillmore agreed to consider the issues. The next day, he announced that the removal order would be canceled, the payment of annuities would be returned to La Pointe, and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin.|$|E

25|$|These spiders build a silken retreat by binding a pair {{of green}} leaves together, where they rest, moult and lay their eggs, which is unusual for a jumping spider.

25|$|According to tradition, Attila had his diviners {{examine the}} {{entrails}} of a sacrifice {{the morning of}} the day of the battle. They foretold that disaster would befall the Huns, but one of the enemy leaders would be killed. Attila delayed until the ninth <b>hour</b> (<b>about</b> 2:30 PM) so the impending sunset would help his troops to flee the battlefield in case of defeat. Hughes takes his own interpretation of this, noting that the divination may be an emphasis of Attila's barbarity and therefore possibly a fabrication. He states that the choice to begin the battle at the ninth hour was due to the fact both sides spent the whole day carefully deploying their coalition armies.|$|E
25|$|Factors such {{as nature}} {{of work and}} lack of {{influence}} within their jobs leads some theorists {{to the conclusion that}} most Americans are working class. They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas. These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence in their jobs. Also, they are not paid to think. For example: The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were $136,960 in May 2006, indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The dentist creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment. In 2009, Dental assistants made roughly $14.40 an <b>hour,</b> <b>about</b> $32,000 annually. Unlike dentists, dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients. They carry out routine procedures and follow the dentists' instructions. Here we see that a dental assistant being classified as working class. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations.|$|E

It will be replaced with Elsa for the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

The rivers also dragged 30 vehicles, {{all of which were}} moderate to total losses.

500|$|Robert Bianco of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} show and said the {{decision}} to focus on fewer subplots might help. Bianco said, [...] "Let's hope the changes work, because Homicide is too good to lose, and its vision of civilization is too troubling to shunt aside." [...] The Washington Post television reviewer Tom Shales called Homicide [...] "achingly, even painfully, brilliant. The best cop show I have ever seen." [...] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun called it the best police drama ever made for television besides Hill Street Blues. Baltimore Sun reporter David Bianculli praised the show's writers for being willing to place their characters in ethically questionable positions, adding: [...] "Please watch this series; it's so good, I don't mind pleading." [...] Tom Jicha of South Florida Sun-Sentinel called it [...] "an <b>hour</b> <b>about</b> as fine as there is on the tube" [...] with great writing and camera-work. Jicha said, [...] "It would be a senseless act of violence against superb TV for those who claim to appreciate fine drama to kill this show by turning the dial." [...] Hal Boedeker, television critic with The Miami Herald, strongly praised the series, particularly [...] "Bop Gun", which he called [...] "the highest order for network TV". Boedeker called the writing, direction and acting [...] "first-rate" [...] and declared Homicide the better choice over NYPD Blue {{because it did not}} resort to gimmicks like the nudity featured in the latter show.|$|E
