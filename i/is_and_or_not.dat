50|$|All conjunctions of literals and all disjunctions of literals are in CNF, as {{they can}} be seen as conjunctions of one-literal clauses and conjunctions of a single clause, respectively. As in the {{disjunctive}} normal form (DNF), the only propositional connectives a formula in CNF can contain <b>are</b> <b>and,</b> <b>or,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not.</b> The not operator can only be used as part of a literal, which means that it can only precede a propositional variable or a predicate symbol.|$|R
25|$|Some {{factors that}} {{influence}} which classification information should be assigned include how much value that information has to the organization, how old the information <b>is</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the information has become obsolete. Laws and other regulatory requirements are also important considerations when classifying information.|$|R

25|$|At {{the atomic}} or {{molecular}} level, {{it depends on}} the frequencies of atomic or molecular vibrations or chemical bonds, how close-packed its atoms <b>or</b> molecules <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the atoms <b>or</b> molecules exhibit long-range order. These factors will determine the capacity of the material transmitting longer wavelengths in the infrared (IR), far IR, radio and microwave ranges.|$|R

Also a comparison of two orchards where orchard A <b>is</b> well producing <b>and</b> orchard B <b>is</b> poor producing. The study examines {{the value of the}} two orchards, where their profitabliltiy <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the poor producing orchard should be redeveloped...|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{spectacular}} trace fossils are the huge, three-toed footprints produced by dinosaurs and related archosaurs. These imprints give scientists clues as to how these animals lived. Although the skeletons of dinosaurs can be reconstructed, only their fossilized footprints can determine exactly how they stood and walked. Such tracks can tell much about the gait of the animal which made them, what its stride <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the front limbs touched the ground.|$|R

The graves {{also had}} an overburden of horse remains; it cannot yet be determined decisively if these horses <b>were</b> domesticated <b>and</b> ridden <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> but they were certainly used as a meat-animal. Most controversial are bone plaques of horses or double oxen heads, which were pierced.|$|R
50|$|DRT avoids {{this problem}} by {{assuming}} that indefinites introduce discourse referents (DRs) which are stored in the mental representation <b>and</b> <b>are</b> accessible (<b>or</b> <b>not,</b> depending on the conditions) to expressions like pronouns and other anaphoric elements. Furthermore, they <b>are</b> inherently non-quantificational, <b>and</b> pick up quantificational force depending upon the context.|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} what {{a public forum}} <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> a library can legitimately claim to be one. Beginning with an imaginary visit to a rather odd public park, and {{a brief review of}} the development of the legal doctrine of the public forum, an attempt is made to establish that the library 1) falls far short of being a genuine public forum, 2) is actually ambivalent about being a forum at all, and 3) could, if it really wanted to, become much more of a forum by making a very simple change in its online catalog...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues surrounding}} {{the concept of}} geometric phase or "anholonomy". Certain physical phenomena apparently require for their explanation and understanding, reference to toplogocial/geometric features of some abstract space of parameters.

During next week, the viewers could vote on their website if Willy could <b>be</b> slaughtered <b>and</b> eaten <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> Although the viewers choose not to kill Willy, Basta told the invitees they did eat Willy.

40|$|The rise {{of social}} media, online campaigning and big data {{techniques}} {{has put a}} new spin on the traditional ‘ground game’ in political campaigns. Using data from the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, Joshua Darr and Matthew Levendusky investigate why campaign field offices are located where they <b>are,</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> {{they can make a}} difference in elections. They find that, through strategic placement, Obama’s field offices accounted for as much as 50 percent of his margin of victory in some states. They argue that in an era of billion dollar campaigns, field offices offer a cost effective way to mobilize voters and leave a legacy of local volunteers...|$|R
40|$|This case teaches project {{management}} concepts (traditionally called PERT / CPM) using the more accurate and modern approach via simulation. The case asks students {{to construct the}} network precedence diagram to help a fictitious school design an 2 ̆ 2 MBA over the Internet 2 ̆ 2 program. Using a spreadsheet model and simulation ad-in program (such as @RISK or Insight), the simulation tells management what the critical activities <b>are</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the project can be completed by a certain date. Probabilistic calculations {{can be made from}} the simulation. Finally, the case shows how the simulation gives superior results compared to the traditional approaches of PERT / CPM...|$|R

50|$|Drona was {{somewhat}} parallel to Bhishma both in martial prowess, and, compelled by the refuge {{they had given}} him, in his unwavering commitment to fighting for Hastinapur irrespective of who the ruler <b>was</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> the cause was just. Like Bhishma, Drona is criticized for his pride and conceit, siding with adharma despite knowing of and acknowledging the righteousness of the Pandava cause. Krishna criticized this reasoning as mere pride-Drona wanted to put his obligation to Hastinapur over dharma {{so that no one}} questioned his honor. Criticism is leveled at Drona for remaining a mute spectator and not having protested the humiliation of Draupadī by Dushasana and Duryodhana following the fateful game of dice.|$|R
40|$|Everyone {{agrees that}} {{consciousness}} {{is a very}} special phenomenon, unique in several ways, but there is scant agreement on just how special it <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> an explanation of it can be accommodated within normal science. John Searle's view, defended with passion in this book, is highly idiosyncratic: what is special about consciousness is its "subjective ontology," but normal science can accommodate subjective ontology alongside (not within) its otherwise objective ontology. Once we clear away some widespread confusions about what science requires, and dismiss the misbegotten field of cognitive science that has been engendered by those confusions, the subjective ontology of the mind, he claims, will lose its aura of unacceptable mystery...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the link between quantitative sustainability disclosure and information asymmetry. It builds upon previous research which links information asymmetry with voluntary disclosure. Stakeholders from the financial services sector claim that sustainability disclosure needs to <b>be</b> more numerical <b>and</b> comparable between companies. This research covers 111 firms from Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden from non-service industries and studies how quantitative their sustainability disclosure <b>is,</b> <b>and</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> there <b>is</b> a negative relation with information asymmetry. The results support the hypotheses, where {{two out of three}} information asymmetry proxies have a significant negative relation with quantitative disclosure. Size is supported as a moderating factor. Quantitativity also proves to have a significant link with third party sustainability ratings. The direct link between quantitativity and cost of capital is not however supported...|$|R
