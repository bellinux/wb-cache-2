50|$|From the TOD, the VNAV determines a four-dimensional {{predicted}} path. As the VNAV {{commands the}} throttles to idle, the aircraft begins its descent along the VNAV path. If either the predicted path is incorrect or the <b>downpath</b> winds {{different from the}} predictions, then the aircraft will not perfectly follow the path. The aircraft varies the pitch {{in order to maintain}} the path. Since the throttles are at idle this will modulate the speed. Normally the FMS allows the speed to within a small band. After this, either the throttles advance (if the aircraft is below path) or the FMS requests speed brakes with a message such as “ADD DRAG” (if the aircraft is above path).|$|E
40|$|A {{check valve}} which closes more rapidly to prevent wearing of the valve seat {{and of the}} valve member that seals thereagainst, {{including}} a solenoid or other actuator that aids the normal spring to quickly close the valve at approximately the time when <b>downpath</b> fluid flow would stop, the actuator then being deenergized. The control circuit that operates the actuator can include a pair of pressure sensors sensing pressure both upstream and downstream from the valve seat. Where the valve is utilized to control flow to or from a piston pump, energization of the actuator can be controlled by sensing when the pump piston reaches its extreme of travel...|$|E
