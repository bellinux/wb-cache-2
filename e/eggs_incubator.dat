40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims {{to design and}} develop a force air system of <b>eggs</b> <b>incubator</b> to {{incubate}} various types of eggs through a conveyor rotating system. This incubator was equipped with temperature and humidity sensors to measure and control the condition in the incubator. The incubator body was fabricated by stainless steel that provides less bacterial cross contamination between the incubator and the hatched chicks. It was designed to automatically change the parameters to the suitable condition to fit {{the various types of}} eggs. Direct current geared motor with low speed was used to rotate chained steel mat at the bottom and automatically change the position of egg to avoid the embryo sticks onto the shell. The entire elements were controlled by microcontroller devices to process the data from sensors and execute the control element of the machine. LabVIEW system was applied for temperature and humidity data recording. The evaluation of the shaft for egg turning system was analysed. The safety factor was determined at 5. 88 by manual calculation and 9. 6 by software simulation respectively. This indicated that the safety factor of the shaft has achieved the required standard which must be higher than 0. 99. The test run experiment on quail eggs, showed the stable temperature in incubation chamber of 37. 5 oC and 49. 86 % of relatively humidity (RH) were achieved. Therefore, the usage of conveyor instead of turning 45 o for eggs rotation system has shown the potential to replicate natural hatching and produce higher hatching rate of 94. 17 %. This machine also provides an accurate temperature and humidity condition in the incubator as well as less bacterial cross contamination...|$|E

It demonstrates, how if proper tools and environment is provided. It empowers individual to solve their own problems. Modern poultry industry is run by big corporate with big hatcheries of huge capacities. It results in exploitation through monopoly of trade. Incubators available in the market are far greater in size than requirement of small villages. It also requires generator backup and therefore requires major investment. An idea of an <b>egg</b> <b>incubator</b> with 100 – 1000 eggs capacity is emerged from this need. This is foreseen as a good business opportunity for women Self Help Groups and village youth. Temperature in the incubator is maintained using solar water heater, LPG or electricity. Tubes carrying hot water from solar heater are circulated inside the chamber to maintain the temperature. Tray rotation, maintenance of humidity etc is automatic and powered by solar energy. Electronic parts and casings of the electronic circuits were primarily done using tools in the fab lab. The project started with actually recording all temperature and humidity reading from the real hen seating on eggs. Five versions of <b>Egg</b> <b>incubator</b> were made. We got 85 % results consistently in experimental trials. We started selling the unit and sold one unit of 500 eggs & one with 1000 eggs capacity.

50|$|Hastings {{made three}} tries at {{building}} a large commercial forced-draft chicken incubator. In 1911 {{he built a}} 6000 <b>egg</b> <b>incubator</b> in Brooklyn, New York, for a Walter B. Davis. An advertising booklet “Davis Poultry Farm” described operations on the farm. Later in 1911 Hastings went to Muskogee, Oklahoma and built a 30,000 <b>egg</b> <b>incubator</b> in a business arrangement with a Lieber, a local lawyer and business man. In the spring of 1912 Milo went to Petaluma, California, then the chicken capitol of the West, trying to generate interest in a million <b>egg</b> <b>incubator.</b> With interest lacking he then went to Port O’Conner, Texas and built a 150,000 <b>egg</b> <b>incubator</b> with financial support from a local businessman. All these business ventures were undercapitalized and none were a commercial success. While still working on the Brooklyn incubator, Milo filed for a patent, Serial No. 624,885 for “A Hatchery for the Eggs of Domestic Fowl”. (The application was witnessed by Edgar Chambless, Hastings' urban planning mentor.) Supporting documents were filed in July, 1911 and further amended by counsel on May 24, 1912. The patent was rejected, the rejection appealed, and on Dec 30, 1912 the appeal was rejected. The patent application was eventually abandoned. In 1918 a Smith got patent Serial No. 1,262,860 for basically the same invention. The Smith patent was challenged in both the United States and Canada. The matter was in the courts for years. At first the challenges were unsuccessful. Then a new strategy was tried: that the Smith patent was invalid because of Hastings’ prior art. So Hastings had a career as an expert witness. This was the only money he ever made off his incubator invention. The matter {{wound up in the}} Supreme Court and was decided in Smith v. Hall, 301 U.S. 216 (1937). The decision, confirming Milo’s prior art, was writing by Justice Harlan Stone, soon to become chief justice. The decision tracks the evolution of Milo’s incubator ideas and his whereabouts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) are {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} primary isolation or passage of influenza viruses, other viruses, and certain bacteria. For small-scale experiments with pathogens that must be studied in biosafety level three (BSL 3) facilities, inoculated ECE {{are sometimes}} manipulated and maintained in small <b>egg</b> <b>incubators</b> within a biosafety cabinet (BSC). To simplify the clean up and decontamination of an <b>egg</b> <b>incubator</b> in case of egg breakage, we explored whether ethylene breather bags {{could be used to}} encase ECE inoculated with pathogens. This concept was tested by determining embryo survival and examining virus yields in bagged ECE. Results Virus yields acceptable for many applications were attained when influenza-, alpha-, flavi-, canine distemper-, and mousepox viruses were propagated in ECE sealed within ethylene breather bags. Conclusions For many small-scale applications, ethylene breather bags can be used to encase ECE inoculated with various viruses. </p...|$|R

The main usage of MQEIS is to incubate quail eggs for quail production in Malaysia. This incubator is equipped with temperature and humidity sensor that could measure {{the condition of the}} quail egg. Inaccurate control of the incubator could affect the temperature and humidity of the incubator to become higher or lower. In this project, a small bulb is located inside the incubator to provide suitable temperature for the quail eggs. In order to maintain the good condition of humidity and ventilation, the incubator is filled up with small amount of water and controlling fan works as the cooling element to regulate air inside the incubator for the hatching process. The LCD screen display, which is located at the front of incubator machine, will display status condition of the incubator in term of its temperature and humidity. The whole incubator system is controlled by the ArduinoAtMega 328 p as the main microcontroller. This Arduino microcontroller is programmed to produce the desired output. The humidity sensor (DHT 11) is connected to Arduino to detect humidity and temperature, which then will be displayed digitally on 16 x 2 LCD screen.
