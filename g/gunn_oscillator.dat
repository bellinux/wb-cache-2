The balanced mixer {{consists of an}} RF quadrature hybrid coupler, two double sideband (DSB) SIS mixers with noise temperature of — 60 K, and an IF 180 degree hybrid coupler covering 4 - 8 GHz IF band. An RF quadrature hybrid coupler was designed and fabricated whose fabrication error was within 5 gm. The noise temperatures of the balanced mixer was {{similar to those of}} two DSB mixers in spite of adding an RF quadrature hybrid and an IF coupler. The required LO power for pumping the balanced mixer was reduced by 42 dB on average compared with those for the DSB mixers and- 15 dB coupler.

40|$|The {{discovery}} and subsequent {{understanding of the}} Gunn effect were followed by applications of the improved Gunn devices in practical configurations, the oscillator and amplifier modes receiving most of the attention. This thesis is primarily an experimental investigation {{in the area of}} waveguide <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillators</b> under conditions of injection locking, bias (FM) modulation or both. These areas had barely been touched upon at the onset of this work and a number of aspects therein needed elucidation. Currently, an increasing interest is developing in the topics of this investigation, especially in modulating <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillators</b> and in using injection techniques for applications in communication systems. The experimental results were obtained by using waveguide oscillators constructed in the School and employing commercially available devices. These were modulated by superimposing an AC signal on the bias DC voltage and were locked by injecting a signal from a klystron. The oscillator behaviour was examined mainly in the following areas: (i) partial locking, (ii) full locking, (iii) bias modulation, (iv) bias modulation together with injection locking and, (v) phenomena associated with the reflected power from the device. Cases (i) - (iv) above, treated together, provide a coherent view of the reflection behaviour of waveguide <b>Gunn</b> <b>oscillators.</b> The factors which affect the prelock spectral history (i) and their influence on the diode are revealed together with a number of anomalous results. The effect of the locking signal on a two-frequency oscillator is also examined in (i). The study of the fully locked oscillator (ii) shows that net amplification is sometimes possible and, in addition, discusses the oscillator characteristics at lock, its frequency responses and previously unreported instability phenomena. Measurements over a wide range of modulating frequencies and voltages (iii, iv), clarify the effects of these parameters on the modulation and locked-modulation characteristics of the oscillator and produce an empirical law correlating these quantities to the locking power. Also, extensions of locked-modulation work into the case of non-coincident oscillator and locking frequencies show that existing theories do not fully account for the observed behaviour. Through (i) - (iv) asymmetries of results about the free-running oscillator frequency are noted. In (v), a new phenomenon is reported and it is believed that this can find applications in frequency demodulation and in estimating diode parameters. Where appropriate, comparisons are made with theory and the original contributions are placed in the context of other work in the field...|$|R
