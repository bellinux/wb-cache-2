5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope was used to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it actually was. Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine}} the mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E
5|$|Forgeries {{in which}} modern lead or white lead pigment {{has been used}} can be {{recognized}} by using a technique called Pb(Lead)-210-Dating. Pb-210 is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of lead {{that is part of}} the uranium-238 Radioactive decay series, and has a half-life of 22.3 years. To <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> Pb-210, the alpha radiation emitted by another element, polonium-210 (Po-210), is measured. Thus it is possible to estimate the age of a painting, within a few years' span, by extrapolating the Pb-210 content present in the paint used to create the painting.|$|E
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium amide. Titration of lithium amide can be used to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E

Investigators examined the four charred engines and concluded all were producing power at the point of impact.

Household surveys are the primary measure for the health MDGs but may be poor and duplicative measurements that consume limited resources. Furthermore, countries with {{the highest levels of}} these conditions typically have the least reliable data collection. The study also argued that without accurate measures, it is impossible to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> progress, leaving MDGs {{as little more than a}} rhetorical call to arms.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in Science in 2012 found that modest rainfall reductions, amounting to only 25 to 40 percent of annual rainfall, {{may have been the}} tipping point to the Maya collapse. Based on samples of lake and cave sediments in the areas surrounding major Maya cities, the researchers were able to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> annual rainfall in the region. The mild droughts that took place between 800-950 would therefore be enough to rapidly deplete seasonal water supplies in the Yucatán lowlands, where there are no rivers.|$|E
25|$|This {{blending}} may be purely quantitative: various vintages can be blended {{to achieve}} the desired volume.

25|$|When {{signs of}} {{pneumonia}} are discovered during evaluation, chest X-rays, are performed {{to support a}} diagnosis of CAP, and examination of the blood and sputum for infectious microorganisms and blood tests {{may be used to}} support a diagnosis of CAP. Diagnostic tools depend on the severity of illness, local practices and concern about complications of the infection. All patients with CAP should have their blood oxygen monitored with pulse oximetry. In some cases, arterial blood gas analysis may be required to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> oxygen in the blood. A complete blood count (CBC) may reveal extra white blood cells, indicating infection.|$|E
25|$|Volumetric methods {{attempt to}} <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> oil {{in place by}} using {{the size of the}} {{reservoir}} as well as the physical properties of its rocks and fluids. Then a recovery factor is assumed, using assumptions from fields with similar characteristics. OIP is multiplied by the recovery factor to arrive at a reserve number. Current recovery factors for oil fields around the world typically range between 10 and 60 percent; some are over 80 percent. The wide variance is due largely to the diversity of fluid and reservoir characteristics for different deposits. The method is most useful early {{in the life of the}} reservoir, before significant production has occurred.|$|E

25|$|For {{the purpose}} of setting {{treatment}} standards and reuse legislation, {{it is important to}} be able to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> helminth eggs in an environmental sample with some accuracy. The detection of viable helminth eggs in samples of wastewater, sludge or fresh feces (as a diagnostic tool for the infection helminthiasis) is not straight forward. In fact, many laboratories in developing countries lack the right equipment or skilled staff required to do so. An important step in the analytical methods is usually the concentration of the eggs in the sample, especially in the case of wastewater samples. A concentration step may not be required in samples of dried feces, e.g. samples collected from urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{planned the}} evacuation of four million people—mostly women and children—from urban areas, including 1.4 million from London. It expected about 90 percent of evacuees to stay in private homes, conducted an extensive survey to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> space available and made detailed preparations for transporting evacuees. A trial blackout was held on 10 August 1939 and when Germany invaded Poland on 1 September, a blackout began at sunset. Lights were not allowed after dark for almost six years and the blackout became {{by far the most}} unpopular aspect of the war for civilians, even more than rationing. The relocation of the government and the civil service was also planned but would only have occurred if necessary so as not to damage civilian morale.|$|E
25|$|Addressable {{systems are}} usually more {{expensive}} than conventional non-addressable systems, and offer extra options, including a custom level of sensitivity (sometimes called Day/Night mode) which can <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> smoke in a given area and contamination detection from the FACP that allows determination {{of a wide range}} of faults in detection capabilities of smoke detectors. Detectors become contaminated usually as a result of the build up of atmospheric particulates in the detectors being circulated by the heating and air-conditioning systems in buildings. Other causes include carpentry, sanding, painting, and smoke in the event of a fire. Panels can also be interconnected to monitor a very large number of detectors in multiple buildings. This is most commonly used in hospitals, universities, resorts and other large centres or institutions.|$|E

25|$|The {{untitled}} {{project was}} scheduled to begin production in September 2006, but scheduling conflicts and budget issues postponed the start of production to February 2007. In November 2006, Luhrmann explored The Kimberley to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> production to be shot there. In December 2006, Bowen was chosen as a filming location for {{a third of the}} production, portraying the look of Darwin. Bowen was chosen as a prospect due to the financing of $500,000 by the Queensland government. In April, Kununurra was chosen as another location for Australia, this time to serve as Faraway Downs, the homestead owned by Kidman's character. Entire sets were built from scratch, including a stand-alone set in the Queensland town of Bowen, the re-creation of war scenes near Darwin Harbour, and the construction of an outback homestead in Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method used}} to assess the amount and effects of water {{pollutants}} is to measure the amount of PM2.5 in rainfall. Measuring PM2.5 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle≤2.5 μm in a given amount of air) is a common metric for assessing air quality. Comparing PM2.5 levels between air and rainfall samples allows scientists to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> air pollution being transferred to water sources. Pollutants in rainfall quickly and directly affect pollution in groundwater sources. In 2013, researchers in Beijing found a significant relationship between the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and in rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had a significant “washing” effect on PM2.5 in the air, transferring a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources. In this way, Beijing’s notorious air pollution has a direct and significant impact on rainfall, and therefore, on water resources throughout the region.|$|E
25|$|Since {{tamarins}} can {{discriminate between}} predatory threats using varying vocalizations, recipients of an AC {{are thought to}} extract various complex signals from this form of communication. Primarily, cotton-tops are able to glean {{the identity of the}} cooperating tamarin through differences in individuals' alarm calls. Further, adults are able to discriminate the gender of callers from their ACs and determine the range of calls within a related tamarin's alarm calling repertoire. Alarm call-based identification is postulated to play a number of functional roles in the cotton-top tamarin. Firstly, an AC recipient is able to identify a cooperating tamarin, and by recognizing which in their group it is, be able to judge the reliability of the AC from past experience. This may arise from a selective pressure for being able to statistically <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> risk present, and how endangered an individual and its group are.|$|E
