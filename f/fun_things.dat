5|$|Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of Civilization II, {{was invited}} to join {{development}} as a game balancer. Reynolds cited the Alpha Centauris balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, Sid Meier's Colonization. According to producer Timothy Train, in designing {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and <b>fun</b> <b>things</b> to do without unbalancing the game. He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest. Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.|$|E

2500|$|The Big Sister was, {{according}} to animation supervisor Jeff Weir, {{the first thing}} Jordan Thomas talked about to the animators {{when they arrived at}} 2K Marin. The character challenged the team to convey her backstory and personality through the design. Fix started with descriptive words on a page, moving to thumbnails and silhouette concepts. Early inspiration for the character's design included racing dogs, and the idea of a character that carries itself in a restrained way until it explodes in action. [...] " [...] of her as graceful and yet awkward at the same time, and that’s really the hard challenge that we had with her. Actually in terms of design, there were lots of <b>fun</b> <b>things,</b> like at one point she had a sort of 'Fallen Angel' feel to her, like broken wings," [...] Weir recalled. Motion capture sessions were used for inspiration for the alternatingly awkward and fluid motion of the character, though none of it was used in the final product. In developing her visual design, the team tried to balance the design influence of the Big Daddies with a unique look. Soft design elements influenced by the story, like Little Sisters that would ride around in the Big Sister's cage and draw on her armor, were added to complement the harsh metal {{of the rest of the}} character.|$|E

I saw a guy who I’m sure {{used to be the}} singer in a band called The Vampire Lovers – they did a song called 'Buzzsaw Popstar' which still sounds good today". In July 1984, a second single, [...] "Sweethearts Blown Mindless", followed and according to The Barman it evokes the Raw Power-era Stooges with a different drummer and Lux Interior of The Cramps instead of Iggy Pop. By the second half of 1984, the group fell apart as the local punk, post-punk movement disintegrated, [...] "turning their back on stardom, the Vampire Lovers split in late '84, claiming to have been thwarted by 'creative differences'".

Phil is angry as the doctor explains how Louise is at a crucial stage in her recovery and the police tell Phil and Sharon what they are doing. Phil and Sharon are told Lisa switched cabs and find Lisa's flat, which is empty. Louise wakes up and Lisa lies to her that she and Phil agreed for her to be away from the square while Phil and Sharon question Lisa's capabilities. The police, Phil and Sharon discuss Lisa being traced through her cash withdrawals in Castle Point and that she has a mental health team.

Louise's phone dies as she tries to phone the police and Lisa prevents Louise from leaving, but when Lisa allows her to go, Louise chooses to stay with and comfort Lisa when she is distressed. Bex gives Phil and Sharon information on a hotel where Lisa and Louise are at and compared to Sharon, Phil shows a lack of regard to Lisa's mental health. Phil finds Louise and she wants him to leave. Phil gains entry to their room and Lisa hits Phil over the head with a phone.
