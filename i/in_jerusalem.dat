5|$|Both faced {{disastrous}} marches across Anatolia in {{the months}} that followed, and most of their armies were destroyed. Louis abandoned his troops and travelled by ship to the Principality of Antioch, where his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine's uncle, Raymond, was prince. Raymond expected him to offer military assistance against the Seljuk Turks threatening the principality, but Louis refused and went to Jerusalem to fulfil his crusader vow. Conrad, stricken by illness, had earlier returned to Constantinople, but arrived <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> a few weeks later in early April 1148. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa, but <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem,</b> the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus.|$|E

5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Georgian {{court was}} {{primarily}} concerned with {{the protection of the}} Georgian monastic centers in the Holy Land. By the 12th century, eight Georgian monasteries were listed <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> Saladin's biographer, Bahā' ad-Dīn ibn Šaddād, reports that after the Ayyubid conquest of Jerusalem in 1187, Tamar sent envoys to the sultan to request that the confiscated possessions of the Georgian monasteries <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem</b> be returned. Saladin's response is not recorded, but the queen's efforts seem to have been successful: Jacques de Vitry, who attained to the bishopric of Acre shortly after Tamar's death, gives further evidence of the Georgians’ presence <b>in</b> <b>Jerusalem.</b> He writes that the Georgians were – in contrast to the other Christian pilgrims – allowed a free passage into the city, with their banners unfurled. Ibn Šaddād furthermore claims that Tamar outbid the Byzantine emperor in her efforts to obtain the relics of the True Cross, offering 200,000 gold pieces to Saladin who had taken the relics as booty at the Battle of Hattin – to no avail, however.|$|E
