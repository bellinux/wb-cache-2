5|$|From its {{formation}} in 1936, Coastal Command {{did not receive}} the support it required {{to be an effective}} naval air service. In September 1939 Nazi Germany invaded Poland beginning the war in Europe. The Command's position was comfortable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> of the war, the period known as the Phoney War. German submarines were not able to reach the Atlantic unless they undertook a dangerous transit journey through the North Sea and around Britain's northern waters or through the English Channel, which was guarded by the Royal and French Navies. The powerful French Navy was responsible for covering half of the Atlantic shipping routes and thus contributed half of the Allied forces available.|$|E
5|$|Regehr {{was born}} on April 19, 1980 in Recife, Brazil, the second son of Canadian Mennonite missionaries Ron and Edith Regehr. Regehr only lived in Brazil <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> of his life. From three to seven years old he lived in Indonesia, where his younger brother, Richie was born. He also has an older brother and a sister. The family finally settled back in Canada, at Rosthern, Saskatchewan around the time he turned seven. Regehr quickly picked up the game of hockey, but was held back {{in his first year}} of minor hockey as he was {{starting}} the game three years behind other kids his age. He helped his father operate the natural surface ice rink in Rosthern, often spending hours manually preparing the ice.|$|E
5|$|Immediately thereafter, Australian Greg Chappell, one of {{the leading}} batsmen of his time, became India's coach (2005) and {{identified}} Pathan's batting potential. Pathan improved his batting skills and tried to become a complete bowling all-rounder, and he opened the batting on occasions in ODIs and scored 93 in a Test match (10 Dec 2005, versus Sri Lanka in Delhi) in the role after an illness to Virender Sehwag. He made three scores beyond 80 in the space of four Test innings against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> of Chappell's stint at the helm, Pathan performed strongly with both bat and ball, scoring runs regularly and frequently taking top-order wickets. He rose to No. 2 in the ICC's ODI rankings for all-rounders and was also in the top five in the Test rankings. This led critics to compare him to former Indian pace bowling allrounder Kapil Dev.|$|E

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> of World War II, Canberra was {{assigned}} to patrol and escort duties around Australia. In January 1940, the cruiser escorted the first convoy carrying Australian and New Zealand soldiers, Anzac Convoy US 1, to the Middle East. During May, Canberra joined sister ship Australia to escort Anzac Convoy US 3 across the Indian Ocean; the convoy was diverted via the Cape of Good Hope following fears that Italy was about to join the war. On 26 June, Canberra left Australia with the troopship Strathmore for Cape Town, where the cruiser {{was assigned}} to the Indian Ocean as a convoy escort between Fremantle, Colombo, and Cape Town. During November, Canberra attempted to locate the German merchant raider Atlantis. She returned unsuccessful to Fremantle on 20 November, but sailed that night with a skeleton crew after the merchant ship SS Maimoa signalled that she was under attack by a German merchant raider (the auxiliary cruiser Pinguin). Although unable to find Maimoa or her attacker, Canberra encountered three lifeboats on 22 November, which carried 27 sailors who had escaped from SS Port Brisbane, another victim of Pinguin. The cruiser returned to Fremantle on 27 November without encountering the German raider. Shortly after, Canberra headed for the East Indies Station.|$|E
500|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> of 1943, Fanning {{deployed}} {{against the}} Japanese on Guadalcanal, supported an occupation {{force on the}} Russell Islands, participated in patrol duty, and assisted in the protection of troops occupying Munda, Solomon Islands. In September, she had an overhaul on the west coast, then finished the year operating off the Aleutian Islands. By January 1944, Fanning was operating with Task Group 58.4 in the Marshall Islands. [...] In March she reported to the Eastern Fleet (British units, reinforced with Australian, Dutch and French warships), participating in strikes against Sabang, Indonesia, the next month. [...] Detached from the Eastern Fleet in May, Fanning sailed to the west coast. [...] In July she left San Diego, escorting the heavy cruiser Baltimore to Alaska with Roosevelt on board. [...] Her next assignment was with Task Group 30.2, shelling Marcus Island in October 1944 to create a diversion and destroy enemy installations. [...] During January 1945, Fanning {{took part in the}} shelling of Iwo Jima, Haha-jima, and Chichi-Jima. For the remainder of the war, she was occupied with patrol and escort activities. [...] In September 1945, she sailed for the United States, and was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, in December 1945; she was sold for scrap in 1948. Fanning received four battle stars for her World War II service.|$|E

She arranged her own appearances and publicity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> but soon decided that she needed a professional manager.

Nevertheless, she says that she gets the most satisfaction from her live performances. In addition to her Miranda tours, Ballinger and Evans presented several music and comedy shows in December 2015 in California, and in January 2016 they gave an 11-performance US tour billed as [...] "The Colleen & Josh Show".|$|E
2500|$|Half of Jordan's prison {{population}} {{at the time}} consisted of people arrested for attempting to return to, or illegally enter, Israeli territory, {{but the number of}} complaints filed by Israel over infiltrations from the West Bank show a considerable reduction, from 233 {{in the first nine months}} of 1952, to 172 for the same period in 1953, immediately before the attack. This marked reduction was in good part the result of increased Jordanian efficiency in patrolling. Between June 1949 and the end of 1952, a total of 57 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed by Palestinian infiltrators from the Jordanian West Bank. The Israeli death toll <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> of 1953 was 32. Over roughly the same time (November 1950 – November 1953), the Mixed Armistice Commission condemned Israeli raids 44 times.

6000|$|George Laird was thirty. At {{the opening}} of the war he was in an East-End practice, and had volunteered at once for service with the Army. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>nine</b> <b>months</b> he had been right up in the thick of it. A {{poisoned}} arm; rather than the authorities, had sent him home. During that leave he married Gratian. He had known the Piersons some time; and, made conscious of the instability of life, had resolved to marry her at the first chance he got. For his father-in-law he had respect and liking, ever mixed with what was not quite contempt and not quite pity. The blend of authority with humility, cleric with dreamer, monk with artist, mystic with man of action, in Pierson, excited in him an interested, but often irritated, wonder. He saw things so differently himself, and had little of the humorous curiosity which enjoys what is strange simply because it is strange. They could never talk together without soon reaching a point when he wanted to say: [...] "If we're not to trust our reason and our senses for what they're worth, sir--will you kindly tell me what we are to trust? How can we exert them to the utmost in some matters, and in others suddenly turn our backs on them?" [...] Once, in one of their discussions, which often bordered on acrimony, he had expounded himself at length.|$|E
