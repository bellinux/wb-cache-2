Each <b>human</b> <b>cell</b> contains roughly two meters of DNA. During most of the cell cycle these are organized in a DNA-protein complex known as chromatin, and during cell division the chromatin can be seen to form the well-defined chromosomes familiar from a karyotype.

5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a <b>human</b> <b>cell.</b> He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different <b>human</b> <b>cell</b> types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E

This technique is {{exemplified by the}} work of Yoshid et al. to produce Janus nanoparticles where one hemisphere has affinity for <b>human</b> <b>cells,</b> while the other hemisphere has no affinity for <b>human</b> <b>cells.</b> This was achieved by cojetting polyacrylamide/poly(acrylic acid) copolymers which have no affinity for <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> with biotinylated polyacrylamide/poly(acrylic acid) copolymers, which when exposed to streptavidin-modified antibodies, obtain an affinity for <b>human</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>cells</b> resist viral infections by {{a variety}} of mechanisms. Viruses must {{overcome}} host cell restrictions to successfully reproduce their genetic material. Here, we identify a host restriction to viral replication that acts at the stage of particle assembly. Viral protein U (Vpu) is an HIV- 1 accessory protein that enhances particle assembly and release in most <b>human</b> <b>cells,</b> but not in simian cells. By using human-simian cell heterokaryons, we show that the inhibition of assembly in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> is dominant. Vpu overcomes the block to assembly in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> and in human-simian heterokaryons. The HIV- 1 vpu gene may have evolved to counteract an assembly restriction that is present in <b>human</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
40|$|Strong species {{specificity}} {{and similar}} tropisms suggest mouse cytomegalovirus (mCMV) {{as a potential}} vector for transgenes into <b>human</b> <b>cells.</b> We reexamined the dogma that mouse cytomegalovirus cannot productively replicate in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> and found that mouse cytomegalovirus can produce infectious particles albeit {{at a level that}} does not sustain an infection. This finding demonstrates that mouse cytomegalovirus can undergo all processes of its life cycle in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> but may not be well adapted to circumvent the <b>human</b> <b>cell's</b> intrinsic defenses. The suppression of mCMV production in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> is affected at several levels, which additively or synergistically result in the appearance of species specificity. Hydrolysis of most newly replicated viral DNA and very low capsid protein transcription reduced the potential particle production to insignificant levels. These effects can be ameliorated by adding human cytomegalovirus tegument proteins and immediate-early protein 1. They function synergistically to produce significant amounts of mCMV in <b>human</b> <b>cells.</b> While the possibility that mouse cytomegalovirus might replicate in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> raises caution in the use of this virus as a transgene vector, manipulation of the mouse cytomegalovirus genome to allow limited spread to other <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> might also provide an advantage for the distribution of certain transgenic products...|$|R
5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a <b>human</b> <b>cell</b> when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical <b>human</b> <b>cell</b> contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the DNA sequence, and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Szilard {{secured a}} {{research}} professorship at the University of Chicago {{that allowed him}} to dabble in biology and the social sciences. He teamed up with Aaron Novick, a chemist who had worked at the Metallurgical Laboratory during the war. The two men saw biology as a field that had not been explored as much as physics, and was ready for scientific breakthroughs. It was a field that Szilard had been working on in 1933 before he had become subsumed in the quest for a nuclear chain reaction. The duo made considerable advances. They invented the chemostat, a device for regulating the growth rate of the microorganisms in a bioreactor, and developed methods for measuring the growth rate of bacteria. They discovered feedback inhibition, an important factor in processes such as growth and metabolism. Szilard gave essential advice to Theodore Puck and Philip I. Marcus for their first cloning of a <b>human</b> <b>cell</b> in 1955.|$|E

5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which patients have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from <b>human</b> <b>cell</b> extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E

Standard curves of mixed human/rodent DNA and mixed human/rodent cells have been performed to determine the limit of detection and linear range of the assay.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Isolation {{of human}} {{antibodies}} using current display technologies can {{be limited by}} constraints on protein expression, folding and post-translational modifications. Here we describe a discovery platform that utilizes self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vectors for the surface display of high-affinity single-chain variable region (scFv) antibody fragments on <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> and lentivirus particles. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bivalent scFvFc human antibodies were fused in frame with different transmembrane (TM) anchoring moieties to allow efficient high-level expression on <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> and the optimal TM was identified. The addition of an eight amino acid HIV- 1 gp 41 envelope incorporation motif further increased scFvFc expression on <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> and incorporation into lentiviral particles. Both antibody-displaying <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> and virus particles bound antigen specifically. Sulfation of CDR tyrosine residues, a property recently shown to broaden antibody binding affinity and antigen recognition was also demonstrated. High level scFvFc expression and stable integration was achieved in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> following transduction with IRES containing bicistronic SIN lentivectors encoding ZsGreen when scFvFc fusion proteins were expressed from the first cassette. Up to 10 (6) -fold enrichment of antibody expressing cells was achieved with one round of antigen coupled magnetic bead pre-selection followed by FACS sorting. Finally, the scFvFc displaying <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> could be used directly in functional biological screens with remarkable sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This antibody display platform will complement existing technologies by virtue of providing properties unique to lentiviruses and antibody expression in <b>human</b> <b>cells,</b> which, in turn, may aid the discovery of novel therapeutic human mAbs...|$|R

40|$|Abnormalities of {{chromosome}} number are frequently observed in cancers. The mechanisms regulating chromosome segregation in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> are therefore of great interest. Recently {{it has been}} reported that <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> without an hSecurin gene lose chromosomes at a high frequency. Here we show that, after hSecurin knockout through homologous recombination, chromosome losses are only a short, transient effect. After a few passages hSecurin / cells became chromosomally stable and executed mitoses normally. This was unexpected, as the securin loss resulted in a persisting reduction of the sister-separating protease separase and inefficient cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc 1. Our data demonstrate that securin is dispensable for chromosomal stability in <b>human</b> <b>cells.</b> We propose that <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> possess efficient mechanisms to compensate for the loss of genes involved in chromosome segregation...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} developed {{short-term and}} long-term assays for autonomous replication of DNA in <b>human</b> <b>cells.</b> This study addresses {{the requirements for}} replication in these assays.

We found a positive correlation between replication strength and fragment length, indicating that large size is favored for efficient autonomous replication in <b>human</b> <b>cells.</b> All large fragments replicated efficiently, suggesting that signals which can direct the initiation of DNA replication in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> are either very abundant or have a low degree of sequence specificity. Similar results were obtained in the long-term assay. We also used the same assays to test in <b>human</b> <b>cells</b> a random series of fragments derived from Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA. The bacterial fragments supported replication less efficiently than the human fragments in the short-term and long-term assays.
