5000|$|The crucifixion's {{proximity}} to the Sabbath day has also factored into the theory.

The Wednesday Crucifixion theory accounts for this discrepancy. In the traditional Jewish calendar there were weekly Sabbaths on Saturday, as well as seven High Sabbaths, also called [...] "High Days", some of which can fall on {{any day of the}} week. John 19:31 says that that particular Sabbath day before which Jesus was crucified was, in the Greek translation, a [...] "great day" [...] or [...] "high day" [...] (μεγάλη ἡ ἡμέρα).|$|R
