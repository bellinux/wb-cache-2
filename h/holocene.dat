5|$|Calabozos {{is one of}} 44 <b>Holocene</b> epoch volcanoes {{located in}} central Chile and Argentina. It is {{included}} within the Southern Volcanic Zone, the most active section of the Chilean Andes. The date of its last known eruption is not known with precision, though it {{took place during the}} <b>Holocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Viking Bergen Island, {{a sunken}} island {{of the early}} <b>Holocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the major}} {{collapse}} approximately 5,000years ago, subsequent eruptions of lava and tephra built up the modern summit cone until about {{as recently as}} 1,000years ago. As many as 11 <b>Holocene</b> tephra layers have been found.|$|E
5|$|Fossil remains {{indicate}} tigers {{were also}} present in Beringia in the north, Japan to the east, and Borneo and Palawan in the Philippines in the south during the Late Pleistocene and Early <b>Holocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lemurs are {{not known}} in the fossil record on Madagascar until the Pleistocene and <b>Holocene</b> epochs. Consequently, {{little is known about}} the {{evolution}} of ruffed lemurs, let alone the entire lemur clade, which comprises the endemic primate population of the island.|$|E
5|$|Tephra {{analysis}} has yielded evidence for many eruptions during the Pleistocene and <b>Holocene,</b> including two large explosive eruptions {{during the early}} and mid-Holocene. These eruptions deposited significant tephra layers over Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} {{population}} in Sichuan Province is {{larger and more}} stable than the Yunnan population, suggesting a southward expansion from Sichuan into Yunnan in the <b>Holocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early <b>Holocene,</b> glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight expansion is noted during the Little Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|Activity of Cerro Blanco {{goes back}} 8 mya, when the Maricunga Belt {{in the west}} was active. The volcano is {{responsible}} for a large <b>Holocene</b> eruption with a Volcano explosivity index 7, {{the largest in the}} Andean Central Volcanic Zone for 5000 years. It is comparable to Santorini and Tambora's large eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{died out}} {{relatively}} recently {{and is only}} known from subfossil remains, it {{is considered to be}} a modern form of Malagasy lemur. Babakotia radofilai lived during the <b>Holocene</b> epoch and is thought to have disappeared shortly after the arrival of humans to the island, possibly within the last 1000 years. However, the only radiocarbon date that has been reported for it dates back to about 31002800BCE.|$|E
5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top {{is dead and}} mostly above the water line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive. Average tide level limits their height. By analyzing the various growth morphologies, microatolls offer a low resolution record of sea level change. Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct <b>Holocene</b> sea levels.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{springbok}} {{are known}} from the Pliocene; the antelope appears to have evolved about three million years ago from a gazelle-like ancestor. Three fossil species of Antidorcas have been identified, {{in addition to the}} extant form, and appear to have been widespread across Africa. Two of these, A. bondi and A. australis, became extinct around 7,000 years ago (early <b>Holocene).</b> The third species, A. recki, probably gave rise to the extant form A. marsupialis during the Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. Fossils have been reported from Pliocene, Pleistocene, and <b>Holocene</b> sites in northern, southern, and eastern Africa. Fossils dating back to 80 and 100 thousand years ago have been excavated at Herolds Bay Cave (Western Cape Province, South Africa) and Florisbad (Free State), respectively.|$|E
5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. The late <b>Holocene</b> eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, a volcano in Alaska, is now {{believed to be the}} source of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.|$|E
5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This has resulted in a widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the <b>Holocene</b> extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The <b>Holocene</b> extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|In the Upper Myall River region, B.serrata {{grows in}} dry sclerophyll forest on sandy soils that have {{recently}} formed (in the <b>Holocene)</b> or in shallow soils over differing substrates, while its close relative B.aemula grows on dry heath forest that occurs on ancient Pleistocene sands {{that have not}} been disturbed in 125,000 years. In intermediate communities both species are found.|$|E
5|$|Large {{explosive}} eruptions in {{the southern}} segment of the Southern Volcanic Zone occur on average every 725 years, and tephras from volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone have been transported over large distances. The largest <b>Holocene</b> volcanic eruption of the Southern Andes occurred 6,700 years before present at Cerro Hudson. Tephra layers found at Mallín El Embudo {{have been attributed to}} Mentolat, as well as to Melimoyu and Cerro Hudson.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur {{has been}} active during the <b>Holocene,</b> after the ice ages. Although no {{historic}} eruptions of the volcano are known, lava flows extending into Laguna Verde have been dated to 13,240 ± 100 BP. The volcano has primarily erupted andesite, with small amounts of dacite and basaltic andesite.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the eruptive history of Mentolat, but it {{is thought to be}} young, with a {{possible}} eruption in the early 18th century that may have formed lava flows on the western slope. The earliest activity occurred during the Pleistocene, and Mentolat has had some major explosive eruptions during the <b>Holocene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mount St. Helens is geologically young {{compared}} with the other major Cascade volcanoes. It formed only within the past 40,000 years, and the pre-1980 summit cone began rising about 2,200 years ago. The volcano is considered the most active in the Cascades within the <b>Holocene</b> epoch (the last 10,000 or so years).|$|E
5|$|Not all {{volcanism}} in Chile {{is relative}} to subduction of the Nazca Plate; the Chile Ridge exhibits submarine volcanism, and volcanism in the Austral Volcanic Zone is {{triggered by the}} Antarctic Plate subducting beneath the South American Plate. One hundred ninety-eight South American volcanoes are on the Global Volcanism Program's <b>Holocene</b> volcano list.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{activity}} is an ignimbrite erupted 0.65 ± 0.18 mya, called the Tuzgle ignimbrite. On {{the rim of}} the caldera left by this eruption is a lava dome complex named the Old Complex Unit. 0.3 ± 0.1 mya ago effusive activity commenced with the Pre-platform and Platform units that were then followed by a tectonic event that dissected these units. Afterwards, the Post-platform and Young Flow Units were erupted. The youngest unit is latitic and was dated 0.1 ± (0.1-0.3) mya ago. This unit may be <b>Holocene</b> or PleistoceneHolocene in age. It is possible that the continuing activity of the Chorrillos fault zone is compressing the magma chamber and feeder dyke of Tuzgle, thus impeding eruptive activity. The well-preserved summit crater and youthful-looking lava flows have been assigned <b>Holocene</b> ages.|$|E
5|$|The present era is {{classified}} {{as part of a}} mass extinction event, the <b>Holocene</b> extinction event, the fastest ever to have occurred. Some, such as E. O. Wilson of Harvard University, predict that human destruction of the biosphere could cause the extinction of one-half of all species in the next 100years. The extent of the current extinction event is still being researched, debated and calculated by biologists.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in the Spanish Creek and Ray Lake {{areas were}} synglacial but {{continued}} after the glacial ice had melted away. Two cinder cones, known as Flourmill Cone and Pointed Stick Cone, {{were created in}} the Spanish Creek area. Lava flows from the two cinder cones lie on glaciated bedrock without an intervening paleosol, indicating an early <b>Holocene</b> age.|$|E
5|$|Volcanism in {{the region}} of Carpathia and Pannonia has been ongoing since 20 million years ago but has {{decreased}} during the Quaternary. No eruptions have occurred in the <b>Holocene.</b> The last volcanism occurred at Ciomadul in the last glacial age. Sparse basaltic volcanism has also occurred in the area, forming monogenetic volcanic fields.|$|E
5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the <b>Holocene</b> extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Botany {{originated}} as herbalism, {{the study}} and use of plants for their medicinal properties. Many records of the <b>Holocene</b> period date early botanical knowledge {{as far back as}} 10,000 years ago. This early unrecorded knowledge of plants was discovered in ancient sites of human occupation within Tennessee, which make up much of the Cherokee land today. The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient texts from India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E
5|$|Calabozos is a <b>Holocene</b> caldera {{in central}} Chile's Maule Region (7th Region). Part of the Chilean Andes' {{volcanic}} segment, {{it is considered}} {{a member of the}} Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ), one of the three distinct volcanic belts of South America. This most active section of the Andes runs along central Chile's western edge, and includes more than 70 of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields. Calabozos lies in an extremely remote area of poorly glaciated mountains.|$|E
5|$|During {{recorded}} history, eruptions have consisted {{primarily of}} a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified <b>Holocene</b> eruption was about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245BC±150years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850BC, 200BC±100 years, 350AD±300 years, 675AD±50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September 1985 – July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E
5|$|Early {{people began}} {{altering}} communities of {{flora and fauna}} for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early. Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early <b>Holocene</b> in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any human intervention, implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally.|$|E
5|$|Hilton Head Island is {{sometimes}} referred to as the second largest barrier island on the Eastern Seaboard after Long Island (which is not actually a barrier island but two glacial moraines). Technically, however, Hilton Head Island is only a half barrier island. The north end of the island is a sea island dating to the Pleistocene epoch, and the south end is a barrier island that appeared as recently as the <b>Holocene</b> epoch. Broad Creek, which is actually a land-locked tidal marsh, separates the two halves of the island.|$|E
5|$|<b>Holocene</b> {{lava flows}} are more alkalic than the Pleistocene lava flows and {{comprise}} several xenoliths of chromium-spinel lherzolite, spinel clinopyroxenite, and rare ferroan websterite and spinel wehrlite. Xenoliths {{do not exist}} in the older lava flows. However, chemical evidence indicates that every lava flow was produced in a similar way by low degrees of piecemeal melting. The melts originally came from the upper mantle which, over time, was progressively depleted by every following melting event.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{studies have}} {{established}} that the lake has long had a permanent ice cover. Further, studies carried out during the austral summer confirm the lake's homogeneous characteristics, with thermal convection as the reason given for its hydro-geochemical and isotropical nature. It is replenished perennially by a process of underwater melting of the adjacent glacier ice. It is also stated that the lake existed during the <b>Holocene</b> period when it emerged from a melt-water pond.|$|E
5|$|Most {{woolly mammoth}} populations {{disappeared}} {{during the late}} Pleistocene and early <b>Holocene,</b> alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, {{which led to the}} shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk Peninsula of Siberia 9,650 years ago. A small population of woolly mammoths survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska, well into the <b>Holocene</b> with the most recently published date of extinction being 5,600 years B.P. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago, well into the start of human civilization and concurrent with the construction of the Great Pyramid of ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Noronhomys {{is known}} only from Fernando de Noronha, a small {{archipelago}} of volcanic origin off northeastern Brazil, {{consisting of a}} main island and several associated smaller islands. The formation of the archipelago, which has never been connected to the mainland, began about 11million years ago; active vulcanism ceased about 2million years ago. Remains of Noronhomys were found in association with remains of various reptiles, birds, and snails, several of which are also restricted to the archipelago, in sand dunes near the northeastern tip of the main island. The age of the deposits is unknown, but is likely late <b>Holocene,</b> at most a few thousand years old.|$|E
5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil. Italian {{explorer}} Amerigo Vespucci may have seen it {{on a visit to}} Fernando de Noronha in 1503, but it subsequently became extinct, perhaps because of the exotic rats and mice introduced by the first explorers of the island. Numerous but fragmentary fossil remains of the animal, of uncertain but probably <b>Holocene</b> age, were discovered in 1973 and described in 1999.|$|E
5|$|Pleistocene {{climate is}} harder to determine, though it was {{probably}} not much wetter than today, except in the mountains where precipitation increased. Drainage changes in the Colorado River Delta probably account {{for most of the}} water budget increases responsible for the formation of Lake Cahuilla. In the Mojave Desert large lakes also formed during that time. In the early <b>Holocene</b> the North American Monsoon strongly influenced the local climate and then progressively weakened.|$|E
