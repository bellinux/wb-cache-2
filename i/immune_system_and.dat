5|$|Microbes {{can make}} {{nutrients}} and minerals {{in the soil}} available to plants, produce hormones that spur growth, stimulate the plant <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> trigger or dampen stress responses.

5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> {{go on to}} become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so the immune system no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E

5|$|In blood plasma, zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper. The concentration of zinc in blood plasma stays relatively constant regardless of zinc intake. Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E
5|$|Most viral {{vaccines}} {{are based}} on live attenuated viruses, while many bacterial vaccines {{are based on}} acellular components of micro-organisms, including harmless toxin components. Since many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce the adaptive response, most bacterial vaccines are provided with additional adjuvants that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> maximize immunogenicity.|$|E
5|$|The Ichneumonidae are {{specialized}} parasitoids, {{often of}} Lepidoptera larvae deeply buried in plant tissues, {{which may be}} woody.

Some of the largest species, including Rhyssa persuasoria and Megarhyssa macrurus, parasitise horntails, large sawflies whose adult females also have impressively long ovipositors. Some parasitic species have a mutualistic relationship with a polydnavirus that weakens the host's <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> replicates in the oviduct of the female wasp.|$|E

5|$|Dendritic cells {{bridge the}} innate <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce {{the proliferation of}} T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E
5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, and therefore that they could not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> the bacterial flagellum are so complex and interdependent that they could not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, {{as well as its}} inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, basic {{biological}} <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> {{their responses}} to external elements to maintain an organism’s health state are described. The relationship between <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> multi-robot <b>systems</b> are also discussed. Our proposed algorithm is based on immune network theories that have many similarities with the multi-robot systems domain. The paper describes a memory-based immune network that enhance a robot’s action-selection process and can obtain an overall a quick group response. The algorithm which is named as Immune Network T-cell-regulated—with Memory (INT-M) {{is applied to the}} dog and sheep scenario. Simulation experiments were conducted on the Player/Stage platform and experimental results are presented. I...|$|R
5|$|The Dales pony is one {{of three}} breeds known to be a carrier of the fatal genetic disease foal {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (FIS). FIS is a recessive disease; affected foals are born when they inherit the gene from both parents. Foals with FIS appear normal when born, but have a compromised <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> anemia, leading to untreatable infections and death within three months. Following the development of a genetic test in 2010, 12% of Dales ponies tested in the UK were found to be carriers. The use of genetic testing has allowed breeders to avoid mating two carrier animals, so that the disease is avoided in foals.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} peripheral nervous system tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose {{a higher}} risk of crews developing cancer, and can cause damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells are central to the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E
40|$|Like {{most other}} fields in biology, {{immunology}} has been revolutionised by {{the techniques of}} molecular biology and the resulting explosion in available experimental data. It is argued that efforts to integrate the data to gain insight into how various subsystems in the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> interact <b>and</b> function require mathematical modelling and computer simulation in close collaboration with experimentalists. This paper illustrates some of the techniques available for modelling <b>immune</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>and</b> highlights the issues that should be borne in mind by anyone starting down the modelling path...|$|R
40|$|Janssen (2001) {{provides}} the stimulus for thoughtful comparison and {{consideration of the}} ranges of responses exhibited by <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> ecological <b>systems</b> {{in the face of}} perturbations such as biological invasions. It may indeed be informative to consider the similarities of the responses to invasions exhibited by <b>immune</b> <b>systems</b> <b>and</b> ecological <b>systems.</b> Clearly, both types of systems share a general organizational structure with all other complex hierarchical systems. Their organization {{provides the}}se systems with resilience. However, when describing the response of ecological-economic systems to invasions, Janssen emphasizes the human-economic response. I would like to expand on his comparison by focusing on how resilience is maintained in complex systems under the threat of invasion...|$|R
50|$|A true {{understanding}} of cell differentiation in the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{will require a}} general perspective on the transcriptional profile of each cell type of the adaptive <b>and</b> innate <b>immune</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>and</b> how these profiles evolve through cell differentiation or activation by immunogenic or tolerogenic ligands. The ImmGen project aims to establish the roadmap of these transcriptional states.|$|R
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> <b>and</b> disorientation.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, HIV causes AIDS by {{depleting}} CD4+ T cells. This {{weakens the}} <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> allows opportunistic infections. T cells {{are essential to}} the immune response and without them, the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells. The mechanism of CD4+ T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases. During the acute phase, HIV-induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4+ T cell depletion, although apoptosis may also be a factor. During the chronic phase, the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4+ T cell numbers.|$|E

Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet.

30|$|When {{nanoparticles}} {{are administered}} intravenously, they are easily {{recognized by the}} body <b>immune</b> <b>systems,</b> <b>and</b> are then cleared by phagocytes from the circulation (Muller et al. 1993).

5|$|Although {{many more}} {{invertebrates}} than vertebrates {{are used in}} animal testing, these studies are largely unregulated by law. The most frequently used invertebrate species are Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. In the case of C. elegans, the worm's body is completely transparent and the precise lineage of all the organism's cells is known, while studies in the fly D. melanogaster can use an amazing array of genetic tools. These invertebrates offer some advantages over vertebrates in animal testing, including their short life cycle and {{the ease with which}} large numbers may be housed and studied. However, the lack of an adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> their simple organs prevent worms from being used in several aspects of medical research such as vaccine development. Similarly, the fruit fly immune system differs greatly from that of humans, and diseases in insects can be different from diseases in vertebrates; however, fruit flies and waxworms can be useful in studies to identify novel virulence factors or pharmacologically active compounds.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (neutrophil granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Glucocorticoids have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. Glucocorticoids also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
