5|$|In some cuts, {{the film}} {{ends with a}} <b>freeze-frame</b> on Steve McQueen's face {{following}} his penny-pitching loss. Turner Classic Movies and the DVD feature the ending with Christian. Jewison wanted to end the film with the <b>freeze-frame</b> but was overruled by the producer.|$|E
5|$|Another parodied film is the 1964 thriller Fail-Safe by Sidney Lumet: at the {{beginning}} of the third act of the episode, scenes of everyday life across Springfield are shown, and one by one, with a 'zooming' sound effect, they all <b>freeze-frame</b> in anticipation of the (supposedly) imminent nuclear blast; such was the ending of Fail-Safe. One of the scenes before the supposed nuclear blast shows Maggie picking flowers in a field, with the camera zooming into her eye, and then the minuscule blast occurs. This is a parody of the infamous and controversial Daisy ad used by Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.|$|E
5|$|The Deltas are despondent, but Bluto rallies {{them with}} an impassioned, if {{historically}} inaccurate, speech ("Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"), and so they decide {{to take action against}} Wormer, the Omegas, and the college. They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and hide it inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, the futures of several of the student main characters are revealed using <b>freeze-frame</b> labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while their adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes.|$|E

50|$|The bleak {{portrait}} in China Behind of both communist China and capitalist Hong Kong brought upon it a thirteen-year ban by the British colonial authorities. In {{addition to their}} provocative themes, both films used stylistic devices, such as <b>freeze-frames</b> and expressionistic color, possibly inspired by the European art cinema of the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|The film {{ends with}} a flash-forward to 1987 where a tour guide is leading a group through the palace. Stopping {{in front of the}} throne, the guide sums up Puyi's life in a few, brief sentences, {{concluding}} that he died in 1967. The picture <b>freeze-frames</b> on the throne and the credits roll.|$|R
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the school}} year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The {{competition}} is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a <b>freeze-frame</b> shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the blind}} lady points Manni towards the {{homeless}} {{man with his}} money, who passes on the cyclist's bike. Manni chases him with a gun, inadvertently causing a head-on collision between the white BMW, Mr. Meier, {{and the man who}} stole Lola's moped. Mr. Meier, Lola's dad and the thief apparently die in the crash. Manni manages to retrieve his money, trading it for his gun. Lola reaches the supermarket, but cannot find Manni. She shouts his name but there is no response. A little farther away, a car pulls up with Manni and Ronnie inside, who shake hands. Manni, no longer in need of the 100,000 marks, asks Lola what is in the bag she is carrying, only for the film to end in a <b>freeze-frame</b> on Lola's reaction.|$|E
25|$|Freddie worries over Effy's {{psychological}} {{state in}} his centric episode, {{as she is}} developing a psychotic depression that resembles what his mother had before she committed suicide. He is able to save Effy after an attempt on her life; she is hospitalised and he is left desolate. JJ's episode sees him {{fall in love with}} a single mother called Lara (Georgia Henshaw), through whom he finds a new-found confidence and begins to doubt whether he really needed to be so highly medicated his whole life. In the penultimate episode, Effy's psychiatric counsellor Dr John Foster (Hugo Speer) uses unorthodox hypnotic methods to cure Effy's depression, making her forget and want to abandon her old friends. After an incident at the spot of Tony's accident where she nearly commits suicide again, her psychosis comes back and Freddie insists Dr Foster cease treating Effy. Later, Foster lures Freddie to discuss Effy, and brutally murders Freddie with a baseball bat. In the finale episode, everyone deals with Freddie's absence, thinking that he has left of his own volition. Naomi and Emily finally repair their damaged relationship, scorched by cheating, and Naomi confesses she loved Emily since they first met; Thomas and Pandora are thrown back together by chance when they both get into Harvard College; a mostly-recovered Effy holds Freddie's birthday party in his shed, knowing that he loved her and pining for his return. Cook, who is on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, uncovers Dr Foster's killing and after confronting him, furiously lunges at Foster. The series ends here in <b>freeze-frame</b> leaving both Cook's and John Foster's fates unknown.|$|E
50|$|First of all, {{there are}} psychic contusions - psychic elaborations which evolve like bruises which {{brighten}} and darken, colour-up, and shift around feeling/sensation pin-point triggers (which Stanton calls contundors). Then {{there are the}} imagos, the amalgams generated from various bits of visual/sensation material that randomly stick together to form an evanescent image or sound that <b>freeze-frames</b> the on-going narrative.|$|R

Displayed in a grid, the subject is captured in split-second intervals.|$|R
500|$|The film's {{original}} trailer {{features a}} jovial Hitchcock taking the viewer {{on a tour}} of the set, and almost giving away plot details before stopping himself. It is [...] "tracked" [...] with Herrmann's Psycho theme, but also jovial music from Hitchcock's comedy The Trouble with Harry; most of Hitchcock's dialogue is post-synchronized. The trailer was made after completion of the film, and since Janet Leigh was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Vera Miles don a blonde wig and scream loudly as he pulled the shower curtain back in the bathroom sequence of the preview. Since the title, [...] "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years. However, a <b>freeze-frame</b> analysis clearly reveals that it is Miles and not Leigh in the shower during the trailer.|$|E
500|$|They {{thought of}} using David Glen Eisley's song [...] "Sweet Victory" [...] {{for the final}} act. He said [...] "It was {{different}} than what we were looking for, {{but it was so}} amazing that we knew we had to use it. So we boarded the sequence to the music, and it felt like such a better ending than any song we could have written on our own." [...] The writers gave it a <b>freeze-frame</b> shot for the ending. Greenblatt's favorite part was director Springer's drawings of Patrick on the electric drums and SpongeBob saying, [...] "It's the thrill of one more kill" [...] (an excerpt from [...] "Sweet Victory"). [...] The live action Bubble Bowl crowd is footage from a United States Football League game featuring the Memphis Showboats and the Tampa Bay Bandits.|$|E
500|$|Signs {{of missing}} footage from the Sellers {{segments}} are evident at various points. Evelyn Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, {{he calls for}} the car, à la Pink Panther, to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; the next thing that is shown is Tremble being tortured. Out-takes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending {{to play the piano}} on Ursula Andress' torso), in the finale - blowing out the candles whilst in highland dress - {{and at the end of}} the film when all the various [...] "James Bond doubles" [...] are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a <b>freeze-frame</b> over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot).|$|E
50|$|Hitchcocks cameo {{appearance}} is a signature occurrence {{in almost all}} of his films. In Spellbound, he can be seen coming out of an elevator at the Empire State Hotel, carrying a violin case and smoking a cigarette, about 43:15 minutes into the film. The trailer for Spellbounds original theatrical release in America made {{a great deal of}} fuss over this cameo, showing the footage twice and even <b>freeze-framing</b> Hitchcocks brief appearance while a breathless narrator informs us that this ordinary-looking man is the films director.|$|R
5000|$|Film critic Roger Ebert {{liked the}} film and wrote, [...] "The movie is built {{as a series of}} more-or-less {{self-contained}} episodes, and the episodes that work are worth the effort. But we get the feeling the movie doesn't know where it's headed and the last scene (one of those <b>freeze-frames</b> that's supposed to crystallize a significant moment for us) left me suspended in midair. If there were ever a movie that just plain stopped, instead of arriving at a conclusion, this is it. Still, there were some good moments along the trail." ...|$|R
5000|$|Spider-Man {{uses the}} same game engine as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Spider-Man was a hidden {{character}} in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, and a reference is made to this during gameplay. The PlayStation, Dreamcast, and Windows versions have pre-rendered cutscenes, whereas the Nintendo 64 version shows captioned <b>freeze-frames</b> done {{in the style of}} a comic book and with fewer voice clips, due to that console's technical limitations for cutscenes. The Lizard was meant to appear in the final cutscene but {{was not included in the}} final version of the game's cutscene.|$|R
500|$|Nancy Basile of About.com ranked [...] "Band Geeks" [...] at [...] 1 in her [...] "Best SpongeBob SquarePants Episodes" [...] list, writing [...] " [...] {{has so many}} of {{the best}} {{elements}} of SpongeBob, crafted into a story whose rhythm flows smoothly and quickly to reach a poignant end." [...] She praised the entire premise, calling it [...] "funny just to think about." [...] Basile also lauded the ending [...] "complete with a keytar and <b>freeze-frame</b> jump in the air." [...] Emily Estep of WeGotThisCovered.com ranked the episode [...] 4 in her [...] "Top 10 Episodes of SpongeBob SquarePants" [...] and said, [...] "Most of the gags in 'Band Geeks' center around Squidward's bleak existence, but it's also stuffed with one-liners from and about each of the characters on the show, such as the line 'These claws ain't just for attractin' mates!' from an about-to-brawl Mr. Krabs, and when Squidward says, 'No Patrick, mayonnaise is not an instrument,' in response to an inevitable query from the stupid star." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] {{feature the}} first {{substantial}} {{appearance of the}} Lich, the series' primary antagonist, who made an early appearance in the season one episode [...] "His Hero" [...] being defeated by Billy in a flashback. The Lich had appeared in concept drawings in the series' pitch bible, which Ward himself had created in 2007. Ward's original drawing was re-designed by former creative director McHale; he purposely gave the Lich a desiccated and dried-up look, and was instrumental in crafting the Lich's rotting appearance. In both this episode and other episodes where the character appears, the Lich was voiced by Ron Perlman. The snail, an easter egg that appears in every episode, appears in the episodes and plays a prominent part. Originally, the snail {{was inspired by the}} in-jokes in episodes of The Simpsons, and was Ward's attempt to [...] "make a game out of every episode of Adventure Time, where you could <b>freeze-frame</b> and find things in the background", such as the snail. However, in [...] "Mortal Folly", the snail serves as the catalyst for the Lich's escape. The snail would also play an important part in other mythology-heavy episodes like [...] "In Your Footsteps", and [...] "The Lich". Osborne later noted that the snail's appearance was pleasing to fans who knew that the snail had been appearing in all the episodes and had actively searched for it before.|$|E
500|$|Like Robin, the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] {{video is}} drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It {{features}} Robin {{and his friend}} Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable EU representatives, bullying pub patrons, a prostitute, two kissing leathermen, a drug addict, deranged businessmen, mermaids and an angel who plays table tennis with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching {{a man with a}} head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said [...] "If you <b>freeze-frame</b> it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." [...] Colin Greenwood said [...] "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so Spinal Tap" [...] and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be [...] "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it [...] "is really about the violence around , which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every time I see it." ...|$|E
50|$|His first self-produced {{film was}} The Embryo Hunts In Secret (extra=1966), {{a story of}} a man who kidnaps, tortures and sexually abuses a woman until she finally escapes and stabs him to death. <b>Freeze-frames,</b> flash-backs, {{hand-held}} camera and locations limited to two rooms and a hallway add to the film's disturbing, claustrophobic atmosphere. Vagabond of Sex (1967) was a parody of Imamura's A Man Vanishes (1967). In Wakamatsu's film, a man leaves his family in Tokyo to travel and engage in various sexual escapades. When he returns home he finds out that his wife is starring in Imamura's documentary about her search for her missing husband.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the videocassette followed the replacement by cassette of other open-reel systems in consumer items: the Stereo-Pak 4-track audio cartridge in 1962, the compact audio cassette and Instamatic film cartridge in 1963, the 8-track cartridge in 1965, and the Super 8 home movie cartridge in 1966.Before {{the invention of the}} video tape recorder, live video was recorded onto motion picture film stock in a process known as telerecording or kinescoping. Although the first quadruplex VTRs record with good quality, the recordings cannot be slowed or <b>freeze-framed,</b> so kinescoping processes continued to be used for about a decade after the {{development of}} the first VTRs.|$|R
5000|$|The second {{version was}} in two segments. The first segment is filmed, {{comprising}} a full-length McGoohan in stark negative, menacingly {{taking a few}} paces towards the camera, then stops. In quick succession, the camera zooms-in fast onto his eyes, <b>freeze-frames,</b> then switches from negative to positive. The legend [...] "Patrick McGoohan as" [...] is added. This then switches to a different photo with McGoohan looking left out of picture. The familiar three-ringed 'target' then reveals the programme logo on a pure black background as before. The music was re-recorded for {{this version of the}} ident and lasted {{for the rest of the}} programme's run.|$|R
500|$|Lou Lumenick of the New York Post {{gave the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, saying [...] "A dazzling, computer-animated fish tale with a funny, {{touching}} script and wonderful voice performances that make it an unqualified treat for all ages." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "Enchanting; written with an effortless blend of sweetness and silliness, and animated with such rainbow-hued beauty, {{you may find yourself}} wanting to <b>freeze-frame</b> it." [...] Daphne Gordon of the Toronto Star gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "One of the strongest releases from Disney in years, thanks to the work of Andrew Stanton, possibly {{one of the most successful}} directors you've never heard of." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Finding Nemo isn't quite up there with the company's finest work -- there's finally a sense of formula setting in -- but it's hands down the best family film since Monsters, Inc." [...] C.W. Nevius of The San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, saying [...] "The visuals pop, the fish emote and the ocean comes alive. That's in the first two minutes. After that, they do some really cool stuff." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Finding Nemo will engross kids with its absorbing story, brightly drawn characters and lively action, and grown-ups will be equally entertained by the film's subtle humor and the sophistication of its visuals." [...] David Ansen of Newsweek gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "A visual marvel, every frame packed to the gills with clever details, Finding Nemo is the best big-studio release so far this year." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Volcano" [...] {{episode was}} in {{production}} when South Park debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an [...] "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized [...] "Volcano" [...] was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song [...] "Kumbaya" [...] around the fire, as well as the long <b>freeze-frame</b> on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.|$|E
500|$|Hard Target {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} on its initial release praising the film's action scenes but noting the poor story and Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting abilities. On the film review television show Siskel & Ebert, Roger Ebert stated that Hard Target is [...] "not very smart and it's not very original, {{but it is}} well made on a technical level. The stunts are impressive... as an action picture, it's well made, but it never becomes more than competent action and I just can't recommend it for that". Gene Siskel also gave the film a thumbs down on the show stating that [...] "John Woo is a good filmmaker... Van Damme is pretty wooden... You notice the style in the film because {{there is not much}} substance". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Van Damme has still not broken the habit of his own blank-faced posturing, although Mr. Woo films him in the most aggrandizing style imaginable". In Variety, Emanuel Levy wrote that Hard Target was [...] "a briskly vigorous, occasionally brilliant actioner starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, hampered by a B-script with flat, standard characters, and subjected to repeated editing of the violent sequences to win an R rating, pic doesn't bear the unique vision on display in Woo's recent [...] "The Killer" [...] and [...] "Hard-Boiled." [...] Van Damme and the director's reputation should ensure initial commercial kick on the way to solid if not spectacular box office". Desson Thompson of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "When Van Damme isn't duking it out with the English language, scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer is filling Henriksen's mouth with villainous pseudo-profundities. Even in a second-rate action picture like this, and despite Henriksen's commendable efforts, they're painful to listen to... Woo's creative presence is practically stifled. There are some flashes of his deliriously wild style—a slow-motion moment here, a well-chosen <b>freeze-frame</b> there. He also introduces American audiences to his taste for unique motorcycle stunts and very, very loud car explosions. But these Wooisms are disappointingly minimal". Lance Henriksen received a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Emil Fouchon in the film. In 1997, Woo looked back on Hard Target stating that it was [...] "in some ways, quite a troublesome movie to make, but I'm rather happy with the way the action scenes turned out". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "B" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E
50|$|The {{years in}} the USA became crucial for Morris, not only because he met Goscinny, but also because he {{gathered}} {{a great deal of}} documentation for his later work, and became familiar with the Hollywood films of the time. Morris introduced in the following years many cinematic techniques in his stories, like <b>freeze-frames</b> and close-ups. Walt Disney's style influenced him, which {{can be seen in the}} very round lines that characterize the early Lucky Luke albums. Many characters in his comics are also clearly based on famous American actors such as Jack Palance, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and William Hart, although he also caricaturizes unexpected figures like Louis de Funès or Serge Gainsbourg.|$|R
5000|$|The helical scan methods use a {{recording}} drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. The tape is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so the tape heads, instead of {{moving across the}} tape at almost 90° to the direction of motion as in the quadruplex system, move across the tape at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across the tape. This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (<b>freeze-framed)</b> during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping the tape transport mechanism, allowing the tape heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.|$|R
2500|$|Eadweard Muybridge's {{sequential}} photography {{of movements}} broken down {{frame by frame}} produced in the late 19th century depicting horses at a gallop and nudes descending a staircase, were known in Europe {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century. Muybridge often traveled to Europe to promote his work and he met Étienne-Jules Marey in 1881. His <b>freeze-framed</b> images of galloping horses evoked time and motion. Displayed in a grid, the horse is captured in split-second intervals. Because the horse's movement was too fast for the human eye to register, there was a scientific debate in the 1870s questioning (Marey's hypothesis originally) whether all four hooves ever left the ground simultaneously. To prove that Marey was right Muybridge (in Palo Alto, California) carried out his [...] "Photographic Investigation". His photographs settled the debate, though skeptics remained.|$|R
2500|$|Shetty {{responded that}} she had not {{received}} any court summons and also discounted the charges. She further claimed that the pictures were <b>freeze-frame</b> shots from a recent movie that only exposed her navel. [...] "As far as my photographs go, what is obscene about it? If navel-showing is obscenity, then our traditional Indian outfit – the traditional sari – should be banned in the first place." ...|$|E
2500|$|With editor Rolando Benedetti, Fellini {{established}} a rhythm in which short sequences {{were separated by}} abrupt cuts while longer sequences used dissolves. The numerous brief and disparate episodes [...] "governed by their own internal logic" [...] were thus held together by a particular editing pattern.

30|$|The {{importance}} of image sequence processing is constantly growing with the ever {{increasing use of}} television and video systems in consumer, commercial, medical, and scientific applications. Image sequences can be acquired by film-based motion picture cameras or electronic video cameras. In either case, there are several factors related to imaging sensor limitations {{that contribute to the}} graininess (noise) of resulting images. Electronic sensor noise and film grain are among these factors [1]. In many cases, graininess may result in visually disturbing degradation of the image quality, or it may mask important image information. Even if the noise may not be perceived at full-speed video due to the temporal masking effect of the eye, it often leads to unacceptable single-frame hardcopies and to poor-quality <b>freeze-frames</b> that adversely affect the performance of subsequent image analysis [2].|$|R
5000|$|Barbara Schober is a German visual artist. Her work {{covers a}} broad range of various media in which the term [...] "Internet Awareness" [...] plays an {{important}} role. With ancient techniques and material experiments, she sets a counterpoint to the pervasive digital world. Schober uses photography and <b>freeze-frames,</b> creates digital and analog collages and (re-)digitizes, paints over, or applies material objects to them. She integrates intentionally or randomly created structures elsewhere in her work. A major topic in Schober's work is a dynamic play with perspective and dimensions which continuously destabilizes the position of the viewer. The spontaneous, the accidental and art-trouvé {{is as important as the}} artist's personal involvement with the object or the topic.
