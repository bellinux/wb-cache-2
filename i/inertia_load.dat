40|$|Wheel force {{transducer}} (WFT), which measures the three-axis forces and three-axis torques {{applied to the}} wheel, is an important instrument in the vehicle testing field and has been extremely promoted by researchers with great interests. The transducer, however, is typically mounted on {{the wheel of a}} moving vehicle, especially on a high speed car, when abruptly accelerating or braking, the mass/inertia of the transducer/wheel itself will have an extra effect on the sensor response so that the inertia/mass loads will also be detected and coupled into the signal outputs. The effect which is considered to be inertia coupling problem will decrease the sensor accuracy. In this paper, the inertia coupling of a universal WFT under multi-axis accelerations is investigated. According to the self-decoupling approach of the WFT, <b>inertia</b> <b>load</b> distribution is solved based on the principle of equivalent mass and rotary inertia, thus then inertia impact can be identified with the theoretical derivation.

40|$|Abstract—High-performance robust {{motion control}} of single-rod {{hydraulic}} actuators with constant unknown <b>inertia</b> <b>load</b> is considered. In {{contrast to the}} double-rod hydraulic actuators studied previously, the two chambers of a single-rod hydraulic actuator have different areas. As a result, the dynamic equations describing the pressure changes in the two chambers cannot be combined into a single load pressure equation. This complicates the controller design since it not only increases the dimension of the system {{to be dealt with}} but also brings in the stability issue of the added internal dynamics. A discontinuous projection-based adaptive robust controller (ARC) is constructed. The controller is able to take into account not only the effect of parameter variations coming from the <b>inertia</b> <b>load</b> and various hydraulic parameters but also the effect of hard-to-model nonlinearities such as uncompensated friction forces and external disturbances. The controller guarantees a prescribed output tracking transient performance and final tracking accuracy in general while achieving asymptotic output tracking in the presence of parametric uncertainties. In addition, the zero error dynamics for tracking any nonzero constant velocity trajectory is shown to be globally uniformly stable. Extensive experimental results are obtained for the swing motion control of a hydraulic arm and verify the high-performance nature of the proposed ARC control strategy. In comparison to a state-of-the-art industrial motion controller, the proposed ARC algorithm achieves more than a magnitude reduction of tracking errors. Furthermore, during the constant velocity portion of the motion, the ARC controller reduces the tracking errors almost down to the measurement resolution level.
