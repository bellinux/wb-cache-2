40|$|Transtracheal gas {{insufflation}} (TGI) improves {{gas exchange}} efficiency, but {{is associated with}} hyperinflation, and usually requires ventilator adjustment {{to compensate for the}} increased gas flow. Although bidirectional TGI (Bi-TGI) minimizes hyperinflation, it does not preclude the need to reduce tidal volumes to prevent hyperinflation. A flow-compensation system was developed by Respironics (Murrysville, PA) to match TGI flows; however, neither that nor the efficacy of Bi-TGI have been tested in vivo. We tested the hypotheses that <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> allows for a constant minute ventilation; Bi-TGI produces less hyperinflation than does unidirectional TGI (Uni-TGI), and endotracheal tube size influences the degree of hyperinflation during TGI. Seven anesthetized intact dogs were studied during positive-pressure ventilation using the Respironics <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> system. Measurements were made during steady-state conditions at constant and measured levels of CO 2 production. Gas exchange efficiency (assessed by expired gas analysis for dead space) and hyperinflation (measured as an increase in pleural pressure) were compared during Bi- and Uni-TGI and for endotracheal tube sizes varying from 7 to 10 F. Bi- and Uni-TGI could be delivered at constant minute ventilation without adjusting ventilatory setting when the <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> circuit was present. Uni-TGI produced more hyperinflation than did Bi-TGI with all sizes of endotracheal tube, and hyperinflation was universally present as tube size decreased to 7. 5 F. We conclude that this new <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> system allows for the delivery of TGI without the need for adjustments to the ventilator settings, and that Bi-TGI produces less hyperinflation than does Uni-TGI, even with small diameter endotracheal tubes. © 2006 by International Anesthesia Research Society...|$|E

The vascular phantom consisted of silicon tubes. 30 % and 70 % stenosis of luminal diameter were made. Each silicon tube connected a pump producing a pulsatile flow. A flowing material to was used in this study to show the similarity of the intensity to blood on MRI. MRA without a contrast medium (NATIVE sequence) were performed in the vascular phantom by changing the image matrix, static magnetic field strength and flow velocity. In addition, the NATIVE sequence was used with or without <b>flow</b> <b>compensation.</b> Vascular stenosis was quantitatively estimated by measurement of the signal intensities in non-contrast MRA images.

We find that BITs stimulate bilateral FDI flows from partner countries - but only so long as the host country has not had a claim brought against it to arbitration. When a host faces a claim, FDI from sources with a BIT in place falls significantly more than that from unprotected sources.

40|$|Rivers {{around the}} world have been {{regulated}} for a variety of reasons. Historically the flows released from these reservoirs have been set with minimal attention to ecology. The aim {{of this study was to}} use both field and modelling techniques to assess the ecological implications for altering <b>compensation</b> <b>flow</b> regimes in upland millstone grit catchments. A simple paired-catchment approach was chosen. The study catchments used were the regulated Rivelin and Loxley (tributaries of the River Don), and the unregulated Hipper. Before the 1 st of April 2004 ， the steady state compensation releases from the Rivelin and Loxley were set at 2, 6 Thousand Cubic Metres per Day (TCMD) and 28 TCMD respectively. After the Ր՛ of April 2004 the <b>compensation</b> <b>flows</b> were altered on the Rivelin and Loxley to 8. 6 TCMD and 22 TCMD. This study used three broad scales of enquiry: macroinvertebrates; fisheries and modelling. Detailed macroinvertebrate surveys were conducted over a four year period (2002 - 2005), with samples taken in the spring, summer and autumn of each of those years. Surber samples were taken, along with associated environmental variables. Data analysis was conducted using both univariate and multivariate techniques. The invertebrate results showed that the role of flow variability is key within both of the regulated systems. The influence of flow variability is different on each of the study rivers, and the influence changes due to the alteration in <b>compensation</b> <b>flows.</b> Fisheries surveys were also conducted over this four year study period (2002 - 2005). Nine sites were surveyed yearly on the Rivelin and Loxley; and three on the Hipper. The fish populations in each of the rivers are dominated by brown trout (Salmo trutta). The importance of the interaction of reach scale morphology and discharge was evident in the fisheries populations with the Rivelin having similar observed densities of brown trout as the Loxley. Altering the <b>compensation</b> <b>flow</b> regimes appears to lead to an increase in the growth rate of older trout within the Rivelin. A two-dimensional hydraulic model was used to simulate the distributions of depths and velocities on four study reaches (two on the Rivelin; two on the Loxley). The model was calibrated to three separate calibration data sets. Subsequently, steady state simulations were conduced for the pre and post change <b>compensation</b> <b>flows</b> in each of the reaches. This output was subsequently linked to a fuzzy-logic based habitat model in order to generate predictions of available habitat. Predictions of available habitat were generated for four life stages of brown trout and for functional feeding groups of macroinvertebrates.

This technology can improve application accuracy of pesticides and fertilizers, thereby reducing the number of inputs while promoting environmental stewardship. However, dynamic system response for sprayer boom operation, which includes cycling or using auto-swath technology, has not been investigated. Therefore, a study was conducted to develop a methodology and subsequently perform experiments to evaluate tip pressure and system flow variations on a typical agricultural sprayer equipped with a controller that provided both boom section and nozzle control. To quantify flow dynamics during boom section or nozzle control, a testing protocol was established that included three simulation patterns under both <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> and no-compensation modes achieved via the spray controller. Overall system flow rate and nozzle tip pressure at ten boom locations were recorded and analyzed to quantify pressure and flow variations. Results indicated that the test methodology generated sufficient data to analyze nozzle tip pressure and system flow rate changes. The tip pressure for the compensated section control tests varied between 6. 7 % and 20. 0 %, which equated to an increase of 3. 7 % to 10. 6 % in tip flow rate. The pressure stabilization time when turning boom sections and nozzles off approached 25. 2 s but only approached 15. 6 s when turning them back on for the <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> tests. Although extended periods were required for the tip pressure to stabilize, the system flow rate typically stabilized in less than 7 s. The tip flow rate was consistently higher (up to 10. 6 %) than the target flow rate, indicating that system flow did not truly represent tip flow during section control. The no-compensation tests exhibited tip pressure increases up to 35. 7 % during boom and nozzle control, which equated to an 18. 2 % increase in tip flow. Therefore, <b>flow</b> <b>compensation</b> over no-compensation had better control of tip flow rate. A consistent difference existed in dynamic pressure response between boom section and nozzle control. Increased tip pressure and delayed pressure stabilization times indicated that application variability can occur when manually turning sections on and off or implementing auto-swath technology, but further testing is needed to better understand the effect on application accuracy of agricultural sprayers...|$|E

Fetal sheep of ≈ 131 days gestation (n = 8) were chronically instrumented with bilateral laser Doppler probes in the parietal cortices and catheters for injection of fluorescent microspheres. Five days after surgery fetuses were subjected to 1 h periods of baseline control breathing, hypoxia and recovery. Microspheres were injected 10 min prior to and 10, 30, 50 and 120 min after initiation of hypoxia. Microspheres were counted in four 12 mm 3 tissue samples from each hemisphere, the tip of the laser Doppler probe being positioned in the centre of one of the cubes. The cube containing the probe tip was also subdivided into 4 mm 3 pieces of tissue. In response to hypoxia, fetal arterial PO 2 declined from 21 ± 2 to 12 ± 1 Torr and brain tissue PO 2 fell from 10 ± 1 to a nadir of 1 ± 1 Torr. Each method detected a significant increase in CBF that reached a maximum after 30 – 45 min, although the increase of flow measured by laser Doppler flowmetry was less than that measured by spheres after 10 and 30 min (P < 0. 05).

We conclude that the DDC algorithm contributes to the standardization of compensation for spectral cross-over in flow cytometry of solid tissues...|$|R
