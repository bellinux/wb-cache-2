60|$|My {{ideas of}} the duties I was to perform were very vague, as were also my ideas of Ireland generally. Hitherto I had passed my time, seated at a desk, either writing letters myself, or copying into books those which others had written. I had never been called upon to do {{anything}} I was unable or unfitted to do. I now understood that in Ireland I {{was to be a}} deputy-inspector of country post offices, and that among other things to be inspected would be the postmasters' accounts! But as no other person asked a question as to my <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> this <b>work,</b> it seemed unnecessary for me to do so.|$|R
5000|$|While timepieces {{of foreign}} make were mainly sold {{and used in}} the US in the 19th-century, the watch {{repairer}} needed <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> his <b>work,</b> which could be acquired only by long apprenticeship and familiarity with {{the various types of}} timepieces. When American watches became popular, watchmaking as a trade began to decline. Materials of every description became plentiful, easily obtained and readily used, and any difficult job was naturally turned over to the manufacturer. Still, these conditions, as regards American watches, afforded no reason why watchmakers should degenerate. On the contrary, every improvement and modification of timepieces and every additional form of movement called for higher skill in handling these delicate machines.|$|R
50|$|As in Great Britain, {{distinct}} {{services of}} inspection {{enforce the law}} in factories and mines respectively. In factories and workshops an inspector may order re-examination as to physical <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> the <b>work</b> imposed of any worker under 16; certain occupations and processes are prohibited - e.g. girls under 16 at machines worked by treadles, and the weights that may be lifted, pushed or carried by girls or boys under 18 are carefully specified. The law applies generally to philanthropic and religious institutions where industrial work is carried on, as in ordinary trading establishments; and this holds good even if the work is by way of technical instruction. Domestic workshops are not controlled unless the industry is classed as dangerous or unhealthy; introduction of motor power brings them under inspection.|$|R
5000|$|After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, she campaigned unsuccessfully {{for women}} {{to be allowed to}} fly {{military}} aircraft.

5000|$|Assessors {{should not}} supply [...] "prescriptive advice" [...] on benefit {{entitlement}} in their reports. However, {{the structure of}} the core WCA and the way reports are presented mean that assessors' opinions on <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> are obvious to decision-makers. Some claimants are unfit for work but nevertheless ineligible for ESA because they do not meet the non-medical criteria with respect to benefit entitlement.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, the Conservative Secretary of State for Work and Pensions criticised the WCA, {{which was}} {{introduced}} when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister. He called the test [...] "unbelievably harsh", said it contained [...] "perverse incentives" [...] for claimants and lamented {{the fact that}} doctors were offered only a [...] "binary choice" [...] when asked for their opinion on <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> Litchfield's professional opinion, as expressed to Parliament, was that the test was [...] "by no means perfect" [...] but nevertheless adequate.|$|E
2500|$|Describing the Paisley Terrier in 1894, Rawdon Lee {{writes that}} [...] "Though he can kill rats, and maybe other vermin, the Paisley Terrier is {{essentially}} a pet dog, and is usually kept as such." [...] The breed was primarily a pet, {{and it was also}} a popular showdog. In 1903, the breed is referred to as [...] "a fancier's dog, a sport from the Skye Terrier stock" [...] and despite some fanciers of the time claiming that the breed had the [...] "hardiness and <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> terrier <b>work...</b> it is evident that a dog with a coat that looks like silk is simply a toy." [...] Owners and breeders in the 1800s placed a high value on the beautiful blue and tan coat, and would cover the dog's feet and tie the hair back over their eyes to keep the coat looking at its best for dog shows.|$|R
6000|$|Hugh Redfield {{the girl}} {{thoroughly}} understood and loved, {{he was so}} simple-hearted and so loyal. His bitter criticisms of the West were not uttered in a destructive mood--quite the contrary. His work was constructive in the highest degree. He was profoundly impatient of America's shortcomings, {{for the reason that}} he deeply felt her responsibility {{to the rest of the}} world. His knowledge of other republics and [...] "limited monarchies" [...] gave his suggestions power and penetration; and even Bridges, besotted in his provincial selfishness, had advised his selection as Supervisor. Of his own <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> the <b>work,</b> Redfield himself took a dispassionate view. [...] "I am only filling the place till the right man comes along," [...] he said to his friends. [...] "The man before me was a half-hearted and shifty advocate. I am an enthusiast without special training; by-and-by the real forester will come to take my place." ...|$|R
60|$|Sun {{and wind}} had their will with the homestead, {{for there was}} little shelter from icy {{blizzard}} and scorching heat at Cedar; but though here and there the frame-boarding gaped and the roof-shingles were rent, no man accustomed to that country could fail to notice the signs of careful management and prosperity. Corrals, barns, and stables were {{the best of their}} kind; and, though the character of all of them was not beyond exception, in physique and <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> their <b>work</b> it would have been hard to match the sinewy men in blue shirts, wide hats, and long boots, then watering their horses at the ford. They were as daring and irresponsible swashbucklers as ever rode out on mediæval foray, and, having once sold their allegiance to Torrance of Cedar, and recognized that he was not to be trifled with, were ready to do without compunction anything he bade them.|$|R
50|$|At {{face-to-face}} assessments, the assessors - who are nurses, {{doctors or}} physiotherapists - are guided and {{prompted by a}} computer programme, designed by Atos {{in conjunction with the}} DWP, called the 'Logic-integrated Medical Assessment' or 'LiMA'. A large amount of lifestyle data and some clinical information is obtained from the claimant and is entered into the computer by the assessor, mostly by selecting pre-determined 'one click' options from an on-screen menu. As the assessment progresses, LiMA tries to gauge both the impact of the disability on the person's daily life and the person's <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> - but while LiMA suggests options to the assessor, it is ultimately the healthcare professional who is responsible for making the recommendations.|$|E
50|$|In Belgium, {{the medical}} {{advisers}} of sickness funds {{have an important}} role legally in the assessment of working capacity and medical rehabilitation measures for employees whose <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> is jeopardized or diminished for health reasons. The measures are laid down in the sickness and invalidity legislation. They are in accordance with the principle of preventing long-term disability. It is apparent from the authors' experience that these measures are not adapted consistently in medical practice. Most of the medical advisers are focusing purely on evaluation of corporal damage, leaving little or no time for rehabilitation efforts. In many other countries, the evaluation of work capacity is done by social security doctors with a comparable task.|$|E
5000|$|The {{core testing}} process was {{outsourced}} to private companies {{from its inception}} — first to Atos in 2008, and then to Maximus from March 2015. At a face-to-face assessment a healthcare professional — in most cases, a nurse — working for the DWP's contractor uses decision-making software, their role-specific training, and their clinical experience to compile {{a report on the}} claimant's disability and his or her <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> The outsourcing firm then sends the report to the DWP. A civil servant uses this report, plus any other relevant information they have to hand, to decide on entitlement to Employment and Support Allowance or to an enhanced rate of Universal Credit, and on whether a successful claimant will be required to take part in [...] "work-related activity".|$|E

It should make sure disabled people get the specialist, tailored and flexible support they need to find and keep a job." ...|$|R

40|$|During {{the search}} for spatial data resources, users, both experts and non-experts in the {{geoinformation}} field, are expected to know what type of spatial data resource they need, and in which clearinghouse or geoportal to search. In the case of success, they are still left with the decision on <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> use, based on complex metadata, for the few cases where such metadata exists. To aid {{the search for}} spatial data resources, we propose a system for guided search for spatial data resources called GUESS. This system enhances current search engines with decision intelligence on <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> use. GUESS <b>works</b> with profiles that contain data about users and about spatial data resources. From a free-form search request, GUESS identifies the spatial extent and the application domain, and searches for spatial data resources that comply with quality requirements in that domain. As a result, GUESS recommends a spatial data resource that best fits the user's needs. We illustrate capabilities of the proposed system on a request by a fictional user of a spatial data resource that is frequently present in the geoinformation worl...|$|R
50|$|During the {{face-to-face}} assessment, if {{it becomes}} clear that the claimant qualifies for the Support Group on the grounds of severe functional disability, the interview should be brought to an early close and the finding recorded as a short note on the claimant's file as a recommendation to the DWP decision-maker. Otherwise, after the interview and any examination the findings are summarised in free text using Standard English prose and the report, constructed mainly from the LiMA options selected by the assessor during the interview phase of the assessment, is sent electronically to the DWP. The whole report attempts both to record all the findings and to justify the recommendation on <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> It shows the total points score and ends with a statement on whether significant disability is likely or unlikely, and a prognosis.|$|E
50|$|Breed {{standards}} only cover externally observable {{characteristics of}} the dog, and even there breed clubs can be very contentious about the exact definition of details. The breed club for each breed may set additional requirements, ones covering qualities {{not covered by the}} breed standard, such as rules and guidelines for health testing and work testing. However, since breeders are free to leave and join (or form) another club if the breed club's requirements for breeding become too troublesome to them, there is no effective control over health and working qualities that are not described in the breed standard. Breed club members have no control over the quality, health, or <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work</b> of dogs being bred by non-members. Even when breed clubs require health testing before breeding their dogs, and raise funds for research on specific disorders, such as syringomyelia in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels or dermoid sinus in Rhodesian Ridgebacks, volume puppy producers and breeders who are not members of the breed club cannot be compelled to contribute to research or to perform the tests. Breed standards can only be used to determine by appearance whether or not volume puppy producers and breeders who are not members of the breed club are breeding dogs that appear to be of the advertised breed.|$|E
5000|$|Iain Duncan Smith {{complained that}} the system gave doctors a [...] "binary choice", not an {{opportunity}} to deliver a more nuanced opinion on claimants' <b>fitness</b> <b>for</b> <b>work.</b> In April 2016, the new Welfare Secretary, Stephen Crabb, said that the WCA had [...] "never worked as intended. The WCA was a mess, it didn't recognise mental health issues {{and other types of}} disability". Later the same year, the Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Debbie Abrahams, said the test her party had described as [...] "tough but fair" [...] in 2010 had been [...] "discredited". When appearing on Question Time, the president of the Liberal Democrats, Baroness Sal Brinton, described the WCA as [...] "not fit for purpose", adding [...] "this process absolutely fails" [...] and [...] "we need to get rid of it". On the same BBC programme, Kier Starmer QC, a former Director of Public Prosecutions, said: [...] "It is time for a real review of how these assessments are actually working". In September 2016, Damian Green was asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr about the deaths of specific benefit claimants; in reply, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions acknowledged that [...] "obviously there are individual cases where it looks as though the system is not working".|$|E
40|$|Many {{employers}} require {{workers to}} have pre-employment medical examinations, routine exams to determine <b>fitness</b> and suitability <b>for</b> <b>work,</b> evaluations <b>for</b> continuing disability, or assessments before {{a return to}} work after illness or injury.

40|$|Along with {{increased}} worldwide incidence of diabetes, {{the frequency of}} its occurrence among persons employed on seagoing vessels has also grown (12). According to the current regulations, persons treated with insulin are not admitted to work at sea, and those treated with oral drugs have a markedly limited access to such a work. This may lead to concealing the fact of being a diabetic, thus enhancing the existing hazards. Current improved methods of glycemia self-control and treatment of diabetes have radically improved vital abilities of diabetics. Having this in mind, a question arises whether the binding regulations on the <b>fitness</b> of diabetics <b>for</b> <b>work</b> at sea should be verified...|$|R
