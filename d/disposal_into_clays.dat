40|$|During {{exploration}} and production of oil and natural gas, various types of waste must be disposed in a permanent and safe way. There is a range of methods for processing and disposal of waste, such as <b>disposal</b> <b>into</b> landfills, solidification, namely chemical stabilization, thermal processing, appropriate formation injections uncovered by a deep well, <b>disposal</b> <b>into</b> salt domes and bioremediation. The method of waste <b>disposal</b> <b>into</b> appropriate formations is a method where strict geological and technical criteria must be satisfied when applied. A fundamental scientific hypothesis has been formulated whereby economic acceptability of the waste injection method, as a main method for waste disposal, is to be shown by an economic evaluation. The results of this research are relevant since {{there has been an}} intention in Croatia and worldwide to abandon wells permanently due to oil and gas reservoirs depletion and therefore it is essential to estimate economic impacts of the waste injection method application. In that way, profitability of using existing wells for waste disposal in oil industry has been increased, leading to the improvement of petroleum company’s business activities (the paper is published in Croatian) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Utilizing coal waste {{byproducts}} formed during mine {{development or}} use {{is important in}} solving environmental problems and recycling of waste materials. In this study, specimens prepared by mixing coal waste of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 % <b>into</b> <b>clay</b> brick have been investigated in terms of water absorption and compressive strength according to coal waste amounts and calcination temperature. As coal waste content increased water absorption increased and compressive strength decreased. When up to 30 % coal waste was mixed <b>into</b> <b>clay</b> at 1300 oC, specimens satisfied 1 st-class brick of Korea Standard requirements (water absorption 10 %>, compressive strength 210 kgf/cm 2 <) ...|$|R
50|$|While <b>disposal</b> <b>into</b> {{exhausted}} open pits {{is generally}} a straightforward operation, <b>disposal</b> <b>into</b> underground voids is more complex. A common modern {{approach is to}} mix a certain quantity of tailings with waste aggregate and cement, creating a product {{that can be used}} to backfill underground voids and stopes. A common term for this is HDPF - High Density Paste Fill. HDPF is a more expensive method of tailings disposal than pond storage, however it has many other benefits - not just environmental but it can significantly increase the stability of underground excavations by providing a means for ground stress to be transmitted across voids - rather than having to pass around them - which can cause mining induced seismic events like that suffered previously at the Beaconsfield Mine Disaster.|$|R
