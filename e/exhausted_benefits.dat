40|$|In 1996 a {{political}} trade-off in the New Jersey legislature {{led to a}} six-month program that provided up to 13 additional weeks of <b>exhausted</b> their regular <b>benefit</b> entitlement. We use this unique episode to provide new evidence {{on the effect of}} changes in the duration of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits on the behavior of UI claimants. Unlike most benefit extensions, the New Jersey Extended Benefit (NJEB) program arose during a period of stable economic conditions, allowing us to sidestep the important issue of endogenous policy adoption. We use aggregate state-level data and administrative records for individual UI claimants from before, during, and after the NJEB program to estimate its impact on unemployment spell lengths. Overall, we find that the NJEB program raised the fraction of UI claimants who <b>exhausted</b> their regular <b>benefits</b> by 1 - 3 percentage points. More importantly, however, we find that the short-term nature of the benefit extension substantially moderated its effect. For individuals who were receiving UI when the benefit extension was passed, we estimate that the rate of leaving UI fell by about 15 percent. Simulations suggest that if the program had run long enough to affect UI claimants from the first day of their spell, the fraction of recipients <b>exhausting</b> regular <b>benefits</b> would have risen by 7 percentage points, and the average recipient would have collected about one extra week or regular benefits. ...|$|R
30|$|Further {{evidence}} on the “power of soft constraints” is provided by Røed et al. (2008), presenting results from a comparative unemployment duration analysis based on Norwegian and Swedish administrative register data from 1999 and 2000. In these years, the maximum UI benefit period in Norway was three years, and there was little focus on activation (see above). In Sweden, by contrast, the maximum UI benefit period was only 60 weeks, and activation was used extensively as a work-test, and also applied as a paid alternative for job seekers with <b>exhausted</b> <b>benefit</b> entitlements. Hence, the Swedish 60 week limitation was clearly a soft one, {{in the sense that}} alternative income options were made available for job seekers whose benefit entitlements had been exhausted. Røed et al. (2008) show that while there was strong and monotone negative duration dependence in the employment hazard for Norwegian job seekers in this period, it tended to be relatively stable for Swedish job seekers, with a significant rise in transition rates around the time of passive benefit exhaustion. And the magnitude of the latter rise was similar in size to those identified by Røed and Westlie (2012) based on Norwegian data only.|$|R

30|$|The {{upshot of}} this is that an {{unemployed}} person in Japan who has no UI benefit eligibility, or who has <b>exhausted</b> this <b>benefit</b> entitlement, has a very strong incentive to find work. In this specific situation, the Japanese PES does not need to devote a major effort to activation since the unemployed have strong work incentives. As a result, the activation effort in Japan, as measured by the public spending effort on ALMPs, is relatively small. In 2012, Japan spent only 0.2 % of GDP on ALMPs, {{less than half of the}} OECD average.|$|R

In Switzerland, there is a very strong decentralisation of active labour market programmes under controls, combined with a certain Germanic discipline 16. Switzerland has a totally decentralised network of employment offices across the 26 cantons.

40|$|Abstract In May 2010 the Danish {{government}} and the Danish People’s Party signed the Fiscal Consolidation Agreement {{with the objective of}} rebalance public finances. One of the main elements was a labor market reform, which reduced the potential unemployment insurance (UI) benefit duration from 4 to 2 years. Based on the experiences from the 1990 s the Ministry of Employment estimated, that no more than 2. 000 - 4. 000 UI-recipients would <b>exhaust</b> their <b>benefits</b> on an annual basis because of the reform. In February 2014 AK-Samvirke announced, that 33. 919 UI-recipients had <b>exhausted</b> their UI <b>benefits</b> in 2013. This leads to following questions regarding: 1) how the reduction of the potential UI benefit duration affected the job search behavior among the unemployment, and how the reform affected the exit rate from unemployment to employment; 2) how the discrepancy between the Ministries forecast and the actual number that lost UI benefits can be explained. To answer these questions I will conduct a thorough description of the UI benefit reforms and the economic situation in the 1990 s and in 2010. In addition, I will include 3 Danish studies and statistics that shed light on the impact of the potential UI benefit duration reduction. In my analysis I juxtapose the above-mentioned descriptions with two disparate theoretical perspectives – a demand-side and a supply-side perspective. I conclude, in accordance with the supply-side theory, that the reduction of the UI benefit duration increased the search activity among the unemployed. But generally seen, the shortening of the benefit period did not increase the individual probability of finding a job. Finally I show, in accordance with the demand-side theory, that the incongruity (between the Ministries forecast and the actual number that <b>exhausted</b> their <b>benefits)</b> resulted from: 1) A contractionary fiscal policy (including a labor market reform that caused uncertainty); 2) The economic depression; 3) The erroneous notion, that the experiences from the 1990 s were comparable; 4) The selected phase-in of the labor market reform...|$|R

40|$|Separate social {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} New Jersey and Illinois tested {{the effect of}} offering Unemployment Insurance (UI) claimants a cash bonus for rapid reemployment.

This paper compares {{the effects of the}} bonus offers on the rate at which claimants exited UI. The New Jersey and Illinois bonus offers generated similar increases in the UI exit rate during the period in which claimants could qualify for the bonus. However, the declining New Jersey bonus had little impact on long-term claimants who <b>exhausted</b> their UI <b>benefits.</b> In contrast, the constant Illinois bonus had a substantial impact on long-term claimants, thereby reducing the rate at which claimants <b>exhausted</b> their UI <b>benefits.</b> This finding at least partly explains why the Illinois bonus had a larger impact on UI receipt than the New Jersey bonus. ...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] The {{recession}} of 2007 to 2009 {{was the most}} severe in the United States since the 1930 s, resulting in {{a net loss of}} 7. 5 million jobs. Workers who lose a job through no fault of their own (referred to as “displaced workers” in this report) may turn to financial assistance offered through the Unemployment Insurance (UI) program. Currently, through benefit extensions authorized by Congress, eligible displaced workers can receive UI benefits for up to 99 weeks in certain states. However, with the slow economic recovery, some may <b>exhaust</b> UI <b>benefits</b> without finding a new job. This raises questions about how Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a program that provides cash assistance to low-income families with children, and other support programs are aiding those who have <b>exhausted</b> UI <b>benefits.</b> GAO was asked to examine: (1) how many of the workers who lost jobs in the recession received and exhausted UI; (2) what are the economic circumstances of those who exhausted UI, and how many received support from TANF and other programs; and (3) the extent to which UI agencies refer those exhausting UI to other support programs. GAO analyzed data from the Current Population Survey’s 2008 and 2010 Displaced Worker Supplements and the 2010 Annual Social and Economic Supplement and data from the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services. GAO also surveyed 51 state UI agencies and conducted interviews with 16 state TANF agencies, selected to reflect a range of unemployment rate changes in recent years.

30|$|Key {{features}} of typical unemployment insurance and Income Assistance programs are {{incorporated in the}} model as follows. First, individuals face time limitations regarding entry to and exit from the unemployment system. Individuals who enter employment from Income Assistance or who have <b>exhausted</b> their unemployment <b>benefits</b> become eligible to receive unemployment benefits after I months of employment. The number of benefit months subsequently increases by one month for each additional month of employment, from a minimum of u months up {{to a maximum of}} u̅ months. Workers who enter employment with unused benefits retain their unused benefit months and accumulate additional months with each month worked. Second, individuals who <b>exhaust</b> their unemployment <b>benefits</b> and do not secure a job are assumed to transit directly to Income Assistance. Finally, it is assumed that individuals can remain on Income Assistance indefinitely or transit to employment if they contact a firm with a vacancy; Income Assistance recipients cannot transit directly from IA to unemployment. In the following sections, we describe the problems faced by individuals in each labor force state in the model.|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to extending {{the period of}} time for which individuals can receive unemployment benefits, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 introduced important reforms to help the long-term unemployed get back to work. First, the 2012 act introduced reemployment assistance and eligibility assessments (REAs) for those getting additional unemployment insurance. The REAs required in-person check-ins in UI offices, skill assessments, and job search counseling during those visits for the long-term unemployed. This proposal was based on a number of studies of randomized trials in Nevada, Minnesota, Illinois and Florida showing substantial reemployment effects. Michaelides et al. (2012) showed that UI recipients who were randomly assigned to REA’s were 15 percent less likely to <b>exhaust</b> <b>benefits,</b> reduced the period for which they received benefits by 3  weeks, and increased their earnings by 18 % in the 6 quarters following participation in REAs. Second, the reform introduced a self-employment assistance (SEA) program which allows the long-term unemployed to continue using UI benefits while setting up their own business. Benus (2009) evaluated a similar program, the Growing America through Entrepreneurship (GATE) program introduced in Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Maine, which randomly assigned half of the people to training and business counseling and provided assistance in applying for business financing, and found that those assigned to the program were 6 percent more likely to own a business, were likely to start their business sooner, and their businesses had greater longevity. They also found that the program was most effective among those receiving UI. Benus et al. (1994) and Benus et al. (1995) also show positive employment impacts from the Self Employment Enterprise Demonstration (SEED) and the Massachusetts Enterprise Program, which allowed the unemployed to continue claiming benefits while receiving entrepreneurial training and setting up a new business.|$|R
40|$|From Summary] The federal/state {{unemployment}} compensation (UC) {{system is}} designed to provide temporary and partial wage replacement to workers who have become involuntarily unemployed. UC also helps to stabilize the economy by providing unemployed workers with additional purchasing power, which serves as an economic stimulus when unemployment rises during recessions. The UC system generally provides sufficient duration of benefits during periods of economic prosperity, as most UC beneficiaries experience fewer weeks of unemployment than their maximum entitlements and return to work before their <b>benefit</b> rights are <b>exhausted.</b> However, during periods of economic decline, people tend to remain unemployed longer because of the greater difficulty in finding new jobs, and a rising proportion of jobless workers <b>exhaust</b> UC <b>benefits</b> without finding new work.
