40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of adding citric acid (organic acid) as an antioxidant and antimicrobial in extending the shelf life and improving the quality of <b>fresh</b> <b>beef</b> <b>sausage.</b> Four levels (0 % control, 0. 1 %, 0. 2 % and 0. 3 %,) of citric acid and the storage periods zero day, 7 days and 14 days) at - 18 Cْ were used. Forty Eight kilograms of beef and 3. 5 kg of subcutaneous fat were used, divided into four groups with 6 replicates. Data were collected on chemical composition, cooking loss, water holding capacity(WHC), objective colour, pH, oxidative rancidity (TBA value), total bacterial counts and sensory evaluation. Data were statistically analyzed using the analysis of variance pertaining to factorial arrangement by SPSS version 10. 05 -computer program. The interaction between the levels of citric acid and storage periods was not significant except in the rancidity (TBA value). TBA value increased significantly with advance of storage period and decreased with increasing the level of citric acid for all treatments. The results revealed that the moisture, protein, WHC, total microbial count and pH of <b>fresh</b> <b>beef</b> <b>sausage</b> decreased, whereas fat, ash, cooking loss and shrinkage increased insignificantly as citric acid levels increased. Colour and sensory evaluation were not significantly affected. Increasing the storage period from day one to day 14 at - 18 Cْ resulted in a non significant decrease of moisture, protein, fat, cooking loss and shrinkage, total bacterial counts, while there was a significant decrease of colour co- ordinates redness (a) and yellowness (b) and increase of lightness (L).

The effects of using different levels (0 % -control, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %) of camel meat and storage periods 0 day, 7 days and 14 days at - 18 Cْ on physical, chemical properties of <b>fresh</b> <b>beef</b> <b>sausages</b> were evaluated. Forty kilograms of (20 kg camel and 20 kg beef) meat and 5 Kg of camel subcutaneous fat were used. Camel and beef meat as well as fresh sausage treatments were analyzed to determine proximate chemical composition, objective color, pH, oxidative rancidity (TBA value), cooking loss, water holding capacity, and sensory evaluation. Data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance pertaining to factorial arrangement by SPSS version 10. 05 -computer program. The results showed that camel meat was significantly different from beef. It had higher moisture, pH, WHC, lightness (L), redness (a), and yellowness (b) colour and lower protein, fat, ash, cooking loss and oxidative rancidity -TBA value compared with beef. The interaction between the used levels of camel meat and storage periods was not significant (P> 0. 05). Increasing the level of camel meat from 0 % level to 100 % in fresh sausage formula resulted in a significant increase of moisture percentage, Lightness (L), redness (a) and yellowness (b) values and a decrease of the fat percentage. The protein and ash content were not significantly different among the treatments. Cooking loss percentage decreased significantly. Shrinkage percentage and the oxidative rancidity-TBA values were not significantly affected by the treatments.

Because of the toxic effects of nitrite, to replace the use of nitrite mostly natural additives. Tomato industries yield a high amount of by-products mainly tomato peel and seeds. Since tomato peel is rich in lycopene, it can be added directly in 0 %, 3 % and 6 % (w/w) in meat mixture used in <b>beef</b> <b>sausage</b> manufacture. This study is designed to investigate the chemical properties of nitrosomyoglobinand oxidation level, sensorial properties and microbiological analyses of <b>beef</b> <b>sausage</b> which have been produced by both reducing the nitrite level and adding tomato peel powder. All samples have been stored at- 18 °C for 3 months. As the level of nitrite was reduced, the oxidation level of the <b>beef</b> <b>sausage</b> was increased significantly. Addition of tomato peel decreased the level of oxidation when compared to the samples which did not contain tomato peel.
