40|$|The goal of {{the current}} {{observational}} {{study was to examine}} non-compliant behavior of children with an easy or a difficult temperament and the discipline styles of their <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers.</b> Participants included 100 <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> their oldest child (4 years of age). Non-compliance of the children and discipline strategy of both <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> were observed during a 'don’t touch' situation (Kuczynski, Kochanska, Radke-Yarrow, & Girnius-Brown, 1987). Inhibitory control was used as a measure of temperament, using the subscale inhibitory control from the Childhood Behavior Questionnaire (Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, & Fisher, 2001). The results suggest that children were more compliant to their fathers than to their mothers. There was a significant association between temperament and compliance to the fathers: children who were reported by their fathers as having more inhibitory control, were more compliant to them. There were no differences in discipline styles between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers,</b> nor were there any differences in discipline styles of parents of children with an easy temperament compared to parents of children with a difficult temperament...|$|R

Russell's design was based on Pixar animator Peter Sohn. Docter auditioned 400 boys in a nationwide casting call for the part.

Docter realized Nagai behaved and spoke non-stop like Russell and chose him for the part. Nagai {{was eight years old}} when cast. Docter encouraged Nagai to act physically as well as vocally when recording the role, lifting him upside down and tickling him for the scene where Russell encounters Kevin. Asian Americans have positively noted Pixar's first casting of an Asian lead character, in contrast to the common practice of casting non-Asians in Asian parts.|$|E

5|$|Myrrha {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as developing from a girl into {{a woman in the}} course of the story: in the beginning she is a virgin refusing her suitors, in that way denying the part of herself that is normally dedicated to Aphrodite. The goddess then strikes her with desire to make love with her father and Myrrha is then made into a woman in the grip of an uncontrollable lust. The marriage between her <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> is then set as an obstacle for her love along with incest being forbidden by the laws, profane as well as divine. The way the daughter seduces her father illustrates the most extreme version a seduction can take: the union between two persons who by social norms and laws are strictly held apart.|$|E
40|$|In this {{longitudinal}} study, two {{research questions}} were examined. First, differences in parenting behaviour between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> were studied. <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> were each (separately) observed {{with their two}} children, aged 2 and 4 years, in three structured situations: one puzzle task and two game tasks. Three parenting dimensions were coded: overinvolvement, rejection, <b>and</b> challenging behaviour. <b>Fathers</b> showed more challenging behaviour towards their youngest child than <b>mothers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> showed more overinvolvement towards this child. <b>Fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> {{did not differ significantly}} in these parenting behaviours towards their oldest child. Rejection appeared not usable. The second research question was whether the effect of parenting behaviour on subsequent social anxiety of the children differed between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers.</b> Social anxiety was measured on two occasions by observing the child's response to a stranger. Regression analyses revealed no predictive relations of early social anxiety and of paternal and maternal overinvolvement to subsequent social anxiety of the oldest child. However, mother's challenging behaviour predicted more subsequent social anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>father's</b> challenging behaviour predicted less subsequent social anxiety of the oldest child. For the youngest child, maternal and paternal parenting behaviour did not predict subsequent social anxiety, but early social anxiety marginally predicted later social anxiety, in both parental models. The findings suggest that <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> may play different roles in the development and prevention of social anxiety in their children, and that fathers' role deserves special attention...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{understand}} the parents’ household decision-making process with respect to allowing girls {{to drop out of}} school, an area that has, thus far, been overlooked in the research regarding school dropouts. This paper has examined the household decision-making process between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>and</b> explores how their respective levels of participation affect on the educational outcome for girls. Data were collected in September 2010 from questionnaires administered to the parents of female students in the sub-district of Pirgonj in Bangladesh. The individual participation index (PI) of both the <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> the <b>mothers</b> was estimated for four major household matters, and the bargaining level of <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> was measured by comparing the participation indices. Logistic regression was then conducted to examine how the participation levels of <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> predicted dropout outcomes for girls. The results show that mothers had less bargaining power than fathers in the decision-making process as the mean for the mother’s participation index is found to be “rarely”, while the father’s index is found to be “very often” when using a 5 -point Likert-typescale. In the logistic regression model, the participation levels of <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> indicate diverse effects on dropout outcomes in which the father’s participation positively predicts the dropout outcome for girls <b>and</b> the <b>mother’s</b> participation negatively predicts the dropout outcome for girls...|$|R

As a college dropout, Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel. Even though these were low-paying jobs, Hinde was able to support himself because he had inherited large land holdings from his father.|$|E
5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his <b>father</b> <b>and</b> <b>mother</b> were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the son could also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E

40|$|The prodromal {{symptoms}} of schizophrenia are nonspecific and include social withdrawal, sleeplessness, decreased desire, {{and loss of}} concentration. Schizophrenia outcomes might be improved if greater therapeutic effort was focused on people with prodromal symptoms. To hasten help-seeking for schizophrenia, we developed a schizophrenia education program for families of patients. Help-seeking and schizophrenia attitudes and knowledge were analyzed among Japanese parents (666 <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> 613 <b>mothers)</b> {{of high school students}} by using the Social Distance Scale-Japanese version, the Link Devaluation-Discrimination Measure and our own questions on help-seeking and schizophrenia knowledge. Statistical analysis included cross-tabulation, the χ 2 test, and multiple regression analysis. Most (97. 5 %) fathers were aged 40 - 59 years; most (78. 3 %) mothers were aged 40 - 49 years. There was a significant difference between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> in basic knowledge of schizophrenia (P 0. 05). When asked what treatment they would seek for a child with sleeplessness or social withdrawal, <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> significantly differed in seeking help medical care at a department of psychosomatic medicine (P differed between <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> (P = 0. 001). In an analysis of parental response to a child with sleepiness and social withdrawal, multiple regression analysis revealed that <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers</b> significantly differed in the likelihood of seeking help at a department of psychosomatic medicine and from a school nurse and in the likelihood of not seeking help (P < 0. 05, P = 0. 001 and P = 0. 001, respectively). In conclusion, help-seeking behavior differed between Japanese <b>fathers</b> <b>and</b> <b>mothers.</b> These findings should assist in developing schizophrenia education programs that aim to hasten intervention. </span...|$|R
