25|$|Just as Æthelred {{was being}} crowned, the Danish King Gormsson {{was trying to}} force Christianity onto his domain. Many of his {{subjects}} did not like this idea, and shortly before 988, Swein, his son, drove his father from the kingdom. The rebels, dispossessed at home, probably formed the first waves of raids on the English coast. The rebels <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> in their raiding that the Danish kings decided {{to take over the}} campaign themselves.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{radio station}} WBUR-FM in Boston {{scheduled}} {{a panel of}} local car mechanics to discuss car repairs on one of its programs, but only Tom Magliozzi showed up.

The brothers were soon asked to host their own radio show on WBUR, which they continued to do every week. In 1986, NPR decided to distribute their show nationally.|$|E
25|$|Reviewers {{have found}} that his book vividly {{demonstrated}} the full and complex humanity of Africans {{as much as the}} inhumanity of slavery. The book was considered an exemplary work of English literature by a new African author. Equiano <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> in sales that he achieved independence from his benefactors. He travelled extensively throughout England, Scotland, and Ireland promoting the book. He worked to improve economic, social and educational conditions in Africa. Specifically, he became involved in working in Sierra Leone, a colony founded in 1792 for freed slaves by Britain in West Africa.|$|E

25|$|In 1888, {{a summer}} as wet as 1887 had been dry, Lohmann took full {{advantage}} of the dreadful pitches on which most matches were played, taking 209 wickets for only 10.90 each (including 143 in 14 county matches). In the three Tests against Australia, Briggs, Bobby Peel and Billy Barnes <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that Lohmann had to do little bowling at the Oval and Old Trafford. However, he took eight wickets at Lord's and made his only Test fifty at the Oval. In 1889, Lohmann again took over 200 wickets (115 for 1485 runs in purely county matches) and took nine wickets in an innings for the first time against Sussex.|$|E
25|$|While {{operating}} the barber shops {{out of the}} hotel, Young sold hair care products made in his own kitchen to customers. Demand became so great that he opened a manufacturing company in 1933. The hotel also prospered, as {{it was one of}} the only hotels in the city to serve black travelers. The company <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that by the end of World War II, Young's hair products were sold at locations around the state, including a pharmacy in Clarksdale and a barber shop in Cleveland. Later, he opened a second manufacturing site for his products in Chicago, a major destination in the 20th-century Great Migration for many African Americans from Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|He {{originally}} {{joined the}} Surrey staff as a medium-paced bowler. In a minor match in 1923 he kept wicket when the regular wicketkeeper was injured, and <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that {{he concentrated on}} his keeping from then on. When Strudwick retired after the 1927 season, Brooks succeeded him as the regular first team keeper, having already played in some matches from 1925 to 1927 when Strudwick was injured or away playing for England. He was notably acrobatic behind the stumps and kept particularly well to fast bowling. That he was regarded highly as a keeper is indicated {{by the fact that}} he played four times for the Players against the Gentlemen between 1931 and 1935. He took six catches in an innings against Kent at Blackheath in 1935, which equalled the Surrey record.|$|E

25|$|The Hotel Northern wasn't {{the only}} {{business}} making a fortune from railway construction. At least four brothels {{were built in}} South Fort George during this era and one Madam, Irene Jordan, <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that she decided to expand her business into Central Fort George and built a large house there, the first two-piano brothel in Northern British Columbia. However, {{it turned out that}} Central Fort George did not want a brothel in their town and it was shut down by Police Chief Dunwoody. But the story would not end there. Undeterred, Miss Jordan had the new brothel skidded over to where the Prince George townsite was being built and the house was later rented by Prince George's first mayor, WG Gillette, to be the Prince George City Hall. Another public outcry erupted and the local newspaper editors had a grand time making jokes and drawing cartoons about this arrangement, until the mayor and the city council moved out into a new City Hall.|$|E
25|$|Disappointed by the {{acceptance}} {{on the part}} of the King, Alfonso XIII, of the coup d'état by General Miguel Primo de Rivera on 13 September 1923, Alcalá-Zamora did not collaborate with the new regime. After the departure of the dictator in 1930, he declared himself a republican in a meeting that took place on 13 April in the Apolo theatre of Valencia. He was one of the instigators of the Pact of San Sebastián. The failure of the military uprising (Revolt of Jaca) in Aragon of that same year sent him to prison, as a member of the revolutionary committee, but he left jail after the municipal elections of 12 April 1931. In these elections, although the monarchist candidates won more overall votes than the republicans did, the republicans <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> in the provincial cities that Alfonso soon abandoned power. Without waiting for a fresh election, Alcalá-Zamora put himself at the head of a revolutionary provisional government, becoming the 122nd Prime Minister, which occupied the ministries in Madrid on 14 April and which proclaimed the Second Spanish Republic.|$|E
25|$|In June 1863, he was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General. Lee was discouraged from taking a field command by Davis, but encouraged by his father. Lee asked his father for a field command, but his father replied that his highest duty was obedience to his superiors. For the most part, he obeyed Davis, but during the Battle of Gettysburg, Lee was given the command of the troops in Richmond. In 1864, Lee was placed in command of Richmond's local defenses against General Grant and General Benjamin Butler. He <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that he was given command of Richmond's eastern defenses at Chaffin's Bluff. Lee remained at Chaffin's Bluff throughout the next months, and in 1864, he {{was promoted}} to Major General. Shortly {{before the end of the}} war, he commanded troops in the field and was captured at Sayler's Creek; three days before his father surrendered on Palm Sunday April 9, 1865 to Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at the McLean House in the village of Appomattox Court House, Virginia (see: Appomattox Court House National Historical Park).|$|E

500|$|On May 9, Rentería {{was called}} up to the Marlins {{following}} an injury to shortstop Kurt Abbott. His first game came on May 10, in a 4–2 win over the Colorado Rockies, {{when he entered the}} game in the ninth inning as part of a double switch. He did not have any at bats in that game, though, and he was just a backup infielder when he first came up because Alex Arias had replaced Abbott as the everyday shortstop. However, Rentería replaced Arias as the starting shortstop on May 19 against the Chicago Cubs. He got his first hit (a single) in his first at bat (against Steve Trachsel) in a 3–2 Marlins victory. He got four hits in a game {{for the first time on}} June 10 in a 5–2 win over the Montreal Expos. His first home run came the next day, off Ugueth Urbina of the Expos, in a 3–2 loss. Rentería <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> as a shortstop that the Marlins moved Abbott over to second base when he came off the disabled list. On June 23, Rentería strained a hamstring on a groundout in the sixth inning of a 5–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was placed on the disabled list the next day, but he remained the starting shortstop when he returned on July 11. From July 25 to August 16 he had a 22-game hitting streak, which was the longest for a rookie since Jerome Walton of the Chicago Cubs had a thirty-game streak in [...] Rentería finished the season with a [...]309 batting average, 68 runs scored, and sixteen stolen bases in 106 games. He was second behind Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth in National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award balloting.|$|E

2500|$|The match {{garnered}} mainstream {{attention from}} media outlets such as ESPN and USA Today. UFC President Dana White credited Shamrock for the show's success. White said, [...] "the reason we <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> on UFC 40 {{was because of}} Ken Shamrock {{and the fact that}} everyone knew who he was." [...] Shamrock nearly scored a knockout early in round 1, buckling Ortiz's knees with a punch and dropping him to one knee. However, Ortiz recovered shortly after and went on to dominate the fight with takedowns and ground-and-pound. Right before Round 4 started, Shamrock's cornerman threw in the towel and Ortiz successfully defended the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Howe, {{working with}} Dorothea Dix, also {{brought about the}} {{establishment}} of the Massachusetts School for Idiot and Feeble-Minded Youth, the Western Hemisphere’s oldest publicly funded institution serving the mentally disabled. He founded the school in 1848 with a $2,500 appropriation from the Massachusetts Legislature. [...] "Idiot" [...] was at that time considered a polite term for individuals with mental and intellectual disabilities. Dr. Howe was successful in his attempt to educate the mentally disabled, but this led to other problems. Some commentators argued that the disabled <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> in schools such as Howe's that they should permanently reside there. Dr. Howe was opposed to this, arguing that the mentally disabled had rights and that segregating them from the rest of society would be detrimental.|$|E
