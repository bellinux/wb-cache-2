She {{was friendly}} with Bodger, {{but not enough}} for him to let her know about Badger. She was briefly the acting Headmistress after Mrs Trout was sent back to Teacher Training School, but returned to her old post when Mrs Bogart took over as Headmistress. As a teacher she was incompetent - she never made the children do any work and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> them play games all day when she was acting Headmistress.|$|E

'Alone in My Room' was also the name given to Skin's first solo tour in two years, which commenced in Berlin in November 2005. For this album she shaved her head bald again, returning to the look she had in her Skunk Anansie days.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, {{while on}} {{vacation}} from film production (Wagons East!) in Durango City, Mexico, Candy called his friends, including Canadian Football League commissioner Larry Smith, {{and told them}} that he had <b>just</b> <b>let</b> go of his team and was putting it up for sale. He then called his assistant, who invited Candy to play golf with him in the spring when he returned to Toronto. After cooking a late lasagna dinner for his assistants, Candy called his co-stars from his hotel, then went to sleep. Some time after midnight, on March 4, 1994, Candy was found dead from a presumed myocardial infarction even though this was unproven as no autopsy was performed. He was 43. The heavyset Candy had struggled for some years with weight-related health issues.|$|E

25|$|I get {{the tune}} and then I {{just keep on}} singing the tune until the words come out from the tune. It's kind of a {{hypnotic}} state that you reach after a while when you keep on playing it where words just evolve from it. So you take those words and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya know, and I started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to <b>just</b> <b>let</b> go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I {{remember}} being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E

500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They <b>just</b> <b>let</b> me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've got to let me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to <b>just</b> <b>let</b> it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Let's</b> <b>Just</b> Be is {{the sixth}} studio album by Joseph Arthur, {{and his first}} with his backing band The Lonely Astronauts. The album was {{released}} on April 17, 2007 in the US, and on September 3, 2007 in the UK. According to Arthur: [...] "the philosophy of the whole record {{was sort of a}} letting go, that's why I called it <b>Let's</b> <b>Just</b> Be, because it was like everything about that record from a Zen-like approach. <b>Just</b> <b>letting</b> things be how they are." ...|$|R

500|$|There {{was this}} one time where I {{had to take a}} blind lady across the street and I’d never done that before. I took her hand which is so {{obviously}} wrong!

"Fionna and Cake" [...] was {{particularly}} successful with the {{fans of the}} series; according to Entertainment Examiner, after the episode aired, [...] "fans of the series loved the new interpretation and clamored for more Fionna and Cake".

500|$|The {{concept of}} 'loving well' was further {{developed}} when the band made {{a trip to}} the Dominican Republic and were inspired by the resilient spirits of people living in poverty on the island. When the band started to write the songs for the album, they joined the character of 'Mr. Lovewell' and the concept of 'loving well', creating the overall message of love that is present in the album. Millard stated the band's dream for the album was [...] "to inspire others to ‘pay it forward’ to the cross.

500|$|Davis {{later said}} [...] "Jim Wong [...] {{was a big}} help, too. A lot of the stage {{directions}} point toward farce, but Jim told me to play against that and <b>just</b> <b>let</b> the situation play out. The Forrest Gump scene was difficult, too. When I prepared it and did it the first time, I was almost Shakespearean in my approach. Jim made me toss it off more, and it worked fine". Chris Owens who portrayed the Young Smoking Man spent time watching how Davis smokes to ensure {{that he did it}} just like him. Owens later appeared as a young version of The Smoking Man again in the episode [...] "Demons", and as his son Jeffrey Spender.|$|E
500|$|During the {{creation}} of [...] God of War, the game's director David Jaffe attempted to create a version of Kratos that looked brutal but had a different appearance from what {{is considered to be}} the traditional Greek hero.

Jaffe said of his final version of the character, that while [...] " [...] may not totally feel at home in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does <b>just</b> <b>let</b> them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E

5000|$|On the Jamie Isaac remix, Michael Cragg of The Guardian {{stated that}} Jamie Isaac [...] "strips the song {{back to its}} bare bones while is augmenting the central beat by simple handclaps, adds in his own backing vocals, tweaks {{everything}} {{to make it seem}} oddly sinister and <b>just</b> <b>lets</b> it all simmer gently." ...|$|R

500|$|René Angélil, Dion, and the Sony family began {{selecting}} prospective songs at {{the beginning}} of 2001, and on 28 August 2001 she started recording vocal tracks for nearly two dozen songs at Montreal's Piccolo Studios.

However, it was first released in Australia, on 22 March 2002.|$|E
500|$|Wright's main {{influence}} was jazz, particularly Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He never considered himself a typical songwriter, preferring to create whole albums of {{music with a}} theme, later saying [...] "if {{the words came out}} like the music, and we didn't have anything else to do, then quite a few would be written". A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I <b>just</b> <b>let</b> it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E
500|$|... "Telephone" [...] was {{originally}} written by Gaga for singer Britney Spears's sixth studio album, Circus, but Spears rejected it. Later, Gaga recorded the song as a collaboration with Beyoncé for The Fame Monster. Gaga said, [...] "I wrote {{it for her}} [...] {{a long time ago}} and she just didn't use it for her album. It's fine because I love the song and I get to perform it now." [...] Spears' demo for the song leaked in May 2010. Additionally, the guest vocalist {{was originally}} going to be Spears, but ultimately Gaga made Beyoncé the featured vocalist instead. The main inspiration behind the song was Gaga's fear of suffocation as she felt that she seldom found time to <b>just</b> <b>let</b> loose and have fun.|$|E
500|$|Furtado has {{described}} the album as [...] "more urban, more American, more hip-hop, [...] more simplified" [...] than her earlier work, which she said was more layered and textured because she [...] "tend to overthink things".
