In this study, the virgin biomass obtained from hingan shell is used as the feedstock for gasifier to generate producer gas. The gasifier-engine system is operated on diesel and on esters of vegetable oil of hingan in liquid fuel mode operation and then on liquid fuel and producer gas combination in <b>dual</b> fuel <b>mode</b> operation. The performance and emission characteristics of the CI engine is analyzed by running the engine in liquid fuel mode operation and in <b>dual</b> fuel <b>mode</b> operation at different load conditions with respect to maximum diesel savings in the <b>dual</b> fuel <b>mode</b> operation. It was observed that specific energy consumption in the <b>dual</b> fuel <b>mode</b> of operation is found to be in the higher side at all load conditions. The brake thermal efficiency of the engine using diesel or hingan oil methyl ester (HOME) is higher than that of <b>dual</b> fuel <b>mode</b> operation. A diesel replacement in the tune of 60 % in <b>dual</b> fuel <b>mode</b> is possible with the use of hingan shell producer gas. The emissions parameters such CO, HC, NOx, CO 2 and smoke are higher in the case of <b>dual</b> fuel <b>mode</b> of operation as compared to that of liquid fuel mode.

2500|$|Cyproterone acetate was {{developed}} to overcome this problem. It is formed by adding an acetate group to cyproterone, see figure 3. Cyproterone acetate has a <b>dual</b> <b>mode</b> of action as it competes directly with DHT for binding to AR, but also inhibits gonadotropin secretion. It thereby reduces androgen, estrogen and LH levels. Cyproterone acetate acts both directly as an antiandrogen in prostate cancer cells and also functions to indirectly decrease serum testosterone levels. The latter causes the limitations of cyproterone acetate, which are central effects on androgen secretion, with subsequent loss of libido and sexual potency. Several reports also state that cyproterone acetate causes liver hyperplasia. These side effects gave pharmaceutical companies the incentive to search for alternative, [...] "pure" [...] NSAAs {{that would not have}} these side effects. [...] Pure antiandrogens block the androgen receptor without exerting any agonistic or any other hormonal activity.|$|E

[...] NASA previously funded a Lockheed Martin study that found speeds up to Mach 7 could be achieved with a dual-mode engine combining turbine and ramjet technologies. [...] The problem with hypersonic propulsion {{has always been the}} gap between the highest speed capabilities of a turbojet, from around Mach 2.2 to the lowest speed of a ramjet at Mach 4. Typical turbine engines cannot achieve high enough speeds for a ramjet to take over and continue accelerating. [...] The NASA-Lockheed Martin study is looking at the possibility of a higher-speed turbine engine or a ramjet that can function in a turbine engine's slower flight envelope; the DARPA HTV-3X had demonstrated a low-speed ramjet that could operate below Mach 3. [...] Existing turbofan engines powering jet fighters and other experimental designs are being considered for modification. [...] If the study is successful, NASA will fund a demonstrator to test the DMRJ in a flight research vehicle.|$|E

In April 2011, the RAF's Assistant Chief of the Air Staff Air Vice-Marshal Baz North {{reported}} that the missiles were [...] "being sought by both the United States of America and the French" [...] {{in the light of}} Brimstone's success in Libya. France's DGA procurement agency held meetings in late May 2011 to discuss a lightweight air-to-surface weapon for the Dassault Rafale; Stéphane Reb of the DGA would merely say that [...] "Brimstone is a solution, but it's not the only option". In early 2014 the US Congress' House Armed Services Committee showed interest again in the missile; high-ranking members of the US armed services have stated they [...] "like it" [...] and if they do choose it they [...] "need it out soon". The French Air Force were still thinking about a purchase in March 2012, with a prime consideration being lower collateral damage compared to the AASM. India has made a request for information about integrating Brimstone on their Sukhoi Su-30MKI fleet. MBDA hopes that firings conducted in the U.S., intended for the U.K. to test the feasibility of arming British General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper UAVs with the missile, will persuade the U.S. military to purchase the Brimstone 2. In July 2014, it was revealed that the United States Navy was beginning environmental and integration analysis of the <b>Dual</b> <b>Mode</b> Brimstone for use on the Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. The United States Army also considered the Brimstone as [...] "an option" [...] in its Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) program, but selected Lockheed Martin's dual-mode seeker upgrade for the Hellfire missile. In September 2015, MBDA displayed the dual-mode Brimstone {{for the first time as}} a helicopter-mounted weapon to fulfill the British Army Air Corps' need for a future attack helicopter weapon for the AgustaWestland Apache. In January 2016, it was reported that Germany was considering arming its newly leased Heron TPs with Brimstone.
