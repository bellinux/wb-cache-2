40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} porcine <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extracts</b> on human <b>pancreatic</b> secretion. Ten male volunteers were intubated with a 4 -lumen jejunal tube to collect gastric and duodenal secretions separately via {{the first and third}} tube, to infuse PEG 4000 distal the pylorus via the second tube and to apply porcine <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extracts</b> via the fourth tube distal the ligament of Treitz. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>extracts</b> were given four times at 40 minute intervals; the first two as active enzymes and subsequently as heat denatured proportions. Secretin was continuously infused intravenously (0. 5 E/kg bw/h) to achieve minimal pancreatic flow. Lipase, amylase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, volume, and bicarbonate were measured in duodenal contents in eight pooled 15 minute fractions. Three subjects who received HEPES-Ringer buffer instead of pancreatic enzymes served as controls. Plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) was measured using a sensitive bioassay. Both active and heat denatured <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extracts</b> caused a small but significant increase in amylase and chymotrypsin secretion. Basal plasma CCK values were 0. 85 (0. 05) pM. After intrajejunal instillation of either active or heat denatured <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extracts</b> plasma CCK rose to 3. 25 (0. 30) pM and to 3. 28 (0. 36) pM respectively. In a second group of five volunteers, plasma CCK concentrations were measured after a test meal. On day 1, volunteers received a liquid fat and protein rich meal and on day 2, the same test meal containing porcine <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extracts.</b> In both cases, a similar increase in plasma CCK was observed. We conclude that therapy with <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extracts</b> stimulate <b>pancreatic</b> enzyme secretion. This may be mediated through release of CCK...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cell-therapy {{provides}} a promising alternative {{for the treatment}} of type 1 diabetes. Monocytes which have a reprogramming or differentiation potential and are more available than any other types of stem cells, have been recognized as candidates for such investigations. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the differentiation potential of rat peripheral blood monocytes into insulin-producing cells by the use of rat <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extract</b> (2 days after a 60 % pancreatectomy). Methods: Rat peripheral blood monocytes were isolated and cultured. Adherent monocytes were induced to differentiate into programmable cells in RPMI supplemented by 10 % FCS, &beta;-mercaptoetanol, M-CSF and IL- 3 for six days. The dedifferentiated cells were analyzed by invert microscopy. Cultures of Programmable Cells of Monocytic Origin (PCMOs) were continued in RPMI, containing 10 % FBS, <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extract</b> and 5 mmol/L glucose for 15 days. The medium was replaced every three days. At the end of the protocol, insulin and c-peptide excreted by the differentiated cells were tested by radioimmunoassay on days 6, 14, and 21. In order to verify insulin production in the cells, dithizone-staining, which is a method for insulin identification, was employed. Results: The results showed that the cells cultured in rat <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extract</b> secreted insulin and c-peptide relative to the control group. Dithizone-staining was positive in the aforesaid cells (P&lt; 0 / 05). Conclusion: The results of the current study showed that <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extract</b> treatment can differentiate rat peripheral blood monocytes into insulin-producing cells which can be regarded as a potential source {{for the treatment of}} diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Previous {{work from}} our {{laboratory}} {{has demonstrated that}} frog urotensin-II (UII), at a high concentration, inhibits glucose-induced insulin release in the rat pancreas. We have investigated the effect of rat UII and two structural analogs on insulin secretion and searched {{for the presence of}} UII-immunoreactivity in rat <b>pancreatic</b> <b>extracts.</b> Methods: The study was performed in the perfused rat pancreas. UII as well as its analogs were synthesized by solid phase methodology. <b>Pancreatic</b> <b>extracts</b> were analyzed for UII by reversed-phase HPLC combined with a sensitive UII RIA. Results: Infusion of synthetic rat UII inhibited glucose-induced insulin release in a dose-dependent manner (IC 50 : 0. 12 nmol/l). UII (1 nmol/l) also inhibited the insulin responses induced by carbachol, glucagon-like peptide- 1, and a calcium channel agonist (BAY K 8644). The inhibitory effect of UII was mimicked by the potent G protein-coupled receptor (GPR 14) agonist [3 -iodo-Tyr 6]UII(4 – 11). In contrast, [Ala 8]UII(4 – 11), a UII analog devoid of contractile activity on rat aortic rings, did not affect glucose-induced insulin secretion.

40|$|Enzymes {{from various}} animal sources {{responsible}} for amylolytic activity {{as measured by}} a precise viscosimetric method have been investigated with regard to individual characteristics in relation to enzyme source.

40|$|Exocrine {{pancreatic}} insufficiency {{caused by}} chronic pancreatitis results from various factors which regulate digestion and absorption of nutrients.

Fat malabsorption also results in a deficit of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) with consequent clinical manifestations.
