Following {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union and Boris Yeltsin's subsequent market reforms, many Russians viewed the Brezhnev era with nostalgia; they missed the stability of that era which had subsequently been lost during the Gorbachev and Yeltsin eras.|$|E
5|$|Belle's yellow ballgown was {{inspired}} by a similar costume Hepburn had worn in the film Roman Holiday (1953). Hahn and a team of male filmmakers designed the ballgown while consuming pizza and alcohol. Originally, the marketing department ordered that Belles' dress be pink to cater to the female audience, but art director Brian McEntee convinced studio to make the dress gold in order to make her to distinguish her from other Disney Princess, specifically Aurora's from Sleeping Beauty (1950). Art director Brian McEntee suggested that Belle be the only character in her village to wear blue in order emphasize {{the fact that she is}} different and an outcast. The colors Belle wears also mimic her emotions, blue being associated with sadness and loneliness. Blue was also used to symbolize <b>good,</b> <b>while</b> Gaston's red represented evil. According to the Directory of World Cinema: American Hollywood by Lincoln Geraghty, Belle {{was inspired}} by actress Judy Garland's role as Dorothy Gale in The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Julie Andrews' performance as Maria von Trapp in The Sound of Music (1965).|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{monitoring}} and improvement the river is divided into several catchment management areas; South of Malmesbury, Bristol Avon Rural and Bristol Avon Urban. In the rural area 22 water bodies are classified as good, 46 as moderated and 8 as poor. The main reasons for not achieving good scores are pollution from waste water, agriculture and rural land management. In the urban area one water body is rated <b>good,</b> <b>while</b> 12 are rated moderate and one is poor. The pollution from upstream is added to by the effects of industry, manufacturing and other businesses and is significantly affected by physical modifications to the water course. Within the catchment area there are 137 river water bodies and 6 lakes; of these 22 percent of rivers are rated as good ecological status, 40 percent good for chemical status and 31 percent good for biological status.|$|E

5|$|In {{creating}} original music, Shimomura {{wanted to}} create compositions that would make players feel <b>good</b> <b>while</b> playing to accompany the action aspect of Kingdom Hearts. She played the game and looked over scripts and illustrations for inspiration. After coming up with ideas, she discussed them with director Tetsuya Nomura and the game planners. For the PlayStation 2 re-release of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, she and her team spent {{much of their time}} working on the fight music; Shimomura wanted the different fight music to reflect different emotions such as happiness and sadness. To handle the large workload for Kingdom Hearts coded, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days and Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, Shimomura composed the most prominent themes, while the rest was created by other composers. In retrospect, Shimomura has stated that the Kingdom Hearts series combined the scenes and music well, and she felt very honored her music has entered into people's hearts. She has also commented that she enjoyed working on the project, despite its hardships, and is proud of the work.|$|E
5|$|Adventures of Mana is {{a remake}} of the 1991 Game Boy game Final Fantasy Adventure, {{which was the first}} entry in the Mana series. It is the second remake of Final Fantasy Adventure, the first being the Game Boy Advance game Sword of Mana, which had removed the {{connections}} to the Final Fantasy series in favor of being more connected {{to the rest of the}} Mana series. According to Adventures of Manas producer, Masaru Oyamada, the development team focused on not upsetting what had made the original game <b>good,</b> <b>while</b> adding things that had not been possible to do in the original version due to hardware limitations; they also aimed to make the game more comfortable and intuitive to play: for instance, switching armor and weapons and using items and magic was made easier, and shortcut commands were added. The game borrows some elements from the original Game Boy version, and some from Sword of Mana. For example, the first remake introduced the ability to play as the heroine, but Adventures of Mana, like the original, only has a male playable character; conversely Adventures of Manas battle system, user interface and sword attack are based on Sword of Manas rather than the original's. Kenji Ito, the composer for Final Fantasy Adventure, returned to create updated and more dramatic rearrangements for the remake.|$|E
5|$|At the Magic Box, Giles {{recognizes that}} he must stand aside if Buffy is to face her {{responsibilities}} in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds {{a picture of the}} forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own <b>good,</b> <b>while</b> Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} of benefits from adaptation and mitigation policies {{are different in}} terms of damages avoided (Toth et al., 2001:653).

She uses the theme of the outsider finding his (or her) place in society and how individuals interact with The Other. A number of Cherryh's novels focus on military and political themes. One underlying theme of her work is an exploration of gender roles. Her characters reveal both strengths and weaknesses regardless of their gender, although her female protagonists are portrayed as especially capable and determined, and many of her male characters are portrayed as damaged, abused, or otherwise vulnerable.|$|E

25|$|Rum {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the early 1700s as a trading item, and quickly became an inelastic <b>good.</b> <b>While</b> Native Americans were {{for the most part}} acted conservatively in trading deals, they consumed a surplus of alcohol. Traders used rum to help form partnerships. Rum had a significant effect on the social behavior of Native Americans. Under the influence of rum, the younger generation did not obey the elders of the tribe, and became involved with more skirmishes with other tribes and white settlers. Rum also disrupted the amount of time the younger generation of males spent on labor. Alcohol was one of the goods provided on credit, and led to a debt trap for many Native Americans. Native Americans {{did not know how to}} distill alcohol, and thus were driven to trade for it.|$|E

25|$|On 3 July 1980, Vysotsky gave a {{performance}} at a suburban Moscow concert hall. One {{of the stage}} managers recalls that he looked visibly unhealthy ("gray-faced", as she puts it) and complained of not feeling too <b>good,</b> <b>while</b> another says she was surprised by his request for champagne {{before the start of}} the show, as he had always been known for completely abstaining from drink before his concerts. On 16 July Vysotsky gave his last public concert in Kaliningrad. On 18 July, Vysotsky played Hamlet for the last time at the Taganka Theatre. From around 21 July, several of his close friends were on a round-the-clock watch at his apartment, carefully monitoring his alcohol intake and hoping against all odds that his drug dependency would soon be overcome and they would then be able to bring him back from the brink. The effects of drug withdrawal were clearly getting the better of him, as he got increasingly restless, moaned and screamed in pain, and at times fell into memory lapses, failing to recognize at first some of his visitors, including his son Arkadiy. At one point, Vysostsky's personal physician A. Fedotov (the same doctor who had brought him back from clinical death a year earlier in Uzbekistan) attempted to sedate him, inadvertently causing an asphyxiation from which he was barely saved. On 24 July, Vysotsky told his mother that he thought he was going to die that day, and then made similar remarks to a few of the friends present at the apartment, who begged him to stop such talk and keep his spirits up. But soon thereafter, Oksana Afanasyeva saw him clench his chest several times, which led her to suspect that he was genuinely suffering from a cardiovascular condition. She informed Fedotov of this, but was told not to worry, as he was going to monitor Vysotsky's condition all night. In the evening, after drinking relatively small amounts of alcohol, the moaning and groaning Vysotsky was sedated by Fedotov, who then sat down on the couch next to him but fell asleep. Fedotov awoke in the early hours of 25 July to an unusual silence, and found Vysotsky dead in his bed with his eyes wide open, apparently of a myocardial infarction, as he later certified. This was contradicted by Fedotov's colleagues, Sklifosovsky Emergency Medical Institute physicians L. Sul'povar and S. Scherbakov (who had demanded the actor's instant hospitalization on 23 July, but were, allegedly, defied by Fedotov), who insisted that Fedotov's incompetent sedation combined with alcohol was what killed Vysotsky. An autopsy was prevented by Vysotsky's parents (who were eager to have their son's drug addiction remain secret), so the true cause of death remains unknown.|$|E
