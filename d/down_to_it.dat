25|$|The Nantucketer, {{he alone}} resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> in ships; {{to and fro}} {{ploughing}} it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there lies his buisiness, which a Noah's flood would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; {{so that when he}} comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers often {{praised the}} game's {{graphical}} style and presentation, while criticising the gameplay. GamePro {{called it a}} [...] "rejuvenating, jaw-dropping experience". IGN said [...] "XIII has a great story-driven sheen, but at its core, it's weighed down by some occasional bewildering flaws, {{in addition to the}} lackluster weapons and simple combat". GameZone also criticised the combat, stating [...] "If not for the graphics to carry the game through, XIII would have been a boring game. Gunfights are {{the best part of the}} gameplay. It also happens to be the most unbalanced part". Edge said XIII had [...] "true artistic merit: it never gets stale; every episode has been drawn with minute care and attention. It would have been an incredible achievement if the gameplay had matched the outstanding art direction". GameSpy criticised the graphics and the multiplayer mode, and concluded [...] "When it comes right <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> XIII is a fine game...Just don't expect the FPS of the year because, sadly, this isn't it".|$|E

It's really about {{the integrity of the}} group, the dignity of the group." [...] Owen later admitted the group was exhausted after twenty years of nonstop touring and recording, and [...] "everybody needed some time." [...] The tour collected $15 million in box office before it even began, and Alabama performed to packed arenas from June to November 2003. Due to [...] "extraordinary fan response and overwhelming ticket demand," [...] the tour was extended for an additional 30 shows, running between February and June 2004. The group performed their [...] "final" [...] show in October 2004 in Bismarck, North Dakota, with Herndon jokingly declaring [...] "I need a job" [...] as the concert closed.|$|E

Sales of the title were higher than anticipated, {{resulting}} in several stores in Japan being sold out within two weeks of its release. The game had sold 47,000 units by November 2009. In North America, NPD Group reported that the game had sold 35,000 units during its first month of release. In a feature on notable video games in 2009, GamesTM stated that The Demon Blade sold [...] "extremely well", besting established Western franchise releases such as [...] Ignition Entertainment, the game's North American publisher, confirmed that the September sales for The Demon Blade had fallen within the NPD Group's estimates, and had met their sales expectations. In a 2010 interview, publisher Marvelous Entertainment stated that, despite positive reception from both critics and players, Muramasa: The Demon Blade had suffered from low sales in Japan, North America and Europe. This was put <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> being a non-traditional game and the falling relevance of the Wii hardware.|$|E

500|$|The Colonial Garden, {{designed}} by landscape architect Samuel Parsons, started construction in 1902 {{and opened the}} following June. Besides plants, the garden had rustic wooden bridges and wooden stairs and a [...] "handsome fountain and central court." [...] A [...] "Shakespeare Garden" [...] was also opened that year, with a grand stairway leading <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> The next year, park officials realized that the Colonial Garden's construction was of poor quality and hard to cultivate. The garden had to be raised , and a nursery needed to be built to transport the plants during the garden's reconstruction. The rustic wooden bridges were to be replaced with stone bridges, while the wooden stairs were to be superseded by stone stairs. Not only did many plants die during the process, but the actual rebuilding was delayed until 1911. Two years later, the Parks Commissioner for the Bronx refused to allocate reconstruction funds because, he stated, the garden looked just fine. Under threat of tearing the garden down, the city had to find money to fill and drain the ground. The rebuilding contract was awarded in 1909 and completed by 1911.|$|E
500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. I would never do an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E
500|$|In revisiting {{the film}} in the 1970s, Arthur Schlesinger noted that Hollywood films {{generally}} age well, revealing an unexpected depth or integrity, {{but in the case}} of Gone with the Wind time has not treated it kindly. Richard Schickel posits that one measure of a film's quality is to ask what you can remember of it, and the film falls down in this regard: unforgettable imagery and dialogue are simply not present. Stanley Kauffmann, likewise, also found the film to be a largely forgettable experience, claiming he could only remember two scenes vividly. Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> being [...] "badly written", in turn describing the dialogue as [...] "flowery" [...] and possessing a [...] "picture postcard" [...] sensibility. Schickel also believes the film fails as popular art, in that it has limited rewatch value—a sentiment that Kauffmann also concurs with, stating that having watched it twice he hopes [...] "never to see it again: twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs". Both Schickel and Andrew Sarris identify the film's main failing is in possessing a producer's sensibility rather than an artistic one: having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being [...] "created" [...] or [...] "directed", but rather having emerged [...] "steaming from the crowded kitchen", where the main creative force was a producer's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible.|$|E

500|$|The next National Woman’s Rights Convention met in Cincinnati on October 17 and 18, 1855. It {{was here}} that Stone {{delivered}} impromptu remarks that became famous as her [...] "disappointment" [...] speech. When a heckler interrupted the proceedings, calling female speakers [...] "a few disappointed women," [...] Stone retorted that yes, she was indeed a [...] "disappointed woman." [...] "In education, in marriage, in religion, in everything, disappointment is the lot of woman. It shall be the business {{of my life to}} deepen this disappointment in every woman's heart until she bows <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> no longer." [...] The convention adopted Stone’s resolution calling for the circulation of petitions and saying it was “the duty of women in their respective States to ask the legislators for the elective franchise.” Following the convention, suffrage petitioning took place in the New England states, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Nebraska, with resultant legislative hearings or action in Nebraska and Wisconsin. Amelia Bloomer, recently moved to Iowa near the Nebraska border, took up the work in that area, while the Indiana Woman’s Rights Society, at least one of whose officers was at the Cincinnati convention, directed the work in Indiana. Stone had helped launch the New York campaign at a state woman’s rights convention in Saratoga Springs in August, and at the Cleveland convention recruited workers for it, {{as well as for the}} work in Illinois, Michigan and Ohio. Stone took charge of the work in Ohio, her new home state, drafting its petition, placing it in Ohio newspapers and circulating it during lectures across southern Ohio while her recruit worked in the northern part of the state. Stone also lectured in Illinois and Indiana in support of the petition drives there and personally introduced the work in Wisconsin, where she found volunteers to circulate the petition and legislators to introduce them in both houses of the legislature.|$|E

2500|$|Until the 19th century Folkestone {{remained}} a small fishing {{community with a}} seafront that was continually battered by storms and encroaching shingle that {{made it hard to}} land boats. In 1807 an Act of Parliament was passed to build a pier and harbour which was built by Thomas Telford in 1809. By 1820 a harbour area of [...] had been enclosed. Folkestone's trade and population grew slightly but development was still hampered by sand and silt from the Pent Stream. The Folkestone Harbour Company invested heavily in removing the silt but with little success. In 1842 the company became bankrupt and the Government put the derelict harbour up for sale. It was bought by the South Eastern Railway Company (SER), which was then building the London to Dover railway line. George Turnbull was responsible in 1844 for building the Horn pier. Dredging the harbour, and the construction of a rail route <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> began almost immediately, and the town soon became the SER’s principal packet station for the Continental traffic to Boulogne.|$|E

I imagined creepy black and white laboratories where glass vials and tubes bubbled with menacing liquids. I pictured a dark night where clouds slowly moved past a full moon.
