5|$|Qiao Weiyue {{also built}} five double slipways (lit. dams) between Anbei and Huaishi (or, the quays on the Huai waterfront). Each of these had ten lanes for the barges to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> Their cargoes of {{imperial}} tax-grain were heavy, {{and as they}} were passing over they often came to grief and were damaged or wrecked, with loss of the grain and peculation by a cabal of the workers in league with local bandits hidden nearby. Qiao Weiyue therefore first ordered the construction of two gates at the third dam along the West River (near Huaiyin). The distance between the two gates was rather more than 50 paces (250ft) and the whole space was covered over with a great roof like a shed. The gates were 'hanging gates'; (when they were closed) the water accumulated like a tide until the required level was reached, {{and then when the}} time came it was allowed to flow out. He also built a horizontal bridge to protect their foundations. After this was done (to all the double slipways) the previous corruption was completely eliminated, and the passage of the boats went on without the slightest impediment.|$|E
25|$|The strangeness flavour {{quantum number}} S (not to be {{confused}} with spin) was noticed to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d, and one other quark, and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets (for example, ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called symmetric, as they would all behave {{in exactly the same way}} with respect to the strong interaction. Since quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be broken.|$|E

500|$|In an {{electricity}} {{system without}} grid energy storage, generation from stored fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear) must be <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> {{in reaction to}} {{the rise and fall of}} solar electricity (see load following power plant). [...] While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can quickly follow solar being intermittent due to the weather, coal, biomass and nuclear plants usually take considerable time to respond to load and can only be scheduled to follow the predictable variation. [...] Depending on local circumstances, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected intermittent sources like solar tend to require investment in some combination of grid interconnections, energy storage or demand side management. Integrating large amounts of solar power with existing generation equipment has caused issues in some cases. For example, in Germany, California and Hawaii, electricity prices have been known to go negative when solar is generating a lot of power, displacing existing baseload generation contracts.|$|E

500|$|All six WindSeekers {{consist of}} the same parts in an {{identical}} structure. The [...] center tower {{is made up of}} eight parts. The base section is different from the other seven tower pieces because it supports the rest of the tower. On top of the eighth tower piece, there is a steel platform where workers and mechanics can observe the operation of the ride and perform maintenance. Above this platform is an element called the [...] "red UFO" [...] or the [...] "Crown". The gondola itself has a number of parts. In the middle of the structure there are wheels that allow the swings to rotate as they <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the tower. The gondola is raised and lowered by cables linking the gondola structure to four sets of yellow wheels, each attached to a different section of the steel platform {{at the top of the}} tower.

500|$|The {{envelope}} {{that held}} the hydrogen gas of Myers' torpedo airship was made of red and yellow silk. One of its trips was a distance of 600 miles and it ran at an average speed of 12 miles an hour. It was powered forward by a propeller that spun at 5,000 revolutions per minute. The caloric engine that drove the propeller was a spontaneous combustion engine [...] "fed" [...] with nitroglycerin semi-translucent fuel pellets. This type of airship could hold up to 10 passengers {{or a combination of}} freight and crewmen. Myers' [...] "torpedo" [...] airships were built later in larger versions. Some were entered in airship contests and one was demonstrated at the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904. It was 74 feet long and 21 feet in diameter. It contained 14,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas and would lift 900 pounds of weight. Myers made several successful experimental test flights at his Frankfort [...] "balloon farm" [...] before delivering it to a Mr. Benbow, the purchaser. After that it was referred to as the Benbow airship. The airship had four 10 horse-power gasoline motors that ran propellers of 4 blades each. The four propellers could be manipulated in most any direction so the operator could steer the airship sideways right and left, <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> and forward and backwards as desired.|$|E

Early signs of CHD include a reluctance to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> stairs or to jump; difficulty rising or lying down; and bunny hopping when running [...] both hind limbs move together. CHD is among the principal orthopedic diseases in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog; it is rarely severe and crippling.
