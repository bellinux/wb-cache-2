5000|$|In 1964, Hibben {{relocated}} to Sandy, Utah {{to become a}} full-time knifemaker. His blades were primarily 440C stainless steel and Hibben was the first knife maker to use that steel in his knives. [...] While in Sandy, Hibben partnered with another knifemaker named Stuart Benedict and these knives were sold under the name [...] "Ben-Hibben". [...] The knives from this time period were fixed-blade Bowie <b>knives,</b> hunting <b>knives,</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>knives</b> and some early fighting knives.|$|R
5|$|Many {{products}} were specially manufactured {{to commemorate the}} event. Saris, <b>fish</b> <b>knives,</b> betel-leaf boxes and other memorabilia with Elokeshi's name printed or inscribed on them were made. A balm for headache was advertised as using the oil made by the mahant in the jail oil press. Such commemorative items were still in sale in as late as 1894. These items were unique {{in the sense that}} they were the only such commemorative items modelled on an event.|$|R

500|$|On 30 November 2006, Wallwork was {{attacked}} {{while on a}} night out with his girlfriend Amy Broadbent at the Sugar Lounge night club in Manchester. He was approached by a former boyfriend of Broadbent, Robert Rimmer, who asked him to leave. When Wallwork refused to do so, Rimmer used a <b>fish</b> <b>knife</b> to stab the footballer seven times in the hand, back and stomach. After being rushed to hospital, Wallwork's condition {{was said to be}} stable and his injuries were not thought to be life-threatening. Police investigating the stabbing described the attack as [...] "not random". They later named 20-year-old Rimmer as the suspect and appealed for him to contact them. Rimmer handed himself into a police station in Manchester and was arrested on 7 December. In December 2007, Rimmer, from Gorton, Manchester, was jailed for five-and-a-half years for stabbing Wallwork after admitting wounding with intent at Manchester Crown Court. Rimmer's friend, Charles Ebbrell, a 27-year-old from Denton, Greater Manchester, was given a suspended jail sentence after he admitted punching Wallwork during the attack. Wallwork was released from hospital on 10 December 2006, the same day that Barnsley and West Bromwich Albion faced each other in a league game; Barnsley supporters displayed a [...] "Get well soon Ronnie" [...] banner during the match. After returning to light training in late January, Wallwork made his comeback from the stabbing on 21 February 2007, playing the full 90 minutes in a West Bromwich Albion reserve team game against Walsall.|$|E

60|$|Charterson {{struck her}} as looking larger, but then {{whenever}} she saw him he {{struck her as}} looking larger. He enveloped her hand in a large amiable paw {{for a minute and}} asked after the children with gusto. The large teeth beneath his discursive moustache gave him the effect of a perennial smile to which his asymmetrical ears added a touch of waggery. He always betrayed a fatherly feeling towards her as became a man who was married to a handsome wife old enough to be her mother. Even when he asked about the children he did it with something of the amused knowingness of assured seniority, as if indeed he knew all sorts of things about the children that she couldn't as yet even begin to imagine. And though he confined his serious conversation to the two other men, he would ever and again show himself mindful of her and throw her some friendly enquiry, some quizzically puzzling remark. Blenker as usual treated {{her as if she were}} an only very indistinctly visible presence to whom an effusive yet inattentive politeness was due. He was clearly nervous almost to the pitch of jumpiness. He knew he was to be spoken to about the sugar business directly he saw Charterson, and he hated being spoken to about the sugar business. He had his code of honour. Of course one had to make concessions to one's proprietors, but he could not help feeling that if only they would consent to see his really quite obvious gentlemanliness more clearly it would be better for the paper, better for the party, better for them, far better for himself. He wasn't altogether a fool about that sugar; he knew how things lay. They ought to trust him more. His nervousness betrayed itself in many little ways. He crumbled his bread constantly until, thanks to Snagsby's assiduous replacement, he had made quite a pile of crumbs, he dropped his glasses in the soup--a fine occasion for Snagsby's sang-froid--and he forgot not to use a <b>fish</b> <b>knife</b> with the fish as Lady Grove directs and tried when he discovered his error to replace it furtively on the table cloth. Moreover he kept on patting the glasses on his nose--after Snagsby had whisked his soup plate away, rescued, wiped and returned them to him--until that feature glowed modestly at such excesses of attention, and the soup and sauces and things bothered his fine blond moustache unusually. So that Mr. Blenker what with the glasses, the napkin, the food and the things seemed as restless as a young sparrow. Lady Harman did her duties as hostess in the quiet key of her sombre dress, and until the conversation drew her out into unexpected questionings she answered rather than talked, and she did not look at her husband once throughout the meal.|$|E
50|$|Cooper {{began making}} utility knives and butcher knives in Tremont, Pennsylvania in 1924 {{while working as}} a welder. Eventually he moved on to welding in the Virginia shipyards and began making hunting <b>knives,</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>knives</b> and combat knives as a second business. Cooper's knives were made by the stock removal method and he {{attached}} his handles using traditional methods such as rivets and pins until 1965 when he retired from welding and relocated to Burbank, California as a full-time knifemaker with his nephew, Greorge Cooper as Cooper Knives.|$|R
50|$|In a photograph, {{taken in}} 1929, Scott appears in her MLAC uniform {{surrounded}} by the fruits of her athletic career: at least six medals, four trophies, and other prizes including a tea set.

5000|$|A {{soup spoon}} {{is a type}} of spoon with a large or rounded bowl, used for {{consuming}} soup. The term can either refer to the British soup spoon or the Chinese spoon. Round bowled soup spoons were a Victorian invention.
