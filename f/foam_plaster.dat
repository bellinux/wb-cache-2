5000|$|The {{interior}} of the crashed alien spacecraft was created by production designer Sean Haworth. To design the ship, Haworth had to recreate what little was shown of the spacecraft in the Carpenter film, then [...] "fill the gaps" [...] for what was not originally shown. Haworth {{and a team of}} approximately twelve others then created the inside of the ship as a several story-high interior set constructed mostly out of a combination of <b>foam,</b> <b>plaster,</b> fiberglass, and plywood. The ship was designed specifically to look as if it were not made to accommodate humans, but rather alien creatures of different size and shape who could walk on any surface. A section of the craft called the [...] "pod room" [...] was designed to imply the alien creatures manning it had collected specimens of different alien species from around the universe for a zoological expedition.|$|E

Casting from those moulds are characterizedby high dimensional accuracy, very good shape pattering and small surface roughness. However, a drawback of the plaster mould is very low permeability. A substational improvement of this parametr may be achived through physical or phisico-chemical treatment of the plaster slurry or prepared mould. The most advantageous results {{can be obtained by}} foaming the slurry. The investigatious comprised evaluation of the influence of mixing parametrs (mixer type, rotation and mixing time, settings the mixer in mixing device) and the content of a foaming agent on the degree of <b>foaming</b> of the <b>plaster.</b> The tests were carried out using the α-plaster Hartform-H 1 and Alkanol XC as a foaming agent. The structure of a slurry produced after foaming is non-homogeous. Therefore, the investigations were completed by making appropriate of this process. Analysis of the results leads to the conclusion, that the <b>foamed</b> <b>plaster</b> Hartform_H 1 reaches the top degree of foaming at the following parameters: the water/plaster ratio W/G= 0. 55, the content of Alkanol XC a= 0. 07 %, stirring with a perforate disc mixer at the rotation speed nm= 4000 rpm during τm= 30 s. In turn the top homogeneity of the <b>foamed</b> <b>plaster</b> slurry can be achieved at the rotation speed nu= 1400 rpm during τu= 30 s., while other parameters are the same as in the foaming process. The obtained results can provide the basis for the elaboration of the industry procedures useful in the production of the plaster moulds for precision casting...|$|R

A cylinder made of foamed gypsum is indented in-situ in an X-ray lab tomograph with a sphere of millimeter radius. The reported experiments show that <b>foamed</b> <b>plaster</b> displays a sharp transition between an undamaged state (with linear elastic behavior) and a compacted state with collapsed porosity under the indenter. Tomographic acquisitions of the sample under load associated with a global version of Digital Volume Correlation allow displacement elds to be measured at dierent load levels.

40|$|Plaster moulds used in {{precision}} foundry {{are characterized}} by a very low permeability which, {{in the case of}} classic plaster moulds, equals to about 0, 01 ÷ 0, 02 m 2 /(MPa·s). One of the most effective methods for increasing the permeability is a foaming treatment. Another characteristic feature of plaster is its very good insulating power which has influence on the process of solidification and cooling of a cast and also on a knock-out property. This insulating power is a function of thermophysical properties of plaster which, in turn, depend mainly on the mineralogical composition of the mould material, its bulk density {{as well as on the}} temperature of the pouring alloy. In the case of a <b>foamed</b> <b>plaster</b> mould an increase of the degree of foaming increases its porosity which causes a change in its thermophysical properties, thereby increasing susceptibility of the mass to overheating. The susceptibility of the plaster layer surrounding the cast to overheating is favorable because it makes it easier to knock-out of the cast by immersing the hot mould in cold water. Thermal and phase tensions that are created during this process cause fast destruction of plaster. This paper describes our investigations aimed at the determination of the dependence of the mould temperature field on the time of the cast stay in the mould, as recorded in a process of an unsteady heat flow. The determined data were planned to be used for estimation of the technological properties of the plaster mould. The tests were carried out using the plaster α-Supraduro and Alkanol XC (foaming agent). The test mould had a diameter of Ø 120 mm with centrally situated mould cavity of Ø 30 mm. Plaster moulds with a degree of foaming 20; 32, 5 and 45 % and comparatively from non-foaming plaster were tested and their temperatures were measured at the distance x= 2; 9; 21; 25; 27; 30 mm from the mould cavity within 25 min. Analysis of the results leads to the conclusion, that the highest effectiveness of heating and overheating of a mould made of a <b>foamed</b> <b>plaster</b> occurs at the degree of the <b>plaster</b> <b>foaming</b> equal to SS= 45 %. The results obtained can provide the basis for the elaboration of the best plaster mould properties, and thus to increase the technology effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The plaster {{moulding}} process {{is commonly used}} for casting prototypes of aluminium components designed for subsequent production by die casting. Plaster moulded prototype castings possess dimensional tolerances and surface quality comparable to die castings, but vithout the high tooling costs and lead times. &fortunately, the mechanical properties of plaster castings are significantly inferior to their die cast counterparts. This is due pri-marily to the low thermal conductivity of plaster which extends casting solidijication time signijicantly compared to die or even sand casting processes. Long solidification times result in large grained castings demonstrating low strength and hardness. This work is an experimental investigation into the effects of various levels of silica sand and carbonfibre additions on the properties of <b>foaming</b> <b>plaster</b> moulds and associated aluminium castings. Data and statistical analyses are presented and conclusions drawn regarding the wet and dry strength of plaster moulds {{as a function of}} sand and carbon fibre content. Likewise, conclusions regarding the associated casting characteristics such as surface jinish, solid$cation time, hardness and tensile strength are presented. The eflec-tiveness of silica sand and carbon fibre additions with respect to improving the properties of plaster moulded prototype castings is also discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceLightweight {{plasterboard}} is {{a product}} composed of <b>plaster</b> <b>foam</b> core whose porosity can reach 75 vol%, lined with two sheets of paper. To optimize the trade-o between thermal resistance and mechanical strength, {{it is important to}} understand and characterize the mechanical behavior of plasterboard. Core compaction of plasterboard is one of the prevalent degradation mechanism. This mechanism is studied herein using in-situ indentation experiments performed at two dierent scales. The rst test was carried out in a lab tomograph. The second test was conducted on the high resolution synchrotron ID 19 beamline at ESRF. Very early damage is revealed. The basic mechanism of pore collapse and its gradual development is detected in contrast with mesoscale observations where compaction appears very abrupt...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} focus on enhanced thermal resistance of building components and as a consequence, the relative importance of airtightness on the overall energy losses of buildings has increased significantly. The construction industry requires practical information on the airtightness of individual construction elements and building envelope interfaces. A literature review on the airtightness of window-wall interfaces has shown that no experimental data are available for masonry construction. This paper offers an investigative study on the airtightness of window-wall interfaces of masonry walls, for 13 different installation methods. The results show that the selected solutions cover a wide range of airtightness levels, from 0 m³/h. m up to 31 m³/h. m at 50 Pa. The experiments have permitted determining that a very good performance can be obtained by using polyurethane foam and caulking, airtight membranes, polyurethane foam and plywood framing, and plaster and caulking. On the contrary, mineral fibre insulation, a partial fill with polyurethane <b>foam</b> and <b>plaster</b> without caulking should be avoided when good airtightness is required. Furthermore, a comprehensive methodology for error calculation is offered, based on error propagation of partially correlated parameters, including the effect of measurement errors, extraneous air leakage and conversion to standard boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the report is to {{investigate}} {{the ability of the}} Fluent 6. 3 k-ε Realizable turbulence model with standard wall functions to model the flow around the front wing of Cal Poly’s 2008 Formula SAE car. The three primary areas of interest are ground effects, the wing wheel interaction, and the wing tip vortices. Fluent was successful at modeling the increase suction from the ground effects, and the upwash due to the wing tip vortices. The results also displayed how the high pressure region in front of the tire propagates forward and interacts with the pressure distribution around the wing. However, Fluent did not predict any separation on the wing in front of the tire, which should be present due to the high pressure region. An experimental wing with pressure taps to record the CP distributions around the wing was created and mounted to the car for a track test to validate the computational results. The test has been saved for future work due to mechanical issues with the engine, preventing the Formula SAE team from running the car. The manufacturing process for the wing is also documented, because the Formula SAE team has never made a test wing with pressure ports before. Additionally instead of using traditional <b>foam</b> molds, <b>plaster</b> molds were created for the lay-up in an effort to reduce lead time. The plaster molds took more time to prepare than the foam ones. However time could be saved, because the aerodynamics sub team didn’t {{have to wait for the}} CNC router and a technician to cut the mold. The quality and surface finish of the final part was acceptable for a race wing...|$|R

However, corsets are tailored to the individual’s body, the exact distances and action between {{the patient and the}} corset are not known. The raw piece is fabricated on the body’s exact model, which is made in at least three steps. First, the upper body of a patient set in a predefined posture is plastered, then after drying the plaster is removed. The second step is the preparation of the torso’s model that is made of plastic <b>foam</b> covered with <b>plaster.</b> After that the corset is formed according to the desired objectives, namely the orthopaedic technician forms the corset on the torso model and makes the necessary adjustments to achieve the desired spine compensation. The corset is then fitted on the patient and eventually minor corrections are made.
