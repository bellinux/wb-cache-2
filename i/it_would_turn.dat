5|$|If built, {{the light}} rail would have as its western {{terminus}} a maintenance facility across Highway 82 from the airport. It {{would include a}} stop at Buttermilk and parallel the highway, using the old Maroon Creek Bridge, until it reached Monarch Street downtown. There <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> south to its eastern terminus at Rubey Park. If there is not sufficient support or funding for the light rail, it could be built as bus lanes at first.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the British Empire and Commonwealth Games {{were held}} in Cardiff. The event was (to date) the biggest {{sporting}} event ever held in Wales; however, {{it would not have}} been possible without the financial support given by the WRU and the Cardiff Athletic Club. Both the opening and closing ceremonies took place at Cardiff Arms Park, plus all the track and field events, on what had been the greyhound track. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> out to be the last time that South Africa would participate in the Games until 1994. South Africa withdrew from the Commonwealth Games in 1961.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 10 was renumbered to Route 5. Plans {{at the time}} were to build a new {{alignment}} from east of Ridgefield to Little Ferry southeast of Hackensack and form Route S5 (now Route 93) along the old road from Little Ferry to Ridgefield. The new Route 6 would share the alignment of Route 5 from Paterson to west of Hackensack, where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> southeast onto a new alignment to Little Ferry, then run with Route 5 again to east of Ridgefield and split onto its own alignment to the George Washington Bridge.|$|E

50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} single track, constructed with 36-pound rails. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> run on Chester Avenue, until 24th Street. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> then, <b>turn</b> east for one block. The line <b>would</b> then <b>turn</b> north again, on K Street. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> continue north and terminate at the Southern Pacific railroad tracks.|$|R
5|$|Written by Lewis Greifer, {{this story}} was {{commissioned}} in July 1974. The story would involve museum keepers being chased out of the British Museum by a mummy. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> out that a group was scaring people away {{in order to gain}} access to a sarcophagus which would contain wild rice from thousands of years ago. The group wanted to use the rice to seed Mars and make a fortune. It was replaced by Robert Holmes' Pyramids of Mars when Griefer fell ill and the scripts came in late and were not what the production team wanted.|$|E
5|$|A line {{running along}} Manhattan's West Side, {{stretching}} {{from the edge of}} the city at Yonkers to 14th Street. It would be a two-track line south to Dyckman Street, a three-track line to 162nd Street, and then-on it would be a four-track line. The line would have two southern branches that would diverge at 14th Street. A connection to the BMT Canarsie Line would use a pair of the tracks, while the other pair would go to Atlantic Avenue and Hicks Street in Brooklyn through an East River tunnel. Then <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> down to Red Hook. There would also be a loop at Battery Park. Another branch would be built; it would consist of two tracks, and would go between 162nd Street and 190th Street via Amsterdam Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Having made {{landfall}} {{in southwestern}} Florida, Dottie quickly proceeded northeastward before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean. High pressure {{building to the}} north of the storm indicated <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> more towards the west, but it moved nearly due northward. The cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) at 0600 UTC on August 20 and subsequently began to weaken; by the time Dottie made landfall in Charleston, South Carolina later that evening, it was barely of tropical storm intensity. It deteriorated into a tropical depression on August 21 and dissipated shortly thereafter. The remnant low pressure system turned southward and once again entered the Atlantic before turning westward and crossing the Florida peninsula.|$|E
50|$|Carlotism found strong {{resistance}} from many parties involved: the viceroys, other Spanish {{authorities in the}} Americas, part of the Criollos, and the British. The plans were never applied, and supporters of <b>it</b> <b>would</b> later <b>turn</b> to independence.|$|R
50|$|Caspary felt so {{strongly}} about the film's distorted message that she later wrote another screenplay {{based on her}} novel {{in the hope that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>turned</b> into a U.S. film, a project which was never realized.|$|R
25|$|The CAF {{had been}} {{actively}} {{searching for a}} B-29 for their use. Through Vic Agather they had an agreement that should one be found that was owned by the government but not in use, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>turned</b> over to the CAF.|$|R
5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|MacFarlane {{notes that}} he was {{surprised}} {{they were allowed to}} do the pickle gag, which consisted of Stewie placing a cucumber on the sofa where Patrick's imaginary wife is sitting, but inserting it into her imaginary vagina (to see if <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> into a pickle), but suggests that maybe broadcasting standards did not fully understand the scene. The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E
5|$|The Senators would {{defeat the}} {{eventual}} Stanley Cup champion Canadiens 5–3 that night, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> {{out to be}} their only highlight of the season for the Senators. The club would tie with the San Jose Sharks for the worst record in the League that year, winning just ten games with 70 losses and four ties (24 points) in the 1992–93 season. The Senators still hold the NHL record for least road wins for their record that season, with one. Their points total for the season was one point better than the NHL record for least points in a season ever. The Senators had aimed low. Firestone had set beating the old record the Senators' goal for the season, as the team planned to finish low in the standings for its first few years {{in order to receive}} high draft picks.|$|E
50|$|The Hades Army (Hadesu Gundan) are {{the primary}} antagonists of the first series. Having devastated Planet Riser, the Hades Army turned its {{attention}} to Earth. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> only <b>turn</b> out that the Hades Army is actually {{a branch of the}} Daruga Imperial Army.|$|R
50|$|Sir Walter Scott remarked, {{with respect}} to the {{destruction}} of this 'great glory of the Roman remains in Scotland,' that, had not the worthy proprietor thought fit to demolish <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>turned</b> the heads of half the antiquaries in Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|The car of Kevin Harvick was {{so tight}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>turn</b> at about 100 miles per hour. After {{inspecting}} the car, {{it was determined}} that the cause was the engine rubbing against the tires, but Harvick will not go to a backup car.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} folk tales about the Sumatran rhino were {{collected}} by colonial naturalists and hunters from the mid-19th century to early 20th century. In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that {{the best time to}} hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and {{could be used as a}} sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|Willkie {{maintained}} {{his interest in}} politics, and was a delegate to the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Since the incumbent Republican president, Herbert Hoover, was widely blamed for the Depression that had followed the stock market crash, the nominee would {{have a good chance}} of becoming president. The major candidates were Smith (the 1928 nominee), Smith's successor as New York's governor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Speaker of the House John Nance Garner, and former Secretary of War Newton D. Baker sought the nomination. Willkie backed Baker, and was an assistant floor manager for his campaign. With a two-thirds majority needed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination, Willkie and others tried to deadlock the convention in the hope that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> to Baker. Roosevelt was willing to swing his votes to Baker in the event of a stalemate, but this did not occur, as Governor Roosevelt gained the nomination on the fourth ballot. Willkie, although disappointed, backed Roosevelt, and donated $150 to his successful campaign.|$|E
5000|$|Interview Time - Guests interviewed {{included}} Death, an atom, and G-spot & Orgasm. Sometimes {{they would}} announce a famous person {{that was going}} to be interviewed, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> always <b>turn</b> out that the guest was unable to attend (unless the guest was in fact an inanimate object).|$|R
25|$|In 1964, the IOC {{endorsed}} {{the addition of}} volleyball to the Olympic program. By this time, the number of national federations affiliated to the FIVB had grown to 89. Later in that year (1969), a new international event, the World Cup was introduced. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> be <b>turned</b> into a qualifying event for the Olympic Games in 1991.|$|R
50|$|Chaff {{was invented}} {{independently}} by Britain, Germany and Japan, {{but was not}} used early on, owing to mutual fears that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> be <b>turned</b> against the inventor. It was not used until 24-25 July 1943 and the Operation Gomorrah raids against Hamburg. Despite having been known in Germany since 1940, no countermeasures had yet been developed against it.|$|R
5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, the line's junction with the IND Crosstown Line in Long Island City {{would have been}} a T-junction, allowing trains from Manhattan to travel south to Brooklyn via the Crosstown line. A map from June of that year shows a proposed alternate routing for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would have had the line turn via Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing via Queens Boulevard. After proceeding via Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned via Hillside Avenue. The map also shows a two-track line continuing from the Van Wyck Boulevard station to 94th Avenue (Atlantic Avenue) in Richmond Hill via Van Wyck Boulevard (today's Van Wyck Expressway). During construction only bellmouths were built for the line, however they were eventually used for the IND Archer Avenue Line. As documented by the map, the Queens Boulevard Line, as originally planned, would have had the express trains travel on a more direct route, via Broadway and Queens Boulevard, while the local trains would take a less direct route hitting larger population centers. There were to be two such instances, however only one was actually completed. The first one, which was not constructed, would have gone through Winfield (now Woodside), west of the existing Elmhurst Avenue station, and the local tracks would have diverged, continuing via Queens Broadway before turning onto 69th Street (Fisk Avenue), rejoining the express tracks at Broadway in Woodside. The second instance, the one that was built, was planned to have the local tracks continue via Broadway west of the 65th Street station, and then <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> south via Steinway Street before rejoining the express tracks at the 36th Street station. The express tracks here would take the more direct route, via Northern Boulevard.|$|E
25|$|As <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> out, {{this would}} be the Patriots only playoff loss at Foxboro Stadium. They would not lose another home playoff game again until 31 years later, seven years after Gillette Stadium opened.|$|E
25|$|As a {{possible}} alternative to subway construction, engineer F. H. Behr proposed a monorail system for Brooklyn. Each car was proposed to carry 80 to 120 passengers and attain {{a speed of}} 100 miles per hour. An application was filed with the Board of Alderman for franchises for four routes, with the first running to South Brooklyn. It would have run from the intersection of Flatbush Avenue and Atlantic Avenue and down Fourth Avenue to 85th or 86th Streets, where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> eastward to Stillwell Avenue, where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> onto West 12th Street and continue to a terminal loop at Coney Island.|$|E
5000|$|Weill {{abruptly}} dismissed Plumeri in August 1994. Plumeri noted: [...] "I was {{so intent}} on getting the job done, that I eliminated the input of other people. If I'd done better at nurturing relationships, who knows how <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>turned</b> out?" [...] Weill made Plumeri a Vice Chairman of Travelers Group Inc. almost immediately thereafter.|$|R
50|$|N. Reed {{has shown}} {{how to find}} the area bounded by a cycloid by using Cavalieri's principle. A circle of radius r can roll in a {{clockwise}} direction upon a line below it, or in a counterclockwise direction upon a line above it. A point on the circle thereby traces out two cycloids. When the circle has rolled any particular distance, the angle through which <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>turned</b> clockwise and that through which <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>turned</b> counterclockwise are the same. The two points tracing the cycloids are therefore at equal heights. The line through them is therefore horizontal (i.e. parallel to the two lines on which the circle rolls). Consequently each horizontal cross-section of the circle has the same length as the corresponding horizontal cross-section of the region bounded by the two arcs of cyloids. By Cavalieri's principle, the circle therefore has the same area as that region.|$|R
5|$|Hamels {{would stay}} a Phillie when {{he agreed to}} a {{contract}} extension on July 24. The six-year, $144 million contract was the second-largest contract ever signed by a pitcher. The deal included a vesting option for 2019 worth $24 million. If the option didn't vest, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> have <b>turned</b> into a club option for $20 million that included a $6 million buyout.|$|R

25|$|The study {{described}} a routing that would begin in Queens near the New York City Housing Authority's Astoria Houses. It would run down 21st Street south to Queensboro Plaza, west onto 11th Street to Newtown Creek. The streetcar would cross Newtown Creek into Greenpoint then, using one-way streets {{close to the}} waterfront, pass through Williamsburg and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> onto Park Avenue, run to Navy Street, then through Farragut Houses, Vinegar Hill, and Dumbo. The line would then run south through Red Hook, cross the Gowanus Canal, and continue south on Third Avenue to 58th Street, where <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>turn</b> west to serve the Brooklyn Army Terminal and Industry City. From there, the line would turn east, terminating at the 59th Street subway station in Sunset Park.|$|E
