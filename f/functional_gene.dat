5|$|Mutation bias {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully <b>functional</b> <b>gene.</b> Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation bias towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation bias, and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation bias, rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation bias than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation bias leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E
25|$|Gene {{expression}} {{is the process}} by which information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> product. These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as transfer RNA (tRNA) or small nuclear RNA (snRNA) genes, the product is a functional RNA.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{performing}} a cycle of directed evolution is the generation of a library of variant genes. The sequence space for random sequence is vast (10130 possible sequences for a 100 amino acid protein) and extremely sparsely populated by functional proteins. Neither experimental, nor natural evolution can ever get close to sampling so many sequences. Of course, natural evolution samples variant sequences close to functional protein sequences and this is imitated in DE by mutagenising an already <b>functional</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E
40|$|The fast {{development}} of {{next generation sequencing}} (NGS) has dramatically increased the application of metagenomics in various aspects. Functional annotation is a major step in the metagenomics studies. Fast annotation of <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> has been a challenge because of the deluge of NGS data and expanding databases. A hybrid annotation pipeline proposed previously for taxonomic assignments was evaluated in this study for metagenomic sequences annotation of specific <b>functional</b> <b>genes,</b> such as antibiotic resistance genes, arsenic resistance genes and key genes in nitrogen metabolism. The hybrid approach using UBLAST and BLASTX is 44 – 177 times faster than direct BLASTX in the annotation using the small protein database for the specific <b>functional</b> <b>genes,</b> {{with the cost of}} missing a small portion (, 1. 8 %) of target sequences compared with direct BLASTX hits. Different from direct BLASTX, the time required for specific <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> annotation using the hybrid annotation pipeline depends on the abundance for the target genes. Thus this hybrid annotation pipeline is more suitable in specific <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> annotation than in comprehensive <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> annotation...|$|R
40|$|Constructed and estuarine wetlands, {{influenced}} by wastewater treatment plants, were investigated, {{with respect to}} microbial activity in terms of <b>functional</b> <b>genes.</b> The density and abundance of three denitrifying genes coding for nitrate (narG), nitrite (nirS), and nitrous oxide (nosZ) reductases, in sediment soil samples from wastewater effluent-fed and estuarine wetlands, were quantified using the SYBR green-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). To assess seasonal effects (i. e., winter (average temperature similar to 2 degrees C) versus spring (average temperature similar to 20 degrees C)), the densities of denitrifying genes, {{with respect to the}} abundance of <b>functional</b> <b>genes,</b> for the two different wetlands were determined. The three <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> for all the sampling sites ranged from 1. 0 x 10 (6) to 1. 0 x 10 (9) copies/g of soil. Without considering seasonal variation, the nitrite-reducing <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> were dominant over the other two genes in the effluent-fed wetland samples. However, nitrate and nitrite-reducing <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> were dominant in relatively cold and warm seasons, respectively, in the estuarine wetland samples. Even though robust patterns and conclusions could not be obtained from the limited investigations, patterns with certain trends and needs for potential future research directions were obtained.

25|$|Gene therapy {{involves}} supplying a <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> to cells lacking that function, {{with the}} aim of correcting a genetic disorder or acquired disease. Gene therapy can be broadly divided into two categories. The first is alteration of germ cells, that is, sperm or eggs, which results in a permanent genetic change for the whole organism and subsequent generations. This “germ line gene therapy” is {{considered by many to be}} unethical in human beings. The second type of gene therapy, “somatic cell gene therapy”, is analogous to an organ transplant. In this case, one or more specific tissues are targeted by direct treatment or by removal of the tissue, addition of the therapeutic gene or genes in the laboratory, and return of the treated cells to the patient. Clinical trials of somatic cell gene therapy began in the late 1990s, mostly for the treatment of cancers and blood, liver, and lung disorders.|$|E

First, 46 <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> involved in microbial responses to environmental stresses such as changes to temperature, osmolarity, oxidative status, nutrient limitation, or general stress response were selected and curated. A total of 22, 855 probes were designed, covering 79, 628 coding sequences from 985 bacterial, 76 archaeal, and 59 eukaryotic species/strains. Probe specificity was computationally verified.

40|$|Biological nitrification/denitrification is {{frequently}} used to remove nitrogen from tannery wastewater containing {{high concentrations of}} ammonia. However, information is limited about the bacterial nitrifiers and denitrifiers and their <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> in tannery wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to the low-throughput of the previously used methods. In this study, 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina high-throughput sequencing, combined with molecular methods, were used to comprehensively characterize structures and functions of nitrification and denitrification bacterial communities in aerobic and anaerobic sludge of two full-scale tannery WWTPs. Pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes showed that Proteobacteria and Synergistetes dominated in the aerobic and anaerobic sludge, respectively. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA gene cloning revealed that Nitrosomonas europaea dominated the ammonia-oxidizing community in the WWTPs. Metagenomic analysis showed that the denitrifiers mainly included the genera of Thauera, Paracoccus, Hyphomicrobium, Comamonas and Azoarcus, which may greatly contribute to the nitrogen removal in the two WWTPs. It is interesting that AOB and ammonia-oxidizing archaea had low abundance although both WWTPs demonstrated high ammonium removal efficiency. Good correlation between the qPCR and metagenomic analysis is observed for the quantification of <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> amoA, nirK, nirS and nosZ, indicating that the metagenomic approach may be a promising method used to comprehensively investigate the abundance of <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the environment...|$|R
