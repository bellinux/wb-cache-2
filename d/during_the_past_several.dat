During the past 11,000years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene.

The report notes that China's lead in the production of rare-earth minerals has accelerated over the past two decades. In 1990, China accounted for only 27% of such minerals. In 2009, world production was 132,000 metric tons; China produced 129,000 of those tons. According to the report, recent patterns suggest that China will slow the export of such materials to the world: [...] "Owing to the increase in domestic demand, the Government has gradually reduced the export quota <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>several</b> years." [...] In 2006, China allowed 47 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 12 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers to export. Controls have since tightened annually; by 2011, only 22 domestic rare-earth producers and traders and 9 Sino-foreign rare-earth producers were authorized. The government's future policies will likely keep in place strict controls: [...] "According to China's draft rare-earth development plan, annual rare-earth production may be limited to between 130,000 and 140,000 [...] during the period from 2009 to 2015.

40|$|Based {{on several}} tens of Ro {{measurements}} made <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decades, <b>several</b> {{studies have been}} performed to derive the best estimate of Ro. Some used just simple averaging to derive a result, whereas others provided comprehensive analyses of possible errors in published results. In either case, detailed statistical analyses of data used were not performed. However, a computation of the best estimates of the Galactic rotation constants {{is not only an}} astronomical but also a metrological task. Here we perform an analysis of 53 Ro measurements (published in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 20 years) to assess the consistency of the data. Our analysis shows that they are internally consistent. It is also shown that any trend in the Ro estimates from the last 20 years is statistically negligible, which renders the presence of a bandwagon effect doubtful. On the other hand, the formal errors in the published Ro estimates improve significantly with time.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} an environmentally driven conceptual framework of Business Model change. Business models acquired substantial momentum in academic literature <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade. <b>Several</b> studies {{focused on what}} exactly constitutes a Business Model (role model, recipe, architecture etc.) triggering a theoretical debate about the Business Model’s components and their corresponding dynamics and relationships. In this paper, we argue that for Business Models as cognitive structures, are highly influenced in terms of relevance by the context of application, which consequently enriches its functionality. As a result, the Business Model can be used either {{as a role model}} (benchmarking) or a recipe (strategy). For that purpose, we assume that the Business Model is embedded within the economic (task) environment, and consequently affected by it. Through a typology of the environmental impact on the Business Model productivity, we introduce a conceptual framework that aims to capture the salient features of Business Model emergent resilience as reaction to two types impact: productivity constraining and disturbin...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) {{is a useful}} noninvasive technique for determining the presence of microvascular obstruction (MVO) and intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH), frequently occurring in patients after reperfused myocardial infarction (MI). MVO, or the so-called no-reflow phenomenon, is associated with adverse ventricular remodeling and a poor prognosis during follow-up. Similarly, IMH is considered a severe damage after revascularization by percutaneous primary coronary intervention (PPCI) or fibrinolysis, which represents a worse prognosis. However, the pathophysiology of IMH is not fully understood and imaging modalities might help to better understand that phenomenon. While, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade, <b>several</b> studies examined the distribution patterns of late gadolinium enhancement with different CMR sequences, the standardized CMR protocol for assessment of IMH is not yet well established. The aim of this review is to evaluate the available literature on this issue, with particular regard to CMR sequences. New techniques, such as positron emission tomography/{{magnetic resonance}} imaging (PET/MRI), could be useful tools to explore molecular mechanisms of the myocardial infarction healing process...|$|R
