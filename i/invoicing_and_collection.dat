40|$|Small {{business}} owners {{often do not}} possess the financial literacy to implement invoice factoring to fund their business. Despite that lack of knowledge, {{an increasing number of}} small {{business owners}} are using invoice factoring as their primary source of funding. Guided by a systems thinking approach, the purpose of this exploratory multiple case study was to understand the effect of invoice factoring of 5 small business owners, 5 small business finance managers, and 5 factoring program managers, all of whom managed factoring programs and technical services companies with less than 3 million in annual revenues. Participants were located in 6 states with data collected through semi-structured Skype and telephone interviews. Data were analyzed according to the Krippendorff method. Member checking and transcript review established trustworthiness and credibility of interpretations. Three themes emerged from interviews: owner eligibility for traditional capital sources, profit margins, and third-party relationships. The small business owners were not eligible for traditional funding options. Factoring administrators and small business owners cited that companies with better profit margins implemented invoice factoring successfully. Finance managers mentioned that factoring companies acted as a third-party to the <b>invoicing</b> <b>and</b> <b>collection</b> processes. Social implications include a contribution to the advancement of small business success rates and to an entrepreneur 2 ̆ 7 s preparation to launch a business venture properly...|$|E

40|$|A {{shortage}} of clean drinking water, {{the lack of}} an adequate sewage system, and rapid environmental degradation from waste dumping have prompted the State of Espirito Santo in Brazil to consider expanding the water supply and sewage disposal system in the region. This paper reports on the finding of a study to appraise the viability of a project to alleviate some of the shortfall in potable water and sewage service in the State. Recommendations are developed for improved investment and operational strategies through an integrated analysis of the financial, economic, distributive and risk aspect of the project. Result of the study indicate that even through the project, in its current state, {{is not likely to be}} financially profitable, it is expected to create significant economic gains for society through the reduction in environmental pollution. Furthermore, improvements in operation and management practices that address the issue of water leakage, <b>invoicing</b> <b>and</b> <b>collections</b> are keys to improving the financial viability, and perhaps ultimately, the economic viability of the system. A particular challenge provided by the study has been the measurement of intangible environmental benefit and their inclusion in the projects analysis of discounted net economic benefits. Without the measure of these benefits the overall economic value produced by this project would be seriously understated. Brazil, water, sewage, environmental, investment, contingent valuation...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{efficiently}} and effectively manage research resources {{is an area}} of growing concern to both grantor agencies and grantee institutions. Central administration of core facilities is one way to address some of those concerns, but managing the needs of disparate cores can be a challenge. All research core facilities, irrespective of their emphasis, {{need to be able to}} contract for services, bill for those services and provide documentation of facility use. While commercial systems are a welcome recent development, most concentrate on sample management data, LIMS, with <b>invoicing</b> <b>and</b> utilization metrics as secondary functions. The shortcoming in these types of offerings is that they do not readily capture the institution's or grantor agencies' needs for use reporting without considerable customization and corresponding associated costs. We have chosen to create a web based tool that can facilitate the scheduling/contracting of services, <b>invoicing</b> <b>and</b> fee <b>collection</b> for those services, and address the complex reporting needs of the institution...|$|R

40|$|We {{have studied}} CRM in a service provider's {{perspective}} {{on behalf of}} Ericsson Microwave Systems AB. The question at issue we decided to investigate is 'How should a service provider set up a point of contact in order to manage customer relations in the 3 G mobile Internet?' To reach a conclusion we have conducted a qualitative study including literature survey and three interviews. This thesis is a design proposal for {{how to set up}} an Internet based point of contact in order to manage customer relations in the 3 G mobile Internet. In order to get a base of knowledge about customer service we have studied one-to-one customer interaction, Customer Relationship Management [CRM], and contact centers. We have also looked at the telecom business and it's particular value chain. The service provider is becoming a provider of subscriptions containing services. In order to provide e. g. network access for the subscribers the service provider must form an alliance with a network operator. This alliance can also be increased with other suppliers of whatever services that adds value to the subscriber. When the service provider forms this value chain, it is the requirements / demands and needs of the subscriber that sets the framework of what to include. The point of contact can be seen as processes that help the subscriber manage her subscription. The processes we have identified as the core processes in the point of contact are sales, order handling, problem handling, <b>and</b> <b>invoicing</b> <b>and</b> <b>collections.</b> With 3 G the services will become more complex {{not only because of the}} technological possibilities, but also because the service providers will build alliances with the most suitable partners. That implies co-operation on an organisational level when the subscriber has a complaint regarding her subscription. The service provider should provide multiple channels for interaction with their subscribers. The subscriber should then be able to adapt the content in these channels to suite her own personal preferences. The point of contact makes self-service possible, but the customers are not ready to take the leap into the fully automated world of customer service and therefore a contact center will still have a place in the foreseeable future...|$|R
