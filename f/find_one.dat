He drove dune buggies and tried kayaking, and in 2007 was learning how to para-glide.|$|E

5|$|Nuttin {{analyzed}} {{the data to}} see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to <b>find</b> <b>one.</b> Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for Magyarország). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{title is}} derived from the 1965 Milton Bradley board game for teenage girls, Mystery Date, wherein several female players draw cards to advance to opening a door, hoping to <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of a variety of {{desirable}} male dates on the other side, while simultaneously hoping to avoid the lone undesirable one. A vintage television commercial for the game is viewed by Don's daughter Sally during the episode.|$|E
5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had {{the opportunity}} to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not <b>find</b> <b>one</b> that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.|$|E

5|$|Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made {{directly}} for Lough Swilly where the landing {{was scheduled to}} take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would be operating in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart searched for a suitable landing site {{but was unable to}} <b>find</b> <b>one</b> before dark on 10 October. He waited out the night close to Tory Island, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was bearing down on the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the wind to give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.|$|E
5|$|Police {{had found}} and arrested some {{suspects}} within 24 {{hours of the}} crime. From recordings made by a highway CCTV vehicle, {{a description of the}} bus, a white charter bus with a name written on it, was broadcast. Other operators identified it as being contracted by a South Delhi private school. They then traced it and found its driver, Ram Singh. Police obtained sketches of the assailants {{with the help of the}} male victim, and used a cell phone stolen from the two victims to <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of the assailants.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to <b>find</b> <b>one</b> at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E

Tantalus (who replaced Chiron as camp counselor) sends Clarisse La Rue on a quest to find the Golden Fleece. Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson run away from camp to find Grover. They are aided in their escape by the god Hermes, who helps them reach a passing cruise ship, the Princess Andromeda. Once aboard, they discover that the ship is full of tourists in a dream-like state living alongside Greek monsters. They are captured by Luke Castellan and learn that he is trying to revive his master Kronos. They escape on a lifeboat and eventually <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of many hideouts that Luke, Thalia, and Annabeth built as children. They are attacked by a hydra but are saved by Clarisse, who is sailing on a confederate ironclad called the CSS Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|Six National Guardsmen arrive, led by Sergeant Winshiser (Aleks Paunovic), as does Colonel James Livingston-Graham (Ian D. Clark), an {{experienced}} big game hunter and tracker from England {{who specializes in}} hunting man-eating tigers. Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff's advice and help. Graham tells the sheriff the soldiers will fail due to their arrogance {{and that he will}} start his hunt for the tiger when they finish. When the guardsmen search for the tiger, it kills one silently. Graham appears and explains how the tiger did it and helps them find the body. Later, Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt (Karl Thordarson), the mayor's son, <b>find</b> <b>one</b> of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road. They investigate and Weinman tells Hundt to call their position in to headquarters. She finds that the two guardsmen were attacked by the tiger, one being killed and the other shot by his partner. Hearing Hundt blowing the patrol car horn, she runs back to the car, but the Tiger has already killed him. Meanwhile, Roy encounters Graham in the woods and they discuss the tiger. When Roy asks if Graham is going to kill the Tiger, Graham tells him that he must because it can't chose not to hunt whatever is around it, including people. They shake hands and part ways with Graham continuing {{to the scene of the}} National Guard attack. When he arrives, he explains how the tiger attacked the guardsmen and deputy.|$|E
5|$|The Returners set out {{to search}} for Terra and {{eventually}} trace her {{to the city of}} Zozo, though they are still shocked by her apparent existence as an esper. There, they also meet the esper Ramuh, who tells them that if they free various other espers from the Magitek Research Facility in the Empire's capital, Vector, they may <b>find</b> <b>one</b> who can help Terra. Vector is on the southern continent, to which the Empire does not allow maritime access, so the Returners go to the Opera House and recruit Setzer Gabbiani, who {{is believed to be the}} owner of the Blackjack, the only airship in the world. They then travel to Vector and attempt to rescue several espers, including Maduin, who is revealed to be Terra's father. However, the espers are already dying from the experiments at Vector, and choose instead to give their lives to transform into magicite—the crystallized remains of the espers' essences that form when they die and allow others to use their powers. The dying espers bestow their magicite upon the Returners. Before the group can then escape, Kefka arrives and causes the Returners, including Locke, to momentarily doubt Celes' loyalty, much to her anguish. However, she provides proof to them of her support by covering for the group while the rest escape. The rest of the group then returns to Zozo, where Terra reacts to the magicite of her father, prompting her to gain knowledge of her past and accept herself as the half-human, half-esper child of Maduin and a human woman.|$|E
