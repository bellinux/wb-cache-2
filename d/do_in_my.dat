25|$|Indie {{asked me}} if I would keep the Barely Legal Radio program on Indie but stop doing mornings. I said yes. I loved doing the morning show for 2½ years but I am also looking forward to not getting up at 4 am any more. If you've ever had a morning job like this, you {{probably}} know the relief I feel, but I will still miss seeing Liz and Jose every day, having David Lynch as my weatherman, and talking to Timothy Olyphant about sports each morning. These will always rank with the coolest things I’ve ever been fortunate enough to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> entire life.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to People in 2013 {{about her}} {{transition}} from actress to author, Larter explained, [...] "After {{my son was}} born, I realized how much time I spend on set acting and how much I love that, but when I’m not on set, I’m usually throwing dinner parties or cooking and entertaining in some way, [...] So I thought you know what, maybe I’ll try to put a book together, that sounds like kind of a fun thing to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> off-time." [...] Larter has two dogs, Jackpot and Ella.|$|E

He remarked, [...] "My favorite fans are Troy McClure fans." [...] He added [...] "It's {{the one thing that}} I <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life that's almost an avocation. I do it for the pure love of it." [...] Many obituaries of Hartman mentioned his work as McClure as {{one of the highlights of}} his career. The BBC said that [...] " [...] voice was known to millions" [...] because of McClure and Lionel Hutz.|$|E

500|$|Hartman {{provided}} the voices for numerous characters on the Fox animated series The Simpsons, appearing in 52 episodes. He {{made his first}} appearance in the second season episode [...] "Bart Gets Hit by a Car". Although he was originally brought in for a one-time appearance, Hartman enjoyed working on The Simpsons and the staff wrote additional parts for him. He voiced the recurring characters Lionel Hutz and Troy McClure, {{as well as several}} one-time and background characters. His favourite part was that of McClure, and he often used this voice to entertain the audience between takes while taping episodes of NewsRadio.

A photograph of actor Sam J. Jones, who played Flash Gordon, was pasted into the original cover art. It was serialized in three issues of Whitman's Flash Gordon comic book, #31–33, March–May 1981. Alden McWilliams inked the backgrounds for the last 25 pages. [...] According to Williamson, [...] "It was the hardest job I ever had to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] He then began drawing the Star Wars comic strip in February 1981 following Alfredo Alcala's tenure, with Goodwin writing. [...] He drew the daily and Sunday feature until March 11, 1984, when the strip was canceled.

Griffith explained, [...] "The inspiration—just plucking random memories from my childhood, as I'm wont to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Sunday strip (also a way to expand beyond Zippy)—and Shep {{was a big part}} of them".|$|E

2500|$|While at Yale, {{he became}} a member of Skull and Bones. He served {{apprenticeships}} at Time, Life, the United States Information Agency, and American Heritage, where he enjoyed research. [...] "Once I discovered the endless fascination of doing the research and of doing the writing, I knew I had found what I wanted to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] While attending Yale, McCullough studied Arts and earned his bachelor's degree in English, with the intention of becoming a fiction writer or playwright. He graduated with honors in English literature (1955).|$|E
2500|$|That bad bowling on that Sunday, that's {{the only}} regret I have in cricket, and I'm sorry I can't have it over again, because knowing what I could <b>do,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, that's what hurts {{most of all}} [...] [...] Sometimes it haunts me, but anyway, that's {{part and parcel of}} life, and you cop it sweet. Anyone who asks me , that's no problem, it brings back bad memories, but you cop it sweet and anyone decent you respond by telling them what you think, and everyone's {{entitled}} to ask in that regard... The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence.|$|E
2500|$|Welch {{posed for}} Playboy {{magazine}} in 1979, {{but she never}} did a full nudity photo shoot. Hugh Hefner and Gary Cole later wrote: [...] "Raquel Welch, {{one of the last}} of the classic sex symbols, came from the era when you could be considered the sexiest woman in the world without taking your clothes off. She declined to do complete nudity, and I yielded gracefully. The pictures prove her point." [...] Welch has refused to take all her clothes off on screen or pose naked throughout her career spanning five decades, saying it is the way she has been brought up. While her image in the 1960s was that of a torrid sex temptress, Raquel's private life was quite different. She once famously said: [...] "What I do on the screen is not to be equated with what I <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> private life. Privately, I am understated and dislike any hoopla".|$|E

2500|$|Jackson's {{representative}} {{explained the}} incident, saying, [...] "Justin {{was supposed to}} pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed." [...] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said [...] "My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason." ...|$|E
