50|$|Failure {{to produce}} a hybrid {{may be due to}} pre- or post-{{fertilization}} incompatibility. If fertilization is possible between two species or genera, the hybrid embryo may abort before maturation. If this does occur the embryo resulting from an interspecific or intergeneric cross can sometimes be rescued and cultured {{to produce a}} whole plant. Such a method is referred to as Embryo Rescue. This technique has been used to produce new rice for Africa, an <b>interspecific</b> <b>cross</b> of Asian rice (Oryza sativa) and African rice (Oryza glaberrima).|$|E
50|$|Interploidy {{hybridization}} {{is a term}} {{to describe}} a hybridization (or manual cross) between two different individuals of different ploidy levels. Individuals resulting from this type of hybridizations are called interploidy hybrids. This phenomenon is often being observed in plants. Interploidy hybridizations in angiosperms often cause abnormal seed development, leading to reduced seed size or seed abortion. This reproductive bottle neck leads to a phenomenon called triploid block. In agriculture, development of new plant cultivars utilizing interploidy hybrids are usually preceded by <b>interspecific</b> <b>cross</b> between two close related species with different ploidy level.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Previously, an <b>interspecific</b> <b>cross</b> between Fusarium circinatum and Fusarium subglutinans {{was used}} to {{generate}} a genetic linkage map. A ca. 55 % of genotyped markers displayed transmission ratio distortion (TRD) that demonstrated a genome-wide distribution. The working hypothesis {{for this study was}} that TRD would be non-randomly distributed throughout the genetic linkage map. This would indicate the presence of distorting loci. Using a genome-wide threshold of a = 0. 01, 79 markers displaying TRD were distributed on all 12 linkage groups (LGs). Eleven putative transmission ratio distortion loci (TRDLs), spanning eight LGs, were identified in regions containing three or more adjacent markers displaying distortion. No epistatic interactions were observed between these TRDLs. Thus, it is uncertain whether the genome-wide TRD was due to linkage between markers and genomic regions causing distortion. The parental origins of markers followed a non-random distribution throughout the linkage map, with LGs containing stretches of markers originating from only one parent. Thus, {{due to the nature of}} the <b>interspecific</b> <b>cross,</b> the current hypothesis to explain these observations is that the observed genome-wide segregation was caused by the high level of genomic divergence between the parental isolates. Therefore, homologous chromosomes do not align properly during meiosis, resulting in aberrant transmission of markers. This also explains previous observations of the preferential trans-mission of F. subglutinans alleles to the F 1 progeny...|$|E
30|$|Many postzygotic {{reproductive}} barrier forms {{have been}} reported in rice (Oryza sativa), such as hybrid weakness (e.g., Oka 1957), hybrid pollen sterility (e.g., Long et al. 2008), and hybrid sterility causing female gamete abortion (e.g., Chen et al. 2008). Among them, hybrid weakness is definable as weak growth occurring in F 1 hybrids derived from crosses between two normal strains. According to its degree or symptom, it is also called hybrid lethality, hybrid abnormality, or hybrid necrosis. Hybrid weakness is also apparent in many other plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana (Bomblies et al. 2007), Phaseolus vulgaris (Shii et al. 1980), <b>interspecific</b> <b>crosses</b> among Gossypium (Lee 1981), and <b>interspecific</b> <b>crosses</b> among Nicotiana (Tezuka et al. 2007).|$|R

The mode of plastid inheritance between Z. albomaculata subsp. albomaculata and Z. albomaculata subsp. macrocarpa was, therefore, investigated.

40|$|Hybridization and {{introgression}} {{are common}} in plants and lead to morphological similarity between species and taxonomic confusion. This gene flow with closely related species can complicate efforts to determine whether an endangered taxon is evolutionarily distinctive and should be identified as a separate conservation unit. Potentilla delphinensis is a rare and threatened endemic species of the Southern French Alps. Two common related taxa (P. grandiflora and P. thuringiaca) are morphologically similar and occur in the same geographical locations. Thus, whether P. delphinensis represents a reliable conservation unit remained unclear. Our evaluation procedure based {{on a combination of}} molecular biology and <b>interspecific</b> <b>crosses</b> was used to define taxa within these plants. Plants were sampled from a total of 23 single and mixed localities for the three supposed taxa and were genotyped with 68 polymorphic Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) loci. Fourty-one seedlings from <b>interspecific</b> <b>crosses</b> were obtained and genotyped. Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism markers identified four genetically distinct units (P. delphinensis, P. grandiflora and two distinct groups of P. thuringiaca). All individuals of P. delphinensis formed a homogeneous and distinct taxon. This taxon was most probably an old allopolyploid from P. grandiflora and the related group of P. thuringiaca. <b>Interspecific</b> <b>crosses</b> gave low seed set and low germination rate. Furthermore, assignment test indicated that seedlings obtained from <b>interspecific</b> <b>crosses</b> were essentially apomictic rather than hybrids.

40|$|In <b>interspecific</b> <b>crosses,</b> a {{mismatch}} in internal physiological conditions between two species can reduce sperm viability in the interval from insemination to fertilization, leading to gametic isolation. Two closely related Japanese phytophagous ladybird beetles, Henosepilachna vigintioctomaculata and H. pustulosa, show several isolating barriers, including {{reduction in the}} number of heterospecific sperm in the female reproductive tract and low egg-hatching rates in interspecific matings. However, the mechanisms of these two potential isolating barriers and the association between them are unknown. Here we investigated temporal changes in the number of sperm stored in the female reproductive tract and egg-hatching rates in inter- and intraspecific crosses between these species. Although the number of sperm decreased after both inter- and intraspecific crosses, the reduction was more drastic in inter- than in intraspecific crosses for females of both species. Most of the sperm reduction occurred early on, during sperm transfer from the bursa copulatrix to the paired ampullae of the common oviduct (the sperm storage organs). These two species also demonstrated stably low egg-hatching rates in <b>interspecific</b> <b>crosses.</b> Since the degree and timing of the sperm reduction did not correlate with egg-hatching rates, the reduction in heterospecific sperm in <b>interspecific</b> <b>crosses</b> may not directly cause the low hatching rates.
