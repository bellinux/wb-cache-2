50|$|The {{thermal process}} in the vortex tube can be {{estimated}} in the following way: 1) The adiabatic expansion of the incoming gas, which cools the gas and turns its heat energy into the kinetic energy of rotation. The total enthalpy (which {{is the sum of}} the enthalpy and the kinetic energy), however, is being conserved. 2) The peripheric rotating gas flow moves towards the hot outlet. Here the <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> effect takes place between the quickly rotating peripheric flow and the opposite slowly rotating axial flow. Here the heat transfers from axial flow to the peripheric one. 3) The kinetic energy of rotation turns into the heat energy by the means of the viscous dissipation. The temperature of the gas rises. As the total enthalpy has been increased during the <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> process, this temperature is higher than the incoming gas. 4) Some of the hot gas leaves the hot outlet, carrying away the excess heat. 5) The rest of the gas turns towards the cold outlet. As it passes its way to the cold outlet, its heat energy is transferred to the peripheric flow. Although the temperature at the axis and at the periphery is about the same everywhere, the rotation is slower at the axis, so the total enthalpy is lower as well. 6) The low total enthalpy cooled gas from the axial flow leaves the cold outlet.|$|E

The temperature at which the inert gas is separated from oxygen for an open-loop and recycled system is varied.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to select {{appropriate}} heat exchangers out of available gas-gas heat exchangers for used in a proposed power plant. The heat exchangers are {{to be used in}} the power plant for the purposes of waste <b>heat</b> recovery, <b>recuperation</b> and intercooling. In selecting an optimum heat exchanger for use, the PCHE was identified as the best candidate for waste <b>heat</b> recovery and <b>recuperation.</b> In order to ascertain the viability of this assertion the PCHE was designed and a 1 D modeling performed in MATLAB using the conditions that the heat exchanger for waste heat recovery would be subjected to. The choice of using the conditions that the waste recovery heat exchanger would be subjected to was due to the fact that, it is the heat exchanger that would be subjected to much harsh conditions (thus higher temperatures of up to 650 ºC). The PFHE was also designed and similarly a 1 D modeling performed in MATLAB. The decision to consider the design of the PFHE was to offer a platform to compare and contrast the performance of the PCHE in order to have a strong basis for deciding on whether to stick to the choice for the PCHE or otherwise. The results obtained from the 1 D modeling of the design of the heat exchangers indicates that the PCHE performed better with regards to pressure drops across the heat exchangers (with values of 1. 17 and 2. 47 % for the cold and hot sides respectively), compactness (with a value of 1300 m 2 /m 3 for the PCHE compared to the 855 m 2 /m 3 recorded from the PFHE), however the PFHE recorded higher heat transfer coefficients, and a subsequent higher overall transfer coefficient. Results obtained from the simulation of the 3 D model buttress the decision to employ the PCHE as heat exchangers to be used for waste <b>heat</b> recovery and <b>recuperation</b> as a wise one, with an effectiveness of 0. 94 as against the design value of 0. 90, and with pressure drops as desired of the optimum heat exchanger...|$|R
40|$|Conceptual {{design studies}} have been {{conducted}} to identify Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) systems which are technically feasible and potentially attractive for future electric utility load-levelling applications. The CAES concept consists of compressing air during off-peak periods and storing it in underground facilities for later use. During peak-load periods the air would be withdrawn, <b>heated</b> by <b>recuperation</b> and combustion and expanded through turbines to generate power. By using off-peak electricity for compression and stored air for peak-load generation, the resulting oil consumption would be about 40 per cent of that consumed by conventional gas-turbine peaking plants. The turbomachinery requirements for this type of system could be met using existing equipment with relatively modest modifications. Although the study discussed herein focused on the storage of air in hydraulically compensated, mined, hard-rock caverns, the compressed air could also be stored in underground aquifers or leached-out salt cavities. Conventional underground excavation technology could be used to construct these storage caverns. A geological survey of the north-central and north-east regions of the United States indicated that sufficient siting opportunities exist such that a prudently designed CAES plant should have little long-term adverse impact on the environment. The competitive position of CAES relative to conventional generation alternatives is highly dependent on utility-specific factors. The cost of electric energy from CAES is generally competitive with costs from conventional peak-shaving systems such as gas turbines and will improve as low-cost off-peak energy from nuclear plants becomes available. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{computational}} thermodynamic {{analysis of}} a samarium oxide-based two-step solar thermochemical water splitting cycle is reported. The analysis is performed using HSC chemistry software and databases. The first (solar-based) step drives the thermal reduction of Sm 2 O 3 into Sm and O 2. The second (non-solar) step corresponds {{to the production of}} H 2 via a water splitting reaction and the oxidation of Sm to Sm 2 O 3. The equilibrium thermodynamic compositions related to the thermal reduction and water splitting steps are determined. The effect of oxygen partial pressure in the inert flushing gas on the thermal reduction temperature (TH) is examined.

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that in the United States alone, enough energy is wasted in industrial applications to power between 43 and 110 million homes. Much of this energy is wasted through hot exhaust streams often in power generation and {{in the manufacture of}} steel. The recovery of portions of this energy is clearly necessary from either an economical or environmental standpoint, however the temperatures at which these exhaust streams run are often too low for conventional energy recovery methods. The incorporation of supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO 2) as a working fluid in power cycles aims to provide a platform on which this energy can be recovered. Literature identifies many techniques to improve S-CO 2 cycle efficiencies, however few outline how to modify this for waste heat recovery applications, where energy output is the key performance indicator. Through the modification of several existing numerical tools, the simulation of several cycle configurations was possible. This allowed for the verification of several thermodynamic principles involved with optimising a S-CO 2 cycle for the application of waste heat recovery. Specifically, a context where a waste-heat source at 900 K flowing at 10 kg/s was simulated as this falls within typical waste heat ranges. This allowed for the comparison of several techniques for achieving higher performing cycles including optimising fluid states at key points in the cycle to minimize compression-work and maximize turbinework and the use of recuperation to reduce waste energy. In addition, the process of splitting the flow between different components to optimise recuperation and avoid its key limitation of its presence known as the pinch-point was investigated. This investigation shows the standard Brayton cycle to be capable of recovering 867 kW representing 13. 69 % of the aforementioned waste-heat source. This cycle was found to waste 5888 kW of power making it insufficient in terms of energy yield, but having a simplicity suitable for waste <b>heat</b> recovery. The <b>recuperation</b> cycle was found to yield 1248 kW representing 19. 7 % of the waste-heat source.

Also found was that as the complexity of cycles grow, often the required parts increase in size and quantity yielding an additional need for an economic analysis, and additionally a potential further study involving the recompression cycle and its suitability for waste heat recovery as well as a review of the numerical methods used...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presented}} here {{is focused on}} the use of aqua-ammonia solution in a novel solar-powered refrigeration cycle intended to be suitable for use in the rural areas of developing countries. The cycle is referred to as a `intermittent regenerative' (IR) cycle, the term regenerative meaning in this context the use of <b>heat</b> recovery or <b>recuperation.</b> The first chapter describes the three better known cycles which may be considered for this application. The IR cycle is introduced as a hybrid development of these which offers the significant advantages of high efficiency while minimising complexity. Chapter 1 provides a methodology by which the novel aqua-ammonia system can be evaluated in comparison with existing systems. The second chapter surveys previous experimental work on solar driven aqua-ammonia cycles. Chapter 3 consists of a detailed design study of the new IR cycle based on computer modelling techniques. The study serves as an analysis of the cycle and allows the performance of the cycle, together with design features and component sizes, to be simulated in a variety of meteorological conditions. A number of original design proposals are evaluated through the modelling exercise. Chapter 4 summarises the results of a second separate modelling exercise which investigates the absorption phase of the cycle. Chapters 5 and 6 describe experimental work. The results of laboratory tests are compared with the predictions of the computer model and in the event serve to validate the theoretical characterisation made in chapter 3 of the performance of key components of the system. The energy efficiency of the system as measured by experiment is proved to correspond to theoretical prediction, so representing a significant advance on the performance of alternative systems. Chapter 7 addresses itself to the wider question of the social and economic validity of a device with the performance and cost of the IR device. A case study is undertaken which explores the potential role of the device in the fish trading economy of Zambia. The study provides data valuable in assessing the usefulness of the technology in helping to stimulate the under-capitalised rural economy of a developing country and in improving local food resource utilisation. Chapter 8 draws together the conclusions of the various chapters and provides an overall conclusion and comment on the value of the IR system. It is proved to have a high efficiency but not to have the robustness nor portability demanded for widespread application in remote locations. Nevertheless the likely life-time cost-effectiveness of the system is judged to be an improvement on existing alternatives and suggestions are made for further improvement...|$|R

40|$|For nonstoichiometric redox {{reactions}} that produce CO and H 2 from CO 2 and H 2 O, <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> from the solid phase is a promising mechanism {{to improve the}} cycle efficiency. Many different approaches to <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> and gas separation have been presented in solar thermochemical reactor concepts recently. To describe the many possible degrees of freedom in the reactor design, a generic reactor model is described for two-step redox reactions of solid pieces of reactant moving in counter flow between reduction and oxidation chambers. The reactive material {{is assumed to be}} porous ceria, where <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> from the solid phase is achieved through radiation heat exchange between reduced and oxidized elements moving in opposite directions.

A study of crucial design parameters shows that heat diffusion in the reactive material can have a significant influence on the performance of the heat exchanger. If the time required for heat diffusion is large with respect to the total residence time in the heat exchanger, the material thickness can be decreased to enhance the share of the material actively participating in the heat exchange process. Furthermore, at the relevant temperatures, radiation dominates the heat exchange within the porous structure, thus the overall heat exchange can be enhanced through an increase of porosity.

40|$|The key to {{overcome}} Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) load range limitations in reciprocating engines {{is based on}} proper control over the thermo-chemical properties of the in-cylinder charge. The studied alternative to achieve the required control of LTC {{is the use of}} two separate fuel streams to regulate timing and heat release at specific operational points, where the secondary fuel is a reformed product of the primary fuel in the tank. It is proposed in this report that the secondary fuel can be produced using exhaust <b>heat</b> and Thermo-Chemical <b>Recuperation</b> (TCR). TCR for reciprocating engines is a system that employs high efficiency recovery of sensible heat from engine exhaust gas and uses this energy to transform fuel composition. The recuperated sensible heat is returned to the engine as chemical energy. Chemical conversions are accomplished through catalytic and endothermic reactions in a specially designed reforming reactor. An equilibrium model developed by Gas Technology Institute (GTI) for heptane steam reforming was applied to estimate reformed fuel composition at different reforming temperatures. Laboratory results, at a steam/heptane mole ratio less than 2 : 1, confirm that low temperature reforming reactions, in the range of 550 K to 650 K, can produce 10 - 30 % hydrogen (by volume, wet) in the product stream. Also, the effect of trading low mean effective pressure for displacement to achieve power output and energy efficiency has been explored by WVU. A zerodimensional model of LTC using heptane as fuel and a diesel Compression Ignition (CI) combustion model were employed to estimate pressure, temperature and total heat release as inputs for a mechanical and thermal loss model. The model results show that the total cooling burden on an LTC engine with lower power density and higher displacement was 14. 3 % lower than the diesel engine for the same amount of energy addition in the case of high load (43. 57 mg fuel/cycle). These preliminary modeling and experimental results suggest that the LTC-TCR combination may offer a high efficiency solution to engine operation. A single zone model using a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism was implemented in CHEMKIN and to study the effects of base fuel and steam-fuel reforming products on the ignition timing and heat release characteristics. The study was performed considering the reformed fuel species composition for total n-heptane conversion (ideal case) and also at the composition corresponding to a specific set of operational reforming temperatures (real case). The computational model confirmed that the reformed products have a strong influence on the low temperature heat release (LTHR) region, affecting the onset of the high temperature heat release (HTHR). The ignition timing was proportionally delayed with respect to the baseline fuel case when higher concentrations of reformed gas were used. For stoichiometric concentration of RG, it was found that by increasing the proportion of reformed fuel to total fuel (RG), from 0 % to 30 %, the amount of energy released during the LTHR regime, or HR{sub L}, was reduced by 48 % and the ignition timing was delayed 10. 4 CA degrees with respect to the baseline fuel case.

Thermal applications are drawing increasing attention in the solar energy research field, due to their high performance in energy storage density and energy conversion efficiency. In these applications, solar collectors and thermal energy storage systems are the two core components. This paper focuses on the latest developments and advances in solar thermal applications, providing a review of solar collectors and thermal energy storage systems. Various types of solar collectors are reviewed and discussed, including both non-concentrating collectors (low temperature applications) and concentrating collectors (high temperature applications). These are studied in terms of optical optimisation, heat loss reduction, <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> enhancement and different sun-tracking mechanisms. Various types of thermal energy storage systems are also reviewed and discussed, including sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, chemical storage and cascaded storage. They are studied in terms of design criteria, material selection and different heat transfer enhancement technologies. Last but not least, existing and future solar power stations are overviewed...|$|E
40|$|Low-temperature heat sources (100 - 150 °C) can {{be found}} in many domains, ranging from {{industrial}} processes to geothermal sources. In many cases, these sources are not being used for electricity generation because of the low conversion efficiency (Carnot). Rising energy prices can make the <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> interesting if the conversion efficiency can be increased. One of the proposed methods for increasing the conversion efficiency is the use of the Kalina cycle. This is a cycle similar to the steam Rankine cycle, but it uses a mixture of water and ammonia as working fluid. The concentration of the ammonia in the mixture is not constant in the cycle. Although the Kalina cycle is pretended to be very efficient, only a few of these power plants have been build in the world. The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the normal Kalina cycle and to find possible improvements. These adapted, improved Kalina cycles can use for example other working fluids.

40|$|The {{graduation}} thesis addresses four given {{energy efficiency}} certificates for the preschool in Škofja Loka, calculated {{according to the}} valid legislation and work methodology. The building in question {{was built in the}} seventies of last century and had it's efficiency improved in 2014. The state of the building before improvements has both measured and calculated efficiency certificates made using the KI Energija 2014 program, while the two energy efficiency certificates for the post-renovation building were made with KI Energija 2014 and URSA Gradbena fizika 4. 0 programs. In {{the first part of the}} graduation thesis we look at the valid legislation concerning energy efficiency certificates, followed by the description of the examined work, work methodology, results and energy efficiency certificates comparison. The thesis concludes with logical actions that might be undertaken to improve the energy efficiency of the building among which the measures to optimize window shading, improve the roof heat insulation, as well as lighting measures, organizational changes and the introduction of a <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> system are described in depth...|$|E
40|$|A {{possible}} pathway {{for renewable}} and sustainable methane production from captured carbon dioxide, water (or seawater) and renewable electricity is proposed and analysed. The proposed system includes Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell combined with ex-situ methane synthesis reactor comprising Sabatier, Methanation and Water-Gas Shift reactions. A well validated electrochemical model {{is used to}} describe the behaviour of the electrolyzer for steam/carbon dioxide co-electrolysis. The methane synthesis reactor is modelled by a set of equations based on thermodynamic equilibrium reaction constants. Effects of current density, temperature, pressure and initial steam to carbon dioxide ratio on system performance are analysed and their effects are discussed. It is found that a simple, single-pass system without <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation</b> could achieve a maximum overall energy efficiency of 60. 87 % (based on lower heating value), a maximum electrical energy efficiency of 81. 08 % (based on lower heating value), and a maximum amount of methane production of ~ 1. 52 Nm 3 h- 1 m- 2 of electrolyzer. It is also found that conversion of ~ 100 % captured carbon dioxide is possible in the proposed system. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
40|$|HTR- 10 GT is the {{development}} of HTR- 10 reactor, which PCU will be a closed Brayton cycle with two-stage compression and <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation.</b> Bypass control method is adopted for rapid power regulation and safety protection. But quick opening of single bypass valve would inevitably lead to temperature shocks in multiple components especially at the reactor inlet and the recuperator core. Based on the regulating characteristics of each possible bypass valve, a dual bypass valve control scheme was proposed along with MIMO decoupling controller designed with diagonal matrix method. The system was modeled with Modelica; the DASSL code was used to solve the Differential and Algebraic Equations during simulations. System’s control characteristic was analyzed with classical linear control theory and H∞ theory applied on linearized system model. Further numerical simulations showed that cooperative functioning of two bypass valves could effectively limit the temperature variation during power regulation, while the decoupler could improve the control effect and the stability of the system. The results will be helpful for the future design of the control system of HTR- 10 GT or other closed Brayton cycle of the same kind...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{summarizes}} the knowledge concerning porous media combustion techniques as applied in engines. One of most important reasons of this review is to introduce this still {{not well known}} technology to researchers doing with internal combustion engine processes, thermal engines, reactor thermodynamics, combustion, and material science. The paper gives an overview of possible applications of a highly porous open cell structures to in-cylinder processes. This application means utilization of unique features of porous media for supporting engine processes, especially fuel distribution in space, vaporization, mixing with air, <b>heat</b> <b>recuperation,</b> ignition and combustion. There are three ways for applying porous medium technology to engines: support of individual processes, support of homogeneous combustion process (catalytic and non-catalytic) with temperature control, and utilization of the porous structure as a heat capacitor only. In the first type of application, the porous structure may be utilized for fuel vaporization and improved fuel distribution in space making the mixture more homogeneous in the combustion chamber. Extension of these processes to mixture formation and ignition inside a combustion reactor allows the realization of a homogeneous and a nearly zero emissions level combustion characterized by a homogeneous temperature field at reduced temperature level...|$|E
