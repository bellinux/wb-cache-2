25|$|This {{style is}} {{commonly}} found on racing bicycles with two chainrings. The relative {{step on the}} chainrings (say 35%) is typically around {{three or four times}} the relative step on the cogset (say 8% or 10%), e.g. chainrings 39-53 and close-range cogsets 12-13-14-15-16-17-19-21 or 12-13-15-17-19-21-23-25. This arrangement provides much more scope for adjusting the gear ratio to maintain a constant pedalling speed, but any change of chainring must be accompanied by a simultaneous change of 3 or 4 sprockets on the cogset <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to switch to the next higher or lower gear ratio.|$|E

25|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970s, transformations like HSV or HSI were used as a {{compromise}} between effectiveness for segmentation and computational complexity. They {{can be thought of}} as similar in approach and intent to the neural processing used by human color vision, without agreeing in particulars: <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> object detection, roughly separating hue, lightness, and chroma or saturation is effective, but there is no particular reason to strictly mimic human color response. John Kender’s 1976 master’s thesis proposed the HSI model. Ohta et al. (1980) instead used a model made up of dimensions similar to those we have called I, α, and β. In recent years, such models have continued to see wide use, as their performance compares favorably with more complex models, and their computational simplicity remains compelling.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} {{method for}} determining sentiment {{is the use}} of a scaling system whereby words commonly associated with having a negative, neutral, or positive sentiment with them are given an associated number on a −10 to +10 scale (most negative up to most positive) or simply from 0 to a positive upper limit such as +4. This makes it possible to adjust the sentiment of a given term relative to its environment (usually on the level of the sentence). When a piece of unstructured text is analyzed using natural language processing, each concept in the specified environment is given a score based on the way sentiment words relate to the concept and its associated score. This allows movement to a more sophisticated understanding of sentiment, because it is now possible to adjust the sentiment value of a concept relative to modifications that may surround it. Words, for example, that intensify, relax or negate the sentiment expressed by the concept can affect its score. Alternatively, texts can be given a positive and negative sentiment strength score <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to determine the sentiment in a text rather than the overall polarity and strength of the text.|$|E
500|$|In practice, {{computational}} addition may {{be achieved}} via XOR and AND bitwise logical operations {{in conjunction with}} bitshift operations {{as shown in the}} pseudocode below. Both XOR and AND gates are straightforward to realize in digital logic allowing the realization of full adder circuits which in turn may be combined into more complex logical operations. In modern digital computers, integer addition is typically the fastest arithmetic instruction, yet it has the largest impact on performance, since it underlies all floating-point operations as well as such basic tasks as address generation during memory access and fetching instructions during branching. To increase speed, modern designs calculate digits in parallel; these schemes go by such names as carry select, carry lookahead, and the Ling pseudocarry. Many implementations are, in fact, hybrids of these last three designs. Unlike addition on paper, addition on a computer often changes the addends. On the ancient abacus and adding board, both addends are destroyed, leaving only the sum. The influence of the abacus on mathematical thinking was strong enough that early Latin texts often claimed that in the process of adding [...] "a number to a number", both numbers vanish. In modern times, the ADD instruction of a microprocessor often replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the addend. In a high-level programming language, evaluating [...] does not change either a or b; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> to replace a with the sum this must be explicitly requested, typically with the statement [...] Some languages such as C or C++ allow this to be abbreviated as [...]|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two types}} of {{penalties}} that can result in a power play for the non-offending team: minor (two minutes) and major (five minutes). For such penalties, the offending player is ruled off the ice and no substitute for the penalized player is permitted. A power play resulting from a minor penalty ends if the team with more players on the ice scores. [...] If the penalty is instead a double minor, a goal scored by the team with advantage ends the first minor penalty, so that 2 goals by the team with more players are needed to end the power play. If a player is given a major penalty (five minute duration), a power play occurs, but if the team on the power play scores, the penalty is not ended, except <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> scored in overtime, as this ends the game. Major penalties only end when five minutes have elapsed or the game has ended.

[...] "Misconduct" [...] penalties (10 minutes in duration), and [...] "game misconduct" [...] penalties (offending player is ejected for the balance of the game) allow for substitution of the offending player, so do not result in power plays. However in practice, misconduct and game misconduct penalties are often assessed in addition to a major or minor penalty. A [...] "match" [...] penalty results in the offending player being ejected for the balance of the game and a 5-minute power play for the non-offending team.
