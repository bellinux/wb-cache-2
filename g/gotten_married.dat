[...] tcm.com], accessed November 1, 2010. Directed by Howard Hawks and starring Paul Muni as Tony Camonte, the film is partially based {{on the life of}} Al Capone and incorporates details of Capone's biography into the storyline. The film begins with Camonte working for Johnny Lovo (Osgood Perkins), but he's dissatisfied with being a subordinate and he's also attracted to Lovo's girlfriend Poppy (Karen Morley). He has an unhealthily controlling relationship with his sister Francesca (Ann Dvorak) – whom he expects to remain chaste—that many critics have described as incestuous. Lovo warns Camonte to leave the North Side alone as it is controlled by a rival mob, but he ignores this warning and launches a series of executions and extortions that result in a war with the North Side gang. Camonte then forcefully takes the gang over from Lovo, who tries unsuccessfully to kill him for this. Camonte's attempt to kill Lovo is more successful, and Poppy happily becomes his girl. When Camonte finds Francesca in a hotel room with his closest friend, coin-flipping gangster Guino Rinaldo (George Raft), he kills Rinaldo in a rage.

Principal record producer and bass guitarist of the group, A.B. Quintanilla, discovered then 17-year old Chris Pérez, {{who at the}} time was the guitarist for Tejano music singer Shelly Lares. Pérez auditioned {{to be part of the}} group, finding A.B.'s music production style to be his original inspiration in wanting to become part of Selena y Los Dinos. At first, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.—the manager of the group, and the father of A.B., Suzette Quintanilla, and Selena—dismissed Pérez, seeing him as more of a rocker and found him to be unequipped for a Tejano band. Betty Cortina, editor-at-large for People magazine, stated that Pérez was the antithesis of Abraham's [...] "clean cut good kids" [...] image. A.B persuaded Abraham that Pérez was capable of performing Tejano music, adding that Pérez's rocker image was harmless. Pérez was then hired as the band's guitarist after the band finished recording Ven Conmigo. Pérez was surprised at how the group worked during the entire production of Entre a Mi Mundo. During pre-production, keyboardist Ricky Vela would sequence the music—Pérez was surprised by how much importance the group put on this—while A.B. would work alongside Vela with any technical problems they faced, as well as choosing the compositions that would be recorded by Selena.|$|E
