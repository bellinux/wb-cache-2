Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater than that of a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron.

5|$|In 1913 {{the crystal}} {{structure}} of sodium chloride {{was determined by}} William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg. This revealed that there were six equidistant nearest-neighbours for each atom, demonstrating that the constituents were not arranged in molecules or finite aggregates, but instead as a network with long-range crystalline order. Many other inorganic compounds were also found to have similar structural features. These compounds were soon described as being constituted of ions rather than neutral atoms, but proof of this hypothesis was not found until the mid-1920s, when X-ray reflection experiments (which detect the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons),</b> were performed.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} is {{a technique}} used for determining the atomic and molecular structure of a crystal, in which the crystalline atoms cause a beam of incident X-rays to diffract into many specific directions.

The temperature (T) dependence <b>of</b> the carrier <b>densities</b> and <b>of</b> their mobilities, as estimated from a numerical analysis based on the isotropic two-carrier model, indicates that its exceedingly large and non-saturating magnetoresistance may be attributed to a near perfect compensation between the <b>densities</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> and holes at low temperatures.

500|$|For every {{reflection}} {{corresponding to}} a point q in the reciprocal space, there is another reflection of the same intensity at the opposite point -q.

As noted above, f(r) is the inverse transform of its Fourier transform F(q); however, such an inverse transform is a complex number in general. To ensure that f(r) is real, the Fourier transform F(q) must be such that the Friedel mates F(−q) and F(q) are complex conjugates of one another.

2500|$|Radio waves {{passing through}} the Earth's {{ionosphere}} are likewise subject to the Faraday effect. The ionosphere consists of a plasma containing free electrons which contribute to Faraday rotation {{according to the above}} equation, whereas the positive ions are relatively massive and have little influence. In conjunction with the earth's magnetic field, rotation of the polarization of radio waves thus occurs. Since the <b>density</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> in the ionosphere varies greatly on a daily basis, as well as over the sunspot cycle, the magnitude of the effect varies. However the effect is always proportional to the square of the wavelength, so even at the UHF television frequency of 500MHz (λ = 60cm), there can be more than a complete rotation of the axis of polarization. [...] A consequence is that although most radio transmitting antennas are either vertically or horizontally polarized, the polarization of a medium or short wave signal after reflection by the ionosphere is rather unpredictable. However the Faraday effect due to free electrons diminishes rapidly at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) so that at microwave frequencies, used by satellite communications, the transmitted polarization is maintained between the satellite and the ground.|$|E
