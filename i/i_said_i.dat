25|$|Oh, that wasn't done wickedly, God {{knows it}} wasn't. We always want cremations {{to go off}} {{smoothly}} for the dear relatives. If <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> knew I was getting money under the Will they might get suspicious and I like cremations and burials to go smoothly. There was nothing suspicious really. It was not deceitful.|$|E
25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> could not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming towards me and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E

25|$|Sitting {{after dinner}} at Ilam {{about a month}} ago, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> saw no hope for a better state of public policy here unless {{there was a new}} {{newspaper}} started which would tell the truth without fear or favour. In five minutes the thing was settled. If I would undertake the management of it, it was to be started and five hundred pound was put down on the spot; it was soon found there was a little press and some types to be bought. I promised I would write and would exercise a general superintendence over the matter... The first number appeared three weeks after the conversation referred to.|$|E
25|$|And {{they told}} us, the Inquisitor {{would have us}} separated, because I was weak, and I should go into a cooler room; but Sarah should abide there. I {{took her by the}} arm, and said. The Lord hath joined us together, and wo be to them that should part us. <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> rather chuse to dye there with my friend, than to part from her. He was smitten, and went away, and came no more in five weeks... they did not part us till ten Weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the sharp showers the Lord did carry us through! Death it self had been better than to have parted in that place.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, she asked me if I had ever written any down, and when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

25|$|Wilson’s diary {{records that}} on 24 March he (5pm) telephoned Lloyd George {{to ask him}} to come to London, {{received}} a telephone call from Foch (“asking what I thought of situation & we are of one mind that someone must catch a hold or we shall be beaten. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> would come over and see him”), then had a meeting with Lloyd George at Downing Street where they discussed “the entirely inadequate measures taken by Haig and Petain” before receiving an evening message from Haig asking him to come over. There is no evidence to confirm Haig's later claim that, on returning from a midnight meeting with Petain at 3am on 25 March, he telegraphed to Wilson and Milner to come over to France and ensure the appointment of “Foch or some other determined general who would fight” as Allied Generalissimo. Wilson reached GHQ at Montreuil at 11.30am on 25 March, having left London by special train at 6.50am then crossed to France on a destroyer. He chided Haig for having, together with Petain, blocked the plan for an Allied reserve, although in fact Petain sent a dozen divisions and it is unclear that a committee would actually have acted any faster. Travers argued that the true reason for Wilson’s visit to France was to discuss a retreat on the Channel Ports, but this view is not accepted by other scholars.|$|E

500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something I {{wanted to talk about}} ... and it's something that has happened to me in the past... As <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E

Bouck cooperated with the author, Alex Kershaw, but imposed one condition, [...] "I told him that other authors never wrote about the other men in the platoon, just me. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't talk to him unless he promised that he'd also write about the other men." ...|$|E
500|$|Petacci {{was sitting}} on the bed and Mussolini was standing. [...] "John" [...] took me outside and told me his orders were to {{eliminate}} them both, because Petacci knew many things. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> could not shoot Petacci, so John said he would shoot her himself, while making it quite clear that Mussolini however, had to be killed by an Italian.|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "Afraid" [...] (featuring rapper Attitude), is a {{description}} of Furtado's fear of what people think of her, and she has said the chorus reminds her of [...] "walking down the hall in high school ... because you live from the outside in. Now that I'm an adult, I care about the inside of me ... Before <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> didn't care about what people thought about me, but I really did." ...|$|E

500|$|Starting in October 2007, he {{appeared}} as a judge on Phenomenon with Uri Geller. In a CNN interview about the show, he told Larry King [...] "no one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And that was what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to do}} with Phenomenon. If somebody goes on that show and claims to have supernatural psychic ability, I'm going to bust [...] live and on television." ...|$|E
500|$|Jardine {{asked me}} if I could bowl on the leg stump making the ball come up into the body all the time, so that Bradman had to play his shots to leg. [...] "Yes, I think that can be done", <b>I</b> <b>said...</b> <b>I</b> had no doubt of its purpose: we thought Don was frightened of sharp rising balls, and we {{reasoned}} that if he {{got a lot of}} them he would be... intimidated and eventually, having to direct his shots to leg all the time, would give a catch to one of the [...] fieldsmen".|$|E
500|$|On her Christmas Day 2007 {{television}} show, Martha Stewart {{exhibited the}} nativity scene she made in pottery {{classes at the}} Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia while serving a 2005 sentence. She remarked, [...] "Even though every inmate was only allowed to do one a month, and I was only there for five months, I begged because <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> was an expert potter—ceramicist actually—and could I please make the entire nativity scene." [...] She supplemented her nativity figurines on the show with tiny artificial palm trees imported from Germany.|$|E

500|$|Well, my {{favorite}} scene {{in all of}} Monroe's movies is when she does that dance sequence for 'Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'. And {{when it came time}} to do the video for the song , <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> can just redo that whole scene and it will be perfect. [...] Marilyn was made into something not human in a way, and I can relate to that. Her sexuality was something everyone was obsessed with and that I can relate to. And there were certain things about her vulnerability that I'm curious about and attracted to.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, he {{describes}} how one {{was an old}} friend who was keen to have children but feared she {{was running out of}} time. [...] "We had never been involved romantically but I knew her well enough to know she would be a wonderful mother and so <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> would like to be the father of her children." [...] A daughter was born in 1990, and another in 1992. Then another friend said she'd like to have children: [...] "And we agreed to have a baby." [...] Their son was born within weeks of his daughter in 1992.|$|E
500|$|As the Nixon {{presidency}} slowly collapsed, Voorhis {{spoke out}} more frequently. In 1972, he said, [...] "Sour grapes {{to criticize the}} man who beat me, but I just wouldn't be human if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> liked spending {{the second half of}} my life as 'the man who Nixon beat'". After Nixon resigned as President, Voorhis, noted, [...] "Here is the philosophy of doing-anything-to-win receiving its just and proper reward." [...] Voorhis, believing he had been labeled a subversive by Nixon, [...] "took some satisfaction" [...] in stating that Nixon himself had been the subversive, seeking, according to Voorhis, to impose [...] "a virtual dictatorship" [...] on the country.|$|E
