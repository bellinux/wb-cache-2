40|$|In {{this paper}} we suggest a revisionist {{perspective}} on two significant figures in early modern life science and philosophy: William Harvey and John Locke. Harvey, the discoverer of {{the circulation of}} the blood, is often named {{as one of the}} rare representatives of the ‘life sciences’ who was a major figure in the Scientific Revolution. While this status itself is problematic, we would like to call attention to a different kind of problem: Harvey dislikes abstraction and controlled experiments (aside from the ligature experiment in De Motu Cordis), tends to <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> instruments such as the microscope, and emphasizes instead the privileged status of ‘observed experience’. To use a contemporary term, Harvey appears to rely on, and chiefly value, ‘tacit knowledge’. Secondly, Locke’s project is often explained with reference to the image he uses in the Epistle to the Reader of his Essay, that he was an “underlabourer” of the sciences. In fact, despite the significant medical phase of his career, Locke’s ‘empiricism’ turns out to be above all a practical (i. e. ‘moral’) project, which focuses on the delimitation of our powers in order to achieve happiness, and rejects the possibility of naturalizing knowledge. When combined, these two cases suggest a different view of some canonical moments in early modern natural philosophy...|$|R

40|$|Hurricane Katrina did massive damage because New Orleans and the Gulf Coast {{were not}} {{appropriately}} protected. Wherever natural disasters threaten, the government – in its traditional role as public goods provider – must decide {{what level of}} protection to provide to an area. It does so by purchasing protective capital, such as levees for a low-lying city. (“Protection” also consists of not imposing threats that raise risk levels, such as draining swamps, or enhance losses, such as building in high-risk areas.) We show that if private capital {{is more likely to}} locate in better-protected areas, then <b>the</b> marginal social <b>value</b> <b>of</b> protection will increase with the level of protection provided. That is, the benefit function is convex, contrary to the normal assumption of concavity. When the government protects and the private sector invests, due to the ill-behaved nature of the benefit function, there may be multiple Nash equilibria. Policy makers must compare them, rather than merely follow local optimality conditions, to find the equilibrium offering the highest social welfare. There is usually considerable uncertainty about the amount of investment that will accompany any level of protection, further complicating the government’s choice problem. We show that when deciding on the current level of protection, the government must take account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> option <b>value</b> <b>of</b> increasing <b>the</b> level of protection in the future.

40|$|Healthcare is {{changing}} as evidence-based medicine (EBM) is incorporated into education and practice. This article considers {{the hierarchy of}} evidence, the validation of evidence for decision making {{and the extent to}} which this includes aspects of cultural and social constructs of health. We review the influence and the methodology of EBM as it is applied to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and suggest that there is an uneasy relationship as the two approaches to health have divergent understandings of health and evidence. There are fundamental philosophical and epistemological differences between orthodox and complementary medicine and we suggest that EBM is limited in how it can be applied to CAM. We question how the two approaches to healthcare can work together to create optimal outcomes in practice. The movement towards evidence-based practice underscores the division between biomedicine and CAM. Historically, there has been little scientific research into CAM, largely because of its place as a `fringe 2 ̆ 7 profession. Most research is funded by private sector interests who might see the economic benefit of a certain procedure or product. The research culture that has developed has been one that emphasises an evidence-based approach to establishing the efficacy of single herbs and nutrients, which overlooks the way that complementary therapists use these substances. The review concludes with a concern that the relationship between EBM and complementary medicine may become unbalanced, and the proponents of one system ignore or <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other. This lack of cross-paradigmatic respect is the wellspring for division and suspicion that is currently permeating the arranged marriage between CAM and EBM...|$|R

40|$|This {{literature}} review explores psychotherapeutic and Buddhist psychological approaches to non-attachment {{as the means}} of working with attachment and identification. Although both psychotherapy and Buddhist psychology are united in the view that attachments and identification are central to suffering, differences {{are evident in the}} way in which each discipline views the role of attachment and identification in terms of their contribution to suffering, and also {{in the way in which}} a release from such suffering might be facilitated. Psychotherapy views identification and attachment as having both positive and negative attributes in their contribution to the development of a healthy sense of self. In contrast, Buddhist psychology views all identification as problematic as a result of its contribution to the creation of fixation with a deluded sense of self. Whilst not <b>dismissing</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> attachment, Buddhist psychology does, however, view the motivations behind an individual’s attachments as the cause of suffering. In this context, particular attention is paid to identifications with the self, with past or with others that harm the client’s health and wellbeing. The writer suggests that helping clients to let go of fixed identifications (or attachments) will help them to create space for a new, freer and healthier experience of self and other within the psychotherapeutic relationship and beyond. This process of letting go (non-attachment) may have particular relevance in regard to how psychotherapists might work toward the alleviation of client’s suffering through the alteration of their mental experience of self, other, and objects (identification), and the reduction of their fixation with or ”clinging” to emotional content (attachment). It is in this way that Buddhist psychology offers the possibility of augmenting psychotherapy in the resolution of client suffering (Dockett, Dudley-Grant & Bankart, 2003) through assisting the individual to move beyond their notion of self, into the freedom of selflessness, encounter with the other, and non-attachment...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a discursive analysis of young people’s sexual health in contemporary Australia, engaging {{with data from}} health promotion, social sciences, and interviews with young people. Data comprises: Australian sexual health websites for young people (N= 3); research papers on young people and chlamydia in Australia, published from 2005 - 2009 (N= 18); and interviews with young people aged 18 - 25, from Sydney (N= 12). Using Michel de Certeau’s theory of everyday practice (1988), I explore young people’s experiences and knowledges of sexual health and how these exceed formal health understandings. I demonstrate how risk-based approaches typically deny young people’s sexual health competencies and <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> friendship and social networks. I propose revision of this deficit understanding of young people through an everyday practice based approach to sexual health. This differs from behavioural science approaches that can abstract young people’s sex practices from {{the context of their}} socio-sexual relations. Considering young people’s competencies and tactics in negotiating sex, I argue that these can inform health promotion strategies, making them more relevant and useful to young people. Early chapters analyse discourses of young people’s experience, risk and knowledge in these data, as key terms that justify young people’s inclusion in Australian sexual health policy. Later chapters explore discourses of pleasure and intimacies, including friendship intimacies. These commonly feature in interview data where participants’ stories highlight the spatial aspects of sex practices and negotiations. These often extend beyond sexual scenarios and into friendships. My thesis demonstrates how young people’s negotiations of safety encompass and exceed formal notions of ‘safe sex’, and draws a parallel between negotiations of safety and pleasure. I argue that a focus on safety is more useful than risk-based approaches, as it incorporates shared <b>values</b> <b>of</b> young people, health promotion, and sexual health research. Young people do not share a deficit understanding of their skills and practices, but are invested in sexual safeties, with common interview discussions of intimacy and its affordances. Finally, a case study of young people’s social media practices is presented, further highlighting friendship’s value to young people’s sexual health negotiations...|$|R
40|$|The twin {{concepts}} of zooprophylaxis and the dilution effect originated with vector-borne diseases (malaria), were driven forward by studies on Lyme borreliosis and have now developed into the mantra "biodiversity protects against disease". The basic {{idea is that}} by diluting the assemblage of transmission-competent hosts with non-competent hosts, the probability of vectors feeding on transmission-competent hosts is reduced and so the abundance of infected vectors is lowered. The same principle has recently been applied to other infectious disease systems - tick-borne, insect-borne, indirectly transmitted via intermediate hosts, directly transmitted. It is claimed {{that the presence of}} extra species of various sorts, acting through a variety of distinct mechanisms, causes the prevalence of infectious agents to decrease. Examination of the theoretical and empirical evidence for this hypothesis reveals that it applies only in certain circumstances even amongst tick-borne diseases, and even less often if considering the correct metric - abundance rather than prevalence of infected vectors. Whether dilution or amplification occurs depends more on specific community composition than on biodiversity per se.

40|$|E. L. Mascall's book The Christian Universe {{was chosen}} as {{as a basis for}} this thesis because the {{argument}} he presents there is a distinctively modern attempt to provide a justification for religious belief. Although it is not merely a reiteration of the traditional arguments, it is deployed in the same way to provide grounds for belief in God. While not <b>dismissing</b> or discounting <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> recent work done in clarifying uses of language in religious contexts [...] indeed, the methods and fruits of linguistic and conceptual analysis have been employed in interpreting and assessing the force of Mascall's argument [...] there remains the substantial question of whether engaging in religious discourse finally has any point. The impetus to investigate this problem - and thus Mascall's attempt to answer the problem - was gained from an article by- H. E. Root ("Beginning All Over Again," Soundings, A. R. Vidler (ed.), C. U. P., London, 1966). In it be upbraids Christian theologians who. suppose, they can justify their beliefs by reference to revelation. He points out that unless they can give a more appropriate reason for what they believe "there are no grounds for believing that a Christian scheme is preferable to some non-Christian one" and the choice between "Christianity and some other religion (or note) becomes arbitrary, irrational, even trivial" (p. 13). There are no easy solutions to this old problem of justifying belief in God. It is significant even to make a small advance in understanding what could provide such a justification. In treating Mascall's argument {{attention has been paid to}} the distinct notion, implied there, that the 'usefulness' of the belief [...] the function it performs in satisfying the human need for sense and meaning in life [...] is a basis, or part of a basis, for asserting that there is such a God, To treat grounds for belief in this way provides a. new insight into theistic argument.

40|$|Prophecy is rash, but it {{may well}} be that the {{publication}} of. D. T. Suzuki's first Essays in Zen Buddhism in 1927 will seem in future generations as great an intellectual event as William of Moerbeke's translations of Aristotle in the thirteenth century or Masiglio Ficino's of Plato in the fifteenth. But in Suzuki's case the shell of the Occident has been broken through. More than we dream, we are now governed by the new canon of the globe. " So wrote the prominent historian Lynn White, Jr. in 1956, as the West began its brief but intense infatuation with the work of Daisetsu Teitaro Suzuki. Carl Jung famously wrote the foreword to Suzuki's Introduction to Zen Buddhism. Students and professors filled up lecture halls and listened intently to every word. Philip Kapleau has acknowledged, "it is mainly the writings of Dr. Suzuki that have shaped the West's intellectual understanding of Zen. " It is impossible to begin studying Western attitudes towards Zen without coming across Suzuki's immense influence on the field. Suzuki's insistence that Zen was an experience incomprehensible to the intellect was critical to his success. Suzuki insisted that Zen could only be understood on its own terms. Here, Suzuki said, was an authentic religious tradition that was unconcerned with intellectualization. It was fiercely suspicious of any intellectual doctrine, placing complete faith in the individual's ability to work out his or her own salvation. Here, Suzuki said, was a religion that provided meaning without insisting upon belief. Suzuki's charisma and the simplicity of his message [...] that Zen is a religion aimed at grasping "the central fact of life as it is lived" [...] resonated deeply in Western circles. In recent years, scholars have critiqued Suzuki's vision of Zen as a timeless experience of reality. These scholars rightly point out that Suzuki undertook virtually no historical, political, or cultural analysis of Zen, thus creating an idealized version of Zen that glosses over the flaws and contradictions of the tradition. The trend in Zen scholarship today is to take a stance diametrically opposed to Suzuki. Engaging in the same intellectualization that Suzuki abhorred, scholars now critically analyze Zen, and often attempt to reduce Zen's claims to nothing more than a set of historical, political, and cultural factors. For these scholars, Suzuki was nothing more than a Zen apologist whose work should be discounted as a biased rendering of Zen doctrine inconsistent with the historical record of Zen as a social institution steeped in a specific time and place. In this thesis I argue that a middle path should be charted between these opposing stances. There is no reason why using one approach should mandate the exclusion of the other. Rather, both perspectives should be incorporated into a fuller, more inclusive approach to studying Zen. Suzuki's understanding of Zen, while flawed, should not be <b>dismissed</b> outright. <b>The</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> Suzuki's writings is that he managed to cogently interpret Zen's claims of an enlightened experience beyond the realm of intellectualization. While not advocating for the supremacy of Zen as Suzuki did, I maintain that his writings provide valuable insights into the tradition. By acknowledging <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> both perspectives, scholars will be able to undertake a more expansive and nuanced approach to studying Zen...|$|R

More specifically, the outcome sensitivity is the maximum difference among <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence, <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> perfect information is <b>the</b> expected <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence, and <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> control is <b>the</b> optimal <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>values</b> <b>of</b> evidence. We also discuss an implementation and a relative computational efficiency issues related to <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> evidence and <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> perfect information.
