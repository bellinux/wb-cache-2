5|$|The debris disk around Beta Pictoris is seen edge-on by {{observers}} on Earth, and is orientated in a northeast-southwest direction. The disk is asymmetric: in {{the northeast}} direction {{it has been observed}} out to 1835 astronomical units from the star, while the southwest direction the extent is 1450 AU. The disk is rotating: the part to the northeast of the star <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> away from Earth, while the part to the southwest of the disc <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> towards Earth.|$|E

When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up to the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{put forward}} the basic {{principle}} of relativity, {{that the laws}} of physics are the same in any system that <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> at a constant speed in a straight line, regardless of its particular speed or direction. Hence, there is no absolute motion or absolute rest. This principle provided the basic framework for Newton's laws of motion and is central to Einstein's special theory of relativity.|$|E

5|$|In Fig. 1, a body <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> along a {{specific}} curve MN acted on by a (centripetal) force, towards the fixed point S.

The method applies equally to the case where the force is centrifugal.|$|E
5|$|Since then, many {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} measuring such dragging coefficients, often {{in combination with the}} Sagnac effect.

5|$|The episode {{focuses on}} Betty Suarez (America Ferrera) {{struggling}} {{to tell her}} friend and boss, Daniel Meade (Eric Mabius) about her new job in London.

Wilhelmina Slater (Vanessa Williams) recovers from being shot by Tyler (Neal Bledsoe) and Amanda Tanen (Becki Newton) finally finds her father.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E

He discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond and is killed; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces {{that she is a}} CIA agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretence of being on leave.|$|E

5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at the speed of the Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
5|$|Electrons play an {{essential}} role in numerous physical phenomena, such as electricity, magnetism, chemistry and thermal conductivity, and they also participate in gravitational, electromagnetic and weak interactions. Since an electron has charge, it has a surrounding electric field, and if that electron <b>is</b> <b>moving</b> relative to an observer it will generate a magnetic field. Electromagnetic fields produced from other sources (not those self-produced) will affect the motion of an electron according to the Lorentz force law. Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when they are accelerated. Laboratory instruments are capable of trapping individual electrons as well as electron plasma by the use of electromagnetic fields. Special telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space. Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics, welding, cathode ray tubes, electron microscopes, radiation therapy, lasers, gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators.|$|E
