50|$|In 2005, the Case Assessment Management Program (CAMP) {{was added}} to the MEU and the Mental Illness Project as a mental illness <b>investigative</b> <b>follow-up</b> team. Staffed by sworn {{investigators}} and LACDMH clinicians, its primary function is to identify those persons suffering from a mental illness, who make frequent use of police and fire emergency services, and/or who are at risk for violent encounters with police officers, e.g. Target School Violence, Suicide Jumpers, and Suicide by Cop (SbC).|$|E
50|$|In April 2012, {{the company}} {{released}} its Policy Management solution, which enables organizations to use platform-level collaboration tools to create, distribute and manage company policies, track employee attestation, and know which {{version of a}} policy was in effect at any given time. In 2013, the company introduced a companion product to the Incident Management solution, CAPA/Remediation, designed to manage <b>investigative</b> <b>follow-up</b> and remedial tasks, {{as well as a}} Compliance Management solution designed for compliance risk assessment and employee survey management.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Crime {{policy is}} subject to the policy process just like other {{governmental}} policies. An effective crime policy is one that reduces the amount of crime in a police department’s jurisdiction, e. g., the city. Accordingly, crime policy consists of the same policy components – agenda setting, formulation, implementation, and feedback. The implementation of any crime policy depends on the information collected by police departments, often through crimes reported to the department via 9 - 1 - 1 calls or brought to a police officer’s attention through proactive police work. The success of that police work relative to the reported crime first depends on whether the type of crime is recorded correctly so that <b>investigative</b> <b>follow-up,</b> if necessary, can be conducted efficiently and properly. Accordingly, police departments that have appropriate internal controls to assess the quality of their crime recording efforts can provide relevant feedback to the command staff and political leaders responsible for setting the agenda and reformulating policy when necessary. This paper will examine the Atlanta Police Department’s efforts in improving its crime recording procedures in 2002 - 200...|$|E

The division serves citizens with <b>follow-up</b> <b>investigative,</b> warrant, and intelligence-gathering services. Specifically, it investigates crimes including homicide, domestic violence, computer fraud, forgery, sexual assault, and more. CID also addresses child support enforcement issues.|$|R
40|$|Following our {{previous}} field surveys for strongyloidiasis in western Uganda, 120 mothers and 232 children from four villages in eastern Uganda were examined, with two subsequent <b>investigative</b> <b>follow-ups.</b> As before, {{a variety of}} diagnostic methods were used: Baermann concentration, Koga agar plate and strongyloidid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), as well as Kato-Katz faecal smears for detection of eggs of other helminths. At baseline, the general prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis was moderate: 5. 4 % as estimated by Baermann and Koga agar methods combined. A much higher estimate was found by ELISA (42. 3 %) which, in this eastern setting, appeared to be confounded by putative cross-reaction(s) with other nematode infections. Preventive chemotherapy using praziquantel and albendazole was offered to all participants at baseline. After 21 days the first follow-up was conducted and 'cure rates' were calculated for all parasites encountered. Eleven months later, the second follow-up assessed longer-term trends. Initial treatments had little, if any, effect on S. stercoralis, and did not alter local prevalence, unlike hookworm infections and intestinal schistosomiasis. We propose that geographical patterns of strongyloidiasis are likely not perturbed by ongoing praziquantel/albendazole campaigns. Antibody titres increased after the first follow-up then regressed towards baseline levels upon second inspection. To better define endemic areas for S. stercoralis, careful interpretation of the ELISA is warranted, especially where diagnosis is likely being confounded by polyparasitism and/or other treatment regimens; new molecular screening tools are clearly needed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundRaised patient {{expectations}} and the 2 -week rule {{for the investigation}} of suspected malignancy have led to heightened demands on surgical outpatient clinics. In this context, the utility of benign post-operative or <b>investigative</b> <b>follow-ups</b> requires justification. MethodsThe surgical outpatient clinic workload of four substantive general surgeons at a typical DGH was analysed over a 4 -week period. All notes were examined to identify referral source, management plan and whether that clinic attendance was justified. ResultsTwenty three clinics (410 patients) were examined over the period of this study. Three hundred and twenty one patient episodes were examined; 52 episodes did not occur due to patient non-attendance and 37 episodes were not accounted for (‘missing/incomplete data’). Thirty three {{percent of the patients}} underwent consultant review whilst 57 % were reviewed by middle grade surgeons and 9 % by SHO/ST 2 doctors. Forty eight percent of the consultations were new referrals: 37 % of these patients were added to the elective surgical waiting list. One hundred and sixty eight follow-up consultations occurred, which included cancer patients (6 %), review patients (12 %), patients attending for investigative results (13 %) and benign post-operative follow-ups (22 %). Forty six of the 69 (66 %) post-operative follow-ups were deemed unnecessary as patients were being seen after benign procedures (hernia repair, anorectal surgery or laparoscopic cholecystectomy). ConclusionOver 50 % attendances (21 / 41) for ‘normal’ results could have been avoided by the use of a directed informative letter. Outpatient clinics are an important resource whose usage must be optimised...|$|R
