25|$|In late April 1861, four Confederate half dollars {{were struck}} on a <b>hand</b> <b>press</b> by certain {{employees}} of the New Orleans Mint. Because of the high relief of the coin die, a test striking was made to see if coins would release from the Confederate die. The die was made by a printing plate engraver (A.H.M. Peterson) in New Orleans who was unfamiliar with techniques required to engrave coining dies. These coins were struck using a U.S. obverse die (Seated Liberty) and the Confederate die made by Peterson. These coins are known as originals, {{and the location of}} all four of the coins is known today.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the fall}} and winter of 1902, word of the gold strike and the new {{settlement}} spread throughout Alaska and the Yukon. Printer George M. Hill, who had been working in Dawson City, packed up his small press and traveled to Fairbanks in early 1903. On September 19, 1903, he printed the first newspaper in the new settlement: Volume I, Issue I of the Weekly Fairbanks News. Little is known about Hill's operation, but he likely used either a Washington <b>Hand</b> <b>Press</b> or an [...] "Army" [...] press — both were small machines designed for transport on a single pack horse or pack mule. Single copies of the first editions of the paper were [...] $0.25 each, or $10 for a year's subscription. The paper was 10pages and had multiple advertisements, including one proclaiming that an election would be held on November 10 of that year for the purpose of incorporating the town. On the front page was a statement of policy: ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1891, young Edward Cox {{purchased}} the Telegram, a weekly newspaper in Hartford City, Indiana. The purchase was made with the financial assistance of a second investor. Thus, Cox began a long career as a newspaper publisher and editor. The Telegram's printing facilities were located {{in the back room}} of a drugstore, with about [...] of space. Initially, Cox used a Washington <b>Hand</b> <b>Press</b> to produce his newspaper. [...] The Washington <b>Hand</b> <b>Press</b> was roughly 70-year-old technology, and it took all day for him to print an edition, even with his newspaper's small circulation. Other related equipment was also crude. [...] This was also a significant year in Cox's personal life, as he married Eldora [...] "Dora" [...] Sites in September.|$|E
2500|$|Two ideas {{altered the}} design of the {{printing}} press radically: First, the use of steam power for running the machinery, and second the replacement of the printing flatbed with the rotary motion of cylinders. Both elements were for the first time successfully implemented by the German printer Friedrich Koenig in a series of press designs devised between 1802 and 1818. Having moved to London in 1804, Koenig soon met Thomas Bensley and secured financial support for his project in 1807. Patented in 1810, Koenig had designed a steam press [...] "much like a <b>hand</b> <b>press</b> connected to a steam engine." [...] The first production trial of this model occurred in April 1811. He produced his machine with assistance from German engineer Andreas Friedrich Bauer.|$|E
2500|$|The Telefon Hírmondó news {{collection}} practices {{closely followed}} those commonly employed by print newspapers. A reporter would compose {{a story and}} submit it to the chief, who would sign it to fix responsibility. A clerk would then carefully copy the text with lithographic ink onto long galley slips which were transferred to a lithography stone, to be printed in parallel columns 6inches wide and two feet long (16cm x 60cm). Then, two pressmen would take a number of impressions on a roller-movement <b>hand</b> <b>press,</b> using common printing paper. Each sheet was proofread by an assistant editor, with help of a copyholder. The verified sheet comprised part of the daily programme, and {{was added to the}} day's file along with the other sheets. A duplicate was cut up into convenient strips for the reading by the stentors.|$|E

2500|$|The Gutenberg {{press was}} much more {{efficient}} than manual copying. It remained largely unchanged in the eras of John Baskerville and Giambattista Bodoni, over 300 years later. By 1800, Lord Stanhope had constructed a press completely from cast iron, reducing the force required by 90% while doubling {{the size of the}} printed area. While Stanhope's [...] "mechanical theory" [...] had improved the efficiency of the press, it was only capable of 250 sheets per hour. German printer Friedrich Koenig was the first to design a non-manpowered machine—using steam. He moved to London in 1804, and met Thomas Bensley; he secured financial support for his project in 1807. With a patent in 1810, Koenig designed a steam press [...] "much like a <b>hand</b> <b>press</b> connected to a steam engine."

60|$|When I {{wrote the}} essay on Edmund Spenser {{the company of}} Irish players who have now their stage at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin had been founded, but gave as yet few {{performances}} in a twelvemonth. I could let my thought stray where it would, and even give a couple of summers to The Faerie Queene; while for some ten years now I have written little verse and no prose that did not arise out of some need of those players or some thought suggested by their work, or {{was written in the}} defence of some friend whose life {{has been a part of}} the movement of events which is creating a new Ireland unintelligible to an old Ireland that watches with anger or indifference. The detailed defence of plays and players, published originally in Samhain, the occasional periodical of the theatre, and now making some three hundred pages of Mr. Bullen's collected edition of my writings, is not here, but for the most part an exposition of principles, whether suggested by my own work or by the death of friend or fellow-worker, that, intended for no great public, has been printed and published from a <b>Hand</b> <b>Press</b> which my sisters manage at Dundrum with the help of the village girls. I have been busy with a single art, that of the theatre, of a small, unpopular theatre; and this art may well seem to practical men, busy with some programme of industrial or political regeneration, of no more account than the shaping of an agate; and yet in the shaping of an agate, whether in the cutting or the making of the design, one discovers, if one have a speculative mind, thoughts that seem important and principles that may be applied to life itself, and certainly if one does not believe so, one is but a poor cutter of so hard a stone.|$|E
