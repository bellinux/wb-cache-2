The sand with the pre-treated waste and/or fuel is kept suspended on pumped air currents and takes on a fluid-like character.

40|$|International audienceFluorocarbon gases (gFCs) {{were found}} to inhibit the liquid-expanded (LE) /liquid-condensed (LC) phase {{transition}} of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) Langmuir monolayers. The formation of domains of an LC phase, which typically occurs in the LE/LC coexistence region upon compression of DPPC, is prevented when the atmosphere above the DPPC monolayer is saturated with a gFC. When contacted with gFC, the DPPC monolayer remains in the LE phase for surface pressures lower than 38 mN m(- 1), as assessed by compression isotherms and fluorescence microscopy (FM). Moreover, gFCs can induce the dissolution of preexisting LC phase domains and facilitate the respreading of the DPPC molecules on the water surface, as shown by FM and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction. gFCs have thus a highly effective <b>fluidizing</b> effect on the DPPC monolayer. This gFC-induced <b>fluidizing</b> effect was compared with the <b>fluidizing</b> effect brought about by a mixture of unsaturated lipids and proteins, namely the two commercially available lung surfactant substitutes, Curosurf and Survanta, which are derived from porcine and bovine lung extracts, respectively. The candidate FCs were chosen among those already investigated for biomedical applications, and in particular for intravascular oxygen transport, i. e., perfluorooctyl bromide, perfluorooctylethane, bis(perfluorobutyl) ethene, perfluorodecalin, and perfluorooctane. The <b>fluidizing</b> effect is most effective with the linear FCs.

25|$|From the {{expression}} above, {{it is seen}} that the van der Waals force decreases with decreasing size of bodies (R). Nevertheless, the strength of inertial forces, such as gravity and drag/lift, decrease to a greater extent. Consequently, the van der Waals forces become dominant for collections of very small particles such as very fine-grained dry powders (where there are no capillary forces present) even though the force of attraction is smaller in magnitude {{than it is for}} larger particles of the same substance. Such powders are said to be cohesive, meaning they are not as easily <b>fluidized</b> or pneumatically conveyed as their more coarse-grained counterparts.

Somewhere between these two end members exists the conditions that support densely populated and diverse communities of chemosynthetic organisms (microbial mats, siboglinid tube worms, bathymodioline mussels, lucinid and vesycomyid clams, and associated organisms). These areas are frequently associated with surface or near-surface gas hydrate deposits. They also have localized areas of lithified seafloor, generally authigenic carbonates but sometimes more exotic minerals such as barite are present.|$|E

Further applications of XDEM include thermal conversion of biomass on a backward and forward acting grate. Heat transfer in a packed bed reactor was also investigated for hot air streaming upward through the packed bed to heat the particles, which dependent on position and size experience different heat transfer rates.

40|$|Four {{kinds of}} spherical {{materials}} with diameter between 0. 3 mm to 0. 6 mm were employed as floating internal in fast bed of cohesive particles to reduce agglomerate size and narrow the size distribution. The fast bed of cohesive particles with floating internals preserves basic <b>fluidizing</b> characteristics of fast fluidization. However, {{the size of}} agglomerates in fast beds of all four types of cohesive particles employed in experiments was notablely reduced. The effect of floating internals could be obviously observed only when the <b>fluidizing</b> gas velocity is higher than about 3 - 4 times of incipient <b>fluidizing</b> velocity of floating internals. This phenomenon may indicate an "active velocity" for floating internals to take effect. Under specific operating conditions and a matching between cohesive powder and floating internal, {{there will be a}} maximal agglomerate size that floating internals can break. This suggests a proper startup procedure for fast bed with floating internals to prevent the formation of oversize agglomerates. Methods for estimating the gas velocity at which floating internal take effect and the terminal velocity of floating internals and agglomerates were developed to give operating range of <b>fluidizing</b> gas velocity of fast bed with floating internals. A model for calculating maximal agglomerate size that floating internal can break was also developed, and an analysis on the influence of fast bed's operating conditions on the maximal size was made based on the model.
