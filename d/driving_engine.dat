50|$|The railway ran {{a tourist}} service until 1970, when {{on the night}} of the 2nd/3rdOctober the {{funicular}} cable was struck by lightning. This started a fire which destroyed the summit hotel and the <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> for the third section in its basement.As a result of this, and also the imminent expiry of the concession, the second funicular section stopped operating in 1974. Part of the <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> of this section can be seen today outside the summit buildings, while parts of two cars can still be seen at the former Bluematt station.|$|E

50|$|The V6 i-VTEC VCM engines feature {{improved}} {{fuel efficiency}} {{due to the}} Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system, which shuts off {{two or three of}} the cylinders {{depending on the type of}} driving (i.e. city driving, uphill/downhill <b>driving,</b> highway <b>driving).</b> <b>Engines</b> lacking VCM results in a decrease of 4 MPG in highway fuel economy.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the missile}} is {{five and a}} half meters away from the gunner, c. 0.3 seconds after leaving the launch tube, it {{activates}} the rocket sustainer motor. The sustainer motor takes it to a velocity of 430 meters per second, and sustains it at this speed. Once it reaches peak speed, at a distance of around 120 meters from the gunner, the final safety mechanism is disabled and the missile is fully armed. All told, the booster burns for 0.5 second and the <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> for another 2.0 seconds.|$|E
50|$|During {{the night}} of August 18-19, Roschek, {{together}} with another engineer, Andrzej Bogusz, arrived at the Otloczyn station, <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> number ST44-607, which belonged to the Chojnice depot. At around 2 a.m., the engine was connected to a few empty coal freight cars. The train then waited for two hours on a side track in the pine forest between Torun and Wloclawek before departing. Roschek's train {{was not included in}} any schedule. Like other trains of this kind, it was supposed to wait for the signal to go, which was only given when the track was clear.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} the rock cycle is usually attributed to James Hutton, from the eighteenth century Father of Geology. The rock cycle {{was a part of}} Hutton's uniformitarianism and his famous quote: no vestige of a beginning, and no prospect of an end, applied in particular to the rock cycle and the envisioned cyclical nature of geologic processes. This concept of a repetitive non-evolutionary rock cycle remained dominant until the plate tectonics revolution of the 1960s. With the developing understanding of the <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> of plate tectonics, the rock cycle changed from endlessly repetitive to a gradually evolving process. The Wilson cycle (a plate tectonics based rock cycle) was developed by J. Tuzo Wilson during the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
50|$|The Marshall {{steam engine}} {{was the main}} <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> for the saws in the mill, running a flat belt from its flywheel. It, {{along with the other}} steam engines in the mill, was powered by the Stirling boiler, which was fed with timber off cuts. The Stirling boiler was a water- tube boiler, in which the water to be heated was {{contained}} within tubes, with fire passing around the outside-in contrast to fire-tube boilers, which had fire passing through tubes which were surrounded by water. The water-tube type was favoured for larger boilers for safety reasons. Stirling water tube boilers were at their most popular in the early 1900s; many of the 30 or so installed in Victoria between 1904 and 1912 were large boilers for electrical power generation or larger manufacturers. Most activity regarding Stirling boiler installation in Queensland, based on newspaper advertising, appears to be between 1900 and 1914, and the Agent for Queensland in 1903 was Norman M Bell.|$|E
50|$|The opening movement, Roncesvalles, begins Path of Miracles at a {{geographically}} popular {{starting point}} for the pilgrimage. As the choir begins a mysterious glissando (termed Pasiputput, from the Bunun people), travel is ingrained in the stage direction, calling the tenors and basses from offstage to join the main choir. The aura is open and overwhelming as multiple languages and sound clusters of E major and E minor fill the air, finally climaxing with a fortissimo E minor chord featuring “bells,” played by crotales.Talbot uses ostinatos throughout the composition extensively, emulating the long walk endured by the pilgrims. Talbot also employs clashing tonalities, encapsulating the pain endured physically as well as the intense mental contemplation that a pilgrimage necessitates. While the basses drone pedal tones, a slow rhythmic transformation develops into a <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> that, with gradually shorter and more syncopated rhythms, propels the music forward.In all, Rocesvalles replays the life and martyrdom of St. James and conveys to how his body came to rest in Santiago.|$|E

5000|$|In 1986, Durell {{released}} Turbo Esprit, {{which had}} an official Lotus license, and featured working car indicator lights. Also in 1986, Sega produced Out Run, {{one of the}} most graphically impressive games of its time. It used two Motorola 68000 CPUs for its 2D sprite-based <b>driving</b> <b>engine,</b> and it became an instant classic that spawned many sequels. It was notable for giving the player the non-linear choice of which route to take through the game and the choice of soundtrack to listen to while driving, represented as radio stations. The game also featured up to five multiple endings depending on the route taken, and each one was an ending sequence rather than a simple [...] "Congratulations" [...] as was common in game endings at the time. That same year, Konami's WEC Le Mans was a race driving simulator that attempted to accurately simulate the 24 Hours of Le Mans competition, with fairly realistic handling, a day-night cycle, and the use of force feedback to simulate road vibration {{in the form of a}} vibrating steering wheel that reacts to the driver's acceleration and off-road bumps.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a complex control {{system in which}} a large-scale of devices are controlled by micro control units (MCUs) based on embedded TCP/IP, with emphasis on the management of these MCUs through one or more reusable driving engines. The number of the driving engines bases {{on the scale of}} the devices and the real-time requirement. For most cases, one <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> with one or more NICs （ Network Interface Cards ） is enough. Each device is controlled by a MCU to sample the device and the sampled data is delivered to applications through the <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> that receives the driving data from the applications and transmits it to the MCU to drive device. The <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> running on an industrial personal computer(IPC) communicates with the MCUs through the lower network, a TCP/IP network, while it communicates with the applications through the upper network, a TCP/IP network and(or) a reflective memory (RFM) network. The <b>driving</b> <b>engine</b> is a reusable software architecture and any number of MCUs can be integrated seamlessly in DLL(Dynamic Link Library) without any need to modify the architecture. To develop a new device control system, the only tasks is to implement the MCU embedded routines that must be done whenever any development methods applied and the MCU DLLs and then integrate the DLLs with the architecture. This MCU-based control method fits the man-in-loop simulators best with the most advantage of making the system wiring simple, elegant and clean than AD cards usually used and has some other beneficial features of software reusability, valid precision maintenance, more developing efficient, run-time and reliable performance.
