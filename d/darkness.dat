5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of <b>darkness,</b> initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the <b>darkness</b> away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the <b>darkness</b> faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the <b>darkness</b> protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of <b>darkness</b> remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger <b>darkness</b> may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, it disappears.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of <b>Darkness,</b> Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of <b>Darkness</b> and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of <b>Darkness</b> will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into <b>darkness.</b> While he is saying this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of <b>Darkness</b> must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E

60|$|Dream {{and waking}} {{thoughts}} were mingled like sky and cloud upon a windy day in April. Suddenly he saw again that lonely {{figure on the}} narrow way with <b>darknesses</b> above and <b>darknesses</b> below and <b>darknesses</b> on every hand. But {{this time it was}} not Sir Richmond.... Who was it? Surely it was Everyman. Everyman had to travel at last along that selfsame road, leaving love, leaving every task and every desire. But was it Everyman?... A great fear and horror came upon the doctor. That little figure was himself! And the book which was his particular task in life was still undone. He himself stood in his turn upon that lonely path with the engulfing <b>darknesses</b> about him....|$|R

5|$|Another likely {{literary}} {{source is}} the plague narrative in the Book of Exodus, in which Egypt {{is covered by}} <b>darkness</b> for three days. It {{has been suggested that}} the author of Matthew's gospel changed the Marcan text slightly to more closely match this source. Commentators have also drawn comparisons with the description of <b>darkness</b> in the Genesis creation narrative, with a prophecy regarding mid-day <b>darkness</b> by Jeremiah, and with an end-times prophecy in the Book of Zechariah.|$|E
5|$|Critic Andy Gill {{links the}} opening {{line of the}} song to the title of Arthur Koestler's bleak novel <b>Darkness</b> at Noon, set in the Great Stalinist purge of 1938 in Soviet Russia. For Gill, Dylan is {{suggesting}} that the human spirit can be cast into <b>darkness</b> by the dead hand of communism {{as well as by}} American capitalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{last show}} on 15 September 2001 saw {{many of the}} old {{features}} and presenters return including leprechauns Mr Sage and Mr Onion who acknowledged in the final few minutes of the show that they were the longest serving presenters of the show. The show then ended with Mr Onion pulling the 'Off' switch plunging the studio into <b>darkness.</b> A match was then struck revealing Cawood, Suttie, Farley and Deley standing in the <b>darkness.</b> After saying Missed It? Missed Out!', a reference to the show's former catchphrase, they blew the match out sending the studio back into <b>darkness</b> symbolising {{the end of the show}} and the end of an era.|$|E

5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The <b>Darkness,</b> {{and the world is}} merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The <b>Darkness</b> successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The <b>Darkness.</b> Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E
5|$|While riders queue {{they are}} shown three {{briefing}} videos featuring actor Renny Krupinski as a sinister man surrounded in <b>darkness,</b> who explains at length {{the physical and}} psychological effects of riding on Oblivion. Although based on scientific facts, his speeches are deliberately exaggerated with hyperbole and dark humour to give riders a sense of intimidation while preparing for Oblivion. The man remains unnamed throughout the videos, although the character was originally {{referred to as the}} Lord of <b>Darkness</b> during production. The final preshow video features a second character whose image appears inverted and therefore glowing white, who argues with the Lord of <b>Darkness</b> as to whether Oblivion is really safe for riders to experience; to which he is repeatedly ignored. The Lord of <b>Darkness</b> maintains that the ride is safe, before the video ends with the sound of his ominous laughter.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day {{to break up the}} Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing under the cover of <b>darkness,</b> they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the <b>darkness.</b> The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E

The group returns to Dimmsdale, where an Eliminator, dubbed a 'Hug'inator by Cosmo, crashes {{in front of them}} and spews out everyone who had been sucked in.

5|$|Aware of the {{critical}} buzz surrounding the show, BBC1 Controller, Michael Grade, quickly announced that the series would be repeated on BBC1, stating, “I think it will reach a wider audience and it deserves it”, and so Edge of <b>Darkness</b> was duly shown, in double episodes, over three consecutive nights between 19 December and 21 December 1985, the fastest time between original broadcast and repeat in the BBC's history. These repeats were accompanied by a disclaimer that the GAIA organisation depicted in the programme was not connected with the Gaia publishing company supported by Prince Philip. It was a move that paid off – Edge of <b>Darkness</b> doubled its audience on BBC1 to 8 million viewers.|$|E

5|$|Both Buddhism and the Lingbao School {{share the}} idea of the Five Paths of Rebirth (Gati). People were reborn into earth prisons, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, as a man, or as a {{celestial}} being. After death, the body would be alchemically refined in the Palace of Supreme <b>Darkness</b> located in the north, and the Southern Palace in the south. The transmutation of the body consisted of two steps; the yin components of the person were refined in the Palace of Supreme <b>Darkness,</b> followed by the yang components in the Southern Palace. The Lingbao concept of rebirth is a Chinese adaptation of Buddhism, mixing traditional Chinese concepts with newly arrived Buddhist ideas.|$|E
