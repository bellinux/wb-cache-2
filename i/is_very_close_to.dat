5|$|Since 2004, new glaciers {{have formed}} on the crater wall above Crater Glacier feeding rock and ice to Crater Glacier below.

Consequently, during the 2014–15 season, {{an expansion of}} the stadium was undertaken. The South Stand was extended {{with the addition of a}} third tier which, in conjunction with an additional three rows of pitch side seating, increased stadium capacity to approximately 55,000.

5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the tracks, such upgrades {{at the old}} station location would have been difficult. New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built {{just west of the}} former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E

Cyclone preparedness measures are inadequate for the 200,000residents of Sitakunda who were estimated to be living in high risk areas after the 1991 cyclone. For every 5,000 people, Sitakunda has only one cyclone shelter, each of which is capable of holding 50 to 60people. Syedpur Union has eleven, Muradpur eight, Baraiyadhala seven, and Kumira five. Sitakunda municipality, Barabkunda, Bhatiary and Bansbaria have four shelters each. Salimpur has three and Sonaichhari Union has two shelters.|$|E

The railway station with the shortest walk to Turf Moor is Burnley Manchester Road. The stadium is also accessible from Burnley Central station on the East Lancashire Line which, although it is physically closer to the ground, is a slightly further walk due to the street layout and the intervening river. There are also a number of bus services in the area, and Turf Moor <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Burnley Bus Station.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 {{census of}} Malaysia {{reported}} {{a population of}} 2,636,000 in Sarawak, making it the fourth most populous state. However, this population is distributed over a large area resulting in Sarawak having the lowest population density {{in the country with}} only 20people per km2. Although it has a low population density, the average population growth rate of 1.8%, from 2000 to 2010, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the national average of 2.0%. In 2014, 58% of the population resided in urban areas with the remainder in rural areas, but over the next 10 years it is predicted that the urban population would rise to 65%. , the crude birth rate in Sarawak was 16.3 per 1000 individuals, the crude death rate was 4.3 per 1000 population, and the infant mortality rate was 6.5 per 1000 live births.|$|E

5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{fate of the}} Universe {{is still}} unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index k and the cosmological constant Λ. If the Universe were sufficiently dense, k would equal +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the Universe will eventually recollapse in a Big Crunch, possibly starting a new Universe in a Big Bounce. Conversely, if the Universe were insufficiently dense, k would equal 0 or −1 and the Universe would expand forever, cooling off and eventually reaching the Big Freeze and the heat death of the Universe. Modern data suggests {{that the rate of}} expansion of the Universe is not decreasing, as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the Universe may eventually reach a Big Rip. Observationally, the Universe appears to be flat (k = 0), with an overall density that <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion.|$|E
5|$|Between Kintbury Lock and Newbury, passing to {{the north}} of Hamstead Marshall, the canal <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the Kennet Valley Alderwoods, the largest {{remaining}} fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet floodplain. The SSSI includes two woods– the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation– which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder (Alnus glutinosa); though ash (Fraxinus excelsior) is abundant in places and there is occasional oak (Quercus robur) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse bryophyte flora including the uncommon epiphytes Radula complanata, Zygodon viridissimus and Orthotrichum affine. Nearby is Irish Hill Copse. This site of coppiced ancient woodland includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet ash/maple and acid oak/ash/hazel woodland with aspen, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), with abundant herb paris (Paris quadrifolia), toothwort (Lathraea squamaria), Solomon's seal (Polygonatum multiflorum), twayblade and early purple orchids (Listera ovata) and Orchis mascula and, locally, wild daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus).|$|E
