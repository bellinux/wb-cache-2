40|$|Softening {{deformation}} of iron ore {{in the form}} of sinter, pellet, and lump ore in the cohesive zone of an ironmaking blast furnace is an important phenomenon that has a significant effect on gas permeability and consequently blast furnace production efficiency. The macroscopic softening deformation behavior of the bed and the microscopic deformation behavior of the individual particles in the packed bed are investigated in this study using wax balls to simulate the fused layer behavior of the cohesive zone. The effects of softening temperature, load pressure, and bed composition (mono - single melting particles, including pure or blend particles vs binary  two different melting point particles) on softening deformation are examined. The principal findings of this study are: 1. At low softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure increases the deformation rate almost linearly. 2. At higher softening temperatures, an increase in load pressure dramatically increases the deformation rate, and after a certain time there is no more significant change in deformation rate. 3. The bed deformation rate of a mono bed is much greater than that of a binary one. 4. In a binary system, the softening deformation rate increases almost proportionally with the increase in the amount of lower melting point wax balls. 5. In a mono system with blend particles, the content of the lower melting point material has a more significant effect on overall bed deformation than the higher melting point one. 6. The macro softening {{deformation of}} the bed behaves the theory of creep deformation. 7. A mathematical model for predicting bed porosity change due to softening deformation based on creep deformation theory has been developed. 8. Increase in load pressure also reduces the peak <b>contact</b> <b>face</b> number of the distribution curves, and this is more prominent with higher porosity values. 9. The contribution of <b>contact</b> <b>face</b> number to bed porosity reduction is more pronounced in a mono system than in a binary system. 10. The porosity reduction in a binary bed is more due to the <b>contact</b> <b>face</b> area increase, presumably of the lower melting point particles. 11. The mono system has a single peak <b>contact</b> <b>face</b> number distribution pattern while the binary system exhibits a bimodal distribution pattern once the higher melting point material starts to deform. 12. In a binary system, an increase in deformation condition severity tends to reduce the <b>contact</b> <b>face</b> number of the higher melting point material without having to increase the <b>contact</b> <b>face</b> number of the lower melting point material accordingly to achieve a given porosity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a composite element method (CEM) for discontinuous rock masses reinforced by fully grouted bolts. This element {{allows one to}} generate mesh without considering exactly the existence of bolts and joints, which further allows for an important simplification in the pre-process work. The sub-elements of rock, grout, bolt, joint, rock/grout interface and bolt/grout interface are defined using corresponding mapped nodal displacements at the composite element. The mapped nodal displacements can be determined using the governing equations established {{by means of the}} virtual work principle. Based on the mapped nodal displacements deformation and stress in each sub-element can be further obtained. The comparative study of the CEM and the conventional finite element method (FEM) has been carried out for the preliminary verification example.

40|$|For over 100 years, {{piston rings}} {{have been used}} in the {{internal}} combustion engine to create, during operation, a seal between the cylinder wall and the piston (Figure 1). In operation, the heat generated on the top ring, will cause the piston to deform and tilt. To accommodate with this effect, designers have improved the performance ring by applying a chamfer to the <b>contact</b> <b>face</b> of the ring to reduce the concentration of stress on the ring when the piston tilts (Figure 1). It can be found that the piston ring coatings (MoS 2 based) can lose structural integrity and state of the art rings incorporate a chamfer as shown in Figure 2 a, is to chamfer the coating on the ring <b>contact</b> <b>face</b> up to the substrate material. In the current design the coatings covers the full length of the chamfer which can lead to excessive stress concentration in A (Figure 2). This paper examines the effect of the contact chamfer and proposes a new solution to relieve active stress from the performance ring. Use of COMSOL Multiphysics: In operation, the piston ring is surrounded by gas acting on it, using effect of chamfer design has been considered using Love's equation in conjunction with Stone's equation for force ad Miler's equation for gas pressure modeling. Dimensional changes on the piston due to changes in thermodynamic and tilt created during BDC to TDC cycle generates stress concentration on A. Structural mechanic bloc from COMSOL has been used for the simulation where variables defined from (Love 1929; Mittler and Mierbach 2009; Neuber and Federhofer 1951; Stone and Ball 2004) equations. The chamfer geometry was controlled through variable inputs such as coating thickness, ring thickness, distance from the ring angle ring to cylinder to incorporate the tilt. The simulation has considered variables such as position, time to impact during contact between the cylinder liner and the piston ring coating. To better represents the two surfaces contacting a multiple meshing procedures. These procedures allows for the shearing process to simulate at 10, 000 rpm. COMSOL has enabled to generate a single simulation considering aspects mentioned above. Results: The results of this simulation confirmed ISO 6622 - 1 on dimensions for ring contact chamfer (Figure 4). When engine operate at 6, 000 to 12, 000 rpm localized high stresses are found on the <b>contact</b> chamfer <b>face</b> of the ring.
