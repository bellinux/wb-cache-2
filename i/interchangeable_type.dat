5000|$|On August 4, 1891, {{after several}} prototypes, Blickensderfer {{patented}} The Blickensderfer Type Writing Machine. The central component {{was the use}} of the cylindrical shaped <b>interchangeable</b> <b>type</b> element which he initially patented on July 15, 1890. An earlier variation to Blickensderfer's typewheel was introduced on the Crandall 1 typewriter in 1883 but Blickensderfer's genius was {{in the use of the}} typewheel combined with the simplicity and the small size of his machine. This invention was unlike anything else on the market and was considered a mechanical marvel that took typewriter engineering to a new level. Striking a key turned the wheel to the appropriate orientation while inking the typeface as it tipped downward past the ink roller to strike the paper. Holding the Cap or Fig keys shifted the typewheel along its axis to use either the middle row, for capital letters, or the lower row, for special characters and numbers.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and empirically explore a model of four {{intragroup}} conflict types (the 4 IC model), consisting of an emotional person, a cognitive task, an emotional task, and a cognitive person conflict. The two first conflict types are similar to existing conceptualizations, whereas the two latter represent new dimensions of group conflict. Design/methodology/approach - Based upon a heuristic distinction between cognition and emotion, the four conflict types are defined, and scales for measuring them are developed. The psychometric and statistical properties of the scales were analyzed by data collected from four company samples and two student samples (N = 208). The validity of the constructs was evaluated by comparing them with similar constructs, in particular, the Intragroup Conflict Scale (ICS), developed by Jehn (1995). Findings - A theory driven exploratory factor analysis elicited a 19 -item structure of four reliable factors, representing the four conflict types. A confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated satisfactory properties of the data matrix compared with the proposed model. Furthermore, a refined 12 -item scale was developed to consider the validity of the 4 IC, with reasonably satisfactory findings. Research limitations/implications - Limitations concerning sample size, wording of items, the demarcation between conflict types and conflict approaches, and the robustness of the constructs are discussed. We suggest that researchers may find the model useful for future studies of conflict in groups. Practical implications - Our model may be of assistance in handling conflicts in organizations. In particular, managers and employees may become aware that emotional conflicts are not always associated with relational or person oriented issues; they may as well concern task oriented issues. Furthermore, cognitive conflicts do not always have to be task oriented; they may also concern relational or person oriented issues. The introduction of the emotional task oriented and the cognitive person oriented conflict types may thus extend the conflict management tool box for managers and employees.

5000|$|The {{original}} M1 and M1A1 rocket launchers were {{equipped with}} simple fixed sights {{and used a}} launch tube without reinforcements. During the war, the M1A1 received a number of running modifications. The battery specification was changed to a larger, standard battery cell size, resulting in complaints of batteries getting stuck in the wood shoulder rest (the compartment was later reamed out to accommodate the larger cells). The M1 and M1A1 used a rear iron sight and a front rectangular [...] "ladder" [...] sight positioned at the muzzle. The vertical sides of the ladder sight were inscribed with graduations of 100, 200, 300, and 400 yards, with the user elevating the bazooka so the rear sight lined up with the selected [...] "rung" [...] on the front sight. On the M9, the ladder sight {{was replaced by the}} General Electric T43 aperture sight. Ranging was accomplished by looking through the rear sight's peep hole while rotating the assembly (which had graduations of 100, 200, and 300 yards) so it lined up with the blade positioned at the muzzle. In September 1944, during the production of the M9A1, the T43 sight was replaced by the Polaroid T90 optical reflector sight, which used an etched reticle for aiming.

40|$|The {{intergenic region}} {{internal}} ribosome entry site (IGR IRES) of the Dicistroviridae viral family can directly assemble 80 S ribosomes and initiate translation at a non-AUG codon from the ribosomal A-site. These functions are directed by two independently folded domains of the IGR IRES. One domain, composed of overlapping pseudoknots II and III (PKII/III), mediates ribosome recruitment. The second domain, composed of PKI, mimics a tRNA anticodon–codon interaction {{to position the}} ribosome at the ribosomal A-site. Although adopting a common secondary structure, the dicistrovirus IGR IRESs can be grouped into two classes based on distinct features within each domain. In this study, {{we report on the}} modularity of the IGR IRESs and show that the ribosome-binding domain and the tRNA anticodon mimicry domain are functionally <b>interchangeable</b> between the <b>Type</b> I and the Type II IGR IRESs. Using structural probing, ribosome-binding assays, and ribosome positioning analysis by toeprinting assays, we show that the chimeric IRESs fold properly, assemble 80 S ribosomes, and can mediate IRES translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. We also demonstrate that the chimeric IRESs can stimulate the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of eEF 2, which suggests that the ribosome is primed for a step downstream from IRES binding. Overall, the results demonstrate that the dicistrovirus IGR IRESs are composed of two modular domains that work in concert to manipulate the ribosome and direct translation initiation...|$|R

40|$|All {{over the}} world, {{wildfires}} {{have a big}} economic, social and environmental impact. It is expected that climate change will result in more frequent, large, catastrophic wildfires. Responding to these large wildfires is a difficult task with high stakes. Incident management teams (IMTs) managing the response to large, escaped wildfires operate in high-pressure environments where they must make complex, time-critical decisions under fast moving, changing conditions. Past research on providing decision support to IMTs focused on modelling initial attack, fire line construction, pre-incident deployment and longer-term planning. However, on days of extreme fire weather, when large fires are burning in hot, dry and windy conditions, fire suppression may be both ineffective and unsafe. The aim of this thesis is {{to address the problem}} of assigning resources to alternative tasks besides direct fire suppression. A description of the wildfire resource assignment problem is presented. A mixed-integer programming model is formulated to capture features that are unique to the problem of protecting assets during wildfires. The formulated model generalises the team orienteering problem with time windows, allowing for mixed vehicle <b>types,</b> <b>interchangeable</b> and complementary vehicle capabilities, and travel times which are determined by vehicle specific speed and road network information. The protection requirements of locations are defined in terms of vehicle capabilities. Two approaches are presented to deal with the dynamic nature of wildfire planning: a dynamic rerouting approach and a two-stage stochastic programming approach. The rerouting approach is appropriate when disruptions are unexpected. The aim is to reassign vehicle in a manner that minimises changes to current vehicle assignment. The stochastic approach uses likelihood estimates for fire spread scenarios. Initial vehicle assignments are made in the first stage with the opportunity for adjustments in the second stage based on observed fire-weather outcomes. The proposed approaches resulted in a set of complementary models for wildfire resource assignment. They can, among other, account for mixed vehicle capabilities, handle unexpected changes and incorporate fire spread scenario likelihoods. The models are computationally feasible and have the potential to provide real-time decision support to IMTs...|$|R
