40|$|A new {{equipment}} was installed for fission product annealing tests of spherical HTR fuel elements. An already existing high frequency furnace and two new resistance furnaces were connected with their helium sweep circuits {{in such an}} way, that {{at a given time}} the fission gas release from two of the furnaces can be monitored independently. The resistance furnaces are capable to reach temperatures of 25 OO°C. The diversity of the safety design of the cooling system and an automatic temperature setting render possible long-term tests without operating personnel. Depending upon the scope, various operation sequences can be chosen. Fission gas annealing tests at irradiation temperatures to determine <b>failure</b> <b>quota</b> are normal experimental routine. High-temperature tests,however, to investigate the endurance of particles and fuel elements, the measurement of the release of solid fission products and fission gas release measurements on activated specimens are still in the status of trial...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{technical}} development focused on real-time heart rate monitoring instead of postexercise evaluation of recorded data. There are several systems {{on the market}} that allow direct and real-time monitoring of several individuals at the same time. The present study compared the systems of Polar, Acentas, Activio, and Suunto in a field test with twelve subjects regarding <b>failure</b> <b>quota,</b> operating distance, and ECG validity. Moreover, the installation and use of software and hardware were evaluated with a quality rating system. Chest belts were evaluated with a questionnaire, too. Overall the system of Acentas reached the best mark of all systems, but detailed results showed that every system has its advantages and disadvantages depending on using purpose, location, and weather. So this evaluation cannot recommend a single system but rather shows strength and weakness of all systems and additionally {{can be used for}} further system improvements...|$|E

40|$|Technical {{change is}} {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} rate and biases, both evaluated for given producer prices. This paper examines the potential discrepancy between this rate and the corresponding rate of consumer welfare change as measured by Allais distributable surplus. We postulate a general equilibrium context with various market <b>failures</b> (taxes, <b>quotas,</b> imperfect competition, and “poorly priced” commodities), and use comparative statics to express the rate of welfare change {{in terms of the}} rate and biases of the technical change. An elementary simulation model of a taxed economy suggests that the rate of welfare change may differ from the rate of technical change by as much as 50 % under plausible circumstances.

50|$|In France, a {{bill was}} passed in 2011 {{requiring}} 40% female directorship by 2016. This quota is to be implemented on two schedules, one for private companies and one for public companies. Public companies will require 20% female board representation within three years, and 40% within six years. Private companies will have nine years to reach the 40% <b>quota.</b> <b>Failure</b> to comply with these schedules will result in voided nominations and suspended remuneration of board members.|$|R
40|$|Global {{recession}} {{has a negative}} impact also on {{the countries of the}} region which have not been European Union members, yet. After the years of growth the Slovak economy has noted a significant decrease. After nine years the GDP of the country noted an inter-year decrease. The economy has been noted by implications of the world economic depression. Mainly the less industrial production has contributed to the decrease of the economy, because of the lower orders from abroad as well as <b>failure</b> of delivery <b>quotas</b> from Russia in January...|$|R
50|$|While {{making a}} massive leap in {{industrial}} capacity, the first Five Year Plan was extremely harsh on industrial workers; quotas {{were difficult to}} fulfill, requiring that miners put in 16- to 18-hour workdays. <b>Failure</b> to fulfill <b>quotas</b> could result in treason charges. Working conditions were poor, even hazardous. Due to the allocation of resources for industry along with decreasing productivity since collectivization, a famine occurred. In {{the construction of the}} industrial complexes, inmates of Gulag camps were used as expendable resources. But conditions improved rapidly during the second plan. Throughout the 1930s, industrialization was combined with a rapid expansion of technical and engineering education as well as increasing emphasis on munitions.|$|R
5000|$|In May 1935 Astbury {{was one of}} five Conservative MPs who {{resigned}} the National Government whip. They felt {{they could no longer}} support the government over their <b>failure</b> to impose <b>quotas</b> or prohibitions on imports of textile goods from India and Burma, threatening the commerce of Lancashire. The group also felt that the National Government, supported in the main by Conservative members, had passed too much [...] "Socialist" [...] legislation, such as that creating the London Passenger Transport Board. He was summoned to a meeting of the West Salford Conservative and Unionist Association to explain his position, having first organised a meeting of his constituents which unanimously approved his actions. A decision on whether he would be adopted as the Conservative candidate at the next election was avoided when he announced he would not be seeking re-election due to poor health.|$|R
40|$|Many fishery {{management}} tools currently in use have conservation value. They {{are designed to}} maintain stocks of commercially important species above target levels. However, their limitations are evident from continuing declines in fish stocks throughout the world. We {{make the case that}} to reverse fishery declines, safeguard marine life and sustain ecosystem processes, extensive marine reserves that are off limits to fishing must become part of the management strategy. Marine reserves should be incorporated into modern {{fishery management}} because they can achieve many things that conventional tools cannot. Only complete and permanent protection from fishing can protect the most sensitive habitats and vulnerable species. Only reserves will allow the development of natural, extended age structures of target species, maintain their genetic variability and prevent deleterious evolutionary change from the effects of fishing. Species with natural age structures will sustain higher rates of reproduction and will be more resilient to environmental variability. Higher stock levels maintained by reserves will provide insurance against management <b>failure,</b> including risk-prone <b>quota</b> setting, provided the broader conservation role of reserves is firmly established and legislatively protected. Fishery management measures outside protected areas are necessary to complement the protection offered by marine reserves, but cannot substitute for it...|$|R
40|$|The European common {{fisheries}} policy (CFP) advocates measures to sustain small-scale fisheries; hence, in the European Commission's {{proposal for a}} reformed CFP, these are exempted from a mandatory system with tradable fishing concessions. This opens up for management actions designed for small-scale fisheries, but also implies new management issues. This article provides insights into the topic based on a Swedish small-scale herring fishery in the western Baltic Sea that was exempted from an ITQ-system. The fishery has been profitable since the system was introduced, and the increasing effort of both incumbent fishermen and new entrants implies a situation where fishermen compete for a limited quota. The migratory pattern of the herring implies high densities in the southern parts of the fishing areas during spring and in the northern parts during autumn. This forms the basis for two different fisheries in the area, {{as well as for}} the current management proposal to divide the quota into a spring and an autumn part. This and other management proposals are discussed in the paper. The main conclusion from the case study is that, when exempting a fishery from tradable fishing concessions, it is important to build other institutions dealing with the fundamental problem of access to the <b>quota.</b> <b>Failure</b> to do so might result in an over-capacity issue and threaten the long-run development of an otherwise successful small-scale fishery.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} call for managers in the Nigerian insurance industry to espouse higher level of ethical behaviour to earn the trust of customers, regulatory agencies, and other stakeholders. Arguably, this will enhance market penetration, increase patronage and higher level of profit. Theoretically however, ethical behaviour can be institutionalized in organizations if the top management support ethical behaviour through punishment and reward (high ethical climate). Other than corporate ethical values, managers’ beliefs about the rightness and wrongness of an action in a particular situation {{could also be a}} function of his/her personal moral philosophy. With respect to financial services, one aspect of marketing which have been empirically shown to have influence ethical judgement and behaviours of managers is sales quotas. When salespersons are assigned higher sales quotas, which are perceived as difficult, the tendency to engage in unethical behaviour to achieve this target becomes higher. In this study, we assess and extend the theoretical relationship between moral judgement of salespersons and perceived quota difficulty in the insurance industry. The study also explores the moderating effects of salesperson’s ethical values (idealism and relativism), corporate ethical climate, and <b>quota</b> <b>failure</b> consequences on the proposed relationship. With a structured questionnaire, data was collected from respondents in the target industry through a multi-stage sampling strategy. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to assess the factorial structure of the measures used in the study, their reliability and validity. Using correlation and regression analysis, the results were presented and discussed with managerial implications for the Nigerian insurance industry...|$|R
