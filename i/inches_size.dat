40|$|Eight tons of CTC/DOE {{formed coke}} of 6 inches x 5 inches x 4 <b>inches</b> <b>size</b> were {{produced}} in the PDU. This coke will be tested at 100 percent formed coke charge in a commercial size foundry. A scheduled test run was postponed due to production requirements at the foundry. Foundry coke was produced from weakly coking Colorado coal. Blending of this coal with 40 percent of stronger caking, higher rank coals was required. Western coal from the Rosebud seam was pyrolyzed to upgrade this low rank, high moisture coal. The objective {{is to improve the}} coal as a fuel and to determine if an acceptable char or coke can be produced from this coal...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the early}} days of {{experimental}} particle physics photomultipliers (PMTs) have {{played an important role in}} the detector design. Thanks to their capability of fast photon counting, PMTs are extensively used in the new-generation of astroparticle physics experiments, such as air, ice and water Cherenkov detectors. Small size PMTs (≤ 3 inches diameter) show little sensitivity to the Earth magnetic ﬁeld, small transit time, stable transit time spread; the price per photocathode area is less comparing to the one for the large area PMTs, typically used so far in such applications. Together with developments and reduced price of multichannel electronics, the use of PMTs of 3 -inches or smaller diameter is a promising option even for nowadays large volume detectors. In this paper we report on the design and performance of a new instrument for mass charac- terisation of PMTs (from 1 inch to 3 <b>inches</b> <b>size),</b> capable to calibrate hundreds of PMTs per day and provide measurements of dark counts, signal amplitude, late-, delayed-, pre- and after-pulses, transit time and transit time spread...|$|E
40|$|When Malcolm Jones and I taught {{first year}} {{students}} in Resource Management at the University of New England {{early in the}} 1990 s, we set a major project based on an analysis of media coverage of environmental issues. I particularly remember a report on water pollution on Sydney's beaches. Using column <b>inches,</b> <b>size</b> of headlines, location in the newspapers, and frequency of reporting, the report showed with considerable statistical certainty that Sydney?s ocean waters were pristine {{prior to the start}} of the swimming season (no or few reports in the papers), became increasingly polluted as summer progressed (more column inches, bigger headlines), reached its highest levels at the height of summer (front page coverage) and then returned to purity as the summer waned and people returned to work and school (no or few reports in the papers). Total nonsense of course. In those days, before the deep water outfalls, beach pollution was a year round problem for Sydney, but the media reported the pollution only in summer when the maximum number of people were likely to be at the beaches and therefore interested in beach conditions and more likely to buy papers highlighting water quality issues. The media report events, whether they are politics, conflict, carnage, sex or the environment, which sell newspapers or attract viewers and listeners to television and radio. Our term project at UNE was designed not only as an exercise in data gathering, analysis and reporting, but was part of our programme of producing media savvy graduates...|$|E
