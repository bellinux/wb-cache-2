40|$|Introduction and Objective Circumcision {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{surgical}} procedures and one of the most frequently performed worldwide. It can be done by many different techniques. This prospective series presents the results of Plastibell&# 174; circumcision in children older than 2 years of age, evaluating surgical duration, immediate and late complications, time for plastic <b>device</b> <b>separation</b> and factors associated with it. Materials and Methods We prospectively analyzed 119 children submitted to Plastic Device Circumcision with Plastibell&# 174; by only one surgeon from December 2009 to June 2011. In all cases the surgery was done under general anesthesia associated with dorsal penile nerve block. Before surgery length of the penis and latero-lateral diameter of the glans were measured. Surgical duration, time of Plastibell&# 174; separation and use of analgesic medication in the post-operative period were evaluated. Patients were followed on days 15, 45, 90 and 120 after surgery. Results Age at surgery varied from 2 to 12. 5 (5. 9 &# 177; 2. 9) years old. Mean surgical time was 3. 7 &# 177; 2. 0 minutes (1. 9 to 9 minutes). Time for plastic <b>device</b> <b>separation</b> ranged from 6 to 26 days (mean: 16 &# 177; 4. 2 days), being 14. 8 days for children younger than 5 years of age and 17. 4 days for those older than 5 years of age (p < 0. 0001). The diameter of the Plastibell&# 174; does not interfered in separations time (p = 0, 484). Late complications occurred in 32 (26. 8 %) subjects, being the great majority of low clinical significance, especially prepucial adherences, edema of the mucosa and discrete hypertrophy of the scar, all resolving with clinical treatment. One patient still using diaper had meatus stenosis and in one case the Plastibell&# 174; device stayed between the glans and the prepuce and needed to be removed manually. conclusions Circumcision using a plastic device is a safe, quick and an easy technique with low complications, that when occur are of low clinical importance and of easy resolution.

40|$|Dielectrophoresis (DEP) is a {{technique}} {{that can be used}} to separate particle at microscale. It is of particular interest because it is a non-invasive, non-destructive and non-contact technique, which ensures that sample composition remains the same with only the particles being separated. On the microscale, DEP has been used to separate viable and non-viable cells, and cells with different dielectric properties, with the aid of a range of miniaturised, microfabricated devices. However, DEP at the nano-scale is a novel area and is still under research. Miniaturisation of devices in general has been an ongoing trend to improve the performance of analytical tools. In particular, processes for micro-device fabrication using dry film resist have been studied in order to reduce size, cost, sophisticated hardware usage and power consumption.

The harvester would operate on the site, {{and it would be}} comprised of a base machine, an accumulating felling head, and a compacting <b>device.</b> <b>Separation</b> of pulpwood and energy wood fractions would take place at a pulp mill. In this experiment, the trees were topped and the top sections were left at the site. The concept was evaluated from an ecological and eco-nomic point of view. Nutrient losses were significantly lower compared to whole-tree harvesting. The energy frac-tion increased by 150 % compared to the cut-to-length method, in which stem bark represents the energy frac-tion. In bundle transportation, the load-bearing capacity of standard trucks can be highly utilized. For short distance hauling by conventional forwarders, an expansion of the load space is required in order to improve the utilization of the load-bearing capacity. Due to insufficient compaction capability when deal-ing with large trees, the bundling concept seems to be more appealing in harvesting energy wood from dense stands characterized by small stem size. In energy wood procurement, the bundling concept has several indirect advantages compared to the conventional forest chip pro-duction. Standard vehicles, with minor modifications, can be used for transportation. Machines involved in the op-eration can work independently, increasing the reliability of the system.

40|$|Curdlan sulfate (CRDS), a sulfated 1 → 3 -β-D glucan, {{previously}} {{shown to}} be a potent HIV entry inhibitor, is characterized in this study as a potent inhibitor of the Dengue virus (DENV). CRDS was identified by in silico blind docking studies to exhibit binding potential to the envelope (E) protein of the DENV. CRDS was shown to inhibit the DENV replication very efficiently in different cells in vitro. Minimal effective concentration of CRDS was as low as 0. 1 µg/mL in LLC-MK 2 cells, and toxicity was observed only at concentrations over 10 mg/mL. CRDS can also inhibit DENV- 1, 3, and 4 efficiently. CRDS did not inhibit the replication of DENV subgenomic replicon. Time of addition experiments demonstrated that the compound not only inhibited viral infection at the host cell binding step, but also at an early post-attachment step of entry (membrane fusion). The direct binding of CRDS to DENV was suggested by an evident reduction in the viral titers after interaction of the virus with CRDS following an ultrafiltration <b>device</b> <b>separation,</b> as well as after virus adsorption to an alkyl CRDS-coated membrane filter. The electron microscopic features also showed that CRDS interacted directly with the viral envelope, and caused changes to the viral surface. CRDS also potently inhibited DENV infection in DC-SIGN expressing cells as well as the antibody-dependent enhancement of DENV- 2 infection. Based on these data, a probable binding model of CRDS to DENV E protein was constructed by a flexible receptor and ligand docking study. The binding site of CRDS was predicted to be at the interface between domains II and III of E protein dimer, which is unique to this compound, and is apparently different from the β-OG binding site.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of whole column detection (WCD) for liquid chromatography (LC). The WCD uses electrochemical techniques for detecting the analytes passing through the separation column. Electrode array for in-column electrochemical detection (ICED) is fabricated along the separation column to enable whole column separation monitoring and allow better understanding on the affinity of particular analyte to the stationary and mobile phases. Numerical models were built to understand the feasibility and differences of electrochemical detection within an unpacked and packed column. From the simulated results, the surface area of the electrode was not hindered by the presence of the particles in flow condition. An electrochemical microfluidic device has been successfully fabricated on PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrate using the reverse imprinting technique. The photolithographically produced gold metal electrode lines were imprinted into the PET substrate using a blank mould and produced an inlaid electrode array with overall step residue within 40 nm. The semi-cured thermoset polyester channel was irreversibly thermal bonded on the PET substrate. The devices were able to tolerate pressure in excess of 90 bars. The PET column was packed with 5 μm C 18 silica beads to perform reverse phase chromatography separation. The array was electrochemically characterised using standard redox probes in both stagnant conditions and under flow. Both numerical modelling and experimental data show improved sensitivity under flow and a limiting current which scaled linearly with cubic root of volume flow rate.

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{advent of}} {{endovascular}} prostheses to treat descending thoracic aortic lesions offers {{an alternative approach}} in patients who are poor candidates for surgery. The development of this approach includes complications that are common to the endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms and some that are unique to thoracic endografting. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review of 60 emergent and high-risk patients with thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) and dissections treated with endovascular prostheses over 4 years under existing investigational protocols or on an emergent compassionate use basis. ResultsFifty-nine of the 60 patients received treatment, with one access failure. Thirty-five patients received treatment of TAAs. Four of these procedures were performed emergently because of active hemorrhage. Twenty-four patients with aortic dissections (16 acute, 8 chronic) also received treatment. Eight of the patients with acute dissection had active hemorrhage {{at the time of}} treatment. Three devices were used: AneuRx (Medtronic; n = 31), Talent (Medtronic; n = 27), and Excluder (Gore; n = 1). Nineteen secondary endovascular procedures were performed in 14 patients. Most were secondary to endoleak (14 of 19), most commonly caused by modular separation of overlapping devices (n = 8). Other endoleaks included 4 proximal or distal type I leaks and 2 undefined endoleaks. The remaining secondary procedures were performed to treat recurrent dissection (n = 1), pseudoaneurysm enlargement (n = 3), and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (n = 1). One patient underwent surgical repair of a retrograde ascending aortic dissection after endograft placement. Procedure-related mortality was 17 % in the TAA group and 13 % in the dissection group, including 2 acute retrograde dissections that resulted in death from cardiac tamponade. Overall mortality was 28 % at 2 -year follow-up. ConclusionAlthough significant morbidity and mortality remain, endovascular repair of descending TAAs and dissections in patients at high-risk patients can be accomplished with acceptable outcomes compared with traditional open repair. The major cause for repeat intervention in these patients was endoleak, most commonly caused by <b>device</b> <b>separation.</b> Improved understanding of these complications may result in a decrease in secondary procedures, morbidity, and mortality in these patients.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this LDRD was to develop microdevice strategies for dealing with samples to be examined in biological detection systems. This includes three sub-components: namely, microdevice fabrication, sample delivery to the microdevice, and sample processing within the microdevice. The first component of this work focused on utilizing Sandia's surface micromachining technology to fabricate small volume (nanoliter) fluidic systems for processing small quantities of biological samples. The next component was to develop interfaces for the surface-micromachined silicon devices. We partnered with Micronics, a commercial company, to produce fluidic manifolds for sample delivery to our silicon devices. Pressure testing was completed to examine {{the strength of the}} bond between the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer and the silicon chip. We are also pursuing several other methods, both in house and external, to develop polymer-based fluidic manifolds for packaging silicon-based microfluidic devices. The second component, sample processing, is divided into two sub-tasks: cell collection and cell lysis. Cell collection was achieved using dielectrophoresis, which employs AC fields to collect cells at energized microelectrodes, while rejecting non-cellular particles. Both live and dead Staph. aureus bacteria have been collected using RF frequency dielectrophoresis. Bacteria have been separated from polystyrene microspheres using frequency-shifting dielectrophoresis. Computational modeling was performed to optimize <b>device</b> <b>separation</b> performance, and to predict particle response to the dielectrophoretic traps.

Elementary examples of arrays are then used to demonstrate the influence of factors such as <b>device</b> <b>separation,</b> wave heading angle, number of devices and array configuration upon collective performance. Subsequently, the power output from an array of five devices is optimised with respect to its layout, using two different routines. The first is a new heuristic approach, named the Parabolic Intersection (PI) method, that efficiently creates array con figurations using only basic computations. The second is a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a novel `crossover' operator. Each method is applied to maximise the output at a given regular wave frequency and direction under two different power take-off regimes and also to minimise power in a third, cautionary example. The resulting arrays are then analysed and the optimisation procedures themselves evaluated. Finally, the effects of irregular seas on array interactions are investigated. The configurations that were optimised for regular wave climates are assessed in a range of irregular sea-states. The GA is then used once more to create optimal array layouts for each of these seas. The characteristics of the arrays are subsequently examined and the influence of certain spectral parameters on the optimal solutions considered. The optimisation procedures were both found to be effective, with the GA marginally outperforming the PI method in all cases. Significant positive and negative modifications to the power output were observed in the arrays optimised in regular waves, although the effects weakened when the same arrays were subjected to irregular sea-states. However, arrays optimised specifically in irregular seas exhibited differences in net power output equivalent to over half that produced from the same number of devices in isolation.

40|$|Multiple {{wave energy}} devices {{supported}} by a common structure represent one possible method of efficiently converting ocean wave energy into electricity. In this study, experimental measurements of multiple small-scale wave energy devices are reported to assist the development and validation of numerical models. Through observation and measurement, the response of two float geometries subjected {{to a range of}} wave conditions and device settings were determined. A range of regular wave conditions were identified that caused a linear relationship to occur between the heave displacement amplitude of the float and the incident wave amplitude. These test cases will enable comparisons to be made with linear simulations of response. Tests conducted in various wave conditions have highlighted the capability of altering the device response by changing the equilibrium draft of one float geometry. Additional damping on the upper surface of the float, due to wave overtopping, could be exploited as a method of limiting the heave response of the device in large amplitude waves. The influence of hydrodynamic interactions on arrays of closely spaced devices has been experimentally investigated for devices subjected to regular and irregular wave conditions. The magnitude and occurrence of interactions and their affect on the individual device response is demonstrably dependent on the incident wave frequency and <b>device</b> <b>separation</b> distance. Compared to an isolated device, positive interactions result in higher average power outputs for an array of devices at certain wave frequencies. Positive interactions occuring at particular wave frequencies are balanced by negative interactions at other wave frequencies, in agreement with published numerical studies of array performance. Varying the level of mechanical damping applied to the float through the power take-off system results in a frequency shift of the calculated power transfer function and alters the motion path of the float. This finding implies that the level of generator torque could be used as an alternative method to tune the response of the device based on the measured incident wave-field. Several time-averaged and time-varying approaches to simulating the response of a wave energy device subjected to wave-field forcing and undergoing free response have been studied. By comparing the simulated and measured responses, the feasibility of using linear and non-linear force terms in a time-varying model has been assessed. In general, single degree-of-freedom simulations based on linear hydrodynamic parameters tend to over-predict device response amplitudes, requiring the application of additional damping. The simulation approach which resulted in the closest agreement with measured responses required the combination of linear diffraction force and radiation added mass terms with non-linear drag and buoyancy force terms, as well as body inertia and gravity forces. This approach goes part way to simulating the complex time-varying hydrodynamics associated with a wave energy device subjected to wave-field forcing.

A change in the experimental objectives of the test-vehicle payload units necessitated modification of some of the standard separation mechanisms. A strap, pull-pin, girth-ring <b>separation</b> <b>device</b> was developed which employed the basic actuation of the standard mechanisms. Evidence of residual burning of the third stage made it necessary to delay separation longer than the time designed into the long-delay <b>separation</b> <b>device.</b> The standard <b>separation</b> mechanism was modified and integrated with the satellite command receiver system so that a ground command after third-stage burnout would cause separation. Flight performance of the various separation mechanisms proved their reliability; they performed without failure in all Vanguard launchings...|$|R

40|$|Microfluidic {{devices have}} {{significant}} potential {{for use in}} the separation and isolation of particulates, based on their chemical or physical properties. Implementation of microfluidic <b>devices</b> in the <b>separation</b> of biological components has dramatic potential advantages; however, those advantages are accompanied by equally difficult challenges relating to fabrication, consistency, robustness, and reliability of the device. One technique used to achieve particulate separations employing a microfluidic device based {{on the size of the}} particles is pinched-flow fractionation (PFF). PFF provides a simple, efficient methodology for size-based particle separation using fluid mechanics principles. We developed techniques for constructing microfluidic devices having high- aspect-ratio features, quality and fidelity. In this work, a modified, confocal- microscopy technique was developed to quantitatively determine feature quality. Microfluidic devices and independent, photolithographically-defined features were constructed using thiol-ene resins by means of a soft-lithography technique; contact liquid photolithographic polymerization (CLiPP). Resin cure times and initiator-to-inhibitor ratio were found to have a strong impact on feature quality. A correlation between aspect ratio and feature thickness for thiol-enes was established, as well. Combining the optimization technique with thiol-ene materials led to the formulation of a photopolymerizable resin capable of fabricating high quality, high-aspect-ratio microfluidic channels that were used to fabricate a PFF device. The final aim of this dissertation was to utilize moving-frame boundary-Integral method (MFBIM) developed in this work to assist in the design of a microfluidic <b>device</b> with enhanced <b>separation</b> efficiency. Previous studies of PFF devices have shown that channel geometry, flow rate and particle size all affect particle trajectories, and hence, separation efficiency. To study the effects of channel geometry, particle size, and fluid flow on the PFF <b>device’s</b> <b>separation</b> performance, a microfluidic channel using the PFF geometry was fabricated. Simulations using the MFBIM were conducted to predict the effects of channel geometry, flow rates, and particle sizes on separation efficiency. The MFBIM simulations provided a method used to predict particle trajectories while varying the flow ratio, particle size and channel geometry. Data from the simulations were used to design a PFF <b>device</b> with optimal <b>separation</b> attributes by modifying the channel geometry and flow ratio...|$|R
