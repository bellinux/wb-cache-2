5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb {{to be is}} still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can be followed by the negation, and <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E

5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of other organisms <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of other organisms have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Artificial ruins, {{built to}} {{resemble}} remnants of historic edifices, {{were also a}} hallmark of the period. They were usually built as centre pieces in aristocratic planned landscapes. Follies were similar, although they differed from artificial ruins <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not part of a planned landscape, but rather seemed to have no reason for being built. Both drew on elements of castle architecture such as castellation and towers, but served no military purpose and were solely for display.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages who speak with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E

These include Cajal bodies, Gemini of coiled bodies, polymorphic interphase karyosomal association (PIKA), promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies, paraspeckles, and splicing speckles. Although little is known about a number of these domains, they are significant <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> show that the nucleoplasm is not a uniform mixture, but rather contains organized functional subdomains.|$|E

5|$|Brachiopods are shelled {{marine organisms}} that superficially resembled {{bivalves}} <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are of similar size {{and have a}} hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two}} groups are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|By the 1850s {{the term}} {{crinoline}} was more usually {{applied to the}} fashionable silhouette provided by horsehair petticoats, and to the hoop skirts that replaced them in the mid-1850s. In form and function these hoop skirts were similar to the 16th- and 17th-century farthingale and to 18th-century panniers, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> too enabled skirts to spread even wider and more fully.|$|E

5|$|During 1971–72 Zappa {{released}} two strongly jazz-oriented solo LPs, Waka/Jawaka and The Grand Wazoo, {{which were}} recorded during the forced layoff from concert touring, using floating line-ups of session players and Mothers alumni. Musically, the albums were akin to Hot Rats, <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> featured extended instrumental tracks with extended soloing. Zappa began touring again in late 1972. His first effort {{was a series}} of concerts in September 1972 with a 20-piece big band referred to as the Grand Wazoo. This was followed by a scaled-down version known as the Petit Wazoo that toured the U.S. for five weeks from October to December 1972.|$|E
5|$|During a LARP, player {{actions in}} the real world {{represent}} character actions in an imaginary setting. Game rules, physical symbols and theatrical improvisation are used to bridge differences between the real world and the setting. For example, a rope could signify an imaginary wall. Realistic-looking weapon props and risky physical activity are sometimes discouraged or forbidden for safety reasons. While the fictional timeline in a tabletop RPG often progresses in game-time, which may be much faster or slower than the time passing for players, LARPs are different <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> usually run in real-time, with game-time only being used in special circumstances.|$|E
