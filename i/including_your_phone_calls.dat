40|$|The Citizens, Not Suspects {{campaign}} aims {{to fight}} the proposals of mandatory data retention legislation in Australia. On 13 th October 2015, the mandatory data retention legislation comes into force in Australia, but the implementation process is in disarray. As the next election approaches {{we need to keep}} the pressure on to have this legislation reviewed. The government’s proposed extensions to National Security powers pose serious threats to the security, privacy and freedom of all Australians. Among these proposals are: mandatory retention for two years of data relating to the internet and telecommunications activity of all Australians. This data could <b>include</b> records of <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> and texts, <b>your</b> location (if you use a mobile phone) and who you send emails to and who you receive them from. As Sir Tim Berners-Lee said when he was down under last year, retention of data on this scale “is so dangerous, you have {{to think of it as}} dynamite”. giving ASIO the power to ‘disrupt’ computers by adding, modifying or deleting files. giving ASIO the power to spy on a number of computers – including a whole computer network – under a single computer-access warrant. giving ASIS (Australia’s foreign intelligence agency) the power to collect intelligence on Australian citizens overseas. creating a new criminal offence, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for revealing information about ‘special intelligence operations’. This comes with no exceptions and would apply to journalists, even if they were unaware that they were revealing information about such an operation. Taken together, these and the other proposals would create the potential for government surveillance on a massive and unprecedented scale, with serious implications for the privacy and civil liberties of all Australians. They could have a serious chilling effect on free speech by inducing people to self-censor. Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus has called the anti-whistleblower section of this legislation (section 35 P) ‘an unprecedented overreach’ by the government that the Labor Party will be opposing. We believe these proposals undermine the presumption of innocence and would create a situation where all Australians would be considered potential suspects, rather than enjoying the freedom from government surveillance and interference that we deserve as citizens of a democracy...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the advent}} of {{personal}} computer technology in the 1980s, computer telephony integration (CTI) has progressively provided more sophisticated telephony services, initiated and controlled by the computer, such as making and receiving voice, fax, and data calls with telephone directory services and caller identification. The integration of telephony software and computer systems is a major development {{in the evolution of}} the automated office. The term is used in describing the computerized services of call centers, such as those that direct <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> to the right department at a business you're calling. It's also sometimes used to describe the ability to use your personal computer to initiate and manage <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> (in which case you can think of your computer as your personal call center). CTI is not a new concept and has been used in the past in large telephone networks, but only dedicated call centers could justify the costs of the required equipment installation. Primary telephone service providers are offering information services such as automatic number identification, which is a telephone service architecture that separates CTI services from call switching and will make it easier to add new services. Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS) on a scale is wide enough for its implementation to bring real value to business or residential telephone usage. A new generation of applications (middleware) is being developed as a result of standardization and availability of low cost computer telephony links.|$|R

30|$|Upon the iPhone was {{launched}} in Korea {{at the end of}} 2009, Kim Bumsoo, CEO of KakaoTalk predicted a mobile revolution and noted that communication was a key value of the mobile space. “What is a phone? A <b>phone</b> is for <b>calling.</b> What is a killer app on <b>your</b> <b>phone?</b> Either <b>calling</b> or sending a text message. Then we did not have to hesitate. A communication tool is the killer app, otherwise a search tool is the most important tool for a personal computer. The essence of a phone is communication. Finally, we launched KakaoSuda, KakaoAgit, and KakaoTalk.” That is, he understood the fundamental attribution of mobile as tool for communication, and he tailored it {{to meet the needs of}} customers suited to their lifestyle. In brief, he realized that the attribute of a mobile phone could be delivered through the KakaoTalk service. He replaced an existing tool within phones that was being offered as a paid service and replaced it with KakaoTalk, which was a free service delivered over the Internet. This also improved communications.|$|R

Assuming that you are sitting down whilst reading this, I ask you to imagine, if you will, that about a dozen paces from your seat, you see a young couple – an attractive young woman and a well-built young man. They {{appear to be in}} love, they are tender enough with one another, and are engaged in light conversation. Then, all of a sudden – and it is very sudden – the man pins the woman down on the bed and starts throttling her. She struggles. She writhes. She tries to scream. They are only a dozen paces from where you are sitting, and you – do nothing. You do not rush to help her, though you could do so in a matter of seconds. You do not call out for help, nor do you look round {{to see if there are}} others who could assist, nor do you take and <b>your</b> <b>phone</b> and <b>call</b> the police.

40|$|Objective: This study {{examines}} the effectiveness {{and costs of}} follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> in improving response rates to a community survey. Methods: Non-responders to a postal survey were randomly allocated to receive a <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> or no <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> The resources used for {{the development and implementation}} of the survey were documented. The response rates and cost per level of follow-up contact examined. Results: Follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls</b> led to a statistical significant increase in the number of responses to a community-wide survey, relative to no <b>phone</b> <b>call.</b> This relative increase in responses (n= 62 for the follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> group versus n= 1 for controls), did not increase the absolute survey response rate sufficiently (from 38. 5 % for two mailed surveys to 39. 8 % for two mailed surveys plus a <b>phone</b> <b>call)</b> to justify the <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> costs. Scenario analyses show increasing the initial response rate by 10 % and conducting a second mailed survey achieves greater marginal cost savings than increasing the response rate to the second mailout or the follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>calls.</b> Conclusions: These results suggest a follow-up <b>phone</b> <b>call</b> was not cost effective.
