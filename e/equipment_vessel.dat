40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{there has been}} an active program in Hong Kong to manage and protect local populations of small {{cetaceans}} from the effects of massive development in the area. This paper reviews the progress that has been made. Only two species regularly occur there: the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin and the finless porpoise. Because most development has occurred in the western waters of Hong Kong, where generally only the humpback dolphin occurs, most of the work has been conducted on that species. Development of large infrastructure projects (such as airports, bridges, expressways, power plants, fuel facilities, and container ports) in Hong Kong often results in land reclamation, dredging and dumping of spoils, pipe and cable laying, percussive and bored piling work, underwater blasting, large increases in vessel traffic, and other impacts. Several mitigation measures have been used with varying levels of success, including bubble curtains/jackets, exclusion zones, ramping up of piling hammers, acoustic decoupling of noisy <b>equipment,</b> <b>vessel</b> speed limits, no-dumping policies, and silt curtains. Baseline, construction-phase, and operational-phase cetacean monitoring is often conducted to evaluate the success of conservation measures put into place. The Environmental Impact Assessment process in Hong Kong has involved cetaceans to a degree perhaps higher {{than anywhere else in the}} world, and much can be learned from studying the successes and failures of this situation.

40|$|The present work {{involves}} {{the study and}} design {{for the production of}} liquid fuel from waste plastic (LDPE) by thermal pyrolysis. The process is carried out thermal pyrolysis where degradation of larger molecules into smaller molecules. The effect of temperature has been studied at different temperatures 475 °c, 500 °c, 525 °c, 550 °c and the following wt. % are 47. 3 %, 63. 2 %, 69. 8 %, 77. 07 % respectively. The most economical process flow diagram was designed for production of liquid fuel from waste plastic (LDPE). The maximum yield of product is obtained at optimum temperature 550 °c. With the help of product flow rate, the required raw materials are calculated which are 6. 48 tons per day to produce 5 ton per day liquid fuel. Residence time is the time required for reaction and this noted as 57 min from the experiment. Design of the reactor is done with help of residence time and flow rate of raw materials and calculated to be 544 liters. Designing of <b>equipment</b> (<b>vessel)</b> are done with the help of mass balance and heat balances reactions. Volume of the vessel is found out from the steady state heat conduction equations. The optimum diameter and length of the reactor are calculated. Cost estimation of the plant is calculated and it is found that it is feasible to put a plant of 5 tons of liquid fuel and with help of input cost and output cost and then profitability is calculate...|$|E
