5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{announcement}} proclaiming the ACC's expansion to 12teams, several cities and sports organizations were preparing bids {{to host the}} ACC Football Championship Game. The prospect {{of tens of thousands}} of visitors could provide a multimillion-dollar economic boost <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> city and region while requiring few, if any, additional facilities. One early contender was the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Even before Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner and operator of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (as it was called then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection. Other early options included Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{candidates}} {{to host the}} program included Soupy Sales, host of children's variety shows in the 1950s and 1960s, and comedian Dana Carvey. After Nickelodeon determined Sales to be too old for the role, and Carvey was offered a chance to audition for Saturday Night Live, the search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> continued. Producers viewed over 1,000 applicants from Los Angeles and New York. First attending a tryout {{in lieu of a}} friend, and later passing multiple auditions, television warm-up comedian Marc Summers was one of two finalists advancing to a final audition. Each hosted a mock game for Nickelodeon to make an ultimate decision on who would host Double Dare. The producers felt the way Summers ended the game by leading into a commercial break was more professional and he was hired for the position {{in the first week of}} September 1986. Because focus groups showed that the audience thought he was more than 10 years younger than he actually was, Summers was obligated by Nickelodeon for years to not mention his age publicly.|$|E

5|$|Okafor and Alexander vied <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> {{of local}} and {{national}} {{player of the year}} awards, with each winning multiple national player of the year awards. Young and Curie were both in the Marist Class 4A sectional in the 2014 IHSA playoffs and could have met again in the round of sixteen on March 14 if they had both won three regional contests. Despite forfeiting all wins in CPL games, Curie remained eligible to compete in the IHSA playoffs due to differences in eligibility rules. On March 4, Curie lost their opening IHSA playoff game to 11–11 DuSable High School by an 88–85 margin in overtime. It marked Curies first loss of the season on the court with Alexander in the lineup. Alexander posted 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks despite fouling out in the final minute of regulation time. Curie trailed 13–2 early and led 47–32 midway through the third quarter. Curie starters Josh and Joseph Stamps were ineligible for IHSA play as was Malik Washington.|$|E
25|$|C. lectularius only feeds {{every five}} to seven days, which {{suggests}} {{that it does not}} spend the majority of its life searching <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host.</b> When a bed bug is starved, it leaves its shelter and searches <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host.</b> If it successfully feeds, it returns to its shelter. If it does not feed, it continues to search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host.</b> After searching—regardless of whether or not it has eaten—the bed bug returns to the shelter to aggregate before the photophase (period of light during a day-night cycle). Reis argues that two reasons explain why C. lectularius would return to its shelter and aggregate after feeding. One is to find a mate and the other is to find shelter to avoid getting smashed after eating.|$|E

40|$|A {{web server}} named Harache is presented. The server runs under the {{authority}} of the file owner. Existing servers have problems that occur because of the user authority during execution. When a program that uses a server embedded interpreter, for example PHP, creates data files, the owner of the created files is the special user account that runs a server. Therefore, other users that share the same server can steal and delete these data files. In particular, these problems are serious <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hosting</b> service where many users share a server. Harache has server processes that run {{under the authority}} of the file owner. Therefore, Harache can solve these problems that occur because of the user authority. Harache can be used <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>hosting</b> service where many people share a server with a reverse proxy. We implemented Harache on a Linux OS with SELinux and performed evaluation experiments to test the system’s effectiveness. Experimental results show that Harache has high performance and scalability...|$|R

It is customary <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> to offer tea to guests soon after their arrival. Tea {{is consumed}} both at home and outside the home, often in cafés or tea rooms. Afternoon tea with cakes on fine porcelain is a cultural stereotype. In southwest England, many cafés serve a cream tea, consisting of scones, clotted cream, and jam alongside a pot of tea. In some parts of Britain, 'tea' may also refer to the evening meal.|$|E
25|$|Ae. albopictus also bites {{other mammals}} besides humans, {{as well as}} birds. The females are always on the search <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host</b> and are {{persistent}} but cautious {{when it comes to}} their blood meal and host location. Their blood meal is often broken off before enough blood has been ingested for the development of their eggs, so Asian tiger mosquitoes bite multiple hosts during their development cycle of the egg, making them particularly efficient at transmitting diseases. The mannerism of biting diverse host species enables the Asian tiger mosquito to be a potential bridge vector for certain pathogens that can jump species boundaries, for example the West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|Both {{female and}} male ticks quest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>host,</b> but for {{different}} reasons. The female quests for a blood meal, the male to search the host for a female tick in order to mate and feed from her. Males may parasitise the female ticks by piercing their cuticle with their mouth parts to feed on the haemolymph (up to 3-4 males have been found feeding on one female tick). Adult male ticks rarely blood-feed on a host. The outside surface, or cuticle, of hard ticks actually grows to accommodate the large volume of blood ingested, which, in adult ticks, may be anywhere from 200 to 600 times their unfed body weight. When a tick is fully engorged {{it is said to}} be replete.|$|E
