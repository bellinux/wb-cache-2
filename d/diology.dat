40|$|The {{method of}} {{additive}} superimposition, {{in the form}} of ECG gating, is a common technique in nuclear car <b>diology</b> (1 - 4). In gated equilibrium blood-pool imaging or gated first-transit methods, data from a number of cardiac cycles are added to provide a single, â€œaverageâ€•, cardiac cycle. A time-activity curve (TAC) is con structed from this average by suitable definition of a region of interest (e. g., the left ventricle, LV). Parame terssuchasejectionfraction(EF),peakejectionrate (PER), etc., are then calculated from this cumulative TAC. It is assumed that the values calculated from this cumulative curve are the â€œmeanâ€•or â€œaverageâ€•of such quantities for the cardiac cycles studied. This assumption is false. It is false because, striotly speaking, one mus...|$|E
