500|$|Levine's {{popularity}} {{outside of}} his musical work has seen him tagged as a [...] "stand-alone star," [...] which critics say have pushed other members of Maroon 5 to the backseat, even in their music. Their guitarist Valentine noted that his vocals were a central aspect around which their music revolved. Conversely, others opine that Levine's fame has been a boost to the band, with Paper writing: [...] "Maroon 5 has managed to ebb and flow with the times ... thanks {{in no small part}} to their frontman's uncanny ability to be extremely entertaining". Delta Sky described him as [...] "a natural, if slightly neurotic, leading man". He claims that the image was consciously cultivated, explaining: [...] "We talked about <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> ago and decided I would step out, for us, not for me or my own ego ... We wanted there to be a frontman." ...|$|E
500|$|Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger {{used his}} press conference before the match to look ahead to the new season. He wanted his team to build on their FA Cup success {{and said that the}} Community Shield [...] "...will {{be the best way to}} prepare for the start of the League season next week." [...] Wenger was {{surprised}} his opponents Manchester City had taken midfielder Frank Lampard from their own franchise club New York City FC on loan; he questioned whether this was a way to bypass UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules. Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago? Maybe – it looks to me like he agreed <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> before." [...] Wenger also revealed Arsenal had received offers for defender Thomas Vermaelen; on the day of the Community Shield match the player transferred to Barcelona.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the Ducatis Galluzzi {{originally}} styled {{were later}} revised and updated by Pierre Terblanche, including the ST series and the Monster 696 update of 2008. Terblanche later joined Galluzzi at Aprilia, {{where they have}} worked together on several new and revised models for Aprilia subsidiary Moto Guzzi. The two collaborated on the Moto Guzzi V12 series, with Le Mans, Strada, and X variants, displayed at EICMA in 2009. Galluzzi described the challenge he and Terblanche faced revising the Moto Guzzi image by saying, [...] "The Guzzi crowd is extremely conservative, but if we only concentrate on those, {{we are going to}} lose eventually. So these bikes are looking into the future." [...] This is similar to the balance sought with earlier Ducati designs, but, [...] "the advantage Guzzi has versus Ducati is that Ducati makes sportsbikes, Guzzi can do anything it wants because they’ve been doing <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> and on all sorts of bikes." ...|$|E

Following this, Peyton decides to skip prom, but gets {{convinced}} not to do so by Lucas. As she walks to her door to answer it (thinking it is Lucas), the man behind the door turns around and it is actually her stalker, Psycho Derek. He ties her up and gags her in her basement and proceeds to make a mock prom for them; he takes pictures of the bound and gagged Peyton, dancing with her and telling her they are gonna [...] "go upstairs and have the perfect prom night". Brooke arrives, knowing that Peyton would never skip prom. Psycho Derek tries to kill Brooke, but Peyton and Brooke eventually defeat him and he ends up in jail. This experience repairs Peyton and Brooke's friendship. Peyton learns that Psycho Derek's real name is Ian Banks. She forgives him after discovering disturbing facts about his past, and tells him that she hopes he finds peace. Lucas and Peyton eventually have sex together for the first time. After making sure with Lucas, Peyton decides to take an internship in L.A. and thus spends the whole summer with Brooke.|$|E
