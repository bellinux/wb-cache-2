5|$|In Michigan, whose Old Mission Peninsula and Leelanau Peninsula AVAs (near Traverse City) {{are known}} for their ice wine, Riesling is a <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> variety, in part on account of its {{suitability}} for that purpose.|$|E
5|$|Although female life {{expectancy}} in Byzantium {{was lower than}} that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female widowhood was still <b>fairly</b> <b>common.</b> Still, some women were able to circumvent societal strictures and work as traders, artisans, abbots, entertainers, and scholars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fairly</b> <b>common</b> in {{its large}} range, {{and with its}} {{population}} stable, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock is considered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature to be a Least Concern on its red list of threatened species.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} halkieriids were a [...] "sister" [...] {{group to}} the molluscs, in other words descendants of a <b>fairly</b> closely related <b>common</b> ancestor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{decorative}} themes on {{the pottery}} are <b>fairly</b> uniform. <b>Common</b> designs are of parallel {{vertical and horizontal}} lines, triangles, stars, S-shaped patterns, and fish-spine designs. Also common were interlaced designs, impressions using ropes or [...] "mamelóns", {{as well as other}} varied ornamental designs. The major part of the ceramics were plain and undesigned, however.|$|R
50|$|This type is {{considered}} a subspecies of the mallard, as Anas platyrhynchos diazi (AOU 1983). This may not be correct, however, as careful analysis of mtDNA control region sequence data—taking into account hybridization events—indicates it is the southwestern relative of the American black duck and shares a <b>fairly</b> recent <b>common</b> ancestry with this species (McCracken et al. 2001).|$|R
5|$|In mid-October, {{the comet}} {{developed}} a notable antitail, pointing towards the Sun. Anti-tails are a <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> cometary phenomenon, and result from orbital geometry giving {{the appearance of}} a tail pointing towards the Sun although material can only be driven away from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Many escapees from captivity {{can also}} be found in similar watery {{habitats}} around the world. Sightings are <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed. In 2011, one specimen was spotted in the Central Coast of California.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{was introduced}} to Jamaica in 1903, and the Bahamas and Cuba were colonised naturally from the US. This bird is <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> but local in Jamaica, Grand Bahama and Bimini, and is rare {{in the rest of}} the Bahamas, eastern Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico and St. Croix.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} halkieriids were a [...] "sister" [...] {{group to}} the molluscs, in other words descendants of a <b>fairly</b> closely related <b>common</b> ancestor. This relationship, they said, {{was supported by the}} muscular foot that most researchers assumed halkieriids had.|$|R
50|$|Habitat loss is {{a primary}} threat, but the superb fruit dove is still <b>fairly</b> {{widespread}} and <b>common</b> throughout its large range. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species ranks it as least concern. In New South Wales, however, the superb fruit dove is considered vulnerable, meaning {{it is likely to}} become endangered.|$|R
6000|$|What I've {{suffered}} from them this morning no tongue can tell. It began with Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus Adolphus (they call him [...] "Gusty" [...] down-stairs for short) {{is a very}} good sort of dog when he {{is in the middle of}} a large field or on a <b>fairly</b> extensive <b>common,</b> but I won't have him indoors. He means well, but this house is not his size. He stretches himself, and over go two chairs and a what-not. He wags his tail, and the room looks as if a devastating army had marched through it. He breathes, and it puts the fire out.|$|R
5|$|A double-double {{is defined}} as a {{performance}} in which a player accumulates a double-digit number total in two of five statistical categories—points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots—in a game. The most common double-double combination is points and rebounds, followed by points and assists. Double-doubles are <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> in the NBA. During the 2008–09 season, 69 players who were eligible for leadership in the main statistical categories recorded at least 10 double-doubles during the season.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma sinuatum is <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> and {{widespread}} across North America {{as far south}} as Arizona. It also occurs throughout Europe and the British Isles including Ireland, though it is more common in southern and central parts of Europe than the northwest. In Asia, it has been recorded in the Black Sea region, and Adıyaman Province in Turkey, Iran, and northern Yunnan in China.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal orb webs are <b>fairly</b> <b>common,</b> {{despite being}} less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that horizontal webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow horizontal flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of horizontal orb webs.|$|E
5000|$|Waiting {{rooms on}} both {{platforms}} were of wooden construction, and an underground ticket office was located beneath the station, {{within a short}} tiled tunnel which allowed passenger access between platforms. [...] "Stopping" [...] trains between Newcastle and Hexham, unlike the Carlisle-Newcastle expresses, called at Ryton, then within the County of Durham. In the summertime, trains would bring day-trippers from the Tyneside metropolis to Ryton Willows, the strip of <b>fairly</b> level <b>common</b> land separating {{the river and the}} railway. Adjacent to the station was a tea-room, with nearby entertainments such as large swings, known locally as [...] "shuggy-boats," [...] and a fleet of rowing boats that were available for hire.|$|R
5000|$|Later on, double carbs {{and more}} {{extensive}} modification would be allowed, {{leading to the}} more powerful Super Vee class featuring wings for downforce and [...] engines, which in the end had <b>fairly</b> little in <b>common</b> with the original VW Beetle. Around 2000, worldwide Vee racing had re-established itself as a 1,200/1,300 cc beginner class with wingless cars and VW engines outputting about , but incorporating more modern chassis and tyres.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 563 burials {{have been found}} at Town Creek Indian Mound; they are {{believed}} to be Pee Dee people. Many of the burial sites appear to have been <b>fairly</b> simple and <b>common,</b> with the bodies casually placed in the graves. Some were found buried with their bodies fully extended, while others may have been re-buried in a bundle of bones. The remains of young children and infants have been found tightly wrapped in deerskins and placed within large pottery vessels archeologists have called burial urns.|$|R
5|$|Lysurus periphragmoides has a pantropical distribution. The fungus {{has been}} {{reported}} from Africa (Mauritius, Tanzania), Asia (Jilin Province, China, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia), Australasia (New Guinea), North America (Bahamas, Dominica, Mexico) and South America (Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela). The distribution extends north to the Ryukyu Islands in Asia. It is <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> in South America, but is usually restricts its appearance to periods of wet weather in southern North America.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{terrestrial}} mammals, including horses (Equus ferus caballus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), cats (Felis catus), {{and brown}} rats (Rattus norvegicus), are <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> {{in the stomach}} contents of tiger sharks around the coasts of Hawaii. In one case, remains of two flying foxes {{were found in the}} stomach of this shark. Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats inedible objects, such as automobile license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{have been}} ornamented with jewelry for {{thousands}} of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe. In ancient and modern cultures, ornaments have been placed to stretch and enlarge the earlobes, allowing for larger plugs to be slid into a large fleshy gap in the lobe. Tearing of the earlobe from the weight of heavy earrings, or from traumatic pull of an earring (for example, by snagging on a sweater), is <b>fairly</b> <b>common.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Examination Timetabling problem {{regards the}} {{scheduling}} for the exams {{of a set}} of university courses, avoiding the overlapping of exams having students in <b>common,</b> <b>fairly</b> spreading the exams for the students, and satisfying room capacity constraints. We present a family of solution algorithms for a set of variants of the Examination Timetabling problem. The algorithms are based on tabu search, and they import several features from the research on the Graph Colouring problem. Our algorithms are tested on both public benchmarks and random instances, and compared with previous results in the literature. ...|$|R
5000|$|The city's {{road system}} is {{arranged}} in a <b>fairly</b> typical system <b>common</b> to many cities in the United States. Streets in the downtown business district are arranged as a grid, with several alternating one-way streets. Many major roads begin {{at or near the}} downtown area and travel outwards from the city like the spokes of a wheel. There are also several roads, such as Bardstown Road and Shelbyville Road, which lead outwards from Louisville to the outlying Kentucky towns of Bardstown and Shelbyville, respectively. (See External links for links to several online maps.) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Hearing loss is <b>fairly</b> a <b>common</b> {{disorder}} {{which is}} usually treated with corticosteroids via systemic administration and/or intra-tympanic injection. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of intra-tympanic injections of dexamethasone with its combination with hyaluronic acid in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss.   Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, 40 patients {{were randomly assigned to}} two groups; in the first group, 20 patients received 2. 4 mg intra-tympanic dexamethasone, while in the second group patients received injections of 2. 4 mg of dexamethasone plus 2 mg of hyaluronic acid in combination. Patients in both groups were injected every other day to a total of three injections. The hearing status of patients was evaluated by pure tone audiometry (bone conduction threshold) before and 2 weeks after the intervention.   Results: Assessment of hearing threshold before and after treatment in the two groups showed a significant difference between hearing thresholds at frequencies of 4, 000 to 8, 000 Hz (...|$|R
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} found in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean from Massachusetts to the Florida Keys, where it is <b>fairly</b> <b>common.</b> It also occurs in the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and there are additional unconfirmed records from Cuba, Jamaica, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The southern extent of its range is uncertain due to confusion with the disparate angelshark (S. heteroptera) and Mexican angelshark (S. mexicana). This bottom-dwelling shark is found over sandy or muddy bottoms on the continental shelf and slope.|$|E
5|$|Among extant strepsirrhines, {{only the}} diurnal and cathemeral lemurs {{have evolved to}} live in multi-male/multi-female groups, {{comparable}} to most living simians. This social trait, seen in two extant lemur families (Indriidae and Lemuridae), {{is thought to have}} evolved independently. Group sizes are smaller in social lemurs than in simians, and despite the similarities, the community structures differ. Female dominance, which is rare in simians, is <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> in lemurs. Strepsirrhines spend a considerable amount of time grooming each other (allogrooming). When lemuriform primates groom, they lick the fur and then comb it with their toothcomb. They also use their grooming claw to scratch places they cannot reach with their mouth.|$|E
5|$|As of June 26, 2011, the {{conservation}} status of Dendroaspis angusticeps {{has not been}} assessed by the IUCN. The eastern green mamba is, however, a <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> species of snake throughout its geographical range, and populations {{are believed to be}} stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable, habitat destruction and deforestation may pose a possible threat to this species.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} commercial species, blackbutt is well {{regarded by}} foresters {{for the high}} quality of timber, easy regeneration and quick growth. Uses include making poles, railway sleepers, flooring, building framework, cladding, joinery, lining boards, furniture, woodchipping and decking. Wood density is about 900 kg per cubic metre. The sapwood is resistant to attack by lyctus borers, the heartwood is yellowish brown to light brown. Coarse textured, <b>fairly</b> straight grained, <b>common</b> small gum veins. Hard, strong, tough but not particularly difficult to work. Slow drying of mid to good levels of durability. Blackbutt timber {{is used in the}} flooring of Parliament House, Canberra.|$|R
500|$|Ricketts Glen State Park {{was named}} {{part of an}} Important Mammal Area because it [...] "support {{critical}} habitat {{for a wide range}} of mammals"; Pennsylvania has 64 wild mammal species. The park has an extensive forest cover of hemlock-filled valleys and hardwood-covered mountains, which makes it a habitat for big woods wildlife. Animals such as white-tailed deer, black bear, red and gray squirrels, porcupine, and raccoon are seen <b>fairly</b> regularly. Less <b>common</b> creatures include beaver, bobcat, coyote, fisher, [...] mink, muskrat, red fox, and river otter. In addition to mammals, Ricketts Glen is also known for its wild turkeys, wild flowers, butterflies, dragonflies, and the occasional timber rattlesnake.|$|R
30|$|Clay {{particle}} density (g/cm 3) is {{the mass of}} clay solids (oven dry) per unit volume of clay. Clay {{particle density}} depends on the densities of the various constituent solid and their relative abundance. The range is <b>fairly</b> narrow because <b>common</b> soil minerals but differ little in density. An average value of 2.65  g/cm 3 is often assumed. In contrast, organic soils mineral have lower particle densities since the density of organic matter is much {{less than that of}} mineral particle. From Table  1, the particle densities of the clay types are 2.50, 2.55, 2.67, 2.92, 2.16 and 2.43  g/cm 3 for UBC, UKC, 2 -ABC, 2 -AKC, 2 -BBC and 2 -BKC, respectively.|$|R
5|$|Deerfield {{and other}} {{communities}} collected funds to ransom the captives. French authorities and colonists also worked to extricate the captives from their Indian captors. Within a year's time, {{most of the}} captives were in French hands, a product of frontier commerce in humans that was <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> at the time on both sides. The French and converted Indians worked to convert their captives to Roman Catholicism, with modest success. While adult captives proved fairly resistant to proselytizing, children were more receptive or likely to accept conversion under duress.|$|E
5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a <b>fairly</b> <b>common</b> cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such error was the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.fallax grow {{scattered}} to grouped {{together on the}} ground, or on very rotten conifer logs in alpine areas under standing conifers. They are <b>fairly</b> <b>common,</b> and typically found between August and October. L.fallax is distributed in the western United States and Canada, with the northern range extending to Alaska; the eastern range is bounded on the east by the Great Plains. Field observations suggest that the fungus can form ectomycorrhizal associations with Tsuga heterophylla. Hesler and Smith noted that the variety concolor was prevalent under species of Fir.|$|E
50|$|Around 750 {{worldwide}} {{species of}} ectomycorrhizal mushrooms compose the genus Russula. They are typically <b>common,</b> <b>fairly</b> large, and brightly colored - making them {{one of the}} most recognizable genera among mycologists and mushroom collectors. Their distinguishing characteristics include usually brightly coloured caps, a white to dark yellow spore print, brittle, attached gills, an absence of latex, and absence of partial veil or volva tissue on the stem. Microscopically, the genus is characterised by the amyloid ornamented spores and flesh (trama) composed of spherocysts. Members of the related Lactarius genus have similar characteristics but emit a milky latex when their gills are broken. The genus was described by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1796.|$|R
50|$|The {{magnolia}} warbler is {{assessed on}} the IUCN Red List as least concern for conservation {{because it is}} <b>fairly</b> widespread and <b>common</b> within its habitat and not at risk of extinction. Research has shown that a good percentage of warblers die from flying into television towers in their migratory path. Also, parts of their habitat have been degraded as coniferous forests are cleared which causes the number of warblers living in a habitat to decrease, but they certainly are not greatly affected by the deforestation. While the deforestation does decrease the warbler population in the specific area that it occurs in, the species is not significantly impacted overall due to the general abundance of the species throughout the region.|$|R
