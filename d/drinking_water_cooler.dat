40|$|The {{water economy}} and {{all areas of}} {{environmental}} and resource protection must be concerned with the environmental quality {{that ought to be}} achieved in the long term without adversely affecting utilisation by future generations, and with demands for future 'sustainable use' that have to be made today. In Germany water would appear to be a sheer inexhaustible resource. Water serves not only as <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> for human beings, it is also the essential basis for all life and economic development. Water resources serve a variety of uses, such as the supply of <b>drinking</b> <b>water,</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>water,</b> waste-water discharge, fishery, shipping, energy production, bathing and recreation, activities that often have a lasting negative effect on water quality, ecology and hydromorphological conditions. Despite the fact that drastic and conspicuous effects to surface waters, such as fish kills, is hardly evident today as a result of measures taken over the past thirty years, the results in many areas are still unsatisfactory. In terms of sustainability criteria, water-compatible land use -in farming, for instance, - will not be achieved so long as <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> abstraction from groundwater is at risk.

Among these organisms, bacteria and fungi are {{responsible for most of}} the contamination in <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> and dieses that are intrinsic to the health public. On the bases of morphological and biochemical and serological we identified different bacterial and fungal isolates. Sixty-four fungal isolates (13 genus) were detected in a total 100 <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> <b>cooling</b> system samples in some trains in Egypt. Suggested names including, Acremonium strictum (4 %), Aspergillus flavus (2 %), Aspergillus niger (2 %), Aureobasidium (2 %), Cladosporium (14 %), Pseudallescheria boydii (12 %), Fusarium cacasicum (8 %), Fusarium moniliform (4 %), Fusarium oxysporum (4 %), Penicillium chrysogenum (8 %), Penicillium corylophilum (4 %), Phialophora bubakii (2 %) and Phoma exigua (2 %). Twenty-four bacterial isolates represent six genus were identified to species level, this including the following suggested names: Staphylococcus epidermidis (3 %), Bacillus subtilis (3 %), Pseudomonas aeruginos (2 %), Pseudomonas pseudomallei (1 %), Pseudomonas, mallei (1 %), E. coli O 157 :H 7 (2 %), E. coli (type strain, 4 %) Salmonella sp.

Antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates was examined. All bacterial isolates were sensitive to Polymxin B, Tetracycline, Chloramphenicol, Amoxycillin clavulanic acid (augmentin) 2 : 1, Gentamycin, Kanamycin, and Sulphamethoxazole/ trimethoprim 19 : 1 respectively. On the other hand, four isolates were resistant to Bacitracin, one isolates was resistance to Ampicillin, four isolates were resistance to Penicillin G and two isolates were resistance to Nitrofurantion. The most effective microbial growth inhibitors were sodium azide, ZnCl 2, CdCl 2, NiCl 2, CuC 12 and FeCl 2 (at 500, 200, 100, 50 /ml) respectively. On the other hand, EDTA and Urea, exhibited no effect at all on growth of bacterial isolates.

The process {{has become known as}} Deep Lake <b>Water</b> <b>Cooling</b> (DLWC). It will provide for over 40,000 tons (140 MW) of cooling - a significantly larger system than has been installed elsewhere.

The Toronto <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> supply required a new intake location that would be further from shore and deeper in the lake.

The cooperation of the district cooling agency, Enwave, solved both problems: Enwave paid for the cost of moving the water intake and also supplied the heat to warm the <b>drinking</b> <b>water</b> supply to acceptable levels by effectively extracting the heat from the buildings it served.
