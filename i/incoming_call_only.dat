Distribution of this document is unlimited. This memo describes a suggested change to the behavior of FTP client programs. No protocol modifications are required, though we outline some that might be useful. Overview and Rational The FTP protocol [1] uses a secondary TCP connection for actual transmission of files. By default, this connection is set up by an active open from the FTP server to the FTP client. However, this scheme does not work well with packet filter-based firewalls, which in general cannot permit <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> to random port numbers. If, on the other hand, clients use the PASV command, the data channel will be an outgoing call through the firewall. Such calls are more easily handled, and present fewer problems. The Gory Details The FTP specification says that by default, all data transfers should be over a single connection. An active open {{is done by the}} server, from its port 20 to the same port on the client machine as was used for the control connection. The client does a passive open. For better or worse, most current FTP clients do not behave that way. A new connection is used for each transfer; to avoid running afoul of TCP’s TIMEWAIT state, the client picks a new port number each time and sends a PORT command announcing that to the server. Neither scenario is firewall-friendly. If a packet filter is used (as, for example, provided by most modern routers), the data channel requests appear as <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> to unknown ports. Most firewalls are constructed to allow <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> <b>only</b> to certain believed-tobe-safe ports, such as SMTP. The usual compromise is to block onl...|$|R
30|$|Secondly, we {{evaluate}} the scenario {{that half of}} the electricity consumed by the base station was provided by diesel generators and the other half by the electrical grid which would increase the carbon intensity from 0.426 kgCO 2 e/kWh to 0.602 kgCO 2 e/kWh. We include the assumption that this would free capacity in the electrical grid. In our scenario, the mobile network would consume 0.95 % of Cote d’Ivoire’s electrical energy and constitute 0.62 % of the national GHG emissions. We also considered evaluating more complex assumptions about the types of base stations. Such a scenario would assume that network planners generate relatively precise predictions of demand in a cell. However, the number of outgoing calls that we plot in Figure  1 together with <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> are <b>only</b> a possible proxy to overall demand of voice traffic. Data services and number of calls at peak time must both be considered to estimate the minimum capacity of a base station. We believe that the results of such a scenario would have too much uncertainty to bring significant value for our discussion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Voice over Internet Protocol is {{a steady}} growing market. It saves {{a lot of}} money for {{providers}} as well as for users. However, spammers could also transmit their messages over this service. This so called Spam over Internet Telephony is more difficult to filter than e-mail spam, because its content is not available in advance. Two kinds of Spam over Internet Telephony can be differentiated: Spam over Internet Tele-phony via Proxy and Direct Spam over Internet Telephony. Direct Spam over Internet Telephony is the direct transmission of unsolicited messages to a lot of user equipment. Therefore, this is the most dangerous form of Spam over Internet Telephony, because no proxy is passed, which could be able to filter the message flow. A solution to face Direct Spam over Internet Telephony is still missing. This gap is closed by the proposed caller pre-validation mechanism. The basic idea is to get more information about an <b>incoming</b> direct <b>call.</b> <b>Only</b> <b>calls</b> of existing participants are connected. The caller is trusted if his existence can be validated successfully. So, a first technique against Direct Spam over Internet Telephony is given with the presented mechanism.

40|$|Techniques for channel {{allocation}} in cellular {{networks have}} been an area of intense research interest for many years. An efficient channel allocation scheme can significantly reduce call-blocking and calldropping probabilities. Another important issue is to effectively manage the power requirements for communication. An efficient power control strategy leads to reduced power consumption and improved signal quality. In this paper, we present a novel integer linear program (ILP) formulation that jointly optimizes channel allocation and power control for <b>incoming</b> <b>calls,</b> based on the carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR). In our approach we use a hybrid channel assignment scheme, where an <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> is admitted <b>only</b> if a suitable channel is found such that the CIR of all ongoing calls on that channel, {{as well as that}} of the new call, will be above a specified value. Our formulation also guarantees that the overall power requirement for the selected channel will be minimized as much as possible and that no ongoing calls will be dropped as a result of admitting the new call. We have run simulations on a benchmark 49 cell environment with 70 channels to investigate the effect of different parameters such as the desired CIR. The results indicate that our approach leads to significant improvements over existing techniques. Comment: 11 page...|$|R
40|$|Efficient use of {{call center}} {{operators}} through technological innovations more often {{come at the}} expense of added operation management issues. In this paper, the stationary characteristics of an $M/G/ 1 $ retrial queue is investigated where the single server, subject to active failures, primarily attends <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> and directs outgoing <b>calls</b> <b>only</b> when idle. The <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> arriving at the server follow a Poisson arrival process, while outgoing calls are made in an exponentially distributed time. On finding the server unavailable (either busy or temporarily broken down), <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> intrinsically join the virtual orbit from which they re-attempt for service at exponentially distributed time intervals. The system stability condition along with probability generating functions for the joint queue length distribution of the number of calls in the orbit and the state of the server are derived and evaluated numerically in the context of mean system size, server availability, failure frequency and orbit waiting time.

40|$|Mobile {{cell phone}} users have {{reported}} experiencing ringing and/or vibrations associated with <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> and messages, <b>only</b> {{to find that}} no call or message had actually registered. We believe this phenomenon {{can be understood as}} a human signal detection issue, with potentially important influences from psychological attributes. We hypothesized that individuals higher in attachment anxiety would report more frequent phantom cell phone experiences, whereas individuals higher in attachment avoidance would report less frequent experiences. If these experiences are primarily psychologically related to attributes of interpersonal relationships, associations with attachment style should be stronger than for general sensation seeking. We also predicted that certain contexts would interact with attachment style to increase or decrease the likelihood of experiencing phantom cell phone calls and messages. Attachment anxiety directly predicted the frequency of phantom ringing and notification experiences, whereas attachment avoidance and sensation seeking did not directly predict frequency. Attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance interacted with contextual factors (expectations for a call or message and concerned about an issue that one may be contacted about) in the expected directions for predicting phantom cell phone experiences...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Virtual {{connection}} tree (VCT) is {{a network}} architecture that can upgrade the quality-of-service (QoS) in wireless {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM) network. The call admission control (CAC) limits the <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> into the network {{in order to maintain}} the quality-of-service of the on going calls, which are already connected to the network. In this paper two different types of systems using VCT are compared, one with queue for new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> and the other without the queue of the new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls.</b> Both of the systems use prioritizing scheme of handoff calls. There will be some delay of the new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> when using system with queue. The probability of delay and the handoff dropping probability of the systems will be analyzed...|$|R

The JCAC algorithm in JRRM module then selects for the <b>incoming</b> <b>call,</b> a set of T RATs (0 [*]≤[*]T[*]≤[*]J) from the available RATs in the heterogeneous network, where T is the number of RATs selected. T[*]=[*] 0 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> cannot be admitted into the heterogeneous network. Therefore, the call is blocked or dropped. T[*]=[*] 1 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> can be admitted into just one of the available RATs. Hence, there is no layer splitting. T[*]>[*] 1 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> is scalable and it will be admitted into more than one RAT.|$|R
