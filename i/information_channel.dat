5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode of broadcasting called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate <b>information</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E

The finding of the study revealed that both information source and <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> factors significantly affect the information choice strategies of the Arab tourists.

500|$|Information channels: Information-theoretic {{approaches}} {{model the}} process of translating the genetic code into corresponding amino acids as an error-prone <b>information</b> <b>channel.</b> The inherent noise (that is, the error) in the channel poses the organism with a fundamental question: how can a genetic code be constructed to withstand noise while accurately and efficiently translating information? These [...] "rate-distortion" [...] models suggest that the genetic code originated {{as a result of}} the interplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse amino acids, for error-tolerance and for minimal resource cost. The code emerges at a transition when the mapping of codons to amino acids becomes nonrandom. The code's emergence is governed by the topology defined by the probable errors and is related to the map coloring problem.|$|E

40|$|The aims {{of current}} study were {{to assess the}} level of tobacco knowledge, anti-tobacco {{messages}} and major <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> in Zhejiang. Face-to-face {{interviews were conducted with}} 2112 adults in Zhejiang. Data on demographic information, smoking status, tobacco knowledge, anti-tobacco messages and major <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> was collected. The findings revealed that only 31. 87 % of the population were aware that smoking could cause all three diseases (stoke, heart disease, and lung cancer), 86. 09 % were aware that smoking causes lung cancer, 46. 43 % and 42. 40 % were aware that smoking causes stroke and heart attack, respectively. Residence and education level had significant effects on awareness, while the effects of smoking status, gender, age, and household monthly income were not significant. There were five major <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> as follows: television (67. 52 %), newspapers or magazines (40. 79 %), billboards (30. 02 %), public walls (24. 72), and radio (23. 79 %). Respondents got the following anti-tobacco messages from mass media: "No smoking in public" (66. 34 %), "No smoking in front of other people" (35. 18 %) and "Not offering cigarettes to one another" (22. 82 %). The tobacco knowledge among residents in Zhejiang province is relatively poor. Improved <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> and content of anti-tobacco messages are necessary to increase the public's tobacco knowledge, particularly among rural residents and people with less education...|$|R

The dispute was also over The Weather Channel's programming format shifting from an information-based channel to an entertainment-based service. The Weather Channel said in a statement, [...] "Dish has chosen to be the first distributor to drop The Weather Channel rather than pay the standard industry rates others in the industry have already agreed to pay", and encouraged Dish Network customers to switch to other pay television providers. Dave Shull, senior vice president for programming for Dish Network said The Weather Channel's fees were harder for the satellite provider to justify paying as more people receive weather information through the internet and mobile services: [...] "They're looking for bid increases when I feel like there's a real migration to the Web, and it's difficult to really justify those rate increases at this time." ...|$|E

Furthermore, they control and operate publicly accessible <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> that serve as marketplaces for the underground economy. In this work, we present a novel system for automatically monitoring these channels and their participants.

We implemented a prototype that is capable of monitoring IRC (Internet Relay Chat) and web forum marketplaces, and successfully performed an experimental evaluation over a period of 11 months.
