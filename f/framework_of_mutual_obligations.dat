50|$|A most {{important}} {{legacy of the}} project according to academic Dave Palmer was that people connected with their culture in a new way, building strong identities and asserting themselves flexibly and successfully in a multicultural context. The Pitjantjatjara concept of ‘ngapartji ngapartji’ itself provided the overarching framework for such {{a new form of}} intercultural engagement: glossed as ‘I give you something. You give me something’ it denotes a reciprocal exchange of gifts that create a social <b>framework</b> <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>obligations.</b> In contrast to Western ideas of trade, here the defining element of exchange is not the material value of the objects and services traded but the fact that trading itself establishes bonds that link people to each other - not only in a material way, but also socially, emotionally and spiritually. Consequently, it is deferral of immediate gratification that keeps people engaged and not a quid pro quo situation that is sought.|$|E

This paper explores {{the effectiveness of}} the Green Reserve, and similarly conceived Work for the Dole programmes, by critically exploring the two frameworks in which they are situated and from which they draw. The paper contends that some of the conceptual and political limitations <b>of</b> <b>Mutual</b> <b>Obligation</b> and Sustainable Development combine to undermine the effectiveness of Work for the Dole programmes such as the Green Reserve. A gap often emerges between the rhetoric <b>of</b> these policy <b>frameworks</b> and their tangible achievements in practice.

In order to enhance these environmental and employment objectives, the paper recommends some alternative approaches towards greening and strengthening <b>mutual</b> <b>obligation.</b> Griffith Business School, School of Government and International RelationsNo Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} I analyse the Supreme Court’s {{landmark}} ruling in Boumediene v. Bush {{against the background}} of the discussion concerning the extraterritorial scope of the U. S. Constitution. The long-standing discussion about the scope of constitutional rights is situated within the theoretical framework elaborated by Gerald Neuman who distinguishes between membership models, universalism, ‘global due process’ and the model of ‘mutual obligations’. The last model, which is based on a limited government perspective tends towards the ideal of judicial cosmopolitanism. I argue that Justice Kennedy’s opinion for the Court does not live up to the cosmopolitan ideal of the model <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>obligations</b> as it was elaborated in Justice Brennan’s dissent in Verdugo and that Kennedy’s casuistic and flexible approach lends itself to possible manipulation. I argue that this danger can be reduced by adopting the minimum standards of international law as a second order framework for constitutional interpretation and I show that the ethical nexus between effective control and responsibility is common to the normative model <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>obligations,</b> on the one hand, and to the framework adopted in European human rights law and international humanitarian law, on the other...|$|R

Collective sanctions, represented by the ostracism of non-normative agents, produced levels <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> <b>obligation</b> comparable {{to the case of}} strong individual norms, but with significant risk of population collapse. The probability of long term survival was highest when tolerance to transgressions was either very low or very high and we propose that this may be one reason for the similarity of normative systems across diverse egalitarian cultures.

This artificially static representation justifies the enforced obligations found in current unemployed policy. Other citizens are represented as eternal contributors who are already fulfilling their obligations, a conceptualisation that offers little guidance on general civic responsibilities.
