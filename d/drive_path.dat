These machines are an essential part {{in the flow of}} ore transportation out of the mine and therefore the driving speed of these machines is very important. Today the drive paths for these machines are drawn by hand in computer software and this is a human-computer interaction that LKAB wants to remove because of the time consumption and also for the possibility to automatically generate faster and more optimized drive paths. Research has been conducted at Luleå University of Technology concerning optimization of drive paths for autonomous machines. This research resulted in a software prototype that integrated map-handling and path generation for the machines at LKAB. This prototype was based on a path generation algorithm with the unfortunately limitation of that the polygon must be monotone, and that is not the typical case for the drive paths that the machines are using. This thesis will show an implementation of an extension of this prototype that will improve the functionality so that polygons without constraints can be used in the calculations of optimized drive paths.

30|$|In this framework, the {{existence}} of self-reinforcing mechanisms is {{a necessary condition for}} unfolding the narrowing dynamics that results in path dependence. In Phase II, agents enjoy the benefits of positive feedback and by doing so they increasingly commit (unconsciously) to path building. The diminishing variety and rising limitation of choices are (often overlooked) collateral side effects of this process. Path dependence research has hallmarked self-reinforcing mechanisms that <b>drive</b> <b>path</b> emerging processes (Katz and Shapiro 1985; Schreyögg and Sydow 2011; Dobusch and Schüßler 2013; Arthur 2018). Various forms of self-reinforcing mechanisms can be distinguished. From an institutional perspective, two mechanisms deserve particular attention: The coordination effect and the logic of complementarities. The coordination effect (North 1990) refers to the increasing benefits of coordinated behavior. The more the agents adopt a specific institution the better their behavior becomes expectable for others, which in turn makes coordination among these agents easier and more efficient. Thus, shared rules contribute to the anticipation of agents’ behavior; reactions become foreseeable and, as a result, uncertainty in transactions and coordination costs can be reduced. From an agent’s point of view, the attractiveness of adopting an institution rises with its spread.|$|E

A general method to calculate the winding factors with different combinations of pole and slot numbers is proposed so that optimal slot numbers (12, 15, and 18) for concentrated windings with relative high winding factors are found. Those winding layouts prove to be advantageous to exhibit lower Joule losses compared to the full-pitch distributed windings. Nevertheless, a further study shows that a better thermal performance can be achieved by the toroidal winding topology in spite of its even higher Joule loss, due to its large area of exposed coils where an effective cooling mechanism can be implemented...|$|E

For TiN, I observe selective oxidation of Ti atoms and formation of an ultrathin Ti oxide layer, while Ti vacancies are left behind at the metal/oxide interface. Within the formalism of ab initio thermodynamics I compute the segregation energies of vacancies and vacancy clusters at the metal/oxide interface, comparing {{the stability of the}} system obtained by FPMD simulations with ideally reconstructed models. Oxide nucleation on cobalt initially follows a metastable, kinetically <b>driven</b> <b>path</b> that results from the high heat release during the dissociation of O 2. The early place-exchange of metal and oxygen atoms leads to the growth of an open, pseudo-amorphous oxide structure with evident Co 3 O 4 -like features. Instead, the oxidation of Cr(110) occurs along an energy path close to thermodynamic equilibrium and limited by Cr-ion diffusion already in the earliest oxidation stages. The initial formation of highly oxidized chromate-like structures seems to be precursory for the subsequent growth of Cr 2 O 3 thin films. The oxidation of CoCr alloys occurs via selective oxidation of chromium, which provide vacancies enabling the diffusion of oxygen atoms into inner atomic layers. This outward diffusion of chromium is strongly facilitated by the matrix of amorphous cobalt. In summary, I suggest that superficial oxidation may proceed along two distinct possible pathways: a thermodynamically stable path along the potential energy minimum surface and a metastable, kinetically <b>driven</b> <b>path</b> that results from the high heat release during the dissociation of O 2...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of the drive-by {{noise level}} in the early design stage of an {{automotive}} vehicle is feasible if the source signatures and source-receiver transfer functions may be determined from simulations based on the available CAD/CAE models. This paper reports {{on the performance of}} a drive-by noise synthesis procedure in which the transfer functions are numerically evaluated by employing the Fast Multipole Boundary Element Method (FMBEM). The proposed synthesis procedure first computes the steady-state receiver contributions of the sources as appearing from a number of vehicle positions along the <b>drive</b> <b>path.</b> In a second step, these contributions are then combined into a single transient signal from a moving vehicle for each source-receiver pair by means of a travel time correction. The determination of the multiple source-receiver transfer functions {{is by far the most}} computationally intensive part in the procedure, and an FMBEM configuration is presented that is optimized for predicting the drive-by noise source pressure levels (SPLs). The introduced approximations result in an overall reduction in accuracy of about 1 dB while reducing the computation time to 25 - 30 hours on a modern desktop pc for a frequency range up to 2. 2 kHz. To coarsen the frequency resolution, a frequency domain interpolation approach is discussed that yields good results in reconstructing the impulse response functions. The accuracy of the transfer functions is studied by comparison of twelve simulated transfer functions with measured ones for a Dodge Neon vehicle, showing a deviation of 3 - 5 dB for most sources. The resulting drive-by noise levels are presented and discussed for the tires, exhaust and intake. The developed synthesis procedure allows for the prediction of the drive-by noise level on the basis of CAD/CAE models with a satisfactory accuracy and within a feasible evaluation time. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Mars Exploration Rovers (MERs), Spirit and Opportunity, far {{exceeded}} their original drive distance expectations and have traveled, {{at the time}} of this reporting, a combined 29 kilometers across the surface of Mars. The Rover Sequencing and Visualization Program (RSVP), the current program used to plan drives for MERs, is only a kinematic simulator of rover movement. Therefore, rover response to various terrains and soil types cannot be modeled. Although sandbox experiments attempt to model rover-terrain interaction, these experiments are time-intensive and costly, and they cannot be used within the tactical timeline of rover driving. Imaging techniques and hazard avoidance features on MER help to prevent the rover from traveling over dangerous terrains, but mobility issues have shown that these methods are not always sufficient. ARTEMIS, a dynamic modeling tool for MER, allows planned drives to be simulated before commands are sent to the rover. The deformable soils component of this model allows rover-terrain interactions to be simulated to determine if a particular <b>drive</b> <b>path</b> would take the rover over terrain that would induce hazardous levels of slip or sink. When used in the rover drive planning process, dynamic modeling reduces the likelihood of future mobility issues because high-risk areas could be identified before drive commands are sent to the rover, and drives planned over these areas could be rerouted. The ARTEMIS software consists of several components. These include a preprocessor, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), Adams rover model, wheel and soil parameter files, MSC Adams GUI (commercial), MSC Adams dynamics solver (commercial), terramechanics subroutines (FORTRAN), a contact detection engine, a soil modification engine, and output DEMs of deformed soil.

The-spline is a ninth-order polynomial curve that can interpolate given Cartesian points with associated arbitrary unit tangent vector, curvature, and first and second derivatives of curvature. It depends on a set of eight (eta) parameters that can be freely chosen to modify the path shape without changing the in-terpolations conditions at the path endpoints.

It is demonstrated that in comparison with conventional helicopter transmission arrangements the split torque design offers: weight reduction of 15 %; reduction in drive train losses of 9 %; and improved reliability resulting from redundant <b>drive</b> <b>paths</b> between the two engines and the main shaft. The transmission fits within the NASA LeRC 3000 hp Test Stand and accepts the existing positions for engine inputs, main shaft, connecting drive shafts, and the cradle attachment points. One necessary change to the test stand involved gear trains of different ratio in the tail drive gearbox. Progressive uprating of engine input power from 3600 to 4500 hp twin engine rating is allowed for in the design. In this way the test transmission will provide a base for several years of analytical, research, and component development effort targeted at improving the performance and reliability of helicopter transmission...|$|R

This path is a popular access point for cyclists coming off the River <b>Drive</b> bike <b>paths</b> to Center City Philadelphia, or for pedestrians departing the Manayunk/Norristown Line transit route at Wissahickon Station or Bus Interchange.|$|R
40|$|The primary aim in the {{treatment}} of autoimmune inflammatory myopathies (IMs) is to recover muscle function. The presence of immune/inflammatory cell infiltrates within muscle tissues represents the common feature of different IM subtypes, albeit a correlation between muscular damage extent and inflammation degree is often lacking. Treatments for IMs are based on life-long immunosuppressive therapy, with the well known adverse effects; recovery is incomplete for many patients. More effective therapies, with reduced side-effects, are highly desirable. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonists emerge to retain pleiotropic anti-inflammatory properties, since they regulate innate and adaptive immunity by switching the immune response from proinflammatory T helper 1 (Th 1) type to tolerogenic T helper 2 (Th 2) type dominance. In skeletal muscle cells less hypercalcemic VDR ligands target powerful mediators of inflammation, such as TNFα and TNFα <b>driven</b> <b>paths,</b> without affecting immune or muscle cells viability, retaining the potentiality to counteract Th 1 driven overreactivity established by the self-enhancing inflammatory loop between immune and skeletal muscle cells. This review summarizes those features of VDR agonists as candidates in future treatment of IM...|$|R
