25|$|The XL2 is a {{derivative}} of the Europa amateur-built kit touring airplane and motor-glider. It was type certified in 2004 under FAR Part 23 for VFR and <b>IFR</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
25|$|The flight {{took off}} from Macaé at 17:19 local time. At the time, it was {{operating}} under instrument flight rules (IFR) with an {{estimated time of arrival}} at 18:02. After taking off from Macaé, the crew stated their intention to cancel their <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan and added that they wanted to continue the flight under visual flight rules (VFR). This cancellation was approved by an air traffic controller.|$|E
25|$|On May 21, 1997, SkyWest Airlines Flight 724, an Embraer EMB-120 (N198SW), {{experienced}} {{a total loss}} of engine power to the right engine and associated engine fire, followed by a total loss of all airplane hydraulic systems, after takeoff from San Diego International-Lindbergh Field, San Diego, California. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The 2 pilots, 1 flight attendant, and 14 passengers were not injured. Skywest Airlines, Inc., was operating the airplane as a scheduled, domestic, passenger flight under 14 CFR Part 121. The flight was destined for Los Angeles, California. It diverted to NAS Miramar, San Diego, where it landed at 14:27 hrs. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time, and an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan was filed.|$|E

50|$|Class C {{airspace}} {{is defined}} below 8100 m and allows IFR and VFR operations. Both IFR and VFR operations {{are required to}} have permanent two-way radio contact with ATC. <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> are separated {{from each other and}} from VFR flights. VFR flights are separated from <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> and are provided traffic information about other VFR flights. Permission for using airspace is required except for the special cases listed in clause 114 of the Federal rules for using Russian air space.|$|R
5000|$|In the USA and Canada, for {{eastbound}} (heading 0-179 degrees) <b>IFR</b> <b>flights,</b> {{the flight}} plan must list an [...] "odd" [...] flight level in 2000 foot increments starting at FL190 (i.e., FL190, FL210, FL230, etc.); Westbound (heading 180-359 degrees) <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> must list an [...] "even" [...] flight level in 2000 foot increments starting at FL180 (i.e., FL180, FL200, FL220, etc.). However, Air Traffic Control (ATC) may assign any flight level {{at any time}} if traffic situations merit a change in altitude.|$|R
500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 19, 1969, at about 20:03 EST, Mohawk Airlines Flight 411, a twin engine Fairchild FH-227B turboprop, {{departed}} from Albany International Airport near Albany, New York. It was operating as a scheduled passenger/cargo flight [...] on an instrument flight rules (<b>IFR)</b> <b>flight</b> plan to its destination of Warren County Airport in Glens Falls, New York, [...] northeast, with an estimated flight time of about 15 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Neither {{flight crew}} was {{specifically}} {{implicated in the}} CAB's finding of probable cause, although the decision by TWA's Captain Gandy to cancel his <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan and fly [...] "1,000 on top" [...] was the likely catalyst for the accident. Also worth noting was that the investigation itself was thorough in all respects, but the final report focused on technical issues and largely ignored contributory human factors, such as why the airlines permitted their pilots to execute maneuvers solely intended to improve the passengers' view of the canyon. It would not be until the late 1970s that human factors would be as thoroughly investigated as technical matters following aerial mishaps.|$|E

The Winter Training Brochure is oriented towards a brief and clear explanation of the basic principles and requirements for the correct and safe use of GNSS devices during the flight, with regard to the target group, pilots and instructors, different age, experience and skill categories. The Winter Training Brochure is divided into three main parts, Part 1 addresses the basic theoretical bases and GNSS principles common for VFR and <b>IFR</b> <b>flights,</b> Part 2 deals with the principles of GNSS use for VFR flights, Part 3 deals with the principles of GNSS use for <b>IFR</b> <b>flights...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> in {{controlled}} airspace require an ATC clearance for {{each part of}} the flight. A clearance always specifies a clearance limit, which is the farthest the aircraft can fly without a new clearance. In addition, a clearance typically provides a heading or route to follow, altitude, and communication parameters, such as frequencies and transponder codes.|$|R
5000|$|Charts {{used for}} <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> contain an {{abundance}} of information regarding locations of waypoints, known as [...] "fixes", which are defined by measurements from electronic beacons of various types, {{as well as the}} routes connecting these waypoints. Only limited topographic information is found on IFR charts, although the minimum safe altitudes available on the routes are shown.|$|R

50|$|Standard {{instrument}} departure (SID) routes, {{also known}} as departure procedures (DP), are published flight procedures followed by aircraft on an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan immediately after takeoff from an airport.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, a {{standard}} terminal arrival route or standard terminal arrival (STAR) is a published procedure followed by aircraft on an <b>IFR</b> <b>flight</b> plan just before reaching a destination airport.|$|E
50|$|Since VFR {{flights are}} not {{necessarily}} conducted on straight lines between ground-based radio navigation transmitters, the altitude restrictions for <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> are not applicable. Instead, a VFR flight can be conducted using pilotage, watching landmarks to determine position and desired direction. In this situation, the minimum reception altitude becomes moot, and the over-riding concern is for obstacle clearance.|$|R
40|$|A {{report is}} {{presented}} to describe some of the errors that pilots make during <b>flight</b> under <b>IFR.</b> The data indicate that there is less risk during the approach and landing phase of <b>IFR</b> <b>flights,</b> as compared to VFR operations.

50|$|ATC do {{not control}} all flights. The {{majority}} of VFR flights in North America {{are not required}} to talk to ATC (unless they are passing through a busy terminal area or using a major airport), and in many areas, such as northern Canada and low altitude in northern Scotland, Air traffic control services are not available even for <b>IFR</b> <b>flights</b> at lower altitudes.|$|R
