25|$|Though {{technically}} {{not part}} of two-wheel ("bicycle") history, the intervening decades of the 1820s-1850s witnessed many developments concerning human-powered vehicles often using technologies similar to the draisine, even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a workable two-wheel design, requiring the rider to balance, had been dismissed. These new machines had three wheels (tricycles) or four (quadracycles) and came in a very wide variety of designs, using pedals, treadles, and hand-cranks, but these designs often suffered from high weight and high rolling resistance. However, Willard Sawyer in Dover successfully manufactured a range of treadle-operated 4-wheel vehicles and exported them worldwide in the 1850s.|$|E
25|$|It is {{relatively}} difficult {{to start a}} housing co-op because <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is, for instance, to build a building or group of buildings to house the members, this usually takes a significant mortgage loan for which a financial institution will want assurances of responsibility.

It is rare that these kinds of skills of organization are available in a random group of people who often have pressures on their existing housing.

500|$|Additional {{content was}} added to the North American release that was absent in the initial Japanese release: new {{optional}} bosses, one of which was named after the winner of the official website's [...] "Name-In-Game" [...] sweepstakes, an extra difficulty level, and a teaser of Kingdom Hearts II accessible by meeting certain criteria. Nomura included the teaser in order to gauge fan reaction to the possibility of a sequel; he felt that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> was unpopular, then {{it would be best to}} leave certain events in the game unexplained. The new content was later added to the Japanese re-release titled Kingdom Hearts Final Mix. Final Mix also included additional content such as new items, cut scenes, and enemies, such as a new secret boss that sets up the sequel. The new content further hinted at plotlines that would be explained in sequels. Some content omitted from Kingdom Hearts was later added into Kingdom Hearts II. A world based on The Lion King, for instance, was unfeasible because an additional program was required to process movement on four legs—a necessity since Sora would become a lion in that world. Due to time constraints, the developers left out an optional boss battle, similar to the Sephiroth battle, against Tifa Lockhart. She was later included in Kingdom Hearts II as a more developed character.|$|E
2500|$|Descartes {{separates}} external objects {{into those}} that are clear and distinct and {{those that are}} confused and obscure. [...] The former group consists of the ideas of extension, duration and movement. These geometrical ideas cannot be misconstrued or combined {{in a way that makes}} them false. [...] For example, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a creature with the head of a giraffe, the body of a lion and tail of a beaver was constructed and the question asked if the creature had a large intestine, the answer would have to be invented. But, no mathematical re-arrangement of a triangle could allow its three internal angles to sum to anything but 180 degrees. Thus, Descartes perceived that truths may have a nature or essence of themselves, independent of the thinker. (In Descartes' formulation, this is a mathematical truth only pragmatically related to nature; the properties of triangles in Euclidean geometry remain mathematically certain) ...|$|E

2500|$|Milton's first {{criticism}} of idolatry {{focuses on the}} practice of constructing temples and other buildings to serve as places of worship. In Book XI of Paradise Lost, Adam tries to atone for his sins by offering to build altars to worship God. In response, the angel Michael explains that Adam {{does not need to}} build physical objects to experience the presence of God. Joseph Lyle points to this example, explaining [...] "When Milton objects to architecture, it is not a quality inherent in buildings themselves he finds offensive, but rather their tendency to act as convenient loci to which idolatry, over time, will inevitably adhere." [...] Even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is pure in nature, Milton still believes that it will unavoidably lead to idolatry simply {{because of the nature of}} humans. Instead of directing their thoughts towards God, as they should, humans tend to turn to erected objects and falsely invest their faith. While Adam attempts to build an altar to God, critics note Eve is similarly guilty of idolatry, but in a different manner. Harding believes Eve's narcissism and obsession with herself constitutes idolatry. Specifically, Harding claims that [...] "... under the serpent's influence, Eve's idolatry and self-deification foreshadow the errors into which her 'Sons' will stray." [...] Much like Adam, Eve falsely places her faith into herself, the Tree of Knowledge, and to some extent, the Serpent, all of which do not compare to the ideal nature of God.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of pre-existence {{within the}} poem {{contains}} {{only a limited}} theological component, and Wordsworth later believed that the concept was [...] "far too shadowy a notion to be recommended to faith." [...] In 1989, Gene Ruoff argued that the idea was connected to Christian theology in that the Christian theorist Origen adopted the belief and relied {{on it in the}} development of Christian doctrine. What is missing in Origen's platonic system is Wordsworth's emphasis on childhood, which could be found in the beliefs of the Cambridge Platonists and their works, including Henry Vaughan's [...] "The Retreate". Even <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> is not Christian, it still cannot be said that the poem lacks a theological component because the poem incorporates spiritual images of natural scenes found in childhood. Among those natural scenes, the narrator includes a Hebrew prayer-like praise of God for the restoration of the soul to the body in the morning and the attributing of God's blessing to the various animals he sees. What concerns the narrator is that he is not being renewed like the animals and he is fearful over what he is missing. This is similar to a fear that is provided at the beginning of The Prelude and in Tintern Abbey. As for the understanding of the soul contained within the poem, Wordsworth is more than Platonic in that he holds an Augustinian concept of mercy that leads to the progress of the soul. Wordsworth differs from Augustine in that Wordsworth seeks in the poem to separate himself from the theory of solipsism, the belief that nothing exists outside of the mind. The soul, over time, exists in a world filled with the sublime before moving to the natural world, and the man moves from an egocentric world to a world with nature and then to a world with mankind. This system links nature with a renewal of the self.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{foreign policy}} goal of Franz Joseph {{had been the}} {{unification}} of Germany under the House of Habsburg. This was justified on grounds of precedence; from 1452 {{to the end of}} the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, with only one period of interruption under the Wittelsbachs, the Habsburgs had generally held the German crown. However, Franz Joseph's desire to retain the non-German territories of the Habsburg Austrian Empire in the event of German unification proved problematic. There quickly developed two factions: one party of German intellectuals favouring a Greater Germany (Großdeutschland) under the House of Habsburg; the other favouring a Lesser Germany (Kleindeutschland) [...] The Greater Germans favoured the inclusion of Austria in a new all-German state on the grounds that Austria had always been a part of Germanic empires, that it was the leading power of the German Confederation, and that it would be absurd to exclude eight million Austrian Germans from an all-German nation state. The champions of a lesser Germany argued against the inclusion of Austria on the grounds that it was a multi-nation state, not a German one, and that its inclusion would bring millions of non-Germans into the German nation state. If Greater Germany was to prevail, the crown would necessarily have to go to Franz Joseph, who had no desire to cede it in the first place to anyone else. On the other hand, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a smaller Germany won out, the German crown could of course not possibly go the Emperor of Austria, but would naturally be offered to the head of the largest and most powerful German state outside of Austria—the King of Prussia. The contest between the two ideas, quickly developed into a contest between Austria and Prussia. [...] After Prussia decisively won the Seven Weeks War, this question was solved; Austria lost no territories as long as they remained out of German affairs.|$|E

5000|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} whether a substantial similarity between the two works existed, the Ninth Circuit applied the [...] "extrinsic-intrinsic test". The purpose of this test is to determine <b>if</b> both <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> and <b>the</b> expression of those ideas are substantially similar in the two works.

The extrinsic test, which determines <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> embodied by <b>the</b> works are the same, was used to determine that <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> ("a martial arts karate combat game conducted between two combatants") were similar or identical.
