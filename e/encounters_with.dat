5|$|Both {{males and}} females utilize calls in alarm situations, {{especially}} in territorial disputes and <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> predators. Males alone produce the cheer call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing pink or p'dink sound. Females {{are the only ones}} that can perform the paired dit-dit or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males cheer chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.|$|E

5|$|Brown bears {{typically}} dominate wolf packs in {{disputes over}} carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites. Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the brown bears they kill, while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves. Wolf interactions with American black bears are much rarer than with brown bears, because {{of differences in}} habitat preferences. The majority of black bear <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike brown bears, black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. While <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> brown and black bears appear to be common, polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs. Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears.|$|E
