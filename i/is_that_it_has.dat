5|$|A {{characteristic}} that distinguishes Cetiosauriscus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> axially concave summits on the cranial and middle caudal neural spines. Barosaurus differs {{from it in}} having a more complex sculpting laterally and ventrally in the caudals; in having a larger humerus-femur ratio; and in having differently developed chevrons.|$|E
5|$|The {{most basic}} {{property}} of the Reuleaux triangle <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> constant width, meaning that for every pair of parallel supporting lines (two lines of the same slope that both touch the shape without crossing through it) the two lines have the same Euclidean distance from each other, regardless of the orientation of these lines. In any pair of parallel supporting lines, {{one of the two}} lines will necessarily touch the triangle at one of its vertices. The other supporting line may touch the triangle at any point on the opposite arc, and their distance (the width of the Reuleaux triangle) equals the radius of this arc.|$|E
5|$|One unique {{feature of}} the ELCA {{calendar}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> given congregations the options of two dates for the Transfiguration. Following most other Western Churches, the ELCA moved the Transfiguration from its August 6 date to the Last Sunday after Epiphany (the Sunday immediately preceding Ash Wednesday) as an option to the traditional Last Sunday after Epiphany {{in an effort to}} encourage a wider observance of the Transfiguration within congregations. However, the traditional date of August 6 was left on the calendar. Congregations were given the option of observing Transfiguration on the Last Sunday after the Epiphany and August 6, thus leaving open the possibility that the Transfiguration could be commemorated twice within a calendar year. In Sweden, Transfiguration Day is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Trinity Sunday, which is the eighth Sunday after Pentecost.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, a {{condition}} for both categories <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>have</b> the ability to monitor continuously and record its results.|$|R
50|$|A common feature {{about the}} Urbanstar/Compass <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a rounded roof dome (more rounded as {{compared}} to the Nimbus), a double-curvature windscreen and a separately mounted destination display.|$|R
50|$|Another odd legend {{regarding}} this fish-eating bird of prey, {{derived from the}} writings of Albertus Magnus and recorded in Holinsheds Chronicles, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> one webbed foot and one taloned foot.|$|R
5|$|The {{defining}} {{dynamic characteristic}} of a planet <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> cleared its neighborhood. A planet that has cleared its neighborhood has accumulated enough mass to gather up or sweep away all the planetesimals in its orbit. In effect, it orbits its star in isolation, as opposed to sharing its orbit with a multitude of similar-sized objects. This characteristic was mandated {{as part of the}} IAU's official definition of a planet in August, 2006. This criterion excludes such planetary bodies as Pluto, Eris and Ceres from full-fledged planethood, making them instead dwarf planets. Although to date this criterion only applies to the Solar System, a number of young extrasolar systems have been found in which evidence suggests orbital clearing is taking place within their circumstellar discs.|$|E
25|$|One {{of several}} {{negative}} impacts of this invasive species <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a detrimental effect on eelgrass.|$|E
25|$|Armenian is a pluricentric language, {{having two}} modern {{standardized}} forms: Eastern Armenian and Western Armenian. The most distinctive feature of Western Armenian <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> undergone several phonetic mergers; {{these may be}} due to proximity to Arabic- and Turkish-speaking communities.|$|E
30|$|The {{calculations}} I {{have done}} are at about [X] dollar in volume, but then I doubled <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> could <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> to <b>be</b> doubled again, {{there is such}} uncertainty at this stage.|$|R
25|$|The Commission's own {{estimate}} of its expenditures, {{as at the}} date of publishing its report, <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> spent approximately 60million. This figure makes this Royal Commission {{one of the most}} expensive in Australia's history.|$|R
25|$|Reid's view on {{apartheid}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{nothing to}} do with sport; nor should it affect it. Even in the late-1980s, when he lived and coached in South Africa, he remained opposed to the sports boycott.|$|R
25|$|A {{big part}} of Facebook's pitch <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> so much {{information}} about its users that it can more effectively target ads to those who will be responsive to the content. If Facebook can prove that theory to be true, then it may not worry so much about losing its cool cachet.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of TDWRs over previous weather radars <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a finer range resolutionmeaning it can see smaller {{areas of the}} atmosphere. The reason for the resolution is that the TDWR has a narrower beam than traditional radar systems, and that it uses a set of algorithms to reduce ground clutter.|$|E
25|$|In the {{northern}} part of Puebla state, most notably in the municipalities of Aquixtla and Chignahuapan, Nahuatl-speaking indigenous peoples produce cooking utensils such as comals, pitchers, pots and more with a glazed finish. They use a Moorish kiln, which conserves fuel and heat. The distinguishing feature of this pottery <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> stamped designs, usually flowers. These stamps are cut clay tablets, which are impressed onto the pottery pieces.|$|E
5000|$|... "We had misconceptions of {{what and}} worshipwas... Our {{idea in the}} past <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to <b>be</b> {{acoustic}} guitar, piano, and organ. Now, all of that goes out the window." [...] Jeff Deyo on praise and worship music ...|$|R

30|$|As it is seen, case 1 has {{the least}} {{variance}} of MC, and therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> expected <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> better performance {{compared to other}} cases. On the other hand, case 4 has the biggest variance of MC, and therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> expected <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> the worst performance.|$|R
25|$|The {{disadvantage}} of the MRI scan {{in the face}} of aortic dissection <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> limited availability and is often located only in larger hospitals, and the scan is relatively time-consuming, which may be dangerous in people who are already very unwell. Due to the high-intensity magnetic fields used during MRI, it is contraindicated in individuals with metallic implants. In addition, many individuals experience claustrophobia while in the MRI scanning tube.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine is {{approved}} {{for use in}} children, adolescents, and adults. However, its efficacy has not been studied in children under six years old. Its primary advantage over the standard stimulant treatments for ADHD <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> little known abuse potential. While {{it has been shown}} to significantly reduce inattentive and hyperactive symptoms, the responses were lower than the response to stimulants. Additionally, 40% of participants who were treated with atomoxetine experienced significant residual ADHD symptoms.|$|E
25|$|I'm really {{pissed off}} with the BBC for {{bringing}} down my first three episodes to two and, in doing so, taking out much of the vital politics. What also makes me very grumpy is that I {{was told that the}} cuts had been introduced by the BBC because they thought British viewers already knew the historical background. But all that's happened as far as the viewer is concerned <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> made Rome hard to follow.|$|E
500|$|Although the Il-30 never {{actually}} flew, {{it was the}} subject of much (misinformed) speculation in the West.

50|$|Dragonshard {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} the gaming press. The game was praised for blending traditional real-time strategy with D&D role-playing elements. The main criticism {{for the game}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a short single-player mode, underscored by the complete lack of an Umbragen campaign.|$|R
2500|$|Dale {{said in a}} 2008 {{interview}} {{that one of his}} main incentives behind co-designing the Cirrus SR20 <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> to <b>be</b> an airplane <b>that</b> Patricia [...] "would want to fly in more than drive", which helped change the direction of the company in the 1990s.|$|R
25|$|Mushroom anchors are {{the most}} common anchors and work best for softer seabeds such as mud, sand, or silt. They are shaped like an {{upside-down}} mushroom which can be easily buried in mud or silt. The advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> up to ten times the holding-power-to-weight ratio compared to a dead weight mooring; disadvantages include high cost, limited success on rocky or pebbly substrates, and the long time it takes to reach full holding capacity.|$|E
25|$|The {{uniqueness}} of the temple <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> 66 idols of Shaiva saints called as Nayanmars and more than 100 Lingas (of different kinds and sizes) including the main deity of Srikanteshwara (Nanjundeshwara) Linga. The main deity is also called Hakim Nanjundeswara; a title given by Tippu Sultan. It is inscribed in the temple history that on Tippu Sultan’s special prayers to the deity, eyesight of the royal elephant was restored, where after the Sultan had a lingam made of jade along with an emerald necklace and donated it to the temple.|$|E
25|$|One {{special case}} {{of this is the}} {{inconsistent}} theory defined by the axiom ∃x ¬x = x. It is a perfectly good theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. The only problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> no models at all. By Gödel's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models. It {{is not the same as}} the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.|$|E
50|$|First {{built in}} 1888, {{the station was}} made out of red sandstone. The two-story {{building}} had a slate roof and an octagonal tower facing the tracks. A unique feature of the station <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> two different waiting rooms, one for men and one for women.|$|R
50|$|During {{his last}} years Richard was afflicted by a {{disorder}} that affected his speech, possibly a stroke, and <b>it</b> may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a similar cause to the paralysis that affected his uncle. He was also heavily in debt. He died on 4 May 1162.|$|R
30|$|The {{limits of}} this paper <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{confined}} to the boundaries of numerical examples. It would be beneficial to extend the research further so as to include real systems and to conduct a comparative study with an example for which a common Lyapunov function exists.|$|R
25|$|The {{adenovirus}} genome is linear, non-segmented double-stranded (ds) DNA that {{is between}} 26 and 48 Kbp. This allows {{the virus to}} theoretically carry 22 to 40 genes. Although this is significantly larger than other viruses in its Baltimore group, {{it is still a}} very simple virus and is heavily reliant on the host cell for survival and replication. An interesting feature of this viral genome <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a terminal 55 kDa protein associated with each of the 5' ends of the linear dsDNA. These are used as primers in viral replication and ensure that the ends of the virus' linear genome are adequately replicated.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, section 3(1)(e) {{differs from}} the classic common law idea of sedition {{because there is no}} {{requirement}} that the seditious tendency has to be directed against the maintenance of government. A District Court held in Public Prosecutor v. Ong Kian Cheong (2009) that on a plain and literal reading, there is no suggestion that Parliament intended to embody the common law of seditious libel into section 3(1)(e). Since prosecutions under the Sedition Act since 1966 have been based on section 3(1)(e), a distinctive feature of the use of the Act in the 21st century <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> primarily been employed to deal with disruptions to racial and religious harmony.|$|E
25|$|Gaur, {{also known}} as the Indian bison, is the {{heaviest}} and most powerful of all wild cattle native to South and Southeast Asia. It is indicated in field data that the population of mature animals is about 5,200–18,000. Male and female Gaur both have distinctive humps between the head and shoulders, a dorsal ridge, prominent horns, and a dewlap which extends to the front legs.The Gaur grows 60% faster than domestic cattle, meaning farmers meat can be harvested at a faster rate, making beef production two to three times more profitable. Gaur meat is preferred over other breeds' meat among local people. Another benefit of the bovine <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> the ability to sweat and tolerates heat well.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{complaints}} leveled against the No. 5 Mk I rifle by soldiers <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> a [...] "wandering zero" [...] — i.e., the rifle could not be [...] "sighted in" [...] and then relied upon to shoot to the same point of impact later on.|$|R
25|$|The key {{constraint}} in {{this approach}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> limited traction because of the single driver. These locomotives were equally characterized by both axles, powered or unpowered, being of equal size. Even though the locomotive had the 2-2-0 designation, the leading axle was unpowered and not a lead truck.|$|R
30|$|Except for IIA {{property}} restrictions, MNL {{model has}} two shortcomings in application. One is its incapability of handling with random preference discrepancies, {{the other is}} its incapability of finding out the correlative factors with panel data. Two merits of MNL <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a close-formed structure, and its parameters can be easily estimated.|$|R
