He {{was among the first}} group of Companions of the Order of Australia in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir John Kerr. In 1979, his novel The Twyborn Affair was shortliisted for the Booker Prize, but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by Penelope Fitzgerald, who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.|$|E

From first hand accounts of his physical appearance Umar is said to be vigorous, robust and a very tall man, in markets he would tower above the people. The front part of his head was bald, always A'sara Yusran (working with two hands), both his eyes were black, with yellow skin, however, ibn Sa'ad in his book stated that he never knew that 'Umar had yellow skin, except if the people took into criterion a certain part of his life where his color changed because he always ate oil at that part of his life. Others say he had reddish-white skin. <b>His</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> ashnabul asnan (very white shining). He would always color his beard and take care of his hair using a type of plant.|$|E

500|$|In 1848, Aqil {{assisted}} {{an expedition}} headed by US Navy captain William Francis Lynch to the Dead Sea, and became {{known in the}} United States and Europe through the publication of Lynch's book that year. Vivid descriptions of Aqil by Lynch are quoted at length {{in the works of}} Finn. Lynch's first encounter with Aqil was in the divan of Said Bey, the Ottoman kaimakam of Acre, and is recorded as follows:But what especially attracted my attention was a magnificent savage enveloped in a scarlet cloth pelisse richly embroidered with gold. He was the handsomest, and I soon thought also the most graceful being I had ever seen. His complexion was of a rich mellow indescribable olive tint, and his hair a glossy black; <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> regular and of the whitest ivory, and the glance of his eye was keen at times, but generally soft and lustrous. With the tarboosh upon his head which he seemed to wear uneasily, he reclined, rather than sat upon {{the opposite side of the}} divân, while his hand played in unconscious familiarity with the hilt of his yataghan. He looked like one who would be 'Steel amid the din of arms, and wax when with the fair.' ...|$|E
500|$|His biographer Suetonius, {{writing about}} {{a century after}} Augustus' death, {{described}} his appearance as: [...] "...unusually handsome and exceedingly graceful at all periods of his life, though he cared nothing for personal adornment. He was so far from being particular about the dressing of his hair, {{that he would have}} several barbers working in a hurry at the same time, and as for his beard he now had it clipped and now shaved, while at the very same time he would either be reading or writing something... He had clear, bright eyes... <b>His</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> wide apart, small, and ill-kept; his hair was slightly curly and inclined to golden; his eyebrows met. His ears were of moderate size, and his nose projected a little at the top and then bent ever so slightly inward. His complexion was between dark and fair. He was short of stature, although Julius Marathus, his freedman and keeper of his records, says that he was five feet and nine inches (just under 5 ft. 7 in., or 1.70 meters, in modern height measurements), but this was concealed by the fine proportion and symmetry of his figure, and was noticeable only by comparison with some taller person standing beside him...", adding that [...] "his shoes [...] somewhat high-soled, to make him look taller than he really was" ...|$|E
500|$|Despite his unusual diet, Tarrare was {{slim and}} of average height. At {{the age of}} 17, he weighed only [...] (...) [...] He was {{described}} as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth, in which <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> heavily stained and on which the lips were almost invisible. When he had not eaten, his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist. When full, his abdomen would distend [...] "like a huge balloon". The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth. His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily, constantly suffering from foul body odour; he was described as stinking [...] "to {{such a degree that}} he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces". This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten; his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot, a visible vapour would rise from his body, and he would become lethargic, during which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions. He suffered from chronic diarrhoea, which was said to be [...] "fetid beyond all conception". Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight. Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him, other than an apparently apathetic temperament with [...] "a complete lack of force and ideas".|$|E

500|$|Midway {{through the}} twelfth-century, Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, King of Cenél nEógain (died 1166) pressed forth to {{claim to the}} high-kingship of Ireland, an office then held by elderly Toirrdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1156). In 1150, Muirchertach invaded Connacht, and succeeded in gaining hostages from the kingdom. Although Muirchertach and Toirrdelbach made peace the {{following}} year, their forces clashed the year after that, with Muirchertach's defeat of Toirrdelbach's son, Ruaidrí (died 1198). In 1154, the forces of Toirrdelbach and Muirchertach again met in a major conflict fought off the Inishowen coast, in what was {{perhaps one of the}} greatest naval battles of the twelfth century. The engagement is briefly recorded by the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, and expanded upon by the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters. According to the latter source, Muirchertach's maritime forces were mercenaries drawn from Galloway, Arran, Kintyre, Mann, and [...] "the territories of Scotland". The annal-entry further reveals that Mac Scelling himself commanded Muirchertach's forces, and that <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> knocked out in the affair. Although Toirrdelbach's forces obtained a narrow victory, his northern maritime power seems to have been virtually nullified by the severity of the contest, and Muirchertach soon after marched on Connacht, Bréifne, and Dublin. As a result of the Dubliners' resulting submission, Muirchertach effectively secured himself the high-kingship. There is reason to suspect that Muirchertach's use of foreign warriorsincluding Mac Scelling himselfstrongly influenced the composition of Cath Ruis na Ríg for Bóinn, a twelfth-century Gaelic text that forms a sequel to the epic Táin Bó Cúailgne.|$|E

2500|$|In 889, Yasovarman {{ascended to}} the throne. A great king and an {{accomplished}} builder, he was celebrated by one inscription as [...] "a lion-man; he tore the enemy with the claws of his grandeur; <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> his policies; {{his eyes were}} the Veda." [...] Near the old capital of Hariharalaya, Yasovarman constructed a new city, called Yaśodharapura. In the tradition of his predecessors, he also constructed a massive reservoir called baray. The significance of such reservoirs has been debated by modern scholars, {{some of whom have}} seen in them a means of irrigating rice fields, and others of whom have regarded them as religiously charged symbols of the great mythological oceans surrounding Mount Meru, the abode of the gods. The mountain, in turn, was represented by an elevated temple, in which the [...] "god-king" [...] was represented by a lingam. In accordance with this cosmic symbolism, Yasovarman built his central temple on a low hill known as Phnom Bakheng, surrounding it with a moat fed from the baray. He also built numerous other Hindu temples and ashrams, or retreats for ascetics.|$|E

[...] He noted that his friend Chuck Spinney had a friend on the plane who was later identified by his dental records because <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>were</b> found inside the Pentagon. Cockburn writes in standard incisive wit [...] "This doesn’t faze the conspiracists. They’re immune to any reality check. Spinney “worked for the government.” They switched the dental records. The Boeing 757 was flown to Nebraska for a rendez-vous with President Bush, who shot the passengers, burned the bodies on the tarmac and gave Spinney’s friend’s teeth to Dick Cheney to drop through a hole in his trousers amid the debris in the Pentagon." ...|$|E
