In collaboration with Health Secretary Alan Levine, Jindal has drafted the Louisiana Health First Initiative. This plan focuses on expanding health insurance coverage for the state's indigent population, increasing Medicaid choice, reducing fraud, authorizing funding of a new charity hospital, and increasing transparency in Medicaid by making performance measures available over the internet. Jindal supports co-payments in Medicaid. Due to a congressional reduction in federal Medicaid financing rates, the Jindal administration chose to levy the largest slice of cuts on the network of LSU charity hospitals and clinics, requiring some facilities to close.|$|E

He called for a repeal of recent Bush tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>uninsured</b> by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new universal health care system. He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse [...] "scaled down rules" [...] the Bush administration had applied to the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and dealing with the potential effects of global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, livestock flatulence and other sources. Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the PATRIOT Act, and investing $100 billion in homeland security. Finally, he released a budget plan that claimed to save $2.35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts, sharing the cost of the Iraq War with other nations, and cutting government waste.|$|E

40|$|The Thai 30 Baht {{program was}} one of the largest health system reforms ever {{undertaken}} by a low-middle income country. In addition to lowering the cost of care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> previously <b>uninsured</b> in public facilities, it also entailed a fourfold increase in funding provided to hospitals to care <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poorest 30 % of the population (who were already publicly insured). <b>For</b> <b>the</b> previously <b>uninsured,</b> we find that the 30 Baht program led to increased health care utilization, as well as a shift from private to public sources of care. But, we find a larger increase <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor who were previously publicly insured, especially amongst infants and women of childbearing age. Using vital statistics records, we find that the increased access to healthcare by the publicly insured poor led to a reduction in their infant mortality of at least 6. 5 per 1, 000 births.
