25|$|Lawrence Cook {{emerged in}} 1907 as a bowler of fast-medium pace, {{possibly}} meant {{to substitute for}} Walter Brearley who was then engaged {{in one of his}} many disputes with the Lancashire committee. Although he took a wicket with his first ball in first-class cricket, on the whole his record for that season was moderate, but with seven wickets on a rare hard pitch against Kent at Canterbury he showed he had great persistence. When Brearley came back into the eleven in 1908, Cook was relegated to the Second Eleven, but in 1910 he re-established in place and in the May following year, helped by a bad pitch and feeble Northamptonshire batting, he bowled with considerable pace and a lot of spin to take eight wickets for 39 runs. Cook indeed bowled so well early that season that Lancashire seemed to have found an excellent pace bowler when Brearley could not play. However, he was felt impossible to fit in when that fast bowler was free from business and on returning to the side he did not maintain his early season form, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> anything of note against the top counties.|$|E

Rheumatologist Fatima Haji, for example, appeared on Al Jazeera television news in a [...] "hysterical" [...] state, describing Isa Abdul Hasan, a man in his 60s who died in her hospital of a head wound he had received from police: [...] "I just started shouting: 'What the hell did this guy do, he was an old man. What <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> to deserve this?'" [...] She later stated that following her arrest, her interrogations were centered on this television appearance.|$|E

The Coroner's Office ruled it a suicide, and the Martin County Sheriff's Office deemed it a [...] "pretty {{clear-cut}} case". However, many Florida locals had their doubts. [...] "If it were [...] a suicide, why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> a head shot instead of a chest shot?" [...] asked Bessie DuBois. The theory was that he stuck the shotgun in the ground, leaned over and pulled the trigger, even though it would have taken considerable effort and flexibility on Nelson's part.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Obama's {{speech on}} Tuesday was a {{brilliant}} effort to deflect attention away from what remains the core issue: what did Obama hear, when did he hear it, and what <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> about it? The answers, {{as best we can}} tell at this stage, is that Obama heard some very harsh things said from the pulpit of Trinity United Church of Christ; that Obama heard them said {{a long time ago and}} probably repeatedly; and that he did little or nothing about it. This from a man who tells us at almost every stop along the campaign trail that he has the [...] "judgment to lead." ...|$|E

'When I'd go see Rush as a kid, I {{would wonder}} why Geddy Lee used one finger all the time. <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> {{that because it}} {{made it easier to}} play while he was singing? I didn't get it. Later I {{realized}} that if you're just riding a note or trying to play a real straight part, it sounds more pulsating if you play with one finger. So I took every bass line and learned how to do it with one finger, and I started doing it that way as much as I could. Back then I thought I looked goofy, but now here I am using one finger whenever I can. One finger is ultimately the funkiest sound of all. If you can do it with one finger, you should. If you can do it with two fingers, you should choose over three.' ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Adams {{was finally}} found {{innocent}} {{after years of}} being processed by the legal system, {{the judge in the}} habeas corpus hearing officially stated that, [...] "much could be said about those videotape interviews, but nothing that would have any bearing on the matter before this court." [...] Regardless, The Thin Blue Line, as Morris's film would be called, was popularly accepted as the main force behind getting its subject, Randall Adams, out of prison. As Morris said of the film, [...] "The Thin Blue Line is two movies grafted together. On one simple level is the question, <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it, or didn't he? And on another level, The Thin Blue Line, properly considered, is an essay on false history. A whole group of people, literally everyone, believed a version of the world that was entirely wrong, and my accidental investigation of the story provided a different version of what happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|CBS {{cut back}} to Cronkite {{reporting}} {{that one of the}} priests had administered last rites to the president. In the next few minutes, several more bulletins reporting that Kennedy had died were given to Cronkite, including one from CBS's own correspondent Dan Rather that had been reported as confirmation of Kennedy's demise by CBS Radio. As these bulletins came into the newsroom, it was becoming clearer that Kennedy had in fact lost his life. Cronkite, however, stressed that these bulletins were simply reports and not any official confirmation of the President's condition; some of his colleagues recounted in 2013 that his early career as a wire service reporter taught him to wait for official word before reporting a story. Still, as more word came in, Cronkite seemed to be resigned {{to the fact that it}} was only a matter of time before the assassination was confirmed. He appeared to concede this when, several minutes after he received the Rather report, he received word that the two priests who gave the last rites to Kennedy told reporters on the scene that he was dead. Cronkite said that report [...] "seems to be as close to official as we can get", but would not declare it as such. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> so with a report from Washington, DC that came moments later, which said that government sources were now reporting the President was dead (this information was passed on to ABC as well, which took it as official confirmation and reported it as such; NBC did not report this information at all and chose instead to rely on reports from Charles Murphy and Robert MacNeil to confirm their suspicions).|$|E
2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>do</b> it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why I think he did it. Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E
