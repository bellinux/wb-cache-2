40|$|Financial {{statements}} {{are the basic}} source {{of information on the}} situation and results of the operation of a business entity within a given period. The <b>financial</b> <b>result,</b> i. <b>e.</b> the difference between the total income and the total cost, is a measure which is important for assessing the company’s operation in a financial statement. It is largely determined by deductible expenses which show the company’s prudent financial management. Prudence means managing appropriately the company’s assets which are used to generate income. Effective management of resources should be based on a reliable analysis of the use of assets according to defined criteria by calculating selected ratios. To have a full picture it is important to perform a comparable analysis which compares different periods while paying attention to changing market conditions, to draw conclusions and then to adopt appropriate methods of effective management of company’s assets in order to maximize its production potential. This paper aims at emphasizing the importance of analyzing the use of assets and possibilities of using it to ensure company’s effective operation...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [98]- 103) As {{a manufacturing}} company implements {{changes at the}} shop floor, performance must be closely monitored to determine whether any improvements were made. Many companies use their cost accounting systems to trace {{the success of these}} changes. A cost accounting system is designed to provide long-term planning and control, but it fails to provide timely feedback for shop-floor monitoring and control. For effective performance measurement and evaluation, an independent performance system which incorporates both financial and non-financial measures and directly meets the company objectives is needed. The successful implementation of manufacturing improvements can be negatively affected by discrepancies between operational and financial measures. Specifically, operational improvements (i. e., decreased inventoiy, increased productivity) may not be reflected in <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> lower production cost, higher sales). The purpose of these research is to provide a methodology for improved decision making through appropriate performance evaluation. The theoretical methodology developed was tested at a small manufacturer. The case study process and relevant results are reported. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: I use an {{experiment}} {{to examine how}} accurate versus inaccurate relative incentive weights on multiple measures that lead bottom-line <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> lead measures) affects managerial performance. The experiment has three types of incentive contracts which reward different combinations of performance measures: only a lag financial measure (ONLYLAG), two lead measures and a lag financial measure (LEADLAG), or only two lead measures (ONLYLEAD). I find that adding lead measures to an incentive contract with only a lag measure (LEADLAG versus ONLYLAG) increases performance when the two lead measures have accurate relative weights, but does not decrease nor increase performance when the two lead measures have inaccurate relative weights. Hence, the addition of lead measures at best benefits performance when the relative weights on lead measures are accurate, and at worst does not harm performance when the relative weights on lead measures are inaccurate. I also find that removing the lag measure from the incentive contract (ONLYLEAD versus LEADLAG) increases performance when the two lead measures have accurate relative weights, but decreases performance when the two lead measures have inaccurate relative weights. The {{results suggest that the}} dysfunctional effect of having lead measures with inaccurate relative weights i...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is to establish {{if there is a}} correlation between efficiency and socially responsible business performance in Croatian enterprises. The research is based on the hypothesis that higher corporate efficiency affects social responsibility development in enterprises and vice versa, that socially more responsible corporate performance {{have a positive effect on}} efficiency. In their research, many authors have proved the correlation between social responsibility and financial performance, reputation of the enterprise and added value. Cases from transition countries, which transferred to market economy and focused on socially responsible management and sustainability, have not been the subject of research. The social responsibility concept implies balance between economic, ecological and social goals, which means distribution of assets on several actors, so it may be predicted that more efficient enterprises will sooner accept the sustainability concept and act more responsibly. Except for theoretical social responsibility hypothesis, the initial point in the empirical section is dynamic analysis of business activities of Croatian entrepreneurs in the period between 1993 and 2010, on the basis of which a sample of enterprises was chosen, which submit transparent reports on social responsibility. The main result obtained by univariate analysis confirms that socially more responsible enterprises have better <b>financial</b> <b>results,</b> i. <b>e.</b> they are more efficient, and also have better reputation. The research also had limitations in relation to qualitative determination of the social responsibility impact on efficiency. The conclusion is derived that there is a causal relationship between efficiency and social responsibility, i. e. higher efficiency level enables higher allocation of resources with the purpose of socially more responsible corporate performance and vice versa; socially responsible corporate performance have an impact on reputation and on improved efficiency, measured by financial indicators...|$|R

Overall, the rate of the <b>financial</b> <b>result</b> from operating activities can describe the activity that is the basis for the company and for the implementation of which the entity was created.

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse and {{evaluate}} the theoretical methods bases of evaluation of performance <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> and changes thereof, and based on this, to perform an extensive analysis of changes in “X” hospital <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> and present methods for the permanent evaluation of changes. Tasks: 1. To analyse and systemize the peculiarities and practical application possibilities of traditional and contemporary theories and methods, which study changes of institutional <b>financial</b> <b>results.</b> 2. To carry out extensive analysis of “X” hospital <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> and related changes through the identification of negative and positive facts and possibilities of using internal and external factors. 3. To identify problem fields of activities and search for {{ways of dealing with}} problems and present reasonable and optimum proposals for the increasing of “X” hospital activity efficiency. 4. To adopt decisions on the rationalization of current asset management. 5. To make the forecast of Hospital’s financial activities when the planned measures of problem solving are implemented. 6. To prepare the evaluation methodology of <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> and their changes for medical institutions. Research methods. Object of the paper– Hospital’s activity <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> and their changes. Research methods: logic analysis of scientific literature (comparison, grouping, detailing and systemization); analysis of legal documents; horizontal and vertical analysis of a balance-sheet and income statement; the method of comparison; analysis of financial coefficients (relative analysis); detailing and summarization; graphic method; the method of economic factorial analysis. Results. Upon having presented reasons of evaluation methods of changes in <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> in the case of “X” hospital, the analysis of <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> of this institution as well as related changes was carried out and it disclosed strong (the administration managed to reduce financial activity loss and successfully expanded other activities) and weak (decreasing sales of services; frozen funds in stocks (goods intended for resale); big buyers’ indebtedness) positions, which precondition change in the size of institution’s <b>financial</b> <b>result.</b> Conclusions. The theories and methods relating with the evaluation of institution’s <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> and their changes, presented by different authors, were systemized by showing their advantages and disadvantages. <b>Financial</b> <b>results</b> of “X” hospital were evaluated and the possibilities of more optimum use and more efficient adaptation of internal factors to the external environment were revealed. Decisions on the rationalization of current asset management were adopted and the forecast of Hospital’s financial activities was made. The evaluation methodology of <b>financial</b> <b>results</b> and their changes for financial institutions was worked out. Practical recommendations. As practical experience shows the majority of Lithuanian institutions have spontaneous organizational management structures of financial activity analysis and such analytical work is only episodic. To improve analytical work at institutions the following is suggested: * To carry out this work at all management levels of an institution. * To create a flexible organizational structure of the system of analysis. * To reduce the gap between the results and conclusions of the analysis performed and the use of its recommendations to the maximum extent since hospital’s management, financiers, economists and auditors should use this information...|$|R
