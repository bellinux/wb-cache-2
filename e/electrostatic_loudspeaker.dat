They are widely admired for their clarity and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
500|$|In {{its product}} manual, the NAIT {{is said to}} have [...] "low {{continuous}} power output ... balanced by a very large peak current capacity so there are no restrictions on the size or type of loudspeaker that may be used. But please don't expect the impossible". Hi-Fi Journal wrote that [...] "the NAIT excelled in musical terms... and would comfortably drive loudspeakers that caused other amplifiers to sound lumpen and distinctly unmusical". And for that reason, many people who owned the Quad <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Loudspeaker</b> (ESL) [...] which are known to be a very difficult load for amplifiers [...] would choose the NAIT to drive their speakers. Reviewers attribute the perception of power of the NAITs to the over-engineered, dedicated power supplies that ensure generous current delivery for musical transients.|$|E
500|$|Stereophile {{described}} the speaker {{as having been}} designed for [...] "serious-music (call that 'classical') listeners who play records more for musical enjoyment than for the sound". Quad launched the speaker in 1957, priced at £52, believing that an audio system {{should be able to}} extract everything of value that is on a recording, while de-emphasising the irritations of mediocre sound recordings. It consists of a minimalistic, slightly curved, flat panel. The [...] "Quad Electrostatic Loudspeaker" [...] or [...] "ESL", as the designers intended to call it, is variously referred to as the Quad 57 and the Quad 55. Its descendants are still often simply referred to as Quad <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Loudspeaker</b> as part of the legacy. Walker called the concept behind the ESL-63 FRED, being the acronym for [...] "Full-Range Electrostatic Dipole".|$|E

500|$|Acoustical Manufacturing Company had {{launched}} a ribbon-hybrid, horn-loaded [...] "Corner Ribbon Loudspeaker" [...] in 1949, {{but this was}} not commercially successful. The electrostatics were designed by David Williamson, and the company's founder, Peter Walker, from a principle elaborated by Edward W. Kellogg for General Electric that was granted a patent in 1934. However, more immediately, a book published in the US in 1954 extolling the scientific merits of the electrostatic [...] transducer inspired Walker to develop an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> of his own; this was technologically enabled by the Mylar film developed by Dupont that came to market in 1949. Walker demonstrated a prototype electrostatic panel speaker (with exceptional clarity in the midrange), and a full-frequency infinite baffle speaker (with ample bass response) at the British Sound Recording Association Annual Exhibition in May 1955. After more research, the large panel speaker with better response over the whole frequency range was demonstrated to the Physical Society in March 1956. The ESL entered commercial production in 1957, and was discontinued only in 1985.|$|E

50|$|In 1957, they {{released}} the Quad <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Loudspeaker</b> (ESL), the first production full frequency range <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> renowned for sonic transparency and very low distortion. Its sonic neutrality and transparency were offset by its extreme directionality, moderate power handling, {{the need for}} a large room, and moderate bass extension; its novel electrical characteristics could render some amplifiers unstable, which could result in damage to either or both.|$|E

5000|$|Arthur Janszen {{was granted}} [...] in 1953 for an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b> The {{developers}} of the Tri-Ergon sound-on-film sound film system {{had developed a}} primitive design of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> as early as 1919. Mr. Janszen's company, JansZen still makes an evolved version of his original design. The KLH Nine was designed in the mid-1950s by Arthur A. Janszen, and thousands were sold after the design was brought over to KLH in 1959 and put into regular production.|$|E
50|$|An <b>electrostatic</b> <b>{{loudspeaker}}</b> (ESL) is {{a loudspeaker}} design in which sound {{is generated by}} the force exerted on a membrane suspended in an electrostatic field.|$|E
50|$|MartinLogan {{was founded}} by Gayle Martin Sanders and Ron Logan Sutherland who met in the late 1970s at a {{high-end}} audio store Sanders managed in Lawrence, Kansas. Despite different backgrounds (Sanders had trained in architecture and advertising, Sutherland in electrical engineering) they shared a passion for music and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a {{sense this}} niche is {{a subset of}} OTLs however it merits {{treating}} separately because unlike an OTL for a loudspeaker, which has to push the extremes of a valve circuit's ability to deliver relatively high currents at low voltages into a low impedance load, some headphone types have impedances high enough for normal valve types to drive reasonably as OTLs, and in particular <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> and headphones which can be driven directly at hundreds of volts but minimal currents.|$|R
50|$|Loudspeakers usually load audio amplifiers. In audio history, {{nearly all}} {{loudspeakers}} have been electrodynamic loudspeakers. There exists also {{a minority of}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> and some other more exotic loudspeakers. Electrodynamic loudspeakers transform electric current to force and force to acceleration of the diaphragm which causes sound pressure. Due {{to the principle of}} an electrodynamic speaker, most loudspeaker drivers ought to be driven by an electric current signal. The current signal drives the electrodynamic speaker more accurately, causing less distortion than a voltage signal.|$|R
50|$|MartinLogan is an American company {{producing}} conventional subwoofer speakers {{as well as}} floor-standing, wall-mounted, and in-wall hybrid speakers using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> and planar magnetic {{thin film}} loudspeaker technology.|$|E
5000|$|He was {{the joint}} {{inventor}} of the moving coil loudspeaker in 1925 along with Chester W. Rice at General Electric, and independently by Edward Wente at Bell Labs. Kellogg also patented an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> in 1934.|$|E
50|$|The Tri-Ergon {{system used}} a special form of {{microphone}} without mechanical moving parts (Katodophone) for sound pickup {{and a special}} electric discharge tube for variable density film recording. For reproduction of sound, the system used an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker.</b>|$|E
50|$|Radford valve {{amplifiers}} {{are rare}} today, and still command high {{prices on the}} secondhand market. Much sought after and enthusiastically rebuilt, they are particularly known for classic and restrained physical design and outstanding, listenable sound quality - including a particular ability to drive, very sweetly, the notoriously difficult Quad <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> 2006 brought hope of a rebirth for the brand, with news of plans to begin manufacture of classic valve based designs like the STA 25 Mk III in 2009.|$|R
50|$|In {{virtually}} all <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> the diaphragm {{is driven by}} two grids, one on either side, because the force exerted on the diaphragm by a single grid will be unacceptably non-linear, thus causing harmonic distortion. Using grids on both sides cancels out voltage dependent part of non-linearity but leaves charge (attractive force) dependent part. The result is near complete absence of harmonic distortion. In one recent design, the diaphragm is driven with the audio signal, with the static charge located on the grids (Transparent Sound Solutions).|$|R
25|$|Electrostatics are {{inherently}} dipole radiators {{and due to}} the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers. Due to this and the low excursion capability, full range <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> are large by nature, and the bass rolls off at a frequency corresponding to a quarter wavelength of the narrowest panel dimension. To {{reduce the size of}} commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles the bass frequencies effectively.|$|R
5000|$|Audiostatic, Blanko.nu {{exclusively}} tubeamp active electrostatic loudspeakers handbuild in Holland, Sound-Lab exclusively build full-range electrostatic panels. The only active, {{full range}} <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> currently in production is the Audiostatic DCA-5. JansZen currently offers active (powered) versions {{of its two}} hybrid models, the Carmelita Active (stand-mounted) and the Valentina Active (floor-standing).|$|E
5000|$|Other {{types of}} large speaker panels, such as {{electrostatic}} loudspeakers, {{tend to be}} more directional than small speakers, for the same reasons as above; they are somewhat more directional only because they tend to be physically larger than most common loudspeakers. Correspondingly, an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> {{the size of a small}} traditional speaker would be non-directional.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of their}} {{tendency}} to attract dust, insects, conductive particles, and moisture, electrostatic speaker diaphragms will gradually deteriorate and need periodic replacement. They also need protection measures to physically isolate their high voltage parts from accidental contact with humans and pets. Cost-effective repair and restoration service is available for virtually every current and discontinued <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> model.|$|E
5000|$|Baxandall {{attended}} King's College School in London, {{then got}} his BSc {{in electrical engineering}} at Cardiff Technical College (1942). He was a radio instructor for the Fleet Air Arm for two years, and then worked for the Telecommunications Research Establishment (at the Circuit Research Division headed by Frederic Calland Williams), later renamed and merged to form the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, {{until his retirement in}} 1971. After retiring he worked as a consultant on various audio projects including loudspeakers, tape duplication, and microphone calibration. During this time he continued to publish, including a [...] "seminal chapter" [...] on <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers.</b> The Audio Engineering Society made him a Fellow in 1980, and in 1993 awarded him with a Silver Medal for his contributions to the field.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} similar speaker designs to the Magneplanar. Martin-Logan and Quad Electroacoustics, among others, make <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers,</b> which are another {{variation}} on the dipole model. Electrostatic speakers operate on a somewhat different principle. While the voice coils in the Magneplanar are conductive wires or foil strips mounted {{on a sheet of}} Mylar film, electrostatic speakers suspend a charged conductive film between two grids (stators) which move the film. One disadvantage of both designs is that a very large panel is required to produce deep bass. Magnepan has addressed this via the physical size of the speakers - a physically large radiating surface produces more bass. Martin-Logan has addressed the bass problem by mounting a conventional cone bass driver in a separate section of the speaker chassis, generally resulting in a physically smaller speaker than the Magneplanar.|$|R
5000|$|Transient {{response}} : A {{system may}} have low distortion for a steady-state signal, {{but not on}} sudden transients. In amplifiers, this problem {{can be traced to}} power supplies in some instances, to insufficient high frequency performance or to excessive negative feedback. Related measurements are slew rate and rise time. Distortion in transient response can be hard to measure. Many otherwise good power amplifier designs have been found to have inadequate slew rates, by modern standards. In loudspeakers, transient response performance is affected by the mass and resonances of drivers and enclosures and by group delay and phase delay introduced by crossover filtering or inadequate time alignment of the loudspeaker's drivers. Most loudspeakers generate significant amounts of transient distortion, though some designs are less prone to this (e.g. <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers,</b> plasma arc tweeters, ribbon tweeters and horn enclosures with multiple entry points).|$|R
50|$|The first fully {{successful}} full-range electrostatics, {{and also}} among the most respected, was produced in 1957: the Quad <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Loudspeaker</b> (Quad ESL, later ESL-57) from Quad Electroacoustics, of Huntingdon, England. These were shaped somewhat like a home electric radiator curved slightly on the vertical axis. They were widely admired for their clarity and precision, but {{can be difficult to}} run while achieving low frequency bass output.|$|E
50|$|MartinLogan's next product {{began to}} take form in 1997 {{in the form of}} the 2000-pound Statement e2 loudspeaker. The design and {{engineering}} behind the Statement e2 fueled the next generation of MartinLogan electrostatic speakers (not to mention ML's first non-electrostatic product). Released in 1999, the Prodigy <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> incorporated much of the design and engineering knowledge gained during the Statement e2 project. Prodigy in turn inspired a new generation of electrostatic products including the Odyssey, Ascent, Aeon and Theater.|$|E
50|$|A magnetostatic {{loudspeaker}} is a dipole loudspeaker that {{is similar}} to an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeaker</b> but instead of using high voltages, uses high currents. Permanent magnets provide a static magnetic field. Wires or strips carrying audio frequency currents are bonded to a thin diaphragm. The current flowing in the conductors interacts with the magnetic field and creates sound {{in much the same way}} as in a conventional dynamic driver. Because of its dipole structure, this kind of speaker creates sound mostly to its front and back.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> use a {{high voltage}} {{electric}} field (rather than a magnetic field) {{to drive a}} thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning. [...] However, their optimum listening area is small {{and they are not}} very efficient speakers. [...] They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency. [...] This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.|$|R
5000|$|The BRAUN LE1 ('Lautsprechereinheit 1' i.e. 'Loudspeaker unit 1') was {{the first}} <b>electrostatic</b> mode <b>loudspeaker</b> {{available}} on the German hi-fi market. German electronics company Braun started production in about 1959 with the technology licensed from the British Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (now known as Quad Electroacoustics (QUAD)). [...] The electronics inside were very similar to QUAD's famous ESL-57, however there were differences. While the stators were identical, the transformers and high voltage cascade were specially developed by Braun.|$|R
50|$|Advantages of <b>electrostatic</b> <b>loudspeakers</b> include {{levels of}} {{distortion}} {{one to two}} orders of magnitude lower than conventional cone drivers in a box, the extremely light weight of the diaphragm which is driven across its whole surface, and exemplary frequency response (both in amplitude and phase) because the principle of generating force and pressure is almost free from resonances unlike the more common electrodynamic driver. Musical transparency can be better than in electrodynamic speakers because the radiating surface has much less mass than most other drivers and is therefore far less capable of storing energy to be released later. For example, typical dynamic speaker drivers can have moving masses of tens or hundreds of grams whereas an electrostatic membrane only weighs a few milligrams, several times less than the very lightest of electrodynamic tweeters. The concomitant air load, often insignificant in dynamic speakers, is usually tens of grams {{because of the large}} coupling surface, this contributing to damping of resonance buildup by the air itself to a significant, though not complete, degree. Electrostatics can also be executed as full-range designs, lacking the usual crossover filters and enclosures that could color or distort the sound.|$|R
