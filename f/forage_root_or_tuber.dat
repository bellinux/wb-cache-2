40|$|Roots and tubers such as {{potatoes}} and cassava rank within {{the top six}} among the world’s most important food crops, yet {{the extent to which}} their global production has been adversely affected by drought remains unclear. Greater uncertainties exist on how drought effects co-vary with: (1) root and tuber species, (2) soil texture, (3) agro-ecological region, and 4) drought timing. It is often assumed that potato is drought-sensitive whereas cassava and sweet potato are resistant to drought, but this assumption has not been quantitatively tested. To address these uncertainties, we collected literature data between 1980 and 2015 that reported monoculture root and tuber yield responses to drought under field conditions, and analyzed this large data set using meta-analysis technique. Our results showed that the amount of water reduction was positively related with yield reduction, but the extent of the impact varied with <b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>tuber</b> species and the phenological phase during which drought occurred. In contrast to common assumptions regarding drought resistance of certain root and tuber crops, we found that yield reduction was similar between potato and species thought to be drought-resistant such as cassava and sweet potato. Here we suggest that drought-resistance in cassava and sweet potato could be more related to survival rather than yield. All <b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>tuber</b> crops, however, experienced greater yield reduction when drought struck during the tuberization period compared to during their vegetative phase. The effect of soil texture on yield reduction was less obvious, and similarly we did not find any significant effects of region (and related climatic factors) on either yield reduction or drought sensitivity. Our study provides useful information that can inform agricultural planning, and influence the direction of research for improving the productivity and resilience of these under-utilized crops in the drought-prone regions of the world...|$|R

40|$|Oldest {{evidence}} for processing of wild cereals: starch grains from barley, wheat, on Paleolithic grinding stone When {{the water level}} in the Sea of Galilee dropped in 1989, archaeologists rushed to excavate Ohalo II, an ancient human settlement. On the floor of one hut they found a large, flat, basaltic stone. The stone’s uneven surface yielded starch grains of grass seeds, mostly from wild barley and possibly also from wheat. This evidence presented in the journal Nature (August 5, 2004), pushes back the date for the processing of close wild relatives of domesticated wheat and barley, a key step in cultural development, to 23, 000 years before the present era. “Ten thousand years before people were cultivating cereals, they were processing wild barley: starch grain analysis establishes a clear link between an intensive exploitation of wild cereals and the subsequent development of plant cultivation and domestication in the region ” explains Dolores Piperno, lead author. “We were very surprised by the abundance of seed remains we found on the stone and how the evidence pointed to the processing {{of just a few}} types of grass seeds.

40|$|Common beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), {{like many}} legumes, {{are rich in}} iron, zinc and certain other microelements that are {{generally}} found to be in low concentrations in cereals, other seed crops, and <b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>tubers</b> and therefore are good candidates for biofortification. But a quandary exists in common bean biofortification: namely that the distribution of iron {{has been found to}} be variable between the principal parts of seed; namely the cotyledonary tissue, embryo axis and seed coat. The seed coat represents ten or more percent of the seed weight and must be considered specifically as it accumulates much of the anti-nutrients such as tannins that effect mineral bioavailability. Meanwhile the cotyledons accumulate starch and phosphorus in the form of phytates. The goal of this study was to evaluate a population of progeny derived from an advanced backcross of a wild bean and a cultivated Andean bean for seed coat versus cotyledonary minerals to identify variability and predict inheritance of the minerals. We used wild common beans because of their higher seed mineral concentration compared to cultivars and greater proportion of seed coat to total seed weight. Results showed the most important gene for seed coat iron was on linkage group B 04 but also identified other QTL for seed coat and cotyledonary iron and zinc on other linkage groups, including B 11 which has been important in studies of whole seed.

40|$|Seasonal {{vertical}} migration of Meloidogyne chitwoodi through soil {{and its impact}} on potato production in Washington and Oregon was studied. Nematode eggs and second-stage juveniles (J 2) were placed at various depths (0 - 180 cm) in tubes filled with soil and buried vertically or in holes dug in potato fields. Tubes were removed at intervals over a 12 -month period and soil was bioassayed on tomato roots. Upward migration began in the spring after water had percolated through the tubes. Nematodes were detected in the top 5 cm of tubes within 1 - 2 months of burial, depending on depth of placement. Potatoes were grown in field plots for 4 or 5 months before the tubers were evaluated for infection. One hundred eggs and J 2 per gram soil placed at 60 and 90 cm caused significant tuber damage at the Washington and Oregon sites, respectively. At the Washington site, inoculum placed at 90, 120, and 150 cm caused potato root infection without serious impact on tuber quality, but inoculum diluted 2 - 8 times and placed at 90 cm did not cause <b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>tuber</b> infection. Nematode migration was dependent on soil texture; 9 days after placement at the bottoms of tubes, J 2 had moved up 55 cm in sandy loam soil (Oregon) but only 15 cm in silt loam (Washington).

However, accurate diagnosis and prognosis of B deficiency depends on calibrated standards for plant and soil testing. For diagnosis of B deficiency the plant part sampled needs to reflect current B supply, and will therefore usually be an actively expanding plant part such as a young leaf. Soil and plant analysis are probably more useful when used to predict the likelihood of B deficiency. Increased reliability of prediction can be achieved when soil and plant analysis values are calibrated for particular soil type and crop species combinations.

Among ten furoviruses, SBWMV, OGSV, RSNV, SgCSV infect cereals, BNYVV, BSBV, PMTV infect <b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>tuber</b> crops and BBNV, PCV and IPCV infect leguminous crops. This paper reviews the information on general characteristics, vector transmission and molecular pathology of furoviruses. However, transmission properties of other plant viruses with fungal vectors have also been summarized. The molecular based mechanism of virus transmission by fungal vector, for some better characterized furoviruses and role of readthrough protein and other genes in virus transmission process, have also been briefly discussed. The analysis of nucleotide sequences of SBWMV, BNYVV, PMTV, PCV and BSBV indicated heterogeneity among furoviruses and have at least three kinds of genome organization. However, read-through proteins (RT) are a common feature in furoviruses and are found in BNYVV, SBWMV, PMTV and BSBV. The BNYVV RT protein is involved in particle assembly and transmission of the virus by P. betae. Repeated manual transmission of BNYVV, SBWMV, PMTV results in spontaneous deletions of RT domain and lose the ability of transmission through vector. PMTV-S, a field isolate, was efficiently acquired and transmitted by a monofungal culture of S. subterranea whereas PMTV-T which has 543 nt deletion in the 3 ` half of the RT, could not be acquired and transmitted by the same fungus. The association of lack of transmissibility of PMTV-T with-in apparent deletion of sequence in RT, relative to RT of transmissible isolate PMTV-S suggests that the RT domain, encoded by PMTV-S RNA 3 contains determinants that {{play an important role}} in the acquisition and transmission of PMTV by S. subterranea. The mechanism by which virus particles move into or out of protoplasm of zoospore, needs further investigation`. However, the process by which aviruliferous zoospores acquire virus particles in vivo, has been proposed.

60|$|The {{experience}} of all cultivators {{of plants and}} breeders of animals shows, that when {{a sufficient number of}} individuals are examined, variations of any required kind can always be met with. On this depends the possibility of obtaining breeds, races, and fixed varieties of animals and plants; and it is found, that any one form of variation may be accumulated by selection, without materially affecting the other characters of the species; each seems to vary in the one required direction only. For example, in turnips, radishes, potatoes, and carrots, the <b>root</b> <b>or</b> <b>tuber</b> varies in size, colour, form, and flavour, while the foliage and flowers seem to remain almost stationary; in the cabbage and lettuce, on the contrary, the foliage can be modified into various forms and modes of growth, the root, flower, and fruit remaining little altered; in the cauliflower and brocoli the flower heads vary; in the garden pea the pod only changes. We get innumerable forms of fruit in the apple and pear, while the leaves and flowers remain undistinguishable; the same occurs in the gooseberry and garden currant. Directly however, (in the very same genus) we want the flower to vary in the Ribes sanguineum, it does so, although mere cultivation for hundreds of years has not produced marked differences in the flowers of Ribes grossularia. When fashion demands any particular change in the form or size, or colour of a flower, sufficient variation always occurs in the right direction, as is shown by our roses, auriculas, and geraniums; when, as recently, ornamental leaves come into fashion sufficient variation is found to meet the demand, and we have zoned pelargoniums, and variegated ivy, and it is discovered that a host of our commonest shrubs and herbaceous plants have taken to vary in this direction just when we want them to do so! This rapid variation is not confined to old and well-known plants subjected for a long series of generations to cultivation, but the Sikim Rhododendrons, the Fuchsias, and Calceolarias from the Andes, and the Pelargoniums from the Cape are equally accommodating, and vary just when and where and how we require them.|$|R

Aconite roots contain aconitine and other Aconitum alkaloids, which are well known cardiotoxins and neurotoxins. To better understand why Aconitum alkaloid poisoning related to the culinary uses of aconite roots can occur and characterize the risks posed by these “food supplements”, relevant published reports were reviewed. From 1995 to 2013, there were eight reports of aconite poisoning after consumption of these herbal soups and meals, including two reports of large clusters of cases (n = 19 – 45) and two reports of cases (n = 15 – 156) managed by two hospitals {{over a period of}} 4. 5 to 5 years. The herbal formulae used did not adhere to the suggested guidelines, with regarding to the doses (50 – 500 g instead of 3 – 30 g per person) and types (raw instead of processed) of aconite roots used. The quantities of Aconitum alkaloids involved were huge, taking into consideration the doses of aconite roots used to prepare herbal soups/meals and the amounts of aconite roots and herbal soups/meals consumed. In a large cluster of cases, despite simmering raw “caowu” (the root tuber of A. kusnezoffii) in pork broth for 24 h, all 19 family members who consumed this soup and boiled “caowu” developed poisoning. Severe or even fatal aconite poisoning can occur after consumption of herbal soups and foods prepared from aconite roots.

40|$|International audienceThe {{increase}} in the prices of agricultural products on the international markets has serious consequences for food safety in Africa. In particular, it impacts countries which are highly dependent on food imports to feed the population.

As we too often forget, this sector is not restricted to farmers. It also concerns the millions of individuals who exercise activities which connect producers and consumer markets: food processing activities (oil extraction, grinding cereals, <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>tubers,</b> fish drying etc.), marketing, distribution, retail and even catering. It is via this sector that the products are circulated, transported to markets, stored, adapted to consumer demand and distributed to these same consumers, while it is through the intermediary of these activities that market incentives are conveyed to the producers in terms of the required quantity, quality and price. This sector finds itself in a paradox: it plays a crucial role as the driving mechanism of the agricultural sector by developing domestic markets but is accorded little importance in public policies. These are often restricted to considering rural farmers on one side and urban consumers on the other, ignoring this entire sector which links the two, regulating both supply and demand in the process. This document primarily aims to draw the attention of the decision-makers to the importance of this sector while examining the causes of its political marginalisation. It then shows that not only does this sector {{play a crucial role in}} linking agricultural supply to the domestic food market, it also holds considerable potential with regard to food safety and poverty reduction.

The nematode was first reported from Al-Bakirah, Gassim region in 1987 (Youssef, 1987). Since then, it has been spreading in wheat fields in the Kingdom, as it has been frequently encountered in 52 - 90 % of the total soil samples collected from wheat fields in three major wheat producing regions located in Riyadh, Gassim and Hail (Al-Hazmi et al., 1994). The pathotype of the nematode was then identified as pathotype Ha 21 (Al-Hazmi et al., 2001). Some of the infested wheat fields are rotated with potato in Saudi Arabia. We have found H. avenae, in few samples from newly-cultivated or non-infested wheat fields which, had been previously cultivated with potato seed tubers produced in nematode-infested fields. Accordingly, 20 soil samples, 100 g each, were collected from the soil adhering to potato seed tubers stored in potato storage (3 ºC) for two years. Hundred potato bags were randomly chosen in the storage, and the potato seed tubers were gently brushed to collect the adhering soil particles. Soil samples were processed for nematode and cyst extraction by sieving and flotation method (Barker, 1985; Shepherd, 1986). Vermiform nematodes were then identified to the generic level (Mai et al., 1968), while nematode cysts were identified following the key of Mulvey & Golden (1983) and Golden (1986). Results showed that H. avenae eggs, juveniles and cysts were, indeed, found in ten of the collected soil samples (absolute frequency = 50 %), and the stunt nematode, Tylenchorhynchus sp., were found in 8 samples (absolute frequency = 40 %). The mean nematode population density per 100 g of the positive samples was: Tylenchorhynchus (90); H. avenae cysts (5 cysts). Our findings demonstrate that planting such contaminated potato seed tubers in our wheat fields would introduce and spread H. avenae to the wheat fields where, the susceptible wheat cv.

Crystal morphology and the distribution of raphides (in <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> leaves <b>or</b> <b>tubers</b> etc.) is similar in same taxa but different in others leaving possible opportunities for plant key characteristics and systematic identification; mucilage in raphide containing cells makes light microscopy difficult, though. Little is known about the mechanisms of sequestration or indeed the reason for accumulation of raphides but it is most likely as a defense mechanism against herbivory. It has also been suggested that in some cases raphides may help form plant skeletal structure. Raphides typically occur in parenchyma cells in aerial organs especially the leaves, and are generally confined to the mesophyl. As the leaf area increases, so does the number of raphides, the process starting in even young leaves. The first indications that the cell will contain crystals is shown when the cells enlarge with a larger nucleus.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{outbreaks}} of potato blackleg in Israel, caused by Dickeya spp., on plants grown from seed tubers imported from Northern Europe, {{are of a}} great concern. The warm climatic conditions {{during the growing season}} favour disease expression, and may result in the establishment of the pathogen in the potato ecosystem and a spread to weeds and other crops (Tsror et al., 2009). Until recently, most of Dickeya spp. strains found in association with potato blackleg in Europe were characterised as D. dianthicola (biovars 1 or 7). These strains have a relatively lowgrowth temperature compared with other Dickeya spp. and seem to be more adapted to cool European climate conditions. However, during the last three years, Dickeya spp. strainsbelonging to a new biovar 3 clade, probably constituting a newspecies, have been isolated from potato tubers inseveral countries in Northern Europe (Slawiak et al., 2009 and references therein). To study dissemination to weeds, surveys were conducted in potato fields where Dickeya-infected potato plants were detected during two consecutive spring seasons (2009 and 2010). Symptomless plants of 12 species of local weeds were randomly collected: Cyperus rotundus,Orobanche aegyptiaca, Amaranthus spinosus, Polygonum equisetiforme, Chenopodium sp., Heliotropium sp., Centaurea iberica, Sorghum haepense, Malva nicaeensis, Cynodon dactylon, Amaranthus blitum and Solanum elaeagnifolium. <b>Roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>tubers</b> (in the case of C. rotundus) of 15 plants of each weed were washed, surface sterilised and then sample homogenates were plated on crystal violet pectate medium (CVP). Cavity forming bacteria were transferred to nutrient agar and analysed. Dickeya spp. were isolated only from the perennial weed C. rotundus. Incidence of infected plants was 6. 7 and 14. 3 % in 2009 and 2010, respectively). DNA extracted from the bacteria isolated from C. rotundus was positive in a PCR amplification procedure using pelADE specific primers which are specific for E. chrysanthemi (Nassar et al., 1996). Isolates were identified by biochemical assays as biovar 3 (Palacio-Bielsa et al., 2006). They were characterised as the new genetic clade, using dnaX sequence (Slawiak et al., 2009) and REP-PCR analyses (Tsror et al., 2009). These isolates caused maceration of potato tubers at 30 °C (Laurila et al., 2008) and formed clear haloes on a polygalacturonic acid medium (Collmer et al., 1988). This is the first report of Dickeya spp. latent infection {{in one of the most}} prevalent weeds in potato fields in Israel. C. rotundus is difficult to control because of resistance to most herbicides. Therefore, it may serve as an alternative host for Dickeya spp. allowing the pathogen to survive in the absence of a host crop...|$|R
40|$|Located in {{southwest}} Turkey, {{not far from}} the seacoast, the natural caves of Öküzini and Karain B were inhabited by prehistoric populations during the Late Glacial and beyond. The Epipalaeolithic populations left traces of different occupation phases dated between 16. 560 ± 180 uncal BP (18. 200 - 17. 400 cal BC) to 12. 130 ± 100 uncal BP (14. 400 - 11. 800 cal BC) in Öküzini, around 15. 000 uncal BP in Karain B. The topic of this research was to examine the macrobotanical remains associated with the Epipalaeolithic occupations, with the underlying aims to acquire insights about the economy of these communities and their use of the environmental resources. A first research paper addresses the issue of plant macroremain identification, in particular the identification of „thick shelled“ plant remains. Morphological comparison with the range of potential species and present geographical distribution made it possible to refine the determination to a double species: Amygdalus orientalis or A. graeca. These plants could grow in the surroundings of the sites on rocky slopes or sandy hills and had to be collected during late summer. All wild Amygdalus seeds are toxic, so that their use as food can be disputed. However, through examination of the detoxification possibilities, nutritional properties and ethnographic analogies for the use of wild almonds, we {{came to the conclusion that}} the seeds probably played a notable role in the diet of the Epipalaeolithic population of southwest Anatolia. A comparison with further published prehistoric “nutshell” finds from the Near East supports a long and widely distributed tradition of wild almond use. The analyses of the whole plant macroremain assemblages (excluding wood charcoals) identified at least 18 taxa and “categories” of remains, mainly carbonised. The importance and the role of the plants – particularly in the diet and their bearing on the seasonality of occupation of the sites – have been evaluated with quantitative and qualitative data. Nuts (principally Amygdalus, wild almond), fruits (principally Pyrus, wild pear), bulbs, <b>roots</b> <b>or</b> <b>tubers</b> (underground storage organs) seem to have occupied a particularly important place in these communities during all Epipalaeolithic phases, at the expense of small-seeded plants. The attested plants would have provided carbohydrates, lipids and micronutrients complementing well the meat diet. The cost of acquisition of the major plant resources was estimated: nuts and underground storage organs were generally considered as high ranked resources, providing a resource easy to gather and to process for a high calorific return. The almonds had a higher cost of acquisition. Their richness in fats and their availability at the onset of the winter season however could justify the additional work required for their detoxification. Judging from the seasonality indices of the plants and ungulate fauna at Öküzini, the cave could have been inhabited periodically in all seasons, but particularly in spring and autumn. A third paper presented the use of firewood and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction using anthracological and other environmental data. The diversity of fuel wood used was moderate and at both sites Acer (maple), Amygdalus (wild almond) and Fraxinus (ash) were the most common and important taxa. Secondary taxa were composed of Maloideae, Pyrus (wild pear), Prunus (wild plum), Quercus (cadufoliate oak), and Rhamnus/Phillyrea (buckthorn/mock privet). No chronological changes were observed. The major difference between both caves was the presence of hygrophilous and mesophillous taxa in Öküzini, whereas Coniferous wood was more common in Karain B, leading to the interpretation of an opportunistic exploitation of the surroundings of each site. Despite the poverty of the Late Glacial vegetation, there was no indication of use of alternative fuel material. These Epipalaeolithic populations seem to have responded to shortages rather through mobility than intensification. The anthracological results have been integrated to present-day knowledge of the environment of southwest Anatolia in an attempt to reconstruct the local vegetation. Among the different models of optimal foraging, the diet breadth model predicts that the resource a forager chooses from an available set of resources depends on their efficiency rank and abundance in the environment. Knowing from former investigations what plant resources were collected by the Epipalaeolithic populations from Öküzini and Karain B, we used this model to estimate the richness of the various classes of plant resources in the environment of the sites. An exploitation of high ranked plant resources, the nuts and the <b>roots,</b> bulbs <b>or</b> <b>tubers,</b> instead of small seeds, probably reflected their good availability in the environment. On the other hand, although the pattern of fuel use did not show any indices of wood scarcity, the reconstruction of the vegetation resulted in an environment not particularly rich in plant resources. The density of population being low, we suppose that the Epipalaeolithic populations living in this region adapted to their natural conditions in moving regularly their camps...|$|R
