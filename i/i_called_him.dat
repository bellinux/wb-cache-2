500|$|The medieval chronicler Bede {{described}} Mellitus {{as being}} of noble birth. In letters, Pope Gregory <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> an abbot, {{but it is}} unclear whether Mellitus had previously been abbot of a Roman monastery, or this was a rank bestowed on him to ease his journey to England by making him the leader of the expedition. The papal register, a listing of letters sent out by the popes, describes him as an [...] "abbot in Frankia" [...] in its description of the correspondence, but the letter itself only says [...] "abbot". The first time Mellitus is mentioned in history is in the letters of Gregory, and nothing else of his background is known. It appears likely that he was a native of Italy, along with all the other bishops consecrated by Augustine.|$|E
500|$|Rangel {{has been}} {{described}} as having a meticulous appearance. [...] Long-time mentor Percy Sutton recalled, “In the beginning <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Pretty Boy Rangel, to denigrate him, because {{he was one of those}} handsome types, hair pushed down and that mustache. But he had a way about him, with that great humor, an ability to influence people.” [...] Later, The New York Times described him thusly: [...] "After three decades in public life, the portly, gravel-voiced Mr. Rangel, who is very much the Old World-style gentleman yet sprinkles his sentences with mild profanity, still takes politics personally." [...] In contrast, Rangel and his office have long been disorganized, with criticism even from supporters for taking on more things than he can keep track of. [...] The congressman's life has been dominated by politics, with no hobbies and few friendships outside of it. [...] Loyalties to Rangel were severely tested during the height of the ethics investigations of him, when a number of political figures bailed out on a lavish 80th birthday gala planned for Rangel at New York's Plaza Hotel.|$|E

500|$|Hutchings {{introduced}} Drake to the 25-year-old American producer Joe Boyd, {{owner of}} the production and management company Witchseason Productions. The company was, at the time, licensed to Island Records, and Boyd, {{the man who had}} discovered Fairport Convention and been responsible for introducing John Martyn and The Incredible String Band to a mainstream audience, was a significant and respected figure on the UK folk scene. He and Drake formed an immediate bond, and the producer acted as a mentor to Drake throughout his career. A four-track demo, recorded in Drake's college room in the spring of 1968, led Boyd to offer a management, publishing, and production contract to the 20-year-old, and to initiate work on a debut album. According to Boyd:In those days you didn't have cassettes—he brought a reel-to-reel tape [...] that he'd done at home. Half way through the first song, I felt this was pretty special. And <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> up, and he came back in, and we talked, and I just said, [...] "I'd like to make a record." [...] He stammered, [...] "Oh, well, yeah. Okay." [...] Nick was a man of few words.In a 2004 interview, Drake's friend Paul Wheeler remembered the excitement caused by his seeming big break, and recalled that the singer had already decided not to complete his third year at Cambridge.|$|E
500|$|... "I Luv This Shit" [...] {{was written}} by August Alsina, The Exclusives (Sean McMillion and Ralph Jeanty), Samuel Irving III, Christine Massa, and Trinidad James and was {{produced}} by Knucklehead. It was recorded by McMillion and Cody Sciara at Goldie's Playhouse and Zac Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, and mixed by Jaycen Joshua with assistance from Trehy Harris at Larrabee Sound Studios, North Hollywood. Vocals were produced by The Exclusives. Knucklehead told Vibe in 2014 that he created the song's beat and {{knew it would be}} successful, stating: [...] "I just knew what [...] voice was gonna do over my beat. And that beat didn't sound like thing else at the time that was out ... When I made the beat, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> immediately after I finished it." [...] After playing the beat to Alsina and The Exclusives, they recorded the song in one hour. It is an R song instrumented by guitar, synthesizer, synth-horns and a heavy bassline. The production was compared by Spin Brandon Soderberg to the work of The-Dream. It revolves around about partying with alcohol and drugs with the central hook [...] "I love this shit", and references the vodka Ciroc, yet {{there is an element of}} sorrow to Alsina's vocals. James' verse contemplates human nature, according to Gregory Adams of Exclaim!. [...] "I Luv This Shit" [...] was originally recorded for Alsina's mixtape The Product 2 (2013), and was included on his debut EP [...] (2013). It was also a bonus track on his first studio album, Testimony (2014).|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{condemnation}} {{for having}} referred to Adolf Hitler {{as being a}} 'great man', Farrakhan has said, [...] "I have throughout my life referred to Hitler as a wicked man, yet, the national news media insists that <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a 'great man', with the implied inference that 'great' means 'good'. However, I did refer to him as 'wickedly great', {{in the same sense}} that Genghis Khan stands out in history." ...|$|E

2500|$|Meier {{explained}} {{the story behind}} [...] "Domingo", saying, [...] "Domingo is a false preacher who, with a few sentences, is trying to impress the people there, and then the choir chants 'Domingo, you showed us just nothing like no one before', it means 'you didn't show us anything either, it's all nonsense what you said, but somehow you did it right'. Domingo de Santa Clara actually existed. There was an Abraham a Sancta Clara, he was some religious fanatic. I don't know where I got it from, but the name pleased me very much: Abraham a Sancta Clara. And since the name Domingo pleases me as well, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Domingo." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 10, 2010, Oscar De La Hoya said {{negotiations}} for a Mayweather-Pacquiao fight {{were close to}} being finalized. Speaking to Spanish-language sport show República Deportiva, De La Hoya briefly talked about {{the current status of}} negotiations and, with a grin on his face, said that the two sides were extremely close to making the biggest fight in boxing a reality. [...] "These negotiations have been real difficult for various reasons, but we're really close to finalizing the contracts, even though they've been complicated," [...] he commented. [...] "Today, I can't really talk about the negotiations, but we're really close." [...] A week later, Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer refuted De La Hoya's comments. [...] "I saw those quotes as well, and I had no idea what Oscar was talking about. And <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> up and asked him about them, {{and he said that he}} was misquoted," [...] Schaefer explained to Lem Satterfield of FanHouse.|$|E
2500|$|The cast were reunited in 1975 for a BBC radio {{adaptation}} of series 1, transmitted on Radio 4 from July to October that year. In 1976, {{a feature film}} spin-off was made. Around {{the time of its}} release, however, Rodney Bewes and James Bolam fell out over a misunderstanding involving the press and have not spoken since. This long-suspected situation was finally confirmed by Bewes while promoting his autobiography in 2005. Unlike Bewes, Bolam is consistently reluctant to talk about the show, and has vetoed any attempt to revive his character.The final breach, as Bewes told it, occurred after Bolam's wife, Sue, announced to her husband, while he was driving, that she was pregnant. He almost crashed the car. Bewes repeated this story in a newspaper interview, thinking that it was already public knowledge, then got a frosty reaction when he rang Bolam to forewarn him. [...] "There was this dreadful silence. He put the phone down. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> back. He didn't answer. He hasn't spoken to me since", Bewes claimed. }} ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{supposed to be}} released on Good Friday, but was released a day early on Thursday, following {{the release of the}} West and DJ Khaled collaboration track [...] "Cold". The track was premiered by Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show and was released onto the Internet the following day onto West's official website. The song serves as the first official single from Cruel Summer, an album by West's record label GOOD Music. The release of the track continued West's GOOD Fridays, a music giveaway that provided free MP3 downloads every week, which had been on hiatus since December 2010. The song features Big Sean and Pusha T, rappers both signed to West's GOOD Music, along with 2 Chainz, all delivering a verse each along with West. Speaking about his feature, 2 Chainz stated that [...] "I've done a lot of work with 'Ye for, like, a year now, {{and it was one of}} those songs where <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> and I told him, 'Man, play my verse over the phone because I don't remember.' That's a good look to add to the résumé, for real." [...] According to 2 Chainz, he had no idea that the song was going to be a single.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{the public}} {{response}} to Scott was generally favorable during the Paramount years, the film critics were less so, repeatedly making unfavorable comparisons to Lauren Bacall and Tallulah Bankhead, beginning with Bob Thomas' March 1945 comment about her screen test: [...] "Her throaty voice may well make Lauren Bacall {{sound like a}} mezzo soprano." [...] When the most prominent critic of the era, Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, gave a bad review of You Came Along (1945), Scott's film debut, she recalled, [...] "Being very young and naïve at the time, I didn't know you weren't supposed to do such things, so <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> up and complained. I told him how hard everyone worked {{to make such a}} beautiful movie, and I couldn't understand how he could be so cruel. I must say he took it awfully well, and was very kind to me." [...] Nonetheless, in his review of I Walk Alone (1948), he stated, [...] "As the torch singer ... Lizabeth Scott has no more personality than a model in the window of a department store." [...] He also wrote of [...] "a frighteningly grotesque Lizabeth Scott, who is supposed to represent a cabaret singer" [...] in Dark City (1950).|$|E
2500|$|While Paths of Glory {{did not do}} well at the box office, it {{has since}} {{become one of the}} great anti-war films, and one of early films by {{director}} Stanley Kubrick. Douglas, a fluent French speaker, plays a sympathetic French officer during World War I who tries to save three soldiers from the firing squad. Biographer Vincent LoBrutto describes Douglas's [...] "seething but controlled portrayal exploding with the passion of his convictions at the injustice leveled at his men." [...] The film was banned in France until 1976. Before production of the film began, however, Douglas and Kubrick had to work out some major issues, one of which was Kubrick's rewriting the screenplay without informing Douglas first. It led to their first major argument: [...] "I called Stanley to my room... I hit the ceiling. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> every four-letter word I could think of... 'I got the money, based on that [...] script. Not this shit!' I threw the script across the room. 'We're going back to the original script, or we're not making the picture.' Stanley never blinked an eye. We shot the original script. I think the movie is a classic, {{one of the most important}} pictures—possibly the most important picture—Stanley Kubrick has ever made." ...|$|E

2500|$|White Zombie {{announced}} in 1998 that the band had officially broken up, {{and it was}} confirmed that Rob had begun working on a solo debut album. Though acting as a solo artist, Zombie worked to find a band to record and tour with; Mike Riggs was selected to play guitar, Blasko played bass guitar, and John Tempesta played the drums. Tempesta {{had been a member of}} White Zombie, while Rob was introduced to Riggs through a mutual friend. On finding the guitar player, Zombie claimed [...] "Danny [...] was just like, ‘I know the perfect guy.’ He gave me Riggs’ phone number and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> out of nowhere. I trusted Danny, so that was it. Riggs came out and he was great. We didn’t have a bass player yet. Riggs and I hung out and talked and I told him everything I wanted to do." [...] Work on the album began in August of 1997, prior to the announcement of White Zombie's separation. The album took an estimated ten months to complete. The majority of the album was recorded at The Chop Shop in Hollywood, California. Zombie described the finished product as a [...] "full-blown evil raging beast - a total Zombie extravaganza" [...] and claimed that album was [...] "no small, self-indulgent album filled with whining about deep feelings." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his call}} for a boycott on June 2, 1925, Du Bois pursued his {{challenge}} to Fisk and McKenzie through his editorials in The Crisis, the official magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and in Black newspapers across the country. In the fall of 1924, Du Bois embarked upon a lecture tour speaking to Fisk alumni clubs throughout the nation. He also contacted Fisk students, faculty, and alumni {{as part of an}} effort to collect evidence and examples of a paternalistic and authoritarian Fisk administration in sympathy with White Southern interests. [...] Soon Du Bois targeted McKenzie. In late 1924, Du Bois wrote of McKenzie's appointment as President in The Crisis: [...] "I knew him. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> friend. I saw in him a new type of young, scientific philanthropist come to help and re-establish training among Negroes." [...] In early 1925, Du Bois resurrected the Fisk Herald, the former Fisk student newspaper. As a former editor of the Herald in the 1880s, Du Bois had a special affection for the newspaper. For many Fisk alumni, the Fisk Herald was an important symbol of literary freedom. Du Bois published the paper out of his office in New York City, and proclaimed in the inaugural issue, [...] "Unless McKenzie is removed from Fisk, I intend to publish every word of evidence I hold to prove he is unfit and a detriment to the cause of higher education for our race." ...|$|E
