40|$|Introduction: More than 1 % {{of world}} {{population}} suffer from epilepsy, which affects {{many aspects of}} individuals’ life. In fact, multiple treatment methods are used for this disorder, among which treatment effects of herbal plants can be introduced. Humulus Lupulus has been utilized in the traditional medicine as an anti-convulsion herb. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the anti-convulsive effect of Humulus Lupulus extract on the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) kindling model of epilepsy. Methods: The present experimental study (n= 8) was carried out on 40 male mice which have been randomly chosen and divided into 5 groups (n= 8), including 1 -control group receiving only PTZ, 1 sham group receiving  distilled water  and 3   experimental groups which received equeous extract of Humulus lupulus in doses of 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg   30 minutes before PTZ injection via gavage tube. Chemical kindling was performed in all the groups {{by a total of}} 15 treatments with PTZ intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg of body weight at every 48 hours. The data analysis was carried out by one-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc test. Results: The study results revealed that administration of Humulus Lupulus extract had a significant effect on the decrease of PTZ-induced seizures. Moreover, this extract can inhibit progress of seizure stages, decrease seizure duration and increase letency time of seizure onset. Conclusion: The findings of the present study demonstrated that aqueous <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> <b>Hops</b> plant has anticonvulsant effect on chemical kindling and as a result, it seems to be useful regarding the epilepsy treatment...|$|E

Heifers {{were randomly assigned}} to individual pens and fed once daily for 147 d. Treatments were a control (no additive); 33 mg monensin (Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN) /kg diet DM; and 10, 25, 50 mg β-acid <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> (DSM Nutritional Products, France) /kg diet DM. Ruminal fluid was collected on d 44 and 86 by rumenocentesis for analyses of VFA, lactate, and NH[subscript] 3 concentrations. Cattle were harvested at a commercial abattoir on d 147. Hops β-acids decreased propionate (P = 0. 01) concentrations and increased caproate (P = 0. 05), A:P (P = 0. 04), and ammonia concentrations (P = 0. 03) compared to monensin. Growth performance of heifers fed β-acid or monensin was not different than that of heifers fed the control diet. Additionally, two in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate effects of hops β-acid extract on starch fermentation by mixed microbial populations from the bovine rumen. In trial 1, 2 treatments were assigned in triplicate to fermentation bottle, fitted with Ankom[superscript]RF 1 Gas Production System modules (Ankom[superscript]RF Technology, Macedon, NY) using starch as substrate (Difco Soluble Starch; Dickinson and Company, Sparks, MD) and either 0 or 33 mg hops β-acid extract (10. 99 % active hops beadlet; DSM Nutritional Products, France) /kg substrate. Gas production was measured over 30 h. Terminal pH, IVDMD, and VFA and lactate were measured after 30 h of fermentation. Gas production increased in response to β-acid (P ≤ 0. 05). Terminal pH, IVDMD, VFA, and lactate were unaffected by addition of β-acid extract (P ≤ 0. 05). In trial 2, pH, VFA concentrations, and IVDMD were measured at 6 -h intervals during a 30 -h incubation period using 36 fermentation tubes. There was no effect of hops β-acid on in vitro fermentation (P > 0. 05).

One spicy/hoppy compound, unmodified from hop to beer, proved responsible for the most intense odor in both hopped beer extracts. Another flavoring compound in hops, linalool, also survives through the process to the final beer.

Following an adventitious observation during dry-hopping experiments, we identified a fining activity associated with Saaz <b>hops.</b> <b>Extracts</b> <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> cones were subsequently shown to have the capacity to flocculate yeast and result in their sedimentation. This activity has since been identified in <b>extracts</b> <b>of</b> many different <b>hop</b> varieties and, significantly in spent hops, the co-product resulting from commercial extraction <b>of</b> <b>hops</b> with either CO 2 or ethanol. Here we illustrate the activity of the novel finings extracted from spent hops following CO 2 extraction <b>of</b> Galena <b>hops.</b> The sediments formed on fining were compact, relative to those obtained when commercial isinglass was used to fine the same beers. The hop extracts were also effective in reducing 90 ° haze in beers under conditions designed to mimic both cask ale (12 [*]°C) and lager (4 [*]°C) type applications. The compounds responsible for the fining activity appear to be large (30 – 100 [*]kDa, or more) polyphenols. Analysis of the polyphenols using colourimetric tests indicated the presence of proanthocyanidins. On acidic hydrolysis these generated cyanidin, which would be derived from a polymer composed of catechin and epicatechin subunits. The presence of these materials in spent hops offers the possibility to develop commercial products, with desirable fining properties, from an existing co-product stream.

Although significant advances {{have been made in the}} identification and quantification of acyl-CoAs using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), separation of isomeric species such as isobutyryl- and n-butyrl-CoA has remained elusive. Here we report an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) -MS/MS method for quantifying short-chain acyl-CoAs including isomeric species n-butyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA as well as n-valeryl-CoA and isovaleryl-CoA.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Hop {{varieties}} {{were compared}} under field and greenhouse conditions {{to determine their}} relative susceptibility to the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticac Koch. A fertility schedule was prepared for mites on resistant and susceptible varieties, and tests were conducted to compare sex ratio, oviposition rate, survival rate, and developmental rate of mites on resistant and susceptible varieties. Hop leaves were examined for traits that could affect mite life histories. Moisture content of leaves, leaf area, and density of ventral glands and hairs were related to oviposition, sex ratio, developmental times, survival, and female migration, using linear regression. Thin layer chromatography (TLC), column chromatography, and gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) were used to analyze farnesol content <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> foliage and oil. Farnesol, nerolidol, geraniol, nerol, and an ether <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> twospotted spider mites were topically applied to female mites to determine effects on oviposition rates. In the greenhouse, mite densities were significantly greater (P < 0. 05) on Comet and Fuggle than on L- 8, L- 1, and Cascade, using artificially infested plants. In the field, natural infestations were significantly lower (P < 0. 005) on Fuggle and Cascade than on Talisman or Comet, and L- 16 had the highest density. Mites on Cascade had a higher intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} than on Fuggle, Comet, Talisman, or L- 16, and mites on Cascade had the shortest generation time. The net reproductive rate was higher on Fuggle than on Cascade, Comet, Talisman, or L- 16. No consistent differences were found in oviposition rates, sex ratio, or survival of mites reared on resistant and susceptible varieties. Highly significant differences (P < 0. 005) were found in developmental rates, and the developmental rate of mites on L- 16 was consistently slowed. Immature mites on L- 16 and Talisman developed slowly, and differed in coloration from mites on Cascade, Fuggle, and Comet. Leaves from Cascade, Comet, L- 16, and Talisman differed significantly (P < 0. 005) in moisture content and density of ventral hairs and glands. Statistically significant regressions were obtained relating oviposition to leaf area, sex ratio to ventral hairs, and development time to leaf moisture content and ventral hairs. Migrating females preferred Comet leaves to leaves from Talisman, Cascade, Fuggle, and L- 16; preference was not significantly related to leaf area, ventral hair density, ventral gland density, or Leaf moisture content.

40|$|Currently the {{treatment}} of chronic inflammatory diseases is aimed at inhibiting the symptoms of the disease {{since there are no}} curative or preventive treatments available. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a painful chronic inflammatory disease of the joints. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a disease in which pain and inflammation of the joint in certain (end-) stages of the disease plays an important role. For variable reasons patients use natural products to relieve their symptoms, with many claims that have insufficient scientific evidence unfortunately. In this thesis a selection of phytochemicals and plant extracts was investigated for their potential modulating effects on inflammatory processes and on chondrocyte cartilage metabolism relevant for OA and RA. Most of these are suitable for nutritional purposes. Different test systems were used, ranging from in vitro experiments with both animal and human cells, to in vivo animal experiments. A bioavailability study in human healthy volunteers was performed as well. Among the tested flavonoids, apigenin, chrysin and luteolin eliminated monocytes/macrophages from white blood cells in vitro, whereas quercetin and naringenin had no effects. An <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> Pterocarpus marsupium demonstrated inhibitory activity of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) which was related to the pterostilbene content <b>of</b> the <b>extract.</b> Moreover, from whole blood assays it became clear that it reduced PGE 2 produced by cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2 and not by COX- 1. In a pilot study with human healthy volunteers the extract was not active. An <b>extract</b> <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> (Humulus lupulus) showed to inhibit PGE 2 produced by COX- 2 and not by COX- 1. In an animal study for acute arthritis oral administration <b>of</b> the <b>hop</b> <b>extract</b> did not result in reduced joint swelling although it was bioavailable. Oral administration of apocynin was able to confirm two in vitro observed features in vivo: (1) oral administration of apocynin was able to reverse zymosan-induced inhibition of cartilage proteoglycan synthesis partially, and (2) oral administration of apocynin showed COX inhibitory effects similar to the NSAID ibuprofen. SKI 306 X, a preparation of a mix of three oriental plants (Clematis mandshurica, Trichosanthes kirilowii and Prunella vulgaris), has been studied in OA patients. The in vitro studies described in this thesis demonstrated that the biological effects of SKI 306 X are at least bipartite: (1) cartilage protective and (2) anti-inflammatory. In conclusion, the results from this thesis illustrate that there is a large potential of plant-derived components as anti-inflammatory agents. However, further research, which includes clinical trials in the relevant patient groups, has to elucidate whether these plant-derived components are appropriate candidates as anti-inflammatory agents suitable for nutritional purposes...|$|R

40|$|In {{contrast}} to determination <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> utilisation {{in terms of}} beer bitterness, analytical measurement of the yield <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> aromatisation is not straightforward {{on account of the}} enormous chemical complexity <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> essential oil and hoppy aroma derived thereof. In this paper, selective determination <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> oil-derived constituents in the flavour profile of pilsner beer is achieved through headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Highly enriched floral and spicy hop essences were prepared by density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), followed by solid phase extraction (SPE), and subsequently added in well-defined amounts to an experimental pilsner, exclusively bittered with purified iso-α-acids <b>extract.</b> In view <b>of</b> reliable measurement of the yield of aromatisation of the pilsner with the respective hop oil fractions, characteristic marker components for the floral and spicy SFE/ SPE hop essences, respectively, were selected. Reliable determination of the selected markers for floral and spicy SFE/SPE hop essences in the aromatised beers turned out to be possible on condition that HS-SPME is combined with GC-MS comprising selected fragment ion monitoring (SIM). Using this approach, application <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> oil preparations can be monitored analytically, allowing improved control and specification <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> aromatisation according to the desired beer flavour. The average yield of beer aromatisation using floral and spicy hop essences was determined at about 95 %. On the basis of their sesquiterpenoid GC-MS/SIM pattern, fresh commercial lager beers could be differentiated, which may be useful for brand fingerprinting and identification. Upon forced ageing of the beers, levels <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> oil-derived sesquiterpenoids, in particular of caryophyllene and humulene epoxides, decrease significantly. In addition, trans-nerolidol is identified as a potential marker for measuring flavour (in) stability of pilsner beer. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Hsp 70 –Hsp 90 {{complex is}} {{implicated in the}} folding and {{regulation}} of numerous signaling proteins, and Hop, the Hsp 70 –Hsp 90 Organizing Protein, facilitates the association of this multichaperone machinery. Phosphatase treatment <b>of</b> mouse cell <b>extracts</b> reduced the number <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> isoforms compared to untreated extracts, providing the first direct evidence that Hop was phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that a cdc 2 kinase phosphorylation mimic <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> had reduced affinity for Hsp 90 binding. Hop was predominantly cytoplasmic, but translocated to the nucleus in response to heat shock. A putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) has been identified within the Hsp 90 -binding domain <b>of</b> <b>Hop.</b> Although substitution <b>of</b> residues within the major arm of this proposed NLS abolished Hop–Hsp 90 interaction as determined by SPR, this was not sufficient to prevent the nuclear accumulation <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> under leptomycin-B treatment and heat shock conditions. These results showed {{for the first time}} that the subcellular localization <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> was stress regulated and that the major arm of the putative NLS was not directly important for nuclear translocation but was critical for Hop–Hsp 90 association in vitro. We propose a model in which the association <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> with Hsp 90 and the phosphorylated status <b>of</b> <b>Hop</b> both play a role in the mechanism of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling <b>of</b> <b>Hop...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0. 2 g liter− 1 or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0. 5 to 1 g liter− 1, and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW 1. 460 to <b>hop</b> <b>extract,</b> indicating inactivation <b>of</b> <b>hop</b> resistance mechanisms, e. g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG 1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and {{in the presence of}} heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins...|$|R
