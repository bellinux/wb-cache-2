5|$|Taiwan <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> (abbreviated THSR or HSR) is a {{high-speed}} rail line that runs approximately , {{along the west}} coast of Taiwan, from the national capital Taipei to the southern city of Kaohsiung. With construction managed by a private company, Taiwan <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> Corporation (THSRC), which also operates the line, the total cost of the project was US$18billion. At the time it was built, {{this was one of the}} world's largest privately funded rail construction schemes. The system is based primarily on Japan's Shinkansen technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{bidding process}} pitted Taiwan <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> Consortium (THSRC) against the Chunghwa <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> Consortium (CHSRC). THSRC's bid {{was based on}} the {{high-speed}} technology platform of Eurotrain, a joint venture between GEC-Alsthom, the main maker of the French TGV, and Siemens, the main maker of the German ICE, while CHSRC's bid was based on Japanese Shinkansen technology supplied by Taiwan Shinkansen Consortium (TSC), a joint venture of Japanese companies. THSRC, which submitted the lower bid and promised to build the line with zero net cost from the government, was chosen as preferred bidder in September 1997. The group was renamed and formally established as the Taiwan <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> Corporation (THSRC) in May 1998. THSRC and the government signed the BOT agreement on 23 July 1998.|$|E

5|$|In November 1994, Taiwan {{passed a}} law {{regarding}} the use of private finance in infrastructure projects, which also applied to the up-to-then state-run THSR project. Consequently, in 1995, POHSR was transformed into the Bureau of <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> (BOHSR), which started to tender THSR as a build-operate-transfer (BOT) scheme in October 1996.|$|E

5|$|The train {{master on}} No. 616 {{received}} complaints from passengers at about 9:10am that the women’s toilet in cabin No. 11 contained {{two pieces of}} luggage which emitted a strange odor. THSRC informed the <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> Police Division, which later boarded the train when it stopped at Hsinchu station. The traffic control center decided to evacuate passengers after the train stopped at Taoyuan station at 9:45 am. More than 600 people were asked to disembark and continue their journey on another train. All passengers affected by the incident would be given a coupon allowing them to purchase a high-speed ticket for their next journey at half price, even though the train company was not {{to blame for the}} incident.|$|E
5|$|The “National Geographic” website chose {{travel by}} <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>rail</b> in western Taiwan as the “Best Winter Trip 2013”. The first film to feature THSR {{prominently}} was the 2007 Taiwanese movie Summer's Tail, directed by Cheng Wen-Tang. A group of teenagers, {{one of whom}} is the son of a Japanese engineer working on the high-speed railway, hang out at a vacant lot under the elevated tracks of THSR in Liuying, Tainan. In Leg 10 of Season 12 of the internationally aired reality television game show The Amazing Race, which was watched by 11.65million Americans, competing teams travelled from Taipei to Taichung and back on the THSR.|$|E

5|$|While {{the media}} {{questioned}} whether the planned construction of three more intermediate stations and the extension to Nangang would be postponed, THSRC published press release on 26 September 2009, stating that the company will comply with “Taiwan <b>High</b> <b>Speed.</b> <b>Rail</b> Construction and Operation Contract”, and the construction project of 3 intermediate stations, namely Miaoli, Changhua and Yunling will be initiated in July, 2012, and is scheduled to start its operation from 2015. By the time of completion, {{there will be a}} total of 12 stations along the THSRC operation route. The company was put under new management in September 2009 with the aim of turning around the company's finances with government help in arranging refinancing of the loans.|$|E
5|$|Taiwan's rapid {{economic}} growth during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century led to saturation of highways, conventional rail, and air traffic systems in the western transport corridor, which threatened to impede further growth. The idea of a new high-speed rail line arose in the 1970s, and informal planning began in 1980. In 1987 the executive branch of Taiwan's government, the Executive Yuan, instructed the Ministry of Transportation to launch a feasibility study for a high-speed rail line in the western Taiwan corridor, which was completed in 1990. The study found that in a comparison of potential solutions to traffic problems in the corridor, a high-speed rail line would offer the highest transit volume, lowest land use, highest energy savings, and least pollution. In July 1990 the Preparation Office of <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> (POHSR) was established and a route was selected in 1991. Plans for the THSR were subsequently approved by the Executive Yuan in June 1992 and by Taiwan's legislature, the Legislative Yuan, in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Further {{expansion}} {{has been}} proposed, contingent upon {{the allocation of}} funding. This includes {{the second phase of}} the Silicon Valley extension, which would bring the system to downtown San Jose and Santa Clara. Plans have long been floated for an extension from Dublin to Livermore, which would cost approximately $1.2 billion and run 5.5 miles (8.9 km) along interstate 580 to Isabel Avenue. The BART board could vote in spring 2018 on this project, which would be completed in 2026. Other plans have included an extension to Hercules, a line along the Interstate Highway 680 corridor, and a fourth set of rail tracks through Oakland. At least four infill stations such as Irvington and Calaveras on existing lines have been proposed. With the Transbay Tube nearing capacity, long-range plans included a new four-bore Transbay Tube beneath San Francisco Bay that would run parallel and south of the existing tunnel and emerge at the Transbay Transit Terminal to connect to Caltrain and the future California <b>High</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>Rail</b> system. The four-bore tunnel would provide two tunnels for BART and two tunnels for conventional/high-speed rail. The BART system and conventional U.S. rail use different and incompatible rail gauges and different loading gauges.|$|E

The first alternative is called Shared Use with top speeds of 90 mph to 110 mph. The second alternative is called Hybrid High Performance with top speeds of 130 mph. There are also high-speed rail alternatives in the same study with top speeds of 180 mph to 220 mph or higher.|$|R
