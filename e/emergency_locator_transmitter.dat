25|$|Naval ships {{combed the}} Makassar Strait while {{military}} personnel went through jungles and mountains of Sulawesi. In {{the face of}} heavy rain and strong winds in the area, the search efforts, coordinated from Makassar city, were focused in the area between the coastal town of Majene and the mountainous region of Toraja. The search in the two areas was due to twin signals, each carrying different <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> frequencies, received by the Singaporean satellite and an Indonesian military air base. The two separate locations produced on radar screens were {{a spot on the}} sea in Majene and on land in Rantepao, Tana Toraja. Searches were then expanded throughout the Island of Sulawesi; some were triggered by unknown distress signals received by a commercial Lion Air flight and an airport. A police officer at the Barru district police operational centre said that all the districts with stretches of coastline along the Makasser Strait had teams searching for the plane.|$|E

During this time the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Locator</b> <b>Transmitter</b> (ELT) began to sound in the Control Tower at Cork Airport. Post impact fires ensued in both engines, and from fuel leaking from the outboard right fuel tank. The fires were put out by the Airfield Fire Service (AFS) before they reached the fuselage. Of the twelve on board, six people were fatally injured including both pilots. Four of the survivors suffered serious injury whilst two received minor injuries and were described as walking wounded. A witness inside the airport terminal building stated that the fog was so thick that the crashed aircraft could not be seen. The airport fire service extinguished both post impact fires within ten minutes of the accident, and started to remove the casualties from the wreckage.pg.192 The injured were taken to Cork University Hospital for treatment. As a result of the accident, Cork Airport was closed until the evening of 11 February.|$|E
2500|$|On July 12, 2013, a {{fire started}} {{on an empty}} Ethiopian Airlines 787 parked at Heathrow Airport before it was {{extinguished}} by the airport fire and rescue service.

The initial investigation found no direct link with the aircraft's main batteries. Further investigations indicated that the fire was due to lithium-manganese dioxide batteries powering an <b>emergency</b> <b>locator</b> <b>transmitter</b> (ELT). The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) issued a special bulletin on July 18, 2013 requesting the US FAA ensure that the locator is removed or disconnected in Boeing 787s, and to review the safety of lithium battery-powered ELT systems in other aircraft types. On August 19, 2015, the Associated Press reported that the fire was started by a short circuit, caused by crossed wires located under the battery.
