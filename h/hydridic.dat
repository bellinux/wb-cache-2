The Li-BH 4 substructure adopts various topologies {{as a function}} of the compound's Li content, ranging from one-dimensional isolated chains to three-dimensional networks. It is revealed that the Li+ ion has potential as a surprisingly versatile cation participating in framework building with the tetrahydroborate anion BH 4 as a linker, if the framework is stabilized by large electropositive counter-cations. This utility can be of interest when designing novel <b>hydridic</b> frameworks based on alkaline metals and will be of use when exploring the structural and coordination chemistry of light-metal systems otherwise subject to eutectic melting...|$|E
