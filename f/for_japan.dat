5|$|Spain {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{threatening}} power <b>for</b> <b>Japan</b> at that time (with a colony and an army in the nearby Philippines). Hasekura's eyewitness accounts of Spanish power and colonial methods in Nueva España (Mexico) may have precipitated the Shogun Tokugawa Hidetada's decision to sever trade relations with Spain in 1623, and diplomatic relations in 1624, although other events such as the smuggling of Spanish priests into Japan and a failed Spanish embassy also contributed to the decision.|$|E

On 19 September 1945 the corps, with the assigned 33rd Infantry Division, sailed from Lingayen Gulf <b>for</b> <b>Japan,</b> landing {{on the island of}} Honshū on 25 September, three weeks after Japan's formal surrender. The next few years were a period during which the terms of the surrender were supervised and enforced; Japanese military installations and material were seized, troops were disarmed and discharged, and weapons of warfare disposed of. The duties of the occupation force included conversion of industry, repatriation of foreign nationals, and supervision of the complex features of all phases of Japanese government, economics, education, and industry.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Cavite on Luzon, the gunboat headed <b>for</b> <b>Japan</b> on 3 April and {{underwent}} repairs {{there from}} 9 April to 19 May before {{heading back to}} the Philippines. The warship arrived at Cavite on 27 May and resumed patrols on 3 June. She spent another seven months conducting patrols in the Philippines and supporting the Army’s operations in the island chain. On 3 January 1901, she departed Cavite and shaped a course for Hong Kong. The gunboat arrived in that British colony on the 6th and began over six months of repairs. At the completion of that work, she departed Hong Kong on 25 June. After a visit to Shanghai, the warship headed back to the United States in July and arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 19 August. She was decommissioned there on 5 September 1901.|$|E
5|$|Allied air {{and naval}} attacks against Japanese {{shipping}} in the South China Sea were expanded during early 1945 as additional USAAF units moved into {{bases in the}} Philippines and other demands on these forces permitted. Land-based patrol aircraft and medium bombers operated over the sea from liberated areas of the Philippines and Dutch East Indies from February. While Allied submarines and these aircraft failed to prevent the escape of the Ise-class battleships when they sailed <b>for</b> <b>Japan</b> during Operation Kita in mid-February, the medium bombers were sinking large numbers of Japanese merchant ships {{by the end of}} the month. Medium and heavy bombers also raided Japanese-held ports across the South China Sea area. As a result of the air and submarine attacks, the Japanese ceased sending ships through the South China Sea in April.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Russian Revolution in 1917, the Russian Provisional Government declared a general amnesty and offered to fund the return of those Russians who had been exiled as political opponents of the Empire; the entire staff of Golos Truda elected to leave New York City for Russia and to move the periodical to Petrograd. In Vancouver on May 26, 1917, the editors, along with Ferrer Center artist Manuel Komroff and thirteen others, boarded a ship bound <b>for</b> <b>Japan.</b> On board, the anarchists played music, gave lectures, staged plays and even published a revolutionary newspaper, The Float. From Japan, the band made their way to Siberia, and proceeded East to European Russia.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry <b>for</b> <b>Japan</b> and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E

5|$|By 10 October Toyoda's tour of {{the front}} was complete. He {{intended}} to depart from Formosa <b>for</b> <b>Japan</b> that same day but was forced to change his plans when Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's Fast Carrier Task Force suddenly appeared to the north, launching strikes against the Ryukyu Islands. Toyoda could not risk a return trip home through a concentrated enemy carrier force that now embarked more than 1,000 aircraft, especially not after previous Combined Fleet commanders had been lost during aerial engagements. As a result, he was grounded far from Combined Fleet headquarters at a decisive moment. Out of position and with inadequate lines of communication, the response to such overwhelming enemy air power was left to Toyoda's Chief of Staff, Vice Admiral Ryūnosuke Kusaka.|$|E

5|$|Given a {{classical}} name <b>for</b> <b>Japan,</b> Fusō was {{built at the}} Samuda Brothers shipyard in Cubitt Town, London. Japanese sources universally give the date for Kongōs keel-laying as 24 September 1875the same as that for the awarding of the contractbut historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. Fusō was launched on 14 April 1877 when Ueno Ikuko, wife of the Japanese consul, cut the retaining rope with a hammer and chisel. Completed in January 1878, the ship sailed <b>for</b> <b>Japan</b> before 22 March {{under the command of}} a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. While transiting the Suez Canal, she was lightly damaged when she ran aground on 27 April. She received temporary repairs at a local dockyard and arrived in Yokohama on 11 June. She was classified as a second-class warship while still in transit. She was transferred to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 17 June for permanent repairs. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was then opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. Beginning on 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E
