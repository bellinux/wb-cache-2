40|$|Since the 1960 s, ~ 5000 km 2 of tidal deltaplain in {{southwest}} Bangladesh has been embanked and converted to densely inhabited, agricultural islands (i. e., polders). This landscape is juxtaposed to the adjacent Sundarbans, a pristine mangrove forest, both well {{connected by a}} dense network of tidal channels that effectively convey water and sediment throughout the region. The extensive embanking in poldered areas, however, has greatly reduced the tidal prism (i. e., volume of water) transported through local channels. We reveal that > 600 km of these major waterways have infilled in recent decades, converting to land through enhanced sedimentation and the direct blocking of waterways by embankments and sluice gates. Nearly all of the observed closures (~ 98 %) have occurred along the embanked polder systems, with no comparable changes occurring in channels of the Sundarbans (< 2 % change). We attribute most of the channel infilling to the local reduction of tidal prism in poldered areas and the associated decline in current velocities. The infilled channels account for ~ 90 km 2 of new land in the last 40 – 50 years, the rate of which, ~ 2 km 2 /yr, offsets the 4 km 2 /yr that is eroded at the coast, and is equivalent to ~ 20 % of the new land produced naturally at the Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal rivermouth. Most of this new land, called ‘khas’ in Bengali, has been reclaimed for agriculture or aquaculture, contributing to the local economy. However, benefits are tempered {{by the loss of}} navigable waterways for commerce, transportation, and fishing, as well as the <b>forced</b> <b>rerouting</b> of tidal waters and sediments necessary to sustain this low-lying landscape against rising sea level. A more sustainable delta will require detailed knowledge of the consequences of these hydrodynamic changes to support more scientifically-grounded management of water, sediment, and tidal energy distribution...|$|E

5|$|A hangar {{was built}} at Bergen Airport in 2003, {{and at the}} same time the airline was {{certified}} as a mechanical aviation workshop. The following year, the Cessna 421 was replaced with a Cessna 441 Conquest II. In 2006, two Beechcraft King Air were bought, and the last Cessna sold. On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport was closed for all scheduled traffic by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a lack of safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was <b>forced</b> to <b>reroute</b> all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following an investment of NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, which owns the airport, scheduled services commenced again. From 1 October 2004, NOK 250,000 was invested at Notodden Airport. Starting in October 2004, the airline also introduced security control of all passengers at Notodden Airport. In 2005, the company had a revenue of NOK 10.3 million; this increased to NOK 20.1 million in 2006, giving a profit of NOK 2.8 million, when the airline transported 2,841 passengers.|$|R
50|$|Earlier {{in the day}} of the accident, a {{switching}} issue <b>forced</b> dispatchers to <b>reroute</b> the Evanston Express to run counter-clockwise {{around the}} Loop instead of its normal clockwise route. This put it on the tracks normally used by the Ravenswood and westbound Lake-Dan Ryan trains. Because of congestion caused by this abnormal track sharing, the Ravenswood train would be required to stop short, waiting for the rerouted Evanston Express to clear before proceeding. Additionally, this delay meant that the Ravenswood was still in place when the Lake-Dan Ryan train arrived on these tracks, and it too was required to stop and wait for the Ravenswood to clear the track before proceeding.|$|R

Another NOK250,000 was invested from 1 October 2004 to keep meet safety requirements. Starting in October 2004, security control was introduced. In September 2007, the Bergen Air Transport bought a new hangar at Notodden, giving it ample space for expansion, and new arrival and departure facilities.|$|R
50|$|With {{the opening}} of the Cut-Off in 1911, the line became known as the Old Road, relegated to a branch line for local freight shipments.

40|$|Natural {{disasters}} {{have the}} ability to disrupt structured systems in the United States, such as transportation systems and freight routes. When a natural disaster occurs, freight is <b>forced</b> to <b>reroute</b> around the effected areas. Rerouting slows recovery efforts, as well as normal transportation of goods within the United States. Therefore, natural disasters, with respect to freight routes, have widespread impacts and the possibility for acute hardship in disaster-prone areas. This thesis examines how comprehensive state and local level emergency operations plans are with respect to freight transportation rerouting following a natural disaster. Coastal cities can modify freight routes and this rerouting might affect recovery efforts and the normal flow of freight. First, seven coastal cities emergency operations plans are examined for specific elements of freight transportation planning. From there, the project determined how complete local level emergency operations plans are in terms of freight transportation and the framework needed for a freight transportation plan. The result of this research was policy recommendations to improve the resiliency of freight transportation networks surrounding coastal cities and incorporate freight transportation planning into emergency operations. The resiliency of freight routes following natural disasters is important because there can be widespread effects on the delivery of goods to the U. S. as well as recovery supplies to the effected area. If freight routes could be modeled to efficiently deliver rescue supplies and goods, while also minimizing the environmental effects, the benefits of uninterrupted service to the transportation system and society could possibly be substantial. The transportation system cannot encounter difficulties whenever a natural or manmade disaster occurs; therefore the United States needs to be better equipped to counteract interruptions in freight routes...|$|R
5000|$|On 19 December 2008 France Telecom {{issued a}} press release stating that the FLAG Telecom, SEA-ME-WE 4, and SEA-ME-WE 3 cables, linking Alexandria, Egypt, Sicily, and Malta, had been cut by either bad weather {{conditions}} or a ship's anchor, resulting in substantial slowdowns in communication traffic, with Egypt experiencing an overall 80% reduction in Internet capacity. France Telecom expects SEA-ME-WE 4 will be repaired first, then SEA-ME-WE 3, then FLAG, and that repairs should be concluded by 31 December. The break disrupted 75% of communication between the Middle East and Asia {{and the rest of}} the world. The breaks caused companies including Vodafone, Verizon Communications, Portugal Telecom, GO (Malta) and France Telecom to experience disruption in their systems and <b>forced</b> them to <b>reroute</b> communications through different means. Others, such as AT&T, also received reports of service disruption. The rerouting of these communications caused large slowdowns in some areas.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} interrelationship between desire and {{the creative process}} in Louise Labe 2 ̆ 7 s Oeuvres Completes. Through a close textual analysis of Labe 2 ̆ 7 s works, I examine the poetics, the discourse, and the dynamics of desire, as its generative <b>force</b> is detoured, <b>rerouted,</b> and rearticulated {{within the framework of}} poetic expression. ^ Part One, the Poetics of Desire, focuses on the thematic and conceptual parameters within which the dynamic of desire operates in Labe 2 ̆ 7 s fictional world. Examining the etymological, theoretical, and philosophical underpinnings which support and in part determine desire 2 ̆ 7 s sinuous path, this section of the dissertation proposes a descriptive model of desire which reflects its multi-dimensional and paradoxical nature. ^ The 2 ̆ 7 impossible 2 ̆ 7 nature of desire creates an unresolved tension between the desired object (male) that is forever out of reach and the desiring subject (female) who is propelled by the very gap or void which she would seek to fill. Part Two, the Discourse of Desire, explores the discordant voices generated by this unresolved tension. Echoing the underlying sociocultural and sexual dimensions of this conflict, these dueling voices of desire illustrate Labe 2 ̆ 7 s manipulation of dominant literary traditions as she regenders the rhetoric of desire and revalorizes the feminine voice. ^ Part Three, the Dynamics of Desire, examines the complex interplay of memory, desire, and the creative process. Privileged moments of the past are retrieved through the operation of memory, which reactivates both the desire and the suffering inherent in those past experiences. As the pain resurfaces, Labe 2 ̆ 7 s poetic persona reinvests unfulfilled erotic energy in poetic expression, where the divine fury of desire is regenerated in lyric form. Foregrounding the privileged status of the creative process, Louise Labe 2 ̆ 7 s Oeuvres Completes celebrate the intimate alliance between passion and poetry through which the writing of desire is endlessly renewed. ...|$|R
