Modacrylics are resistant to acids, weak alkalis, and organic solvents. These fibers are also resistant to moths, mildew and sunlight. Modacrylic fabrics can be machine washed using warm water and tumble dried on a low setting. Modacrylic pieces can also be dry-cleaned, however, they should not be steamed and should only be tumbled on cold. Some fabrics may also be cleaned using the furrier method (a special non <b>immersion</b> <b>cleaning</b> process). The fibers are heat sensitive and will shrink at 250 °F and will stiffen at temperatures over 300 °F.|$|E

Changes from tradi-tional solvent cleaning to alternative methods set into motion recent trends toward zero discharge of pollutants into the air, water, and soil. Phase-outs of ozone-depleting solvents greatly impacted many manufacturers of both industrial and commercial products; in fact, many are still feeling the ramifications. Equipment and bath maintenance, rinsing and drying issues, rust and corrosion problems, chemical disposal, and new environ-mental regulations-these are all concerns that arrived “on the tailcoat ” of replacement chemistries. ’ Moreover, many interim alter-native solvents and solvent formulations themselves have uncertain regulatory futures. * Somewhere in all this transitioning, a new dry cleaning technology emerged called liquid carbon dioxide (LCO 2) <b>immersion</b> <b>cleaning.</b> It has since evolved into an effective and standardized cleaning alter-native. But success came only after a carefully orchestrated develop-ment process: from invention to optimization of the LCO 2 process to the recycling component. This development included both regional and federal environmental agency technology demonstrations 3, 4 and the issuance of several patents. 5 Nonetheless, the technology might still he on the drawing hoard {{were it not for the}} decision of leading manufacturers to apply it in actual production lines.

40|$|Hot zinc {{galvanising}} gives {{steel objects}} a corrosion resistant surface. The method demands large <b>immersion</b> basins for <b>cleaning,</b> pre-treatment and galvanising. Molten zinc {{has to be}} kept at a uniform temperature of 450 degrees C which requires a high consumption of energy. A Finnish company, Kuumagalvanionti Oy, has built a new hot zinc galvanising plant. By choosing to use electrical heating with sophisticated load control, energy consumption has been cut to 0. 15 kWh per kg of product. Average energy consumption of oil/gas fuelled zinc basins in Finland is about 0. 45 kWh/kg. The new plant also has a system for recycling the pickling fluid used in the process. This reduces cost and also minimises pollution...|$|R
40|$|The ~ 4 Cu monitor {{method was}} used to study the impact of DI H 20 rinses on the {{cleaning}} efficiency of fluorinated silicon surfaces.

Efficient silicon surface cleaning is required for ob-taining high product yields and reliabil ity for semi-conductor devices. It has been shown that peroxide solutions are capable of removing organic and metallic contamination from silicon (1, 2).

40|$|Data {{recently}} {{collected from}} an industrial thin film manufacturer indicate that almost 8 % of devices are rejected due to excess metal, or unwanted metal on the device surface. Experimentation and analysis suggest that {{almost half of}} these defects are caused by incomplete removal of nickel oxides that form {{on top of the}} conductive nickel surface throughout the heated environment of the upstream process. This study classified and identified the composition of these excess metal defects, evaluated recommended wet etch methods to remove nickel oxide, and finally proposes a wet etch process that will rapidly remove defects while continuing to maintain the desired semi-anisotropic etch profile, uncharacteristic of most wet immersion etch processes. Results attested that rapid exposure to dilute (40 %) nitric acid followed by immediate <b>immersion</b> into a <b>cleaning</b> agent, proprietary nickel etchant, and titanium tungsten etchant removed all nickel oxide defects. Upon implementation, this method has the potential to reduce scrap due to excess metal by 3 % and reduce overall etch process time by 25 %. In addition, a process was developed to completely etch patterned substrates with high defect density mid process and rework them from raw substrates. by Neha H. Dave. Thesis (M.

40|$|Chlorinated {{solvents}} such as freon and 1, 1, 1 trichloroethane (TCA) {{are both}} environmental and physiological hazards which deplete stratospheric ozone. These chemicals {{are the primary}} degreasing solvents (vapor, vat, and hand operations) in redesigned solid rocket motor (RSRM) manufacturing. Due to the mandates of the Clean Air Act, substitutes must be identified for RSRM cleaning processes. The initial phase of laboratory testing identified candidate cleaners to replace 1, 1, 1 trichloroethane for cleaning, potentially reducing annual TCA consumption by 800, 000 lbs. This paper describes RSRM testing which elucidated the effects of several interdependent variable including: definition of surface cleanliness criteria, validation of cleaning power of new candidates, the effect of <b>immersion</b> <b>cleaning</b> versus spray cleaning on cleaning, any effect of the cleaner and/or inhibitor upon bondline aging, and compatibility of the cleaners with nonmetallic tooling and processing materials...|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{the aim of}} {{this project}} was to reduce {{environmental}} load caused by halogenated hydrocarbons by developing and researching alternative processes using aqueous solutions, and implementing these in technical systems. Results: process and system techniques for cleaning with aqueous solutions were developed for various applications, and replace previous cleaning processes using halogenated hydrocarbons without loss of quality. The emphasis of this process development laid on elaboration of methods for selecting cleaners, the examination of different rinsing and drying techniques and the influence of ultrasonics on <b>immersion</b> <b>cleaning.</b> For the purpose of quality assurance, methods were developed to determine residual dirt and to analyze cleaning solutions. Regeneration processes were tested and applied to extend the standing time of bathes. For the implementation of these cleaning processes, a cost effective concept for converting existing systems with clorinated hydrocarbons was developed and employed. Furthermore, different types of aqueous cleaning systems were conceived and installed in production plants. These comprise both flexible central systems for the cleaning of parts from various areas of production and cleaning systems which form part of the production flow. (orig.)

40|$|International audienceA {{new test}} was {{developed}} to assess the efficiency of no-wiping hard-surface cleaning. The test allows cleaner comparisons according {{to their ability to}} remove greasy soils. The chosen approach minimizes the mechanical forces applied while cleaning so that the interactions between a detergent solution and the soil to be removed can be characterized. For this, <b>immersion</b> <b>cleaning</b> was chosen, with coated stainless steel as substrate and pigmented oils as the model soil. Several parameters were studied in defined ranges using the Experimental Design method and systematic comparisons. The test shows high reliability on degreasing assessments and is therefore especially suited to optimization of nonionic surfactant mixes. The originality of the test lies in the possibility of keeping a visual trace of the cleaned substrate appearance by imprinting it on a piece of paper. The validation of the test leads to corroboration of several practical observations. Temperature and agitation {{play a major role in}} cleaning efficiency. Detergent solution concentration is a more relevant parameter than pH. Sodium carbonate is shown to have a higher buffering effect than pentahydrated sodium metasilicate. The test is easy to set up, highly sensitive, and can be adapted to solve the problems encountered by formulators of detergent cleaners, such as screening the best ethoxylated fatty alcohol mix for better degreasing properties...|$|E
40|$|Additive Manufacturing of {{metallic}} {{components for}} aerospace applications offers many advantages over traditional manufacturing techniques. As a new technology, {{many aspects of}} its widespread utilization remain open to investigation. Among these are the cleaning processes {{that can be used}} for post finishing of parts and measurements to verify effectiveness of the cleaning processes. Many cleaning and drying processes and measurement methods that have been used for parts manufactured using conventional techniques are candidates that may be considered for cleaning and verification of additively manufactured parts. Among these are vapor degreasing, ultrasonic immersion and spray cleaning, followed by hot air drying, vacuum baking and solvent displacement drying. Differences in porosity, density, and surface finish of additively manufactured versus conventionally manufactured parts may introduce new considerations in the selection of cleaning and drying processes or the method used to verify their effectiveness. This presentation will review the relative strengths and weaknesses of different candidate cleaning and drying processes as they may apply to additively manufactured metal parts for aerospace applications. An ultrasonic cleaning technique for exploring the cleanability of parts will be presented along with an example using additively manufactured Inconel 718 test specimens to illustrate its use. The data analysis shows that this ultrasonic cleaning approach results in a well-behaved ultrasonic cleaning/extraction behavior. That is, it does not show signs of accelerated cavitation erosion of the base material, which was later confirmed by neutron imaging. In addition, the analysis indicated that complete cleaning would be achieved by ultrasonic <b>immersion</b> <b>cleaning</b> at approximately 5 minutes, which was verified by subsequent cleaning of additional parts...|$|E
40|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBRs) are {{becoming}} more and more popular for both municipal and industrial wastewater treatment despite membrane fouling which is an unavoidable problem for all MBR applications in wastewater treatment. Membrane properties, feed-biomass characteristics, and operational conditions are considered as the three major factors that impact on membrane fouling in MBRs. The purpose of the present thesis was to study the membrane fouling behavior and different membrane cleaning procedures in single aerobic activated sludge systems, anaerobic digestion systems, and anaerobic digestion systems followed by an MBR in order to understand why and how the membrane performances are different in these three systems. In the first part of this PhD, lab-scale MBRs were implemented to simulate one-stage (a single aerobic MBR) and two-stage (an aerobic MBR preceded by an anaerobic process) systems for treating molasses based synthetic wastewater. All MBRs presented successful COD removal. In the single aerobic MBR, both hollow fiber and flat sheet membranes showed a stable performance under sub-critical flux (sub-CF) conditions. But once operated under supra-CF condition, the membrane performance could not return to the earlier stable situation anymore, even after decreasing the operational flux back to sub-critical levels. Organic fouling was the major contribution to membrane fouling in the single aerobic MBR, which could be treated with NaClO during maintenance cleaning. The comparison of the MBR performance and membrane cleaning between the one-stage system and the two-stage system showed that the anaerobic treatment of the wastewater before discharging into the MBR definitely changed the biomass characteristics in the post-treatment MBR. Due to the higher SMP level, especially its carbohydrate fraction, and the smaller particle size, the post-treatment MBR presented a faster fouling rate than the single stage aerobic MBR. In addition, inorganic fouling played a clearly more prominent role. Furthermore, citric acid cleaning showed a much better effect on the permeability recovery than NaClO cleaning in the MBR of the two-stage system. Further work addressed in detail the issue of membrane cleaning in the MBR of the two-stage system. Two flat sheets membranes, cleaned by citric acid and NaClO respectively, showed different membrane fouling and cleaning behavior under similar operational conditions. During operation under supra-CF condition, removable fouling (cake layer formation) was dominant for both membranes. Citric acid was found to be a better chemical cleaning agent, especially at high temperature. An additional chemical solution (EDTA with caustic solution) was used for treating fouled membrane pieces after the experiment. Although EDTA presented a metal removal as good as citric acid, it could not fully recover the membrane porosity, as evidenced by SEM analysis. In the second part of this PhD, a UASB followed by three different kinds of membrane-based post-treatment processes (an aerobic MBR, an anaerobic side-stream MBR and a UASB-effluent microfiltration) was implemented to treat brewery wastewater. Under the same operational flux, the anaerobic side-stream MBR showed the highest fouling rate, while the aerobic MBR presented a quite stable filtration performance. The characterization of the membrane feed indicated that the high carbohydrate fraction of the SMP and the smaller floc size could be the two main reasons to result in the highest fouling rate for the anaerobic MBR. The characteristics of the foulant layers showed that polysaccharide-like compounds were present in all three membrane post-treatments, while the inorganic foulants and the protein-like foulants were only present in the foulant layer of the aerobic MBR and the anaerobic MBR, respectively.
