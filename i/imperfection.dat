5|$|Existence is a single, {{objective}} and simple reality, {{and there is}} no difference between its parts, unless in terms of perfection and <b>imperfection,</b> strength, and weakness… And the culmination of its perfection, where there is nothing more perfect, is its independence from any other thing. Nothing more perfect should be conceivable, as every imperfect thing belongs to another thing and needs to become perfect. And, as it has already been explicated, perfection is prior to <b>imperfection,</b> actuality to potency, and existence to non-existence. Also, it has been explained that the perfection of a thing is the thing itself, and not a thing in addition to it. Thus, either existence is independent of others or it is in need of others. The former is the Necessary, which is pure existence. Nothing is more perfect than Him. And in Him {{there is no room for}} non-existence or <b>imperfection.</b> The latter is other than Him, and is regarded as His acts and effects, and for other than Him there is no subsistence, unless through Him. For there is no <b>imperfection</b> in the reality of existence, and <b>imperfection</b> is added to existence only because of the quality of being caused, as it is impossible for an effect to be identical with its cause in terms of existence.|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, delusional, and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an <b>imperfection</b> and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of high {{resolution}} imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is {{in contact with the}} heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface {{like the rest of the}} drop. In theory, it should follow the surface <b>imperfection.</b> This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized energy state of the triple line hinges on the idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.|$|E

5|$|Partly in {{response}} to {{what he saw as}} unsound and unscientific speculations by William Buckland and other practitioners of flood geology, Charles Lyell advocated the geological theory of uniformitarianism in his influential work Principles of Geology. Lyell amassed evidence, both from his own field research and the work of others, that most geological features could be explained by the slow action of present-day forces, such as vulcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation rather than past catastrophic events. Lyell also claimed that the apparent evidence for catastrophic changes in the fossil record, and even the appearance of directional succession in the history of life, were illusions caused by imperfections in that record. For instance he argued that the absence of birds and mammals from the earliest fossil strata was merely an <b>imperfection</b> in the fossil record attributable to the fact that marine organisms were more easily fossilized. Also Lyell pointed to the Stonesfield mammal as evidence that mammals had not necessarily been preceded by reptiles, and to the fact that certain Pleistocene strata showed a mixture of extinct and still surviving species, which he said showed that extinction occurred piecemeal rather than as a result of catastrophic events. Lyell was successful in convincing geologists of the idea that the geological features of the earth were largely due to the action of the same geologic forces that could be observed in the present day, acting {{over an extended period of}} time. He was not successful in gaining support for his view of the fossil record, which he believed did not support a theory of directional succession.|$|E

30|$|As {{explained}} in [4], {{the quality of}} the acquired hidden feedback information in (4) may be degraded by several <b>imperfections</b> in the probing, e.g., the receiver noise or unexpected interference, the measurement errors at the ST. These <b>imperfections</b> have been carefully discussed in [4] for the probing of CGIsp, and the conclusions show that the probing performance is robust to small <b>imperfections.</b> In general, these <b>imperfections</b> are not unique to the problem studied here, but widely observed to exist in many other probing schemes for the CR system [3, 8, 9, 12]. Therefore, to concentrate on the idea of the CDIsp probing itself, we leave these <b>imperfections</b> fuzzy in the design, and assume that the acquired hidden feedback information is perfect at the ST in Section 3 and 4. The impact of the <b>imperfections</b> on the CDIsp probing performance is evaluated comprehensively via the simulations in Section 5.|$|R
40|$|Thin walled {{stiffened}} composite panels, {{which are}} among the most utilized structural elements in engineering, possess the unfortunate property of being highly sensitive to geometrical <b>imperfections.</b> Existing analysis codes can predict the buckling load of a structure with specified initial <b>imperfections.</b> However, it is impossible to determine the amplitude and shape of <b>imperfections</b> of nonexistent composite panels that are only being designed.

40|$|International audienceThe analog {{electronic}} circuits are always subject to some <b>imperfections.</b> Analog <b>imperfections</b> cause deviations from nominal values of electronic elements.

This work extends the evidence regarding the degree of market <b>imperfections</b> in three ways. First, this work represents the first attempt to compare the market <b>imperfections</b> of four Asian index futures markets. As anticipated, the degrees of market <b>imperfections</b> are significantly higher in the emerging markets (Korea and Taiwan) compared to the developed markets (Japan and Hong Kong). Second, this work compares the relative performance of three alternative volatility estimators in estimating the degree of market imperfections: the bivariate error correction GARCH(1, 1) model, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) and the power EWMA. The comparison results provide support for the conclusion that among the volatility estimators examined, the bivariate error correction GARCH(1, 1) model performs the best. Third, this work tests the stationarity of the degrees of market <b>imperfections.</b> The empirical results demonstrate that the degrees of market <b>imperfections</b> for all four Asian markets are stationary, suggesting that the estimates of the degrees of <b>imperfections</b> obtained from ex post data are useful to investors on an ex ante basis. ...|$|R
