5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of shame and alienation as <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>and</b> becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.|$|E
25|$|Neal, {{desperate to}} stay out of prison and find Kate, knows that he must find a legal way to have Hagen taken down. He takes off toward the warehouse, exiting the two-mile radius his {{tracking}} anklet allows him to stay within. Peter is alerted at the FBI headquarters that Neal has bolted. Peter believes that Neal has run off in search of Kate; however, he tracks him to Hagen's warehouse. With Neal, a convicted felon, inside the warehouse, Peter now has probable cause to enter. <b>He</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> discovers Hagen running a massive counterfeiting operation. Hagen and his men are taken into custody, and Peter remarks to Neal that this is the third time Neal has been caught.|$|E
25|$|Thor {{agrees to}} compete in a {{drinking}} contest but after three immense gulps fails. Thor agrees to lift a large, gray cat in the hall but finds that it arches his back no matter what <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> that he can raise only a single paw. Thor demands to fight someone in the hall, but the inhabitants say doing so would be demeaning, considering Thor's weakness. Útgarða-Loki then calls for his nurse Elli, an old woman. The two wrestle but the harder Thor struggles the more difficult the battle becomes. Thor is finally brought down to a single knee. Útgarða-Loki says to Thor that fighting anyone else would be pointless. Now late at night, Útgarða-Loki shows the group to their rooms and they are treated with hospitality.|$|E

25|$|During {{a search}} among Mrs McGinty's possessions, Poirot finds a {{newspaper}} from which an {{article has been}} cut out. The newspaper is dated {{a few days before}} the murder. He later discovers that the missing article is about women connected with famous murder cases, and includes photographs of them. He also discovers that Mrs McGinty had purchased a bottle of ink in a local shop shortly before her murder. He concludes that she had recognised one of the women in the article, and had written to the paper in question. Someone must have found out about it and then killed her to prevent her from talking. Poirot and Spence, using the ages of people in the town, conclude that someone is either Lily Gamboll, who committed murder with a meat cleaver as a child, or Eva Kane, who had been the love interest who inspired a man to murder his wife and bury her in a cellar. Another possibility is that someone is Evelyn Hope, the daughter of Eva Kane. Shortly afterwards, Poirot discovers the murder weapon, a sugar hammer, left around in plain sight at his boarding house and accessible to all the suspects. In an attempt to flush out the murderer, Poirot claims to know more than <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>and</b> is nearly pushed under an oncoming train. Poirot decides to show most of the suspects the photos at a party. Mrs Upward claims to have seen the photo of Lily Gamboll, but does not say where.|$|E
500|$|Frank confronts Lester and {{attempts}} to kiss him; Lester rebuffs the colonel, who tearfully flees. Carolyn puts the gun in her handbag, shouting, [...] "I refuse to be a victim!" [...] Lester finds a distraught Angela sitting alone in their darkened living room; she asks him to tell her she is beautiful. <b>He</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> they kiss.|$|E
500|$|Steve Coogan was the directors' {{first choice}} to play Beale, {{although}} the film's producers wanted to cast another English actor. McGehee and Siegel felt Coogan was {{suited to the}} role because [...] "no matter what awful things <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>and</b> says, somehow there's something sympathetic about him". Joanna Vanderham, the last actor to be cast in the film, secured her role two weeks before production started after talking with McGehee, Siegel and Kaufman on Skype from Glasgow.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{before he}} left that place, he thought {{that he would have}} just one more look at the {{beautiful}} figure. So <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> gazed and gazed until his heart melted away within him like a lump of butter; and, hardly knowing what <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>he</b> stooped <b>and</b> kissed the lips.|$|R
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> {{in a month}} {{had added}} a new {{language}} to the five he already possessed.|$|R

500|$|According to Ben Rosen, by pricing the ZX81 so low, [...] "Sinclair {{has opened}} up a {{completely}} new market among people who had never previously considered owning a computer." [...] Clive Sinclair acknowledged the role that guesswork had played in his decision to launch the ZX81 on such a large scale: [...] "It was a surmise that {{the man in the}} street would want such a computer. <b>He</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> our information {{is that a lot of}} people are using the machines avidly." [...] A New Scientist retrospective published in 1986 commented: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Gilmour and Mason {{decided to}} revisit {{recordings}} made with Wright, mainly during the Division Bell sessions, {{to create a}} new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new parts and [...] "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the album as a tribute to Wright: [...] "I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>and</b> how his playing {{was at the heart of}} the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was." ...|$|E
500|$|Feller again led {{the majors}} in wins (25), strikeouts (260), innings pitched (343), and walks (194) for the 1941 season. His six shutouts were an AL-best on the season. That year, Joe DiMaggio talked about Feller's {{pitching}} ability, stating [...] "I don't think anyone {{is ever going}} to throw a ball faster than <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>And</b> his curveball isn't human." [...] Feller appeared in the May 12, 1941, edition of Life, which said: [...] "...he is unquestionably the idol of several generations of Americans, ranging in age from 7 to 70. They represent of city, town, and village in the land, speak of him familiarly as 'Bob', and talk about him by the hour, with enthusiasm." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{remembered her}} and she saw that <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> this somehow {{promoted}} an illogical sense of acquaintance with him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will make}} myself a fire,' he thought, <b>and</b> thus <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> by and bye a smooth brown head peered {{at him from}} the water, and a long body {{followed}} it.|$|R
60|$|So I said it again, and he {{said his}} again, and I said mine again, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> then I <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> <b>and</b> we kept on <b>doing</b> it, <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> it, <b>and</b> I never had such a good time, {{and he said}} the same. In my opinion there isn't {{anything}} that is as killing as one of those dear old ripe pensioners {{if you know how to}} snatch it out in a kind of a fresh sort of original way.|$|R
500|$|Four filmed {{scenes from}} [...] "Do-Over" [...] were cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scenes were {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the first scene, Jack Donaghy plans to seduce Kathy so that he can get his old job back. The next scene, after Jack tells Liz he plans on reclaiming his former job back, Liz asks him how {{he will be able to}} get inside the 30 Rock building, as he does not have his employee ID card. Jack tells her you can do anything if you walk with confidence, which <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> is permitted inside. Liz tries to do the same, but the guard asks her for ID, which she shows. In the third scene, Liz and Bev talk to NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer). Kenneth is fascinated with the adoption process, and says that his own mother worked two jobs as an animal control person for the state and selling meats door-to-door. The final scene, Liz introduces Bev to Tracy in the [...] "do over".|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Lita and Kane lasted until the May 16 episode of Raw, when Lita turned on Kane, by helping Edge defeat {{him in the}} finals of the Raw Gold Rush Tournament, while also revealing she had been faking her knee injury. This made Lita become a villain {{for the first and}} only time in her career. On the May 30 episode of Raw, Lita announced that she had filed for divorce, and said things such as Kane was like a 4th grader in the bedroom, that she would not have to deal with things such as his sweaty body, the [...] "stupid little" [...] laugh <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> the wedding ring being flushed down a toilet. She then attempted to marry Edge on the June 20 episode of Raw, but the marriage ceremony was interrupted by a vengeful Kane, who emerged from beneath the ring, destroyed the ceremony, and as Edge and Lita escaped from the ring, Kane tombstoned their priest. The storyline with Kane ended shortly thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Later, Vince and Peggy visit a {{local record}} store {{to check out}} Vince's new single, but they are shocked to {{discover}} that the Geneva Records manager gave the song to Mickey Alba, who recorded and released the song himself, thereby stealing Vince's song. Outraged, Vince storms into the label's office and confronts the manager, violently slapping him around. To avoid making the same mistake twice, Vince suggests that he and Peggy should form their own label. They do, naming the new label Laurel Records and hiring an attorney, Mr. Shores (Vaughn Taylor), to oversee their business. Vince then records [...] "Treat Me Nice" [...] and begins pitching it, but it is universally rejected. Peggy convinces her friend, disc jockey Teddy Talbot (Dean Jones), to air the song. <b>He</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> it becomes an immediate hit. Later that evening, Vince asks Peggy out to celebrate the success of his new single, but is disappointed when he learns that she has accepted a dinner date for that evening with Teddy.|$|E

500|$|Weir's {{loan from}} Sunderland was {{extended}} until January 2011, with Mills commenting: [...] "He's a fit lad who's totally committed in what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>and</b> I've been impressed with him". Mills {{was named the}} Conference Premier Manager of the Month for November 2010 after leading York to a seven-match unbeaten run, while Michael Ingham picked up the Player of the Month award after keeping six clean sheets and conceding one goal in this period. York were knocked out of the FA Trophy {{in the first round}} after being beaten 1–0 by Conference North team Boston United, which was the team's first home defeat under Mills. Racchi's contract with York expired, although Mills stated his intention to re-sign him once the January 2011 transfer window opened. York's away match with Luton was abandoned after 55 minutes due to heavy snow, with the score at the time being 0–0. Sangaré agreed to sign for Moroccan Botola champions Wydad Casablanca pending the expiry of his York contract at the end of December 2010, although after the transfer fell through he signed for Oxford. McDermott and Racchi agreed to sign new contracts with York once the January 2011 transfer window opened, which would keep them at the club {{until the end of the}} season. Having failed to establish a place in the team under Mills, Gash agreed to join Rushden in January 2011 on loan for the rest of the season.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002 came India in Slow Motion, {{written in}} {{collaboration}} with Gillian Wright and published by Viking. Reviewing the book in The Observer, Michael Holland wrote of Tully that [...] "Few foreigners manage to get under {{the skin of the}} world's biggest democracy the way <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> fewer still can write about it with the clarity and insight he brings to all his work." ...|$|E

He's not even conscious of what <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> it made him nervous for {{me to try to}} articulate what I was trying to do. And I sensed that immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, 'Shut up, I don't want to hear about it.' He didn't want me to tell him about it, you know. He wanted to make fun of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paul claims {{several times}} that believers are saved by Divine grace, and that believers are {{therefore}} [...] "not under law, but under grace". The Epistle of James, in contrast, claims that Christians are to obey the [...] "whole law", that [...] "a person is justified by what <b>he</b> <b>does</b> <b>and</b> not by faith alone", and that [...] "faith without works is dead". Protestants, with their belief in salvation by faith alone, have had difficulty reconciling these contradictory views. Martin Luther, for example, asserted that the Epistle of James might be a forgery, and relegated it to an appendix in his Bible (although he later accepted its canonicity - see Antilegomena).|$|E
2500|$|There is, however, {{one more}} loose end to tie up. Present at the tournament is Organate, the {{daughter}} of the King of Sidon who has been waiting for Sir Eglamour for fifteen years. But since Sir Eglamour has won Christabel in marriage, what better outcome than for Sir Degarébel, Sir Eglamour’s son, to marry Organate? <b>He</b> <b>does,</b> <b>and</b> the celebrations are truly joyous. They all return to Artois and the old earl falls from his tower in terror at the sight of them, and is killed. [...] The love of Eglamour and Christabel, though presented as classical courtly love, ends in marriage and children -- a deviation from the original formulation of courtly love that grew common in romances of this era.|$|E
