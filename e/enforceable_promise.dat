40|$|This essay {{highlights}} {{a phenomenon}} that {{has no place in}} the conventional theory of sophisticated business contracts: the term that makes no sense as an <b>enforceable</b> <b>promise,</b> one that defies functional explanation, one that drafters blush to rationalize in retrospect or chalk up to honest mistake. The subset of contract drafters who stop and think about the term before the contract is signed know that it has little enforcement or other instrumental value. Even if a court were to enforce such a term, its interpretation would be extremely hard to predict at signing. Nevertheless, such clauses get included in contracts between sophisticated parties. Why? The authors speculate that some terms are in business contracts because the process of formalizing certain feelings about the parties’ relationship in an official and routine manner characteristic of business contracting provides value to the parties. They suggest that such value is, at least in part, the satisfaction of expressing their feelings publicly and formally. The authors introduce the concept of “feel-good formalism” to describe the impulse to express feelings in contract terms, with limited or no regard for the terms’ instrumental utility...|$|E
40|$|Our legal system, {{like every}} other, limits {{the power of}} {{individuals}} to enlist {{the state in the}} enforcement of their private agreements. In a broad sense, all limitations of this sort restrict the contractual freedom of those involved by depriving them of the right to decide whether their voluntary arrangements shall be legally binding. Many of these limitations are intended to protect the interests of third parties, including the general interests of society at large: Two neighbors cannot make an enforceable contract to rob a third, nor can a group of businessmen negotiate a price-fixing agreement that will be binding as a matter of law. Other restraints on contractual freedom, however, are primarily intended to protect those whose freedom they restrict. Restraints of this sort aim to protect people from themselves by limiting their capacity to make enforceable agreements of various kinds. In general, any legal rule that prohibits an action on the ground that it would be contrary to the actor 2 ̆ 7 s own welfare is paternalistic. The prohibition against suicide, the requirement that motorcyclists wear helmets, laws that restrict the use of drugs or make education compulsory are all examples of legal paternalism. In this Article, I shall be concerned with one branch of this wide and heterogeneous family of legal rules—those that may properly be regarded as belonging to the law of contracts because the liberty they restrict is the liberty to bind oneself by making a legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>promise...</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{expectation}} damages {{is to put}} the non-breaching party in the position it would have occupied had the contract been fulfilled. Expectation damages can be contrasted to reliance damages and restitution damages, which are remedies that address other types of interests of parties involved in <b>enforceable</b> <b>promises.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Insurance {{contracts}} are unilateral, meaning {{that only the}} insurer makes legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>promises</b> in the contract.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{individuals}} {{to be able to}} trust that promises will be performed is central to justifying a law that renders certain <b>promises</b> <b>enforceable.</b> This Article argues that the legal enforcement of certain promises to meet this need does not necessarily diminish the personal relationships of trust in which such promises are made, as has been argued. Rather, this Article argues, the making and performance of legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>promises</b> can assist individuals in building relationships of trust, as it assists them in the pursuit of myriad goods...|$|R
40|$|<b>Enforceable</b> <b>promises</b> {{discourage}} lying, cheating, and stealing. Contracts that embody such promises shape institutions, distribute power, {{and organize}} markets. The Smith-King critique of elite empirical contracts scholarship reveals a field {{preoccupied with the}} first set of functions and barely interested in the second. I am loath to second-guess this view without empirical evidence of my own. Instead, I draw from it two sets of implications-one for the substantive study of contracts, the other for the relationship between contract theory and contract empiricism...|$|R
2500|$|Contract law {{concerns}} <b>enforceable</b> <b>promises,</b> and can {{be summed}} up in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept). In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: offer and acceptance, consideration and the intention to create legal relations. In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get £100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an invitation to treat, mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a reasonable man Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, [...] "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the [...] "distinct inconvenience" [...] of using a faulty product. [...] "Read the advertisement how you will, and twist it about as you will", said Lord Justice Lindley, [...] "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".|$|R
40|$|An {{enforceable}} undertaking is a <b>promise</b> <b>enforceable</b> in court. In it, {{the alleged}} offender, {{known as the}} promisor, promises the regulator (for {{the purpose of this}} article the Australian Securities and Investments Commission) to do or not to do certain actions. The result achieved through an enforceable undertaking reflects the compromise that is reached by the parties involved. However, the alleged breach that has led to an enforceable undertaking may have affected a number of people who are not necessarily involved in the negotiation of the undertaking. Accordingly, this paper considers any impact that an enforceable undertaking may have on third parties...|$|R
40|$|Covenants {{and ground}} leases have been, and {{continue}} to be, used to create shared spaces that are fundamentally, and often invidiously, exclusive. Famously made a dead letter {{in the case of}} Shelley v. Kraemer, covenants banning resale to nonwhite households put the force of law behind the segregated birth of America’s suburbs. Today, gated residential communities and shopping malls assure a degree of class exclusivity through covenants and commercial ground leases, respectively. These same legal mechanisms, however, are now deployed to assure long-term inclusion as well. Developers of affordable housing are creating homes that are not only beneficial to the original homeowners but also available for future generations of qualified home buyers. When selling the newly developed homes, they are having subsidized homeowners promise to pass the good deals on to future home buyers. These resale restrictions allow single-family homes to be sold, and later resold, to low and moderate-income households in neighborhoods that would otherwise be unavailable to them. Affordability protections of 15 years or less are relatively common and can be achieved through a number of legal arrangements. Common law and statutory hostility to long-term private arrangements that limit alienability, however, have made the search for perpetual affordability more challenging. Those seeking to sustain economic diversity in residential communities over multiple generations of homeowners have turned to covenants authorized by statute and ground leases as the vehicles by which these promises can be enforced. As stand-alone <b>enforceable</b> <b>promises</b> that run with land, covenants have become the primary vehicle for Inclusionary Zoning programs that seek to preserve the mixed-income nature of affected for-profit housing developments for the long haul. Community Land Trusts have generally preferred the ground lease, a standard device for shopping mall creation, to ensure that subsidized single-family homes developed by nonprofit housing organizations can remain affordable forever. As economic diversity in communities is given its proper place as a long-term goal for America’s metropolitan areas, 21 st century real estate law will need to integrate both covenants and ground lease reversion interests as stable, effective means of enforcing affordability-preserving resale restrictions. In addition to arguing for the importance of both covenants and ground leases as affordability conservation mechanisms, this article will analyze and evaluate each device as to its effectiveness in achieving the development goal of creating and sustaining economically diverse communities of choice...|$|R
40|$|An {{enforceable}} undertaking is a <b>promise</b> <b>enforceable</b> in court. The alleged offender, {{known as}} the promisor, promises the regulator (for {{the purpose of this}} article, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission) to do or not to do certain actions. As an administrative sanction, an enforceable undertaking aims to protect the public, prevent similar breaches from occurring in the future and implement corrective action in the case where the alleged breach affected outsiders. Such aims are desirable, because an undertaking may not only impact the alleged offender but it also has a positive effect on the victim of the alleged breach and the community they live in. Accordingly, this article looks at the notion of restorative justice to assess whether an enforceable undertaking can be restorative in nature...|$|R
5000|$|In its {{traditional}} form, consideration is expressed as {{the requirement that}} in order for parties to be able to enforce a promise, they must have given something for it (quid pro quo): something must be given or promised in exchange or return for the promise. A contract must be [...] "met with" [...] or [...] "supported by" [...] consideration to be enforceable; also, only a person who has provided consideration can enforce a contract. In other words, if an arrangement consists of a promise which is not supported by consideration, then the arrangement is not a legally <b>enforceable</b> contract. Mutual <b>promises</b> constitute consideration for each other. ("I promise you to do X, in consideration for which you promise me to do Y").|$|R
40|$|This Article {{offers a}} novel {{interpretation}} of contract law, which I call “contract as empowerment. ” On this view, contract law {{is neither a}} mere mechanism to promote efficiency, as many economists suggest, nor a mere reflection of any familiar moral norm—such as norms of promise keeping, property, or corrective justice. Contract law is instead a mechanism of empowerment: it empowers people to use legally <b>enforceable</b> <b>promises</b> as tools to influence other people’s actions and thereby to meet {{a broad range of}} human needs and interests. It also empowers people in a special way, which reflects a moral ideal of equal respect for persons. This fact explains why contract law can produce genuine legal obligations and is not just a system of coercion. This Article introduces contract as empowerment and argues that it offers a theory of contract with distinctive advantages over the alternatives. Contract as empowerment is an interpretive theory: it is simultaneously descriptive, explaining what contract law is, and normative, explaining what contract law should be. To establish the theory’s interpretive credentials, this Article identifies a core set of doctrines and puzzles that are particularly well suited to testing competing interpretations of contract law. It argues that contract as empowerment is uniquely capable of harmonizing this entire constellation of doctrines while explaining the legally obligating force of contracts. Along the way, contract as empowerment offers (1) a more penetrating account of the expectation damages remedy than exists in the current literature, (2) a more compelling account of the consideration requirement, and (3) a concrete framework to determine the appropriate role of certain doctrines—like unconscionability—that appear to limit freedom of contract. The whole of this explanation is greater {{than the sum of its}} parts. Because of its harmonizing power, contract as empowerment demonstrates how a broad range of seemingly incompatible surface values in modern contract law can work together— each serving its own distinctive but partial role—to serve a more fundamental principle that is distinctive to contract law. These surface values include the values of fidelity, autonomy, liberty, efficiency, fairness, trust, reliance, and assurance. Although many people think that contract law must involve trade-offs between these values, contract as empowerment suggests that surface tensions between them are not always fundamental or real. So long as the complex system of rules that govern contracts is fashioned in the right way, these doctrines can work together to serve a deeper and normatively satisfying principle that is distinctive to contract. This framework can therefore be used to guide legal reform and identify places in which market regulation is warranted by the principles of contract in many different contexts of exchange—from those involving consumer goods to labor, finance, credit, landlord-tenant arrangements, home mortgages, and many others...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the use of enforceable undertakings in Australian {{occupational health and safety}} (OHS) regulation. <b>Enforceable</b> undertakings are <b>promises</b> by persons alleged to have breached their regulatory obligations to do something, which if not done, is enforceable in court. Enforceable undertakings potentially have an important responsive and restorative role to play a regulatory enforcement strategy to ensure compliance with OHS statutes, and have been used in other areas of business regulation, including trade practices, financial, prudential, consumer, civil aviation, environmental and communications and media regulation. The article then reports on a study of the operation of enforceable undertakings in Queensland to enforce compliance with OHS obligations. We conclude that this early experience of enforceable undertakings in Queensland provides useful guidance as to how the enforceable undertaking provisions might best be implemented and preliminary evidence of the complexities of their likely effectiveness in OHS regulation.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} what seem to be basic principles in contract law: 2 ̆ 2 consideration need not be adequate 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 the rule against penalties applies only to sums payable on breach. 2 ̆ 2 The 2 ̆ 7 reluctant inspiration 2 ̆ 7 lies in the recent Australian case of Andrews v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, which establishes {{that the absence of}} breach or an obligation to avoid the occurrence of an event upon which a sum becomes payable, does not render such sum incapable of being characterized as a penalty. This decision constitutes an unexpected divergence from the position in most other common law jurisdictions. What are its practical implications? Should we even engage in historical arguments given that the penalty jurisdiction evolved at the time where the law did not recognize <b>enforceable</b> <b>promises</b> to perform? The paper commences with broad observations regarding the enforceability of liquidated damages clauses, the increasingly commercial approach to evaluating whether a pre-estimate of loss is 2 ̆ 2 genuine 2 ̆ 2 and the necessity to treat sums payable on breach as part of the commercial bargain. The more liberal the attitude with regards to the amount (i. e. the higher the sum that can be stipulated), the more limited the effect of the rule against penalties. A liberal approach does not affect the contract breaker’s ability to invoke the rule but his ability to succeed. In combination with the description of the performance, the price and the limitation of liability (if any), sums payable on breach often point towards a transaction-specific risk allocation. In many instances such sums come dangerously close to primary obligations. And courts do not, as a matter of principle, review primary obligations. Once this is acknowledged, it becomes even more difficult to justify any attempts to expand the scope of the penalty jurisdiction beyond payments triggered by breach. After confronting some of the historical arguments made by the court in Andrews, the paper analyzes the recurring attempts to extend judicial review of contractual payments by creating 2 ̆ 2 hybrid stipulations 2 ̆ 2 – sums that are neither payable on breach nor in return for contractual performance. A difficult theoretical exercise awaits: should we create artificial divisions between contractual payments to establish whether they can be reviewed? Or should we finally acknowledge that all sums payable under a contract are part of the commercial bargain? On one hand, doctrinal integrity may point towards the need to vigorously defend the present form of the rule against penalties, including its (seemingly) strict limitation to sums payable on breach. On the other, some arguments made in Andrews and in other recent cases highlight the theoretical inconsistencies of its current formulation. After all, the 2 ̆ 2 breach/no breach 2 ̆ 2 dichotomy can also be regarded as a device for avoiding judicial scrutiny. At present, on the basis of Andrews alone it appears incorrect to use an institution that prohibits deterrence from breach to review the commercial substance of contracts. The rule against penalties reflects the general equitable principle not to enforce oppressive or unconscionable transactions. It does not reform commercially imprudent transactions. Given its exceptional nature, the penalty jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly – even with regards to sums payable on breach. Once sums payable on breach are regarded as part of commercial bargain, it is more difficult to subject them to review. If, however, payment is unrelated to the breach of a contractual promise, it comes dangerously close to being a contractual promise. Any review seems unacceptable...|$|R
5000|$|Consideration in English law {{is one of}} {{the four}} main {{building}} blocks of a contract. Consideration can be anything of value (such as an item or service), which each party to a legally binding contract must agree to exchange if the contract is to be valid.

In its traditional form, expressed as the requirement that in order for parties to be able to enforce a promise, they must have given something for it (quid pro quo): something must be given or promised in exchange or return for the promise. A contract must be [...] "met with" [...] or [...] "supported by" [...] consideration to be enforceable; also, only a person who has provided consideration can enforce a contract.
