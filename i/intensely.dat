5|$|The editing of Jaws {{has been}} <b>intensely</b> studied for over thirty years.|$|E
5|$|After the event, Dumoulin {{said that}} he {{prepared}} at altitude for the race and that he produced a hard physical effort on the uphill section and went less <b>intensely</b> on the flatter parts.|$|E
5|$|Cadence-lypso was {{influenced}} by nationalist movement that espoused Rastafari and Black Power. Many groups performed songs with <b>intensely</b> ideological positions, {{and much of the}} repertoire was in the vernacular Creole language.|$|E
5|$|Corals' {{many colors}} give it appeal for {{necklaces}} and other jewelry. <b>Intensely</b> red coral is prized as a gemstone. Sometimes called fire coral, {{it is not}} the same as fire coral. Red coral is very rare because of overharvesting.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} the 1932–33 pre-season training <b>intensely</b> by himself (as opposed to playing golf with his teammates), Mather selected Matthews in 15 games, enough to earn {{him in a}} winners medal after Stoke were crowned Second Division champions, one point ahead of Tottenham Hotspur. On 4 March 1933 he scored his first senior goal in a 3–1 win over local rivals Port Vale at The Old Recreation Ground.|$|E
5|$|At {{the heart}} of this epic, Lee relays another {{personal}} story that impacts <b>intensely,</b> especially as the song breaks during the bridge and her voice takes flight like never before. Lyrics like 'Somewhere beyond the pain there must be a way to believe' sear and soar, as Lee continues to hypnotize like no other singer in rock or pop for that matter.|$|E
5|$|Booth's stage {{performances}} were often characterized by his contemporaries as acrobatic and <b>intensely</b> physical, with him leaping upon {{the stage and}} gesturing with passion. He was an excellent swordsman, although a fellow actor once recalled that Booth occasionally cut himself with his own sword.|$|E
5|$|Chromium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. The name of the element {{is derived from the}} Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are <b>intensely</b> colored.|$|E
5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being <b>intensely</b> urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent growing public concern has prompted the severe restriction of further land reclamation from Victoria Harbour. Awareness of the environment is growing as Hong Kong suffers from increasing pollution compounded by its geography and tall buildings. Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E
5|$|Gedi {{is one of}} many medieval Swahili-Arab coastal {{settlements}} {{that stretch}} from Mogadishu, Somalia to the Zambezi River in Mozambique. There are 116 known Swahili sites stretching from southern Somalia to Vumba Kuu at the Kenya-Tanzania border. Since the rediscovery of the Gedi ruins by colonialists the 1920s, Gedi {{has been one of the}} most <b>intensely</b> excavated and studied of those sites, along with Shanga, Manda, Ungwana, Kilwa, and the Comoros.|$|E
5|$|Lawton {{continued}} to train his heading skills <b>intensely</b> {{in the summer}} of 1936, and also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club as a batsman in the Lancashire League. He scored a six against both Learie Constantine and Amar Singh. He scored 369 runs in 15 completed innings for an average of 24.06.|$|E
5|$|Modzelewski {{qualified}} {{this view}} by stressing the greatly {{limited access to}} impartial information. Society was <b>intensely</b> indoctrinated at the official level, while families at home, to protect their youth, refrained from criticizing the regime or discussing issues that were deemed not safe.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the breed}} first became commercial, it {{has spread to}} Canada and become a major {{contributor}} in the commercial lamb industry. The breed adapts well to confinement and is readily used in accelerated crossbreeding programs. Polled Dorsets thrive under grass-based and feedlot conditions and are more suitable on small farms that are <b>intensely</b> managed.|$|E
5|$|The mule, {{especially}} its fur, was <b>intensely</b> textured and detailed {{to make it}} look visually rough and bristly, and the mule itself weary and worn. The same techniques were applied to the red and yellow adornments draped and hung over the animal.|$|E
5|$|A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush is a 1958 book by the English travel writer Eric Newby. It is an autobiographical {{account of}} his adventures in the Hindu Kush, around the Nuristan {{mountains}} of Afghanistan, ostensibly {{to make the first}} mountaineering ascent of Mir Samir. It {{has been described as a}} comic masterpiece, <b>intensely</b> English, and understated. Publications including The Guardian and The Telegraph list it among the greatest travel books of all time. It has sold over 500,000 copies in paperback.|$|E
5|$|Antarctica is <b>intensely</b> {{cold and}} arid. Most of the world's {{freshwater}} ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat {{is the loss}} of large sections of the Larsen Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula. The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} she {{completed}} Italian Food, Lehmann's publishing firm had been closed down by its parent company, and David found herself under contract to Macdonald, another imprint within the same group. She <b>intensely</b> disliked the company and wrote a most unflattering portrait {{of it in a}} 1985 article. Disliking the approach to her books that the company took, she left Macdonald and signed a contract with the publisher Museum Press for her next book, Summer Cooking, which was published in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{managed the}} first tour of Trial by Jury, which {{stopped at the}} Theatre Royal in Dublin, Ireland, in September 1875. While there, he met a young Scottish actress, Susan Couper Black, who used the stage name Helen Lenoir. She became fascinated by his vision for {{establishing}} a company to promote English comic opera and gave up her next engagement to join his theatrical organisation as his secretary. Well-educated, with an organisational ability, business acumen, focus on detail and diplomatic skills that surpassed even Carte's, Lenoir gradually became <b>intensely</b> involved {{in all of his}} business affairs. Carte and Lenoir married in 1888, three years {{after the death of his}} first wife.|$|E
5|$|Christiaan Persoon first {{described}} Boletus calopus in 1801. Modern molecular phylogenetics {{showed that it}} was only distantly related to the type species of Boletus and required placement in a new genus; Caloboletus was erected in 2014, with C.calopus designated as the type species. Although Caloboletus calopus is not typically considered edible due to an <b>intensely</b> bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe. Its red stipe distinguishes it from edible species, such as Boletus edulis.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Hayes {{was elected}} {{president}} {{in one of the}} most contentious elections in national history. He lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel J. Tilden but he won an <b>intensely</b> disputed electoral college vote after a Congressional commission awarded him twenty contested electoral votes. The result was the Compromise of 1877, in which the Democrats acquiesced to Hayes's election and Hayes withdrew remaining U.S. troops protecting Republican office holders in the South.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{on his way}} {{to visit}} his wife at the cottage where she was cared for by a devoted couple, Richardson crashed his motor-bike and was in {{hospital}} for several weeks. Kit was at that point mobile enough to visit him, but later in the year her condition worsened and in October she died. He was <b>intensely</b> lonely, though the comradeship of naval life was some comfort. In 1944 he married again. His second wife was the actress Meriel Forbes, a member of the Forbes-Robertson theatrical family. The marriage brought him lifelong happiness and a son, Charles (1945–98), who became a television stage manager.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Disney {{produced}} Mary Poppins, {{based on}} the book series by P. L. Travers; he had been trying to acquire the rights to the story since the 1940s. It became the most successful Disney film of the 1960s, although Travers disliked the film <b>intensely</b> and regretted having sold the rights. The same year he also became involved in plans to expand the California Institute of the Arts (colloquially called CalArts), and had an architect draw up blueprints for a new building.|$|E
5|$|Later that night, two {{teenagers}} {{get into a}} fight in the woods. The girl, named Maggie (Jillian Bach), runs into the woods to be alone and Kevin (Angelo Vacco), her boyfriend, gives chase. However, he is attacked and his heart is removed. Meanwhile, the writer <b>intensely</b> transcribes the event on his typewriter. The next day, Mulder and Scully discuss this latest incident via phone. An unmarked envelope is discovered by Scully in the office containing a milagro, a type of pendant. While she examines the pendant, a voice-over from the writer describes Scully's most intimate feelings as she examines the unsolicited gift.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to <b>intensely</b> dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E
5|$|Mateiu Caragiale {{died two}} years later in Bucharest, at the age 51, after {{suffering}} a stroke. Despite his explicit wish and opposition from his widow, speeches were held at his funeral ceremony, including ones by Alexandru Rosetti and Adrian Maniu. Rosetti and Eugen Lovinescu later recounted an unusual incident sparked by the event: Iancu Vulturescu, a friend of Caragiale's and frequenter of Casa Capșa, looked <b>intensely</b> upon the dead body as he was paying his respects; later in the evening, he committed suicide in a hotel room.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1880, Wyatt {{testified that}} White's {{shooting}} was accidental. Brocius expressed regret, {{saying he had}} not intended to shoot White. Gunsmith Jacob Gruber testified that Curly Bill's single-action revolver was defective, allowing it to be discharged at half-cock. A statement from White before he died was introduced stating that the shooting was accidental. The judge ruled that the shooting was accidental and released Brocius. Brocius, however, remained <b>intensely</b> angry about how Wyatt had pistol-whipped him and became an enemy to the Earps. Virgil was also appointed acting town marshal of Tombstone.|$|E
5|$|Portrayed by Rob Lowe, Chris Traeger {{begins the}} show as an auditor working for the Indiana state {{government}} in Indianapolis, but eventually becomes the acting city manager of Pawnee, the fictional Indiana city where Parks and Recreation is set. Originally from Wisconsin, he is an excessively positive and optimistic person, who is constantly upbeat and extremely energetic. As a baby, Chris {{was diagnosed with a}} rare blood disorder and was not expected to live longer than three weeks, but miraculously survived. As a result, he sees every day he is alive as a gift, which results in his <b>intensely</b> cheerful and enthusiastic personality. He has a stepbrother who lives in London.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction is {{generally}} by allogamy (cross-pollination) and Hippeastrum may be propagated by seed or offset bulbils (bulblets), although commercial ventures use in vitro techniques, or splitting of the bulb into sections. The genus has been <b>intensely</b> bred and cultivated {{since the early}} nineteenth century to produce large colourful showy flowers. In temperate climes these can be placed outside in the summer, and after a dormancy period, be induced to rebloom inside in the winter.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine {{emperors}} {{appealed to}} the West for help, but the Pope would only consider sending aid {{in return for a}} reunion of the Eastern Orthodox Church with the See of Rome. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by imperial decree, but the Orthodox citizenry and clergy <b>intensely</b> resented the authority of Rome and the Latin Rite. Some Western troops arrived to bolster the Christian defence of Constantinople, but most Western rulers, distracted by their own affairs, did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart the remaining Byzantine territories.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left {{the city for the}} country. It was an <b>intensely</b> hot day, which further reduced the number of people {{prepared}} to suffer the discomfort of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} role {{of copper}} has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually {{the shape and}} look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until {{the time of the}} Industrial Revolution; the provinces most <b>intensely</b> mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of another key social fact: the culture. Groups, when interacting, {{create their own}} culture and attach powerful emotions to it. He {{was one of the}} first scholars to consider the question of culture so <b>intensely.</b> Durkheim was interested in cultural diversity, and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails to destroy a society. To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the law.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{oxidation}} states of manganese are +2, +3, +4, +6, and +7, though all oxidation states from −3 to +7 have been observed. Mn2+ often competes with Mg2+ in biological systems. Manganese compounds where manganese is in oxidation state +7, which are mostly {{restricted to the}} unstable oxide Mn2O7, compounds of the <b>intensely</b> purple permanganate anion MnO4−, and a few oxyhalides (MnO3F and MnO3Cl), are powerful oxidizing agents. Compounds with oxidation states +5 (blue) and +6 (green) are strong oxidizing agents and are vulnerable to disproportionation.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the morning}} Hurricane Gustav {{continued}} to rapidly strengthen. Deep convection around the eye flared <b>intensely</b> and the hurricane's minimum central pressure dropped precipitously—24mbar (0.71inHg) in 24hours. By 1000UTC it had reached Category3 strength {{and continued to}} strengthen. Another drop in pressure–down 11mbar (0.32inHg) in 6hours to 954mbar (28.17inHg)–was quickly followed {{by an increase in}} wind speed to , making Hurricane Gustav a Category4 hurricane when it had been a mere tropical storm only 24 hours earlier. That afternoon, as Hurricane Gustav continued moving northwest towards Cuba, its western eyewall passed directly over the Isle of Youth.|$|E
5|$|Various {{evolutionary}} ideas {{had already}} been proposed to explain new findings in biology. There was growing support for such ideas among dissident anatomists and the general public, but {{during the first half}} of the 19th century the English scientific establishment was closely tied to the Church of England, while science was part of natural theology. Ideas about the transmutation of species were controversial as they conflicted with the beliefs that species were unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy and that humans were unique, unrelated to other animals. The political and theological implications were <b>intensely</b> debated, but transmutation was not accepted by the scientific mainstream.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} study {{resulted}} in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and <b>intensely</b> lobby MDSHA to expand US113 to four lanes. MDSHA responded in 1995 by initiating the US113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E
