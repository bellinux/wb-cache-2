Histologically, SAF tumorsare unencapsulated, mostly located in the dermis or subcutis, andcomposed of spindled and stellate-shaped cells with random, loosestoriform and fascicular growth patterns. The stromal component ofthe tumor was Alcian blue-positive. The tumor cells were mostly immunopositivefor CD 34, vimentin, and CD 99; often immunopositivefor EMA; and immunonegative for S- 100, HMB- 45, SMA, desmin, andkeratin. There have been 19 reports of 149 SAF cases in the Englishlanguage literature.

40|$|Lameness {{has been}} {{incorrectly}} labeled as a “cow {{and not a}} sow” concern, and this has possibly arisen due {{to the majority of}} sows being far more stationary over their productive lifetime compared to dairy cows. Therefore, the objectives of this study were record hoof lesion frequency, proportion, type and severity from sows housed in gestation stalls during a one month period. A total of 30 sows were used (Yorkshire [n = 3], Duroc [n = 14] and Yorkshire x Duroc crosses [n = 13]). All sows were individually housed in stalls that had concrete flooring and manure fell into a holding pit. Sows were feed at 0600 h once a day a commercially available ground feed. Caretakers observed all sows twice daily, at 0600 h and 1600 h. Hoof lesion and severity was scored (medial and lateral toes, dew claws and the sole) and recorded once a week by a single observer using the <b>FeetFirst</b> lesion scoring guide produced by the FeetFirst™ Team. Lesion severity was scored as, one (mild), two (moderate) and three (severe) which occurred on any anatomical area of the hoof (toes, dew claw, heel and sole). Lesion severity scores was reported numerically (actual number of hooves involved) and presented as a proportion {{of the total number of}} hooves in the study. Lesion type was defined as toe growth, dew claw, heel overgrowth and erosion, heel sole crack, white line, cracked wall horizontal and cracked wall vertical (FeetFirst™ Team, 2009). Lesion type was reported numerically (actual number of hooves) and presented as a frequency and proportion of the total number of hooves in the study. On average, 50. 8...|$|E
