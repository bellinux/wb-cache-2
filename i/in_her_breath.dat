60|$|Virginia drew <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and looked}} at the Colonel in amazement.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him quickly. There was a little catch <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|She heard, and, falling {{backwards}} in fear, drew <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to shriek aloud.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, Honain, what's this? 'Twould seem I {{am really}} joyful. There's {{inspiration}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> very <b>breath.</b> I am another being. Nay! waste not kisses on those ugly fetters.' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{walked by}} his side <b>in</b> silence. <b>Her</b> <b>breath</b> was coming a little quicker, her fingers lay passive in his. Then {{for a moment he}} felt the grip of them almost burn into his flesh. Still she said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|At last {{our patient}} stirred faintly, as <b>in</b> a dream; <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> faltered. We bent over her. Was it death, {{or was she}} {{beginning}} to recover? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{know what}} they're about, if ever people did,' murmured Miss Nipper, drawing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> 'oh! trust them Skettleses for that!' ...|$|E
60|$|When he came {{to dinner}} the next week and spread out his sketch on the living-room table Maude drew <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The girl's {{forefinger}} twirled rapidly {{the loop}} of braid {{that it had}} previously been twirling slowly, and drawing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> she said, 'No, sir.' ...|$|E
60|$|His {{face was}} guilty, however, {{as if his}} hand had been caught in a money-bag, and I {{wondered}} what had enticed the lad to my books. I was still standing pondering when Leeby ran up the stair; she was so active that she generally ran, and she grudged the time lost <b>in</b> recovering <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
60|$|People {{hurried out}} then as though their one desire was {{to escape from}} the scene of the tragedy. Lady Cynthia, still {{clinging}} to Francis' arm, led him to the furthermost corner of the launch. There were real tears <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eyes, <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> was coming <b>in</b> little sobs.|$|R
50|$|The wand {{given to}} Alora {{transforms}} into a spear, and the Princess pierces the dragon's heart. As the dragon dies, Freyja collapses and confides <b>in</b> <b>her</b> dying <b>breath</b> that Alora was her daughter. Reinforcements of dark elves arrive but concede victory and {{allegiance to the}} Princess as she brandishes the spear aloft in triumph.|$|R
6000|$|Twice {{she drew}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> to speak, {{and the whole}} table laid its {{collective}} knife and fork down to listen. All she said was: ...|$|E
60|$|Not so Juanita. Her {{black eyes}} snapped {{suddenly}} with suspicion, she drew <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> {{and closed her}} little mouth firmly. Then she began a crescendo.|$|E
60|$|Elsa's eyes danced. She drew <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> softly. Betty {{looked at}} her in silence for a moment. The wistful {{expression}} was back on her face.|$|E
60|$|The forest grew thicker as they advanced, {{and after}} walking {{for half an}} hour Madame Duchesne {{declared}} that it was impossible for her to go farther. Nat was indeed surprised that she had held on for so long. She had been leaning on his arm, and he felt the weight becoming heavier and heavier every step. She was bathed <b>in</b> perspiration, <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> came <b>in</b> gasps, and he himself proposed a halt, feeling that she {{was at the end of}} her strength.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes--I need you." [...] He {{took her}} hands, he felt them tremble <b>in</b> his, <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> came quickly, but her gaze was so intent as {{seemingly}} to penetrate to {{the depths of}} him. And despite his man's amazement at her hesitation {{now that he had}} offered her his all, he was moved, disturbed, ashamed as he had never been in his life. At length, when he could stand no longer the suspense of this inquisition, he stammered out: [...] "I want you to be my wife." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bazra - This Queen of Robbers is {{the ruler}} of the Island of Mikos and its Treasure Fortress, where she hoards stolen objects of great magical value. Bazra is first seen as short and round, wearing a {{dazzling}} pink crown, furry pink robe, and pink shoes. Later, when she reveals her true self, she's anything but cute. Her cheeks shrivel {{as if she had}} sucked <b>in</b> all <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>her</b> skin turns the color of ash, and her eyes dwindle to shifty black dots in a sea of red. She becomes as gray as a ghost. The first time we actually see <b>her</b> is <b>in</b> Book 23, The Fortress of the Treasure Queen.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] {{said the}} young farmer, opening {{her eyes and}} drawing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> for an outburst. Joseph Poorgrass retired a few steps behind a hurdle.|$|E
60|$|She {{stopped with}} a quick catch <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> and the {{darkness}} round them seemed to become luminous with the light of hope that broke upon him within.|$|E
6000|$|We are all {{so happy}} now, my dear Miss Floy!' says Susan, with a {{suspicious}} catching <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b> 'You, you won't {{be angry with}} me now. Now will you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He wakes--from {{forth the}} prison [...] We sing Osiris risen, [...] We sing {{the child that}} Nout {{conceived}} and bare. [...] Thine own love, Isis, waits [...] The Warden of the Gates, [...] She breathes the breath of Life on breast and hair, [...] And <b>in</b> <b>her</b> breast and <b>breath</b> [...] Behold! he waketh, [...] Behold! at length he riseth out of rest; [...] Touched with her holy hands, [...] The Lord of all the Lands, [...] He stirs, he rises from <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>her</b> breast! [...] But thou, fell Typhon, fly, [...] The judgment day drawn nigh, [...] Fleet on thy track as flame speeds Horus from the sky." ...|$|R
50|$|Danny {{becomes a}} corrupt {{contractor}} who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes {{to visit him}} at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses {{on top of the}} mother, killing <b>her.</b> <b>In</b> <b>her</b> dying <b>breath,</b> she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love.|$|R
50|$|On {{the very}} {{night of the}} old zamindar’s long-awaited death, Bhikni is called over to meet Bhimdata from the {{neighbouring}} village. As Shanichari bids adieu to Lakshman Singh, who plans to leave the village after his father's death, a messenger comes from Bhimdata. The messenger tells her of Bhikni's untimely death due to the plague, and of how <b>in</b> <b>her</b> dying <b>breath</b> she had asked Shanichari to be informed of how she was actually Peewli, her mother. This unleashes Shanichari’s pent-up emotions and transforms her, too, into a rudaali.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I could," [...] she said, drawing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath,</b> {{with the}} eagerness of a thirsty person while {{mimicking}} {{the action of}} drinking--"I wish I could--but no--I cannot--I cannot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Marie!" [...] I gasped at length; and at {{that word}} the blood rushed to her face and brow, and I saw her draw <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> as though to scream.|$|E
6000|$|Susan drew <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> with {{an amount}} of {{expression}} not easily described, further relieving her feelings with a smart cough, answered, 'Very quiet indeed, Miss Floy, no doubt. Excessive so.' ...|$|E
5000|$|At the Swan, Hurley {{requests}} {{to speak to}} Libby, and he tearfully apologizes to her for forgetting the blankets. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> dying <b>breath,</b> she says, [...] "Michael!", {{with a look of}} terror <b>in</b> <b>her</b> eyes. Jack, mistaking her horror as fear for Michael's safety, assures her that Michael is fine. Hurley starts to cry, as does Kate, Sawyer hugs Kate and she cries in his arms. Locke and Mr. Eko are seen making their way back to The Swan, as the timer starts to sound, the numbers needing to be entered into the computer; the episode ends with Michael in the armory, looking gravely toward the doorway, his plan unfolding.|$|R
5000|$|Desperate, {{the girls}} go to Morishige, their {{professor}} and an author on urban legends. Obsessed {{with the idea}} of meeting Sadako, Morishige eagerly watches the cursed videotape, although the girls are less than thrilled, as Natsumi only has one day to live. Morishige takes the girls to an exorcist in the hopes that she can save Natsumi. However, Sadako possesses Natsumi and forces Morishige, the exorcist and her two assistants to kill themselves for interfering. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> dying <b>breath,</b> the exorcist tells the girls that a man with psychic powers, Keizo Tokiwa, {{is on his way to}} help them.|$|R
50|$|Ares and {{his army}} attack Washington, D.C. Trevor and Diana arrive to battle Ares and are soon {{joined by the}} Amazons. While Ares manages even to summon the Amazons long dead from the Underworld to fight their own sisters, his scheme is stopped by Alexa, {{a member of the}} undead host, who reveals to Artemis a chant which nullifies Ares's control over them. The undead then turn on Ares but are {{destroyed}} by his powers. Hippolyta faces Persephone in combat and kills <b>her,</b> but <b>in</b> <b>her</b> dying <b>breath,</b> Persephone makes the queen realize that in shutting the Amazons away from the world of men, she has denied them the chance to live their lives as women.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh--I didn't {{think it}} was you! I didn't--Oh, Jude!" [...] A hysterical catch <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> ended in a {{succession}} of them. He advanced, but she quickly recovered and went back.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was shocked}} to hear of your accident, but it was some time ago, and you are recovering," [...] she remarked, trying to speak hopefully, but with a catch <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|E
60|$|CHLOE. My husband. [She draws <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>breath</b> {{with a long}} shudder, then seem {{to seize}} her courage in her hands] I've got to be quick. He keeps on asking--he knows there's something.|$|E
6000|$|... "And then, ah yes! {{it might}} be that she was asking my {{permission}} to throw herself from the car: that she was beseeching me to turn away my head that she might leap to the ground, and thus end her anxieties and her miseries--I might say our miseries; for if the tiger should follow her he, too, would be killed. I should be left to weep over my dearest, the joy of my life and my heart. The tiger would be dead. <b>In</b> <b>her</b> last <b>breath</b> Irene would know that I was safe. That would be like Irene, my dear Irene! But I would not suffer it. I could not speak, but I shook my head.|$|R
60|$|The child sat silently {{beneath a}} tree, hushed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> very <b>breath</b> by {{the stillness of}} the night, and all its {{attendant}} wonders. The time and place awoke reflection, and she thought with a quiet hope--less hope, perhaps, than resignation--on the past, and present, and what was yet before her. Between the old man and herself there had come a gradual separation, harder to bear than any former sorrow. Every evening, and often in the day-time too, he was absent, alone; and although she well knew where he went, and why--too well from the constant drain upon her scanty purse and from his haggard looks--he evaded all inquiry, maintained a strict reserve, and even shunned her presence.|$|R
60|$|Mara almost screamed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> ecstasy, {{but she had}} sense {{enough to}} hold <b>her</b> <b>breath.</b>|$|R
