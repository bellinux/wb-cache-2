Where the iBook required substantial disassembly to access internal components {{such as the}} hard drive, users only need to remove the battery and the RAM door to replace the MacBook drive.

5|$|Receipt of Banking Services: A Lebanese Identity Card holder {{can use the}} Lebanese Identity Card as {{identity}} verification document when opening bank account, withdrawing money from the bank or receiving money transfers in the Republic of Lebanon. It <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> a Lebanese Identity Card holder to also take loan from the bank whether you work in an identifiable institution or not. This is because their identity can be easily verified and the banks are confident {{that they can be}} traced in the event of loan default based on their PIN or biometric information stored on the Lebanese Identity Card.|$|E
5|$|Since it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> a snake's {{tongue to}} fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short {{compared to that of}} terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become very large and extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E

5|$|The {{accusations against}} Clarence, Stephen, Gull and Druitt also draw on {{cultural}} {{perceptions of a}} decadent ruling class, and depict a high-born murderer or murderers preying on lower-class victims. Because Druitt and the other upper-middle-class and aristocratic Ripper suspects were wealthy, there is more biographical material on them than on {{the residents of the}} Whitechapel slums. Consequently, it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> writers to construct solutions based on a wealthy culprit rather than one involving a Whitechapel resident. There is no direct evidence against Druitt, and since the 1970s, the number of Jack the Ripper suspects has continued to grow, with the result that there are now over 100 different theories about the Ripper's identity.|$|E
5|$|The reactivities of the {{alkali metals}} {{increase}} {{going down the}} group. This {{is the result of}} a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.|$|E

A study performed by Matter and Meier (2008) showed that women who self-reported higher prospective memory ability were more satisfied with oral contraceptive use and experienced lower stress levels.

25|$|Underarm bowling still {{plays a role}} in {{informal}} garden cricket games, {{which are}} often played by less athletic people or young children. Novices at playing the game are often unable to bowl overarm effectively or accurately, so can be allowed to bowl underarm by general consensus. Since underarm bowling is also slower than overarm, it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> novice batsmen to hit the ball, making it ideal for informal and children's cricket.|$|E
25|$|Afrikaans {{acquired}} some lexical and syntactical borrowings {{from other}} languages such as Malay, Khoisan languages, Portuguese, {{and of the}} Bantu languages, and Afrikaans has also been significantly influenced by South African English. Dutch speakers are confronted with fewer non-cognates when listening to Afrikaans {{than the other way}} round.

The boardwalk will be lowered in some spots to provide up-close encounters with the animals. The cheetah and white rhino exhibits will be reconfigured, allowing for a new hippo exhibit between them.|$|E
25|$|Bacterial {{adhesion}} to boat hulls {{serves as}} the foundation for biofouling of seagoing vessels. Once a film of bacteria forms, it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> other marine organisms such as barnacles to attach. Such fouling can reduce maximum vessel speed by up to 20%, prolonging voyages and consuming fuel. Time in dry dock for refitting and repainting reduces the productivity of shipping assets, and the useful life of ships is also reduced due to corrosion and mechanical removal (scraping) of marine organisms from ships' hulls.|$|E
25|$|Doctors {{wishing to}} pursue a {{speciality}} must take entrance exams at the public/private institution of their choice that offers them. It <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> students in private Medical Schools to obtain a residency in a Private Hospital, especially when the university has its own hospital, as the university holds positions specifically for its graduates. Speciality courses last about two to five years, depending on the branch of medicine the physician has chosen. There is no legal limit {{for the number of}} specialities a doctor can learn, although most doctors choose to do one and then they sub-specialise for further job opportunities and less overall competition, along with higher wages.|$|E

25|$|Many astronomers {{request that}} nearby {{communities}} use low pressure sodium lights or amber Aluminium gallium indium phosphide LED {{as much as}} possible, because the principal wavelength emitted is comparably easy to work around or in rare cases filter out. The low cost of operating sodium lights is another feature. In 1980, for example, San Jose, California, replaced all street lamps with low pressure sodium lamps, whose light <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> nearby Lick Observatory to filter out. Similar programs are now in place in Arizona and Hawaii. Such yellow light sources also have significantly less visual skyglow impact, so reduce visual sky brightness and improve star visibility for everyone.|$|E
25|$|Both {{languages}} are still largely mutually intelligible, although this relation can in some fields (such as lexicon, spelling and grammar) be asymmetric, as it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> Dutch speakers to understand written Afrikaans {{than it is}} for Afrikaans speakers to understand written Dutch. Afrikaans is grammatically far less complex than Dutch, and vocabulary items are generally altered in a clearly patterned manner, e.g. vogel becomes voël ("bird") and regen becomes reën ("rain"). In South Africa, the number of students following Dutch at university is difficult to estimate, since the academic study of Afrikaans inevitably includes the study of Dutch. Elsewhere in the world, the number of people learning Dutch is relatively small.|$|E
25|$|For {{a dog to}} be {{considered}} for a Police Department, they must first pass a basic obedience training course. They must be able to obey the commands of their handler without hesitation. This allows the officer to have complete control over how much force the dog should use against a suspect. Dogs trained in Europe are usually given commands in the country's native language. Dogs are initially trained with this language for basic behavior, so, it <b>is</b> <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> the officer to learn new words/commands, rather than retraining the dog to new commands. This is contrary to the popular belief that Police Dogs are trained in a different language so that a suspect cannot command the dog against the officer.|$|E
