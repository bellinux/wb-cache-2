This paper proposes a novel method for estimating the <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> consumption of a processor. The method models <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> as the output of a linear system excited by a signal comprised of the total current due to each instruction. System identification is performed by cross-correlation of a pseudo-random stimulus with the measured current. The method was applied to the Texas Instruments TMS 320 VC 5510 DSP and was found to provide an average correlation of 93 % between estimated and measured <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> across a range of benchmarks...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a FinFET base 8 T Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cell. FinFETs also promise to improve the difficult performance report power of compromise. FinFET {{can be used to}} reduce the leakage current and power of leakage.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{investigated}} the peak <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> {{characteristics of the}} flux-lock type superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) with two magnetically coupled circuits. The flux-lock type SFCL with two magnetically coupled circuits has the similar fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics to the flux-lock type SFCL using its third winding. The <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> operation of the SFCL is performed by the generation of the magnetic flux between two coils when a fault happens and the fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics of the SFCL are dependent on the winding direction of two coils. To confirm it, the peak <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> characteristics of this SFCL were analyzed based on its electrical equivalent circuit and the fault limiting characteristics of this SFCL were investigated through the fault <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> experiment. Through the analysis on the short-circuit results, it was shown that the <b>limited</b> fault <b>current</b> could be adjusted by the winding direction of two coils...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>current</b> {{variations}} in FPGA or microprocessors are major characteristics for analyzing noise {{in a power}} delivery network (PDN). Direct measurement of FPGA <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> variation {{is a very difficult}} problem, and is less studied than other PDN design questions. In this paper, a methodology to model the FPGA <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> waveform and its spectrum is developed and presented. Implementation of an impedance transfer function allows predicting noise at a remote point on the PCB. Using modeling results, the noise waveform and spectrum in the PDN on the PCB is estimated. Measurements at the remote point on the PCB help evaluate the proposed methodology and show a good correlation between theory and experiments. This research demonstrates also the implementation of a <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> modeling methodology for PDN analysis and PCB decoupling design.

40|$|The switched-current technique, a {{recently}} developed circuit approach to analog signal processing, {{has emerged as}} an alternative/compliment to the well established switched-capacitor circuit technique. High speed switched-current circuits offer potential cost and power savings over slower switched-capacitor circuits. Accuracy improvements are a primary concern {{at this stage in}} the development of the switched-current technique. Use of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> mirror has produced circuits that are insensitive to transistor matching errors. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> mirror has been limited by other sources of error including clock-feedthrough and voltage transient errors. In this paper we present an improved switched-current building block using the <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> mirror. Utilizing current feedback the errors due to current imbalance in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> mirror are reduced. Simulations indicate that this feedback can reduce total harmonic distortion by as much as 9 dB. Additionally, we have developed a clock-feedthrough reduction scheme for which simulations reveal a potential 10 dB total harmonic distortion improvement. The clock-feedthrough reduction scheme also significantly reduces offset errors and allows for cancellation with a constant current source. Experimental results confirm the simulated improvements...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Clock-feedthrough effects, channel-length {{modulation}} and device mismatch are {{the main}} causes of the inaccuracy of Switched-Current (SI) circuits. In this paper, these non-ideal effects are analyzed. A high-performance current mirror, namely regulated cascode current mirror, which eliminates drain voltage variation problem is introduced. By using this current mirror as a basic memory cell, a clock-feedthrough cancellation circuit is developed, which ideally solves the clock-feedthrough and drain voltage variation problems. A fifth-order SI lowpass Chebyshev ladder filter is built using the proposed cancellation circuit and implemented in a two-micron P-well standard digital CMOS process by MOSIS. Another emerging technique, <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> mirrors or current copiers, is introduced.

50|$|Further, {{this power}} {{dissipation}} will remain {{as long as}} the overload exists, which means that the devices must be capable of withstanding it for a substantial period.

40|$|The {{combined}} radial-axial {{magnetic bearing}} (CRAMB) with permanent magnet creating bias flux {{can reduce the}} size, cost, and mass and save energy of the magnetic bearing. The CRAMB have three-degree-of-freedom control ability, so its structure and magnetic circuits are more complicated compared {{to those of the}} axial magnetic bearing (AMB) or radial magnetic bearing (RMB). And the eddy currents have a fundamental impact on the dynamic performance of the CRAMB. The dynamic stiffness model and its cross coupling problems between different degrees of freedom affected for the CRAMB are proposed in this paper. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> stiffness and the dynamic displacement stiffness models of the CRAMB are deduced by using the method of equivalent magnetic circuit including eddy current effect, but the <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> stiffness of the RMB unit is approximately equal to its static current stiffness. The analytical results of an example show that the bandwidth of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> stiffness of the AMB unit and the dynamic displacement stiffness of the CRAMB is affected by the time-varying control currents or air gap, respectively. And the <b>dynamic</b> <b>current</b> stiffness and the dynamic displacement stiffness between the AMB unit and the RMB unit are decoupled due to few coupling coefficients...|$|R

40|$|Keywords:hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse, arc trigger, {{fault current}} limiter, current density Abstract. With {{conventional}} high voltage <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse, the rated current is usually below 200 A. The rated current {{of the state}} of the art arc triggering hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse is only 600 A, with its interrupting capability being 25 kA, and still can’t meet the requirements of modern industrial application. With the arc triggering hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuses, the major obstacle to higher rated current and interrupting capability lies in the long operation time of the arc trigger. Increasing the current density of arc trigger notches can effectively improve the operation speed of the trigger. Simulation and parameter optimization of the arc trigger are conducted by using ANSYS 11. 0 to attain the optimal fuse element structure. In this study, the notch current density of the arc trigger was as high as 3300 A/mm 2, and the trigger can be used in the hybrid <b>current</b> <b>limiting</b> fuse of rated 35 kV, 2 kA and 40 kA interrupting capability...|$|R
