50|$|Alternatively, a <b>grapple</b> <b>fork</b> {{may be used}} to {{lift and}} {{transport}} large round bales. The <b>grapple</b> <b>fork</b> is a hydraulically driven implement attached {{to the end of a}} tractor's bucket loader. When the hydraulic cylinder is extended, the fork clamps downward toward the bucket, much like a closing hand. To move a large round bale, the tractor approaches the bale from the side and places the bucket underneath the bale. The fork is then clamped down across the top of the bale, and the bucket is lifted with the bale in tow. Grab hooks installed on the bucket of a tractor are another tool used to handle round bales, and be done by a farmer with welding skills by welding two hooks and a heavy chain to the outside top of a tractor front loader bucket.|$|E

2500|$|The boat is {{a unique}} find that was {{measured}} at [...] by [...] and weighed [...] It had benches, rowlocks, two rows of nine oars and a paddle rudder for steering. It also included tools for <b>grappling,</b> three <b>forks,</b> a yardarm and a spear. The tools are of much lighter design than the ship's hull and are shown in the illustration. The boat suggests that the hoard was a votive deposit to the Celtic sea god Manann√°n mac Lir.|$|R
5000|$|Midway Stock Farm Barn is a {{historic}} building located north of Keosauqua, Iowa, United States. The barn was built by William A. Barker around 1880. It gained historical significance when his son Webb installed equipment made by the Louden Machinery Company of Fairfield, Iowa. [...] By doing so he converted the facility from one that raised livestock to a dairy operation. Around 1918 Barker built an addition onto {{the south side of}} the barn and installed a litter carrier with tracks and switches on the ground floor, a hay carrier with a steel track and <b>grapple</b> hook hay <b>fork</b> also on the main floor, and a metal aerator on the roof. It is one of few local operations that still has the Louden equipment. [...] The barn was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{excavator}} is {{used for}} not only civil engineering but also building demolition, scrap recycling and so on. The reason is thought {{that it has a}} general-purpose power supply system and is able to move by itself. In other words, it could be considered a kind of high-powered robot. As a whole, it consists of several modules. Divided roughly by each function, power module such as an engine and pumps, working module such as front structures and hydraulic actuators, traveling module such as crawlers or wheels, operation module such as control levers and pedals. In this time, to gather and carry lots of objectives in scrap yard or somewhere, both a <b>fork</b> <b>grapple</b> and a loader bucket are equipped as a working module. And to carry the objectives quickly to destination, wheeled traveling system is equipped. As a result, we have produced a multi-functional handling machine which has double front attachments and wheels. Then if operators cooperate the modules effectively, {{they will be able to}} handle their work more efficiently...|$|R
