5|$|Stevenage {{started the}} season poorly, losing 3 {{out of their}} first 4 games and conceding 13 goals in the process, {{including}} a 5–0 loss to Wrexham {{on the first day}} of the season. The club secured its first victory under Westley in late August 2008, a 3–1 win away at Barrow, before winning four games on the bounce in September. However, through the first half of the club's 2008–09 campaign, Westley's side were suffering from the same inconsistency that was common in his first spell as manager of the Hertfordshire side, losing three games on the trot in November – the last of which was a 2–1 home defeat to Wrexham, it was to be Stevenage's last defeat at Broadhall Way in the league for 18 months. Westley brought in former player, Dino Maamria as first-team coach at the club. This, coupled with important signings during the campaign, such as Chris <b>Day,</b> <b>Mark</b> Roberts, and Jon Ashton, meant that Stevenage witnessed an up-turn in form halfway through the campaign. A 24-game unbeaten run stretching from December 2008 to April 2009, as well as winning crucial games towards the latter stages of the season, ultimately meant that Westley's men made the Conference Premier play-offs, finishing in the last play-off place. Despite taking a 3–1 lead into the second leg, Stevenage lost 4–3 overall on aggregate to Cambridge United. Westley did, however, enjoy success in the FA Trophy when he led the side out at Wembley Stadium in front of 27,102 as Stevenage beat York City 2–0 in the Final. The win was Westley's first taste of success as manager of Stevenage. After the game, it was announced that Westley was to stay on as manager for another year.|$|E

25|$|On {{the first}} day of this match at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, Glamorgan scored runs at nearly six an over as David Hemp (120), Matthew Maynard (105) and Ian Thomas (133) all making centuries. They {{continued}} on the second day, adding 87 for the last three wickets to end with a total of 603, until Cardiff UCCE finally dismissed them - before they were bowled out for 152 in reply, spinner Dean Cosker taking three for 13. However, Glamorgan chose not to enforce the follow-on and elected for more batting practice. By close of play they were 134 for no loss. On the third and final <b>day,</b> <b>Mark</b> Wallace and Jonathan Hughes both completed their centuries, making 117 and 109 (retired hurt) respectively. Glamorgan eventually declared on 381 for 3 after 28 third-day oers, leaving Cardiff UCCE an impossible 833 to win - before Andrew Davies nipped out a wicket after five minutes. After Simon Jones got another, and Cardiff UCCE were 57 for 2, Rhodri Lloyd and Simon Butler got together for three hours, {{until the end of the}} match. When Lloyd was out for 102, Butler was on 104, and the game ended in a draw.|$|E

25|$|Later that year, {{following}} {{the example of}} a friend Joe Wallace (Jason Rush) who had told his parents about being gay and HIV-positive, Mark decides to tell his parents. By now, he is dating Rachel Kominski (Jacquetta May), who advises him not to but Mark is tired of the pretence. On Boxing <b>Day</b> <b>Mark</b> tells Pauline and Arthur that he is HIV-positive. They sit in stunned silence while he scatters helpful leaflets around the house and then goes away for a while. On his return, he faces Pauline's irrational terror and Arthur's hostility. Arthur's ignorance is apparent initially as he fears that Mark will pass HIV on to him; he even bleaches everything Mark touches to avoid infection. Pauline and Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully) are understandably distraught but help Arthur to understand the illness, and are a huge support to Mark. Mark's relationship with Rachel ends, and the animosity at home send Mark back to his girlfriend Gill, who moves to London and becomes seriously ill. Gill's HIV has already progressed into AIDS and her deterioration is rapid. She is diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and goes into a hospice. Mark realises that he is in love with her and asks her to marry him. Mark and Gill marry, and their honeymoon consists of one night in a hotel, before Gill returns to the hospice and dies.|$|E

2500|$|Around Valentine's <b>Day,</b> <b>Mark</b> {{tells the}} {{audience}} that Roger and Mimi have been living together, but they are tentative with each other. It is also told that Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest, and during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne's controlling behavior and Joanne criticizes Maureen's promiscuous mannerisms. They break up dramatically coming up with an ultimatum ("Take Me or Leave Me"). Time speeds on to spring ("Seasons of Love B"), but Roger and Mimi's relationship is strained by Mimi's escalating heroin usage and Roger's lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS ("Without You"). By {{the end of the}} summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline ("Voice Mail #4"). A dance is performed representing all the couples' sex lives ("Contact"). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories with Collins being the last to reminisce ("I'll Cover You [...] "). Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer ("Halloween"). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and between Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group shares a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will be breaking up. Everyone leaves except Mark and Roger, and so Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York. Roger, unable to handle Mimi's declining health, becomes angry with Mark and leaves. Mimi returns to say goodbye, overhears everything Roger says, and, terrified, agrees to go to rehab ("Goodbye Love"). Collins is forcibly removed from the church for being unable to pay for Angel's funeral. Benny shows compassion by paying, causing him and Collins to recuperate their old friendship.|$|E

60|$|The next <b>day</b> <b>Mark</b> {{established}} himself at an inn in Peckham, and {{for six weeks}} made diligent inquiries, but without success. There were {{at least a dozen}} men who lived quietly and rode or drove to their business in town. Many of them were put aside as needing no investigation, having been residents there for years. Some of the others he saw start or return, but none of them corresponded in any way with the probable appearance of the man for whom he was in search. During this time he heard of several private coaches being held up on the road between Epsom and London, and three burglaries took place at Streatham.|$|E
60|$|About {{the middle}} of the <b>day,</b> <b>Mark</b> ran the beat {{alongside}} of the Reef, at the usual landing, and welcomed Bridget to his and her home, with a kiss. Everything was in its place, and a glance sufficed to show that no human foot had been there, during the weeks of his absence. Kitty was browsing on the Summit, and no spaniel could have played more antics than she did, {{at the sight of her}} master. At first, Mark had thought of transferring this gentle and playful young goat to the Peak, and to place her in the little flock collected there; but he had been induced to change his mind, by recollecting how much she contributed to the beauty of the Summit, by keeping down the grass. He had therefore brought her a companion, which had no sooner been landed on the Reef, than it bounded off to make acquaintance with the stranger on the elevation.|$|E

[...] These last words he spoke looking back over his shoulder as he stood up in his stirrups, for he had caught the eye of the huntsman, who was surrounded by his bounds, and was now trotting on to join him. During a great portion of the <b>day,</b> <b>Mark</b> found himself riding by the side of Mrs. Proudie, as that lady leaned back in her carriage. And Mrs. Proudie smiled on him graciously, though her daughter would not do so. Mrs. Proudie was fond of having an attendant clergyman; and as it was evident that Mr. Robarts lived among nice people--titled dowagers, members of Parliament, and people of that sort--she was quite willing to install him as a sort of honorary chaplain pro tem.|$|E

6000|$|The very <b>day</b> <b>Mark</b> {{first saw}} the ocean he was sixteen years old. He had got his height, five feet eleven, and was strong for his years, and active. In fact, {{it would not have}} been easy to find a lad every way so well adapted to his new calling, as young Mark Woolston. The three years of his college life, if they had not made him a Newton, or a Bacon, had done him no harm, filling his mind with the germs of ideas that were destined {{afterwards}} to become extremely useful to him. The young man was already, indeed, a sort of factotum, being clever and handy at so many things and in so many different ways, as early to attract the attention of the officers. Long before the vessel reached the capes, he was at home in her, from her truck to her keelson, and Captain Crutchely remarked to his chief mate, the day they got to sea, that [...] "young Mark Woolston was likely to turn up a trump." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{business}} of securing the ship occupied nearly two days, {{and was not}} got through with until about {{the middle of the}} afternoon of the second day. It was Saturday, and Mark had determined to make a good beginning, and keep all their Sabbaths, in future, as holy times, set apart for the special service of the Creator. He had been born and educated an Episcopalian, but Bob claimed to be a Quaker, and what was more he was a little stiff in some of his notions on the opinion of his sect. The part of New Jersey in which Betts was born, had many persons of this religious persuasion, and he was not only born, but, in one sense, educated in their midst; though the early age at which he went to sea had very much unsettled his practice, much the most material part of the tenets of these good persons. When the two knocked off work, Saturday afternoon, therefore, it was with an understanding that the next day was to be one of rest in the sense of Christians, and, from that time henceforth, that the Sabbath was to be kept as a holy <b>day.</b> <b>Mark</b> had ever been inclined to soberness of thought on such subjects. His early engagement to Bridget had kept him from falling into the ways of most mariners, and, time and again, had a future state of being been the subject of discourse between him and his betrothed. As the seasons of adversity are those in which men are the most apt to bethink them of their duties to God, it is not at all surprising that one of this disposition, thus situated, felt renewed demands on his gratitude and repentance.|$|E
