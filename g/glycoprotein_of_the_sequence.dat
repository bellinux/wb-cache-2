40|$|<b>The</b> <b>sequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BamHI L {{fragment}} of B 95 - 8 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA has been determined. <b>The</b> transcription starts <b>of</b> five promoters have been mapped to this fragment, using S 1 mapping and either {{in vitro transcription}} or the primer extension technique. Dramatically increased levels of cytoplasmic poly(A) + RNAs, transcribed from these promoters, occur after treatment of B 95 - 8 cells with 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate (TPA).

40|$|PURPOSE: Complete oocyte lysis in {{in vitro}} {{fertilization}} (IVF) is a rare event, but one against which we remain helpless. <b>The</b> recurrence <b>of</b> this phenomenon in some women in each of their IVF attempts, regardless of treatment, together with <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> animal experiments led us to investigate <b>the</b> possible involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genes encoding for the glycoproteins constituting the zona pellucida (ZP). PATIENTS & METHODS: Over the last ten years, during which we treated over 500 women each year, three women suffered recurrent oocyte lysis during their IVF attempts in our Centre for Reproductive Biology. For {{each of these three}} cases, we <b>sequenced</b> <b>the</b> four genes and promoter <b>sequences</b> encoding <b>the</b> <b>glycoproteins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ZP. <b>The</b> <b>sequence</b> variations likely to cause a change in protein expression or structure, were investigated in a control group of 35 women who underwent IVF without oocyte lysis and with normal rates of fertilization. RESULTS & CONCLUSION: We found no mutations in <b>the</b> ZP genes <b>sequenced.</b> Only some polymorphisms present in the control group and in the general population were detected, excluding their specific involvement in the phenotype observed. Thus, although we suspected that complete oocyte lysis was due to a genetic cause, it did not seem possible to directly incriminate the genes encoding <b>the</b> proteins <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ZP in the observed phenotype. Further study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genes involved in the processing and organization <b>of</b> ZP <b>glycoproteins</b> may allow elucidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanism underlying recurrent oocyte lysis during {{in vitro fertilization}}...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> genomic RNA <b>of</b> pestiviruses is {{translated}} into a large polyprotein that is cleaved into a number <b>of</b> proteins. <b>The</b> structural proteins are N terminal in this polyprotein and include three glycoproteins called E 0, E 1, and E 2 on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{order in which they}} appear in the polyprotein. Using pulse-chase experiments, we show that a pestiviral glycoprotein precursor, E 012, is formed that is processed into E 0, E 1, and E 2 in an ordered fashion. Processing is initiated by a nascent cleavage between the capsid and the translocated E 012 followed by cleavage at <b>the</b> C terminus <b>of</b> E 2. E 012 is then rapidly cleaved to form E 01 and E 2. After E 2 is released from the precursor, E 01 is processed into E 0 and E 1.
