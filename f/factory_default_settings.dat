Some commentators argue that those who set up access points without enabling security measures are offering their connection to the community. Many people intentionally leave their networks open to allow neighbours casual access, with some joining wireless community networks to share bandwidth freely. It has largely become good etiquette to leave access points open for others to use, just as someone expects to find open access points while on the road.|$|E

The four smaller buttons are at each corner of the writing area and have the following default functions: Clock (clock icon) brings up the Date and Time briefly, then reverts to the current program, Contrast (Circle icon: half black, half white) allows the user to adjust the contrast and brightness of the display, Keyboard (ABC Icon) brings up an on-screen keyboard that allowed the user to [...] "type" [...] using the stylus, Number Board (123 icon) brings up the keypad on-screen keyboard which is used in much the same way as the letters keyboard.|$|E
40|$|Hewlett Packard {{recently}} released a new security patch to fix an authentication bypass vulnerability in specific network printers. The Enterprise Security Office is using {{this opportunity to}} remind agencies {{of the importance of}} securing network printers in general. Network printers are frequently overlooked when securing office networks; sometimes left with default configurations and not patched, they represent a risk to the office network environment. Network based printers are much more than just a print device. They typically have full operating systems, hard drives, and a full complement of communication services. Built-in services such as ftp, tftp, e-mail, web server, and snmp are increasingly the target of choice for hackers wanting to remain undetected and to gain a foothold in the office network. Because network printer devices are frequently left unsecured with default passwords and utilizing <b>factory</b> <b>default</b> <b>settings</b> they are easy targets. Example attacks against printers include bridging between networks (i. e wireless to LAN or vice-versa), sniffing network traffic to steal sensitive data, redirection and spoofing of network traffic, malware distribution and email spam generation. Applicable Devices: All network printing devices, multifunction copiers, and network based fax machines...|$|E

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) has gained significant {{popularity in the}} imaging {{of the head and}} neck region eliciting the need for DRLs for CBCT examinations. The main objective of the study was to collect dose data for the establishment of indication-based national DRLs for CBCT examinations {{of the head and neck}} region in Finland as well as to form proposals for the prospective DRLs. In addition, examination frequencies, the use of optimised imaging parameters and the effect of manufacturer and model of the CBCT device on dose were studied. The study was conducted as a nation-wide dose survey among the Finnish facilities conducting CBCT examinations of the head and neck region. The response rate was 56 % in terms of registered devices and 57 % in terms of listed places of use. DRL proposals were made for seven indications. The values for the proposals were derived from the 75 th percentile values of the indication-specific dose distributions. Very wide dose ranges were observed within all seven indications. The most common indication was pre-surgical imaging of implant treatments. A significant portion of the respondents had used <b>default</b> <b>factory</b> <b>settings</b> instead of optimising the imaging parameters. No particular manufacturer or device model stood out as producing exceptionally high or low doses regardless of the user. The Finnish DRLs for CBCT examinations will be issued based on the results of this study...|$|R
