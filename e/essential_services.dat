5|$|In {{common with}} the other main island chains of Scotland {{many of the more}} remote islands were {{abandoned}} during the 19th and 20th centuries, in some cases after continuous habitation since prehistoric times. These places had been perceived as relatively self-sufficient agricultural economies, but both island residents and outsiders later came to consider that the more remote islands lacked the <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> of a modern industrial economy.|$|E

5|$|Although St. Lucia {{suffered}} {{significant damage}} to its residential structures and agricultural land, its airports and hotels were operational within days having needed only small-scale repair work. Hospitals and other <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> kept running on standby power supplied by independent generators {{to assist in}} the cleanup and recovery efforts. Roads connecting the north and south of the island were quickly cleared. LUCELEC, the nation's only electricity provider, worked around the clock to repair dozens of downed electrical poles and restored electricity by August 21. The rest of the island's infrastructure weathered the storm. Two shelters were opened for hurricane-affected residence, and USAID/OFDA provided US$40,432 of assistance to the island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the event, the Société de Transport de la Communauté Urbaine De Montréal (STCUM) {{announced}} that they would held strikes over pension fund contributions during the Grand Prix weekend. STCUM chose those dates due to the event's high-profile status as public transport was classified as an essential service over the weekend. It would also result in the road leading to the circuit being blocked off to spectators. STCUM appeared before <b>Essential</b> <b>Services</b> Council on 9 June to discuss producing a contingency plan to ensure spectators would attend the Grand Prix with full services running. An agreement was reached on 13 June with 60% of transport workers voting in favour of improved pay and pension, allowing the race to go unaffected.|$|E
5|$|In {{those areas}} which the Red Army had {{captured}} {{and before the}} fighting in {{the centre of the}} city had stopped, the Soviet authorities took measures to start restoring <b>essential</b> <b>services.</b> Almost all transport {{in and out of the}} city had been rendered inoperative, and bombed-out sewers had contaminated the city's water supplies. The Soviet authorities appointed local Germans to head each city block, and organised the cleaning-up. The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city. Most Germans, both soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens which began on Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's orders. After the capitulation the Soviets went house to house, arresting and imprisoning anyone in a uniform including firemen and railwaymen.|$|E

40|$|LLM (Labour Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 In South Africa {{teachers}} are currently allowed to strike. This leads to numerous problems, as learners are left without an educator and their Constitutional right to basic education is infringed upon. This {{has an impact}} on university acceptance and impairs the socio-economic growth in the country, especially when taking into account the history of prejudice as regards education in South Africa. This dissertation considers whether or not education should be declared as an <b>essential</b> <b>service</b> in terms of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995, as sectors declared as such are not awarded the right to strike. In order to determine whether education should be designated as an <b>essential</b> <b>service,</b> the right to strike and the right to education as enshrined in the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, have to be balanced or weighed up against each other. By declaring education as an <b>essential</b> <b>service</b> it will ensure that the latter right is more adequately realised, in turn having a positive impact on the development of South Africa. In declaring education an <b>essential</b> <b>service,</b> educators will not be left without remedy as other remedies (which do not impair the rights of learners) do indeed exist and will be available to said educators in accordance with relevant legislation and provisions.

5|$|Though {{the exact}} extent of losses was unclear, the {{earthquake}} caused further damage to many structures in Christchurch; {{approximately half of}} the buildings in the centre of the city were already damaged or destroyed by previous strong earthquakes. Preliminary assessments indicate over 100 additional buildings were rendered beyond repair in the area. Despite its moderate magnitude, the preceding magnitude 5.6 ML tremor caused several two-story buildings at a road intersection in the city to collapse. Multiple hospitals and residential care facilities in Christchurch were left without <b>essential</b> <b>services,</b> and some reported considerable damage to infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|On 3February, {{the head}} of the State Emergency Service (SES) and then-Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen toured {{northern}} Queensland to inspect damage. The government of Australia vowed to assist by providing financial and emergency services, also offering to provide aid to banana and sugar cane farmers who suffered losses as a result of Winifred. Two government helicopters were sent shortly thereafter, assessing the severity of damage, evacuating residents, and delivering food. Bjelke-Petersen later expressed anger at the federal government for having increased the threshold for disaster relief before raising loans, and also stated that the Federal Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, had no right to accompany him on his visit to northern Queensland, only offering to discuss an offer provided that the federal government was willing to provide financial assistance. Approximately 500volunteers for the SES were deployed the same day, reinstating electrical and other <b>essential</b> <b>services,</b> evacuating regional citizens, delivering bread to numerous towns, and sending 700tarpaulins to shield roofless houses. Rescue and relief work was hindered by high traffic on telephone networks, forcing Telecom to cease calls between Townsville and Ingham.|$|E
5|$|The Internal Security Act allows {{persons to}} be {{detained}} without trial for acting {{in any manner}} prejudicial {{to the security of}} Malaysia or to the maintenance of its <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> or economic life. It is authorized by Article 149 of the Malaysian Constitution, which stipulates that if an Act recites that action has been taken or threatened by any substantial body of persons, whether inside or outside the Federation in respect of certain situations – including organized violence against persons or property, the excitement of disaffection against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong or the government, or the promotion of feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population likely to cause violence – then any provision of that law designed to stop or prevent that action is valid notwithstanding that it is inconsistent with certain articles of the Constitution guaranteeing fundamental liberties. Upon Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965, the island republic retained both the Internal Security Act and Article 149 of the Constitution in its statute book.|$|E

5|$|Despite the ruthlessness and {{determination}} of the supporters of the coup, the rebels failed to take any major cities with the critical exception of Seville which provided a landing point for Franco’s African troops. The primarily conservative and Catholic areas of Old Castile and León fell quickly, and in Pamplona they celebrated the uprising {{as if it were}} a festival. The government retained control of Málaga, Jaén and Almería. Cadiz was taken for the rebels with the help of the first troops from the Army of Africa. In Madrid they were hemmed into the Montaña barracks. The barracks fell the next day, with much bloodshed. Republican leader Santiago Casares Quiroga was replaced by José Giral who ordered the distribution of weapons among the civilian population. This facilitated the defeat of the army insurrection in the main industrial centres, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and other main cities in the Mediterranean area, but it allowed the anarchists to arm themselves and take control of Barcelona and large swathes of Aragon and Catalonia. In Barcelona, the official government lost control of security, <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> and welfare. However, the anarchists held back from demanding too much political power, which could have had even more serious consequences. General Goded surrendered in Barcelona and was later condemned to death, despite broadcasting a message explaining his captivity over the radio at the request of the authorities.|$|E
5|$|In early 1942, he {{was posted}} {{overseas}} to Malaya (former name for Malaysia) with the 15th Field Regiment Royal Artillery after the Japanese had invaded Malaya and Thailand, and Pearl Harbor had been bombed. Upon their arrival, their {{fight against the}} Japanese was brutal and short-lived, and soon his battalion began retreating to Singapore. The Changi Garrison, a heavily fortified coastal defence {{where most of the}} British forces were based, consisted of three army barracks; the 2nd Battalion Gordon Highlanders in the Selarang Barracks, the Royal Engineers in Kitchener Barracks, and the 9th Coastal Artillery Regiment of the Royal Artillery in Roberts Barracks. By 12 February, the situation in Singapore was desperate and Lieutenant-General Arthur Ernest Percival, General Officer Commanding of HQ Malaya Command, ordered the Changi Garrison to withdraw to Singapore Town. After the British surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942, Stanley and Allied POWs were ordered to march to Changi for internment; the 15,000 Australians went into Selarang Barracks and the British to Roberts and Kitchener Barracks. Stanley was interned at Roberts Barracks and later joined other POWs to work around Singapore, repairing damage inflicted by the Japanese attacks and getting <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> back to working order. Percival was held in Roberts Barracks until, with all senior officers above the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, he was sent to Formosa (now Taiwan) by the Japanese. The food given to the prisoners was of poor quality and inadequate for men working as slave labour. As a result of this and the harsh treatment meted out by the Japanese guards such as the beatings and executions of escaped prisoners, the men's health and morale began to suffer in the long run.|$|E

To that end, recommendations include the further development of a professional association for religion teachers, credentialing standards, and a certification/licensing scheme...|$|R
