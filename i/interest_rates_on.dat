By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s when most of the industry had halted growth because of higher <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>on</b> loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E

The <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>on</b> loans to brokers at the stock exchange soared to 70% and, with brokers unable to get money, stock prices fell to a low not seen since December 1900.

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> household consumption. We exploit a change in Indian banking legislation, which encouraged banks to offer higher <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> deposits to citizens above sixty years. We use consumption data from the Indian National Sample Survey to calculate regression discontinuity estimates, based on age cut-offs. We find that a 50 basis point increase in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> deposits leads to an immediate decline of consumption expenditure by 12 percent. This decline is primarily in non-food, non-essential items. Estimates prior to the banking legislation show {{no significant difference in}} the consumption expenditure. (JEL E 21, E 62, H 31, D 91) The effect of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> consumption is a central concern in macroeconomics. Among many issues that are related to inter-temporal substitution, one of the most relevant from today's perspective is whether consumers can be induced to increase consumption by a reduction in <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> paid <b>on</b> deposits. In this paper we measure the causal effect of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>on</b> consumption. This has crucial implications for understanding the timing and effectiveness of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> as a policy instrument that affects consumption, savings and ultimately the growth rate of an economy...|$|R

5|$|Calvin {{thought that}} {{agriculture}} {{and the traditional}} crafts were normal human activities. With regard to trade and the financial world he was more liberal than Luther, but both were strictly opposed to usury. Calvin allowed the charging of modest <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>on</b> loans. Like the other Reformers Calvin understood work as a means through which the believers expressed their gratitude to God for their redemption in Christ and as a service to their neighbors. Everybody was obliged to work; loafing and begging were rejected. The idea that economic success was a visible sign of God's grace played only a minor role in Calvin's thinking. It became more important in later, partly secularized forms of Calvinism and became the starting-point of Max Weber's theory about the rise of capitalism.|$|E

5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM.

Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>on</b> its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement.

Investors will be indifferent to the <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>on</b> deposits in these countries due to the equilibrium resulting from the forward exchange rate. The condition allows for no arbitrage opportunities because the return on domestic deposits, 1+id, is equal to the return on foreign deposits, (1+if). If these two returns weren't equalized by the use of a forward contract, there would be a potential arbitrage opportunity in which, for example, an investor could borrow currency in the country with the lower interest rate, convert to the foreign currency at today's spot exchange rate, and invest in the foreign country with the higher interest rate.|$|E
