5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E
25|$|Bertram Copeland Rumfoord: A Harvard history professor, retired Air Force {{brigadier general}} and millionaire, who shares a {{hospital}} room with Billy and {{is interested in}} the Dresden bombing. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> a relative of Winston Niles Rumfoord, a character in Vonnegut's earlier novel, The Sirens of Titan.|$|E

25|$|Partholón {{comes from}} Bartholomaeus (Bartholomew) and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> an {{invention}} of the Christian writers, possibly being borrowed from a character of that name in the Christian pseudo-histories of Saint Jerome and Isidore. The Fomorians have been interpreted {{as a group of}} deities who represent the harmful or destructive powers of nature; personifications of chaos, darkness, death, blight and drought.|$|E
25|$|The {{standing}} {{figure is}} in typical pilgrim or travelling priest garb: waraji, a grey robe, and light-coloured leggings and arm covers. In addition, {{he wears a}} gong around his waist and carries a shakujō (錫杖) pilgrim's staff. Behind him, the body and straps of a portable shrine are just visible. Heroes and their foes disguising themselves as pilgrims is a popular kabuki motif. The character's aggressive pose—right arm removed from his robe, menacing facial expression—indicates that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> not a benign pilgrim.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{continued}} to play for Warwickshire into his late forties, and when he retired from playing {{at the age of}} 48 in 1988, he had taken 2,068 first-class wickets. The reduction in the amount of first-class cricket played means that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to remain the last man to have broken the 2,000 mark. Never much of a batsman, he made only three half-centuries in more than 800 innings, his 7,000 runs coming at an average of just 13. After retirement, Gifford went into coaching and became coach of first Sussex, and then Durham.|$|E

25|$|He scored his 212 against Canterbury in 260 minutes. He {{opened the}} batting {{on the first}} day, was 103 not out at lunch, and was fourth out not long after tea with the score at 343, on a day in which Wellington scored 494 for 9 wickets off 94 eight-ball overs. So <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to have scored at a little under a run a ball. His 204 {{a few weeks later}} was {{probably}} a little slower, but no less impressive: he came to the wicket at 18 for 1, reached his double-century in 262 minutes, and was last out in a team total of 374 off 85.1 overs.|$|E
25|$|The right {{wall of the}} {{corridor}} show the scenes {{from the life of}} the Buddha. These include Sujata offering food to the Buddha with a begging bowl in white dress, Tapussa and Bhalluka next to the Buddha after they offering wheat and honey to the Buddha as monk, the future Buddha sitting alone under a tree, and the Buddha at a ploughing festival. One mural shows Buddha's parents trying to dissuade him from becoming a monk. Another shows the Buddha at the palace surrounded by men in dhoti and women in sari as his behavior presents the four signs that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to renounce. On this side of {{the corridor}} are also paintings that show the future Buddha as a baby with sage Asita with rishi-like looks. According to Spink, some of the Cave 16 paintings were left incomplete.|$|E
25|$|James Cook {{was born}} on 7 November 1728 (N.S.) {{in the village of}} Marton in Yorkshire and baptised on 14 November (N.S.) in the parish church of St Cuthbert, where his name {{can be seen in the}} church register. He was the second of eight {{children}} of James Cook, a Scottish farm labourer from Ednam in Roxburghshire, and his locally born wife, Grace Pace, from Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at Great Ayton, where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years' schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager. For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, Roseberry Topping, enjoying the opportunity for solitude. Cooks' Cottage, his parents' last home, which <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to have visited, is now in Melbourne, Australia, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934.|$|E

500|$|Walter {{explains}} that viruses have forms of [...] "personalities," [...] that influence their hosts {{to act in}} certain ways. He posits that the virus is not airborne after all, but needs more samples for further tests. Meanwhile the infected receptionist {{is influenced by the}} virus, jumps out a window, and also scares Peter into falling into an infected pool of blood. The woman is sprayed with disinfectant spray, as Peter quickly rinses himself off. Knowing <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> infected, Peter searches through the Dutch man's pockets, leading to the discovery of a briefcase infected by the virus.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's musical biographer, Simon Leng, views [...] "Dark Horse" [...] as its {{composer}} addressing {{his critics}} {{by creating a}} [...] "new persona". [...] "This 'George' is a man {{one step ahead of}} his detractors," [...] Leng writes, [...] "triumphing with quicker feet and better gags. Commentators try to pin his character down at peril, for <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to change and take the least expected course." [...] In the song's choruses, Harrison declares himself [...] "a dark horse / Running on a dark race course", [...] "a blue moon", and a [...] "cool jerk" [...] who is [...] "Looking for the source". Leng paraphrases this self-depiction as meaning [...] "a loner" [...] and [...] "an elusive, cheeky maverick".|$|E
500|$|The Elder next {{describes}} his conflict with Diotrephes, {{who does not}} acknowledge the Elder's authority and is excommunicating those, like Gaius, who welcome missionaries sent by the Elder. The Elder mentions a previous letter which he has written to the church which was suppressed by Diotrephes, and says {{that he intends to}} visit the church and to confront Diotrephes. [...] "The church" [...] is apparently known to Gaius, but <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> not a member of it, since otherwise the Elder would not need to provide him with information about Diotrephes' activities. [...] The dispute between Diotrephes and the Elder seems to be based on church leadership and authority rather than doctrine, since the Elder does not accuse Diotrephes of teaching heresy.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1902 rugby season in May, Verge was up for {{selection}} to the University first XV, either at fullback or threequarter, and also for NSW as fullback. He took the place at fullback on the University XV from A. J. McKenzie. By June 1902, Verge was gaining recognition in the press. The Referee reported: [...] "Verge, as full back, deserves a special word of praise for quickness and all-round ability: he has steadily improved until he now may be compared with any man we have in the position. And <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to still further improve." [...] After a lacklustre performance by John Maund at fullback in the first inter-state match between NSW and Queensland, Verge gained his first cap for NSW in the return match on 19 July 1902 at University Oval, Sydney.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{comes in}} two forms; where the {{defendant}} {{claims he was}} insane {{at the time of}} the crime, and where the defendant asserts he is insane at the time of trial. In the first situation, the defendant must show that he was either suffering from a disease which damaged the functioning of the mind and led to a defect of reason that prevented him from understanding what he was doing, or that he could not tell that what he was doing was wrong. In the second situation, the test is whether or not the defendant can differentiate between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] verdicts, instruct counsel and recognise the charges he is facing. If successful, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to be detained under the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964, although judges have a wide discretion as to what to do.|$|E
500|$|Beecham {{has been}} much quoted. In 1929, {{the editor of a}} music journal wrote, [...] "The stories {{gathered}} around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable. Wherever musicians come together, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> {{to be one of the}} topics of conversation. Everyone telling a Beecham story tries to imitate his manner and his tone of voice." [...] A book, Beecham Stories, was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his bons mots and anecdotes about him. Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including Arnold Bax and Winston Churchill; Neville Cardus admitted to inventing some himself. Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, [...] "A musicologist is a man who can read music but can't hear it"; his maxim, [...] "There are only two things requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn't matter much"; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: [...] "Nothing from Mozart?" ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the plot}} of A Game of Thrones, in season 1 Jon, the bastard son of Ned Stark, joins the Night's Watch. He arrives at the Wall, with his direwolf Ghost in tow, {{to find that the}} order is a shadow of its former self. Raised to be a talented fighter with a strong sense of justice and honor, Jon is at first contemptuous of his fellow recruits, who are mostly lowborn, untrained criminals and exiles. In [...] "Lord Snow", he is persuaded by Tyrion Lannister to put aside his prejudices, and helps some of the others with their weapons training. Jon befriends Samwell Tarly, who is more an {{intellectual}} than a fighter. Jon takes his vows but is disappointed to be made steward to Lord Commander Jeor Mormont rather than a ranger in [...] "You Win or You Die". Sam points out that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> being groomed for command. Jon saves Mormont from a wight in [...] "The Pointy End", and in [...] "Baelor" [...] is given House Mormont's ancestral blade Longclaw, a sword made of Valyrian steel, in thanks. Jon learns of his father's execution for treason in [...] "Fire and Blood", and though tempted to leave the Wall to help his family, his sense of duty ultimately compels him to stay.|$|E

He inadvertently awakens some of its inhabitants, but is remotely guided to safety by Oswin. Harvey, revealed to be a Dalek puppet, attacks the Doctor and Amy. He is joined by other survivors who were also converted. The puppets steal Amy's protective bracelet just before the pair are saved by Oswin, who reunites them with Rory. Amy begins experiencing symptoms of the conversion process. The Doctor, surmising that the Daleks will destroy the planet {{as soon as he}} deactivates the force-field, plots an escape via a nearby teleporter which will transport them to the Dalek ship. Oswin agrees to deactivate the force-field in return for the Doctor coming to rescue her. Rory tries to give Amy his bracelet reasoning if loves slows the Dalek puppet conversion he will be less susceptible because he has always loved Amy more than she loves him. Amy angrily replies that she loves him equally, but divorced him because of her infertility. They realize that the Doctor had secretly slipped his bracelet onto her without telling them, since <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> immune to the nanogenes, to force them to reconcile.|$|E
