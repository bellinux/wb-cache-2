Mail-coaches began to overrun the country in all directions at the then remarkable pace of from eight to ten miles an hour,--and, let us remark in passing, there was a whirl and dash about these stage-coaches which railway trains, with all their velocity can never hope to attain to, except when they dash into each other! Man is but a weak creature in some senses. Facts are scarcely facts to him unless they touch his eye or ear. The smooth run of a train at twenty or even thirty miles an hour, with its <b>gradual</b> <b>start</b> and gentle pull up, has but a slight effect on him now compared with the splendid swing of the well-appointed mail coach of old as it swept round the bend of a road, and, with red-coated driver and guard, cracking whip, flying dust and stones, and reeking foam-flecked horses, dashed into town and pulled up, while at nearly full speed, amid all the glorious crash and turmoil of arrival! No doubt the passing of an express train within a yard of your nose is something peculiarly awful, and if you ever get permission to ride on the engine of an express, the real truth regarding speed, weight, momentum, will make a profound impression on you, but in ordinary circumstances {{the arrival of a}} train cannot for a moment compare with the dash, the animal spirit, the enthusiasm, the romance of the mail coach of days gone by.|$|E

50|$|A glimpse on {{the history}} of green urbanism of US as found in Karlenzig, et al. ‘How Green is Your City’ book (2007, 06-07). The concept had a <b>gradual</b> <b>start</b> in the late 1800s, when some large cities of United States (US) started using {{advanced}} drinking water, sewage and sanitary systems. Consecutively, public parks and open spaces were implemented in New York City. At the end of the World War II, the US government offered its citizens affordable housing in easy loan to boost up city population and also introduced a new federal Interstate System, combined with a rise of automobile ownership, gave away to a novel way of life called ‘Suburbia’. Meanwhile, in the 1950s the inhabitants of other industrial cities, including Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, Cleveland and Philadelphia, had already experienced greener suburban pastures. But all those green trees died because of old age or pollution, and were not replaced. After a decade of the ‘Urban Renaissance’, the term used by Richard Rogers, came into light in 1990. Europe was never far behind to endorse urban sustainability. ‘The Green Paper on the Urban Development’ published in 1990 has been considered as a ‘milestone’ document in promoting sustainable city projects as a solution to global environmental role (Beatley, 2000). Lehmann (2010) mentioned that since then cities have engaged themselves in a global-scale competition with each other in three distinct areas. These are, firstly, to be regarded as an attractive, creative place and a cultural hub to attract highly skilled workers and Melbourne, Australia was strong competition with arts, museum and university; secondly, to get recognition as a place for secure investment, mention worthy, Dubai, Shanghai, and Singapore have topped in attracting and facilitating global investment capital; and thirdly, to become a leader of green vision for the future by technological advancement and offering environmentally sound lifestyles and also providing green jobs and Hannover, and Copenhagen did well in this field. After the earth Summit, 1992, different terms, including, sustaining cities (Leitmann, 1999), sustainable cities (Beatley, 2000), sustainable urbanism (Farr, 2008), green city (Karlenzig, 2007), eco-towns, eco districts and eco-cities (Lehmann, 2010), have tried to reduce environmental impacts on the cities and to achieve sustainable development and thus to live more peacefully, there. Both the green and sustainable cities present fundamental opportunities to apply new technologies for example, public transport, district heating, green building and green design and also bring major lifestyle changes such as, walking, bicycling, and reduce energy consumption. The major agenda of the all kinds of the above mentioned cities are tackling global climate change, biodiversity loss, and also lift themselves as ‘hosts’ of all environmental challenges. It has been argued that the focus of these theories are mainly on adjusting the relationship between the city and nature and also creating new cities other than renovating existing cities. To address the gap, Timothy Beatley and Steffen Lehmann used the ‘green urbanism’ theory that aims to transform existing cities from fragmentation to compaction.|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{operation}} {{efficiency and}} user satisfaction for {{spatial and temporal}} shapes of augmented force-feedback fields {{to be used with}} computer pointing devices in target acquisition tasks. In an experiment, three different force-field shapes at two different mean force levels were compared, with an electromechanical forcefeedback trackball as control device and with efficiency and user satisfaction as dependent variables. Efficiency was measured by the time required to perform a certain task, and user satisfaction was measured through a subjective rating procedure. Satisfaction results indicate that to a rough approximation, participants can be grouped into those who prefer high and those who prefer low force levels. Members of the former group were most satisfied with force fields with a <b>gradual</b> <b>start</b> and an abrupt ending. This force-field shape also proved to be the most efficient for both groups. When all participants were considered as a single group, none of the effects was found to be statistically significant. A gender effect was also found; in both preference groups women achieved significantly shorter task completion times than men. Actual or potential applications of this research include enabling computer interaction for people prone to repetitive strain injuries and the increment of efficiency and satisfaction in human-computer interaction in general...|$|E

40|$|This Discussion Paper {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the National Emissions Trading Taskforce, which reports to the Premiers and Chief Ministers of all Australian States and Territories. The paper sets out a possible design for a national emissions trading scheme. The scheme is designed to achieve long term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in an economically efficient way. It aims to {{provide a framework for}} emissions reduction that gives business and the community certainty and predictability. The underlying motivation for advancing a Discussion Paper on such a scheme is the view that the future prosperity of Australia may be better served by taking early action to adapt to a “carbon constrained” world, rather than putting off action and risking a shock to the economy and society. The fundamental obligation of governments is to create a robust and predictable regulatory framework within which new technology and innovation can be developed and applied - to create incentives and rewards for improved environmental outcomes. The Taskforce has taken care to try to understand and address the impacts that emissions trading could have on different sectors and groups within Australian society and the economy. Importantly, the scheme provides for a <b>gradual</b> <b>start,</b> and for assistance to sectors which might otherwise be adversely affected. Public consultation, feedback and comment on the proposals in this paper will be critical in informing refinements to the design, and the decision of Premiers and Chief Ministers about how to proceed...|$|E

40|$|The {{decline of}} agriculture, {{observable}} mainly in industrialized countries, shows itself {{not only in}} a gradual decrease in the economic weight of the primary sector, {{but also in the}} abandonment of land devoted to agricultural and livestock activities. The phenomenon of agricultural land abandonment is complex and, in order to explain the causes, it is necessary to consider not only the physical and productive features of the land but also the social and economic characteristics of the area. It also appears to be conditioned by production specialization, since traditional livestock-raising areas show a higher risk of abandonment. The process, which is <b>gradual,</b> <b>starts</b> with a reduction in production intensity followed by increasing marginalization and, finally, the total abandonment of land use. Focusing on a representative area on the Cantabrian Coast of northern Spain, this study tests the hypothesis that a large portion of agricultural land in livestock-oriented regions is underused.

2500|$|Based on {{the works}} of {{prominent}} members of theological schools of Antioch and Nisibis, and shaped by liturgical and linguistic traditions of the East-Syriac rite, christology of the Church of the East was very early faced with particular terminological challenges. Exceptional complexity of Greek theological terminology led to frequent debates and controversies {{over the use of}} various terms, both in the Latin West and in Syriac East. Among such terms were: ousia ( [...] , [...] "essence"), physis ( [...] , [...] "nature"), hypostasis ( [...] , [...] "substance"), and prosopon ( [...] , [...] "person"). In Syriac language, term physis was translated as kyānâ (ܟܝܢܐ) and hypostasis was translated as qnômâ (ܩܢܘܡܐ). In the Church of the East, the term qnoma (or qnuma) was used to emphasize the dyophysite position in its radical form, by designating a particular hypostasis to each of the two natures of Christ. Official adoption of such theological positions, that were in odds with the Chalcedonian definition, was <b>gradual</b> (<b>starting</b> from the Synod of Beth Lapat in 484). After several oscillations during the 6th century, the process was completed {{by the beginning of the}} 7th century, and thus a final christological distinction was created between the Church of the East and the [...] "western" [...] Chalcedonian Churches.|$|R

40|$|Five engine {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to definitely establish the failure mechanism of leading-edge cracking and to determine which conditions of engine operation cause the failures. Five groups of S- 616 and M- 252 buckets from master lots were run consecutively in the same J 47 - 25 engine. The tests included a steady-state run at full-power conditions, rapid cycling between idle and rated speed, and three different start-stop tests. The first start-stop test consisted of cycles of start and stop with 5 minutes of idle speed before each stop; the second included cycles of start and stop but with 15 minutes of rated speed before each stop; the third consisted of cycles of <b>gradual</b> <b>starts</b> and normal stops with 5 minutes at idle speed before each stop. The test results demonstrated that {{the primary cause of}} leading-edge cracking was thermal fatigue produced by repeated engine starts. The leading edge of the bucket experiences plastic flow in compression during starts and consequently is subjected to a tensile stress when the remainder of the bucket becomes heated and expands. Crack initiation was accelerated when rated-speed operation was added to each normal start-stop cycle. This acceleration of crack formation was attributed to localized creep damage and perhaps to embrittlement resulting from overaging. It was demonstrated that leading-edge cracking can be prevented simply by starting the engine gradually...|$|R
