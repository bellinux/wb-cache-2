In this respect, the phrase or its abbreviation is often paired with its complement, [...] "estimated time of departure" [...] or [...] "ETD", to indicate the <b>expected</b> <b>start</b> time of a particular journey. This information is often conveyed to a passenger information system as part of the core functionality of intelligent transportation systems.|$|E
