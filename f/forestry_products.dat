5|$|Dawson Creek is a {{regional}} node for air, rail, and bus services. The Dawson Creek Airport, which services commercial flights by Central Mountain Air, {{was built in}} 1963; its 1,524m (5,000ft) runway was paved in 1966. There are larger airports in Fort St. John and Grande Prairie that maintain more comprehensive flight schedules. Passenger rail service was available in Dawson Creek between 1931 and 1974. Service began when the Northern Alberta Railways (NAR) built its northwest terminus in the town and was extended in 1958 to Vancouver with a rail line through the Rocky Mountains. Passenger rail service ended as commodity shipments of grains, oil and gas by-products, and <b>forestry</b> <b>products</b> became {{more important in the}} resource-based economy. Greyhound Lines maintains a bus station in Dawson Creek which connects the city to Vancouver, Edmonton (via Grande Prairie), and Whitehorse (via Fort Nelson).|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to provide a comprehensive overview of the productivity situation in the forest products sector at the national and provincial level in Canada, to compare this situation to that in other countries with important <b>forestry</b> <b>product</b> sectors, and to offer some explanation of the trends discovered. The report covers seven major areas. The first provides a detailed examination of trends in output in the forest products sector, which includes three industries, logging and <b>forestry,</b> wood <b>products,</b> and paper products. The second discusses trends in employment and hours worked in the sector and the third trends in the capital stock. The fourth section provides estimates of labour (output per hour), capital productivity, and total factor productivity for the three forest product industries and the sector aggregate for Canada for the 1961 - 2000 period and cyclically neutral sub-periods. The fifth section compares labour, capital, and total factor productivity growth rates and levels in Canada, the United States and Finland over the 1975 - 99 period. The sixth section outlines 13 determinants of productivity growth and then uses these variables to shed light on productivity trends in the three forest products sectors in Canada. <b>Forestry,</b> Forest <b>Products,</b> Logging, Wood Products, Primary Manufacturing, Primary Industries, Pulp and Paper, Paper <b>Products,</b> <b>Forestry</b> Industry, Canada, United States, Finland, Productivity, Productivity Growth, Productivity Determinants...|$|R
25|$|In 1998 the {{findings}} of a study by consultants Woodward-Clyde for Environment Bay of Plenty, Environment Waikato, the Taupo District Council and Tranz Rail Limited were published to evaluate the various proposals to deal with transporting <b>forestry</b> <b>products</b> out of the Taupo region. The report stated that railheads could be accessed at Waiouru, National Park, Kinleith, and Murupara. The report said that it would be unlikely that rail connections would be made at National Park or Waiouru as the distance to forestry ports and processing plants would increase. A connection from Kinleith was a possibility but it would need to traverse difficult terrain and two crossings of the Waikato River may be needed. The report recommended an extension of the Murupara Branch line as being the best rail option.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{very small}} {{percentage}} of the economy is based on fishing and forestry. Fishing is not a major economic activity as it is limited to the small rivers and lakes of the region. Of the two major lakes, one is shared with neighboring Michoacán state. Of the fish is that is caught or raised, most is carp, followed by mojarra. There are 150,000 hectares of forest in the state, which about half theoretically exploitable. However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and oyamel in danger of extinction. The lack of forest cover has led to erosion and other environmental problems. Most <b>forestry</b> <b>products</b> come from pine and holm oak, with most being harvested in the area around the city of Guanajuato.|$|E
25|$|India {{is one of}} the world's largest {{consumer}} of fuel-wood. India's consumption of fuel-wood is about five times higher than what can be sustainably removed from forests. However, a large percentage of this fuel-wood is grown as biomass remaining from agriculture, and is managed outside forests. Fuel-wood meets about 40% of the energy needs of the country. Around 80% of rural people and 48% of urban people use fuel-wood. Unless India makes major, rapid and sustained effort to expand electricity generation and power plants, the rural and urban poor in India will continue to meet their energy needs through unsustainable destruction of forests and fuel wood consumption. India's dependence on fuel-wood and <b>forestry</b> <b>products</b> as a primary energy source is not only environmentally unsustainable, it is a primary cause of India's near-permanent haze and air pollution.|$|E

25|$|The {{survival}} of the species depends on {{a large number of}} habitats from Canada, the United States and Mexico during its annual migration cycle. The three countries adopted a plan in 2008 for the conservation of the butterfly’s habitat through its migration routes. Within the Biosphere in Mexico, the greatest threats to the butterfly habitat are deforestation, illegal logging, unorganized tourism, forest fires and lack of cooperation among various authorities. Most of these dangers come from the surrounding human settlements, which put pressure on the natural areas to provide agricultural space and <b>forestry</b> <b>products</b> such as fuel and wood for manufacturing furniture and other crafts. The main human communities in the area are Contepec, Temascalcingo, Angangueo, Ocampo, San Felipe del Progreso, Zitácuaro, Villa de Allende and Donato Guerra.

It would build from Cave Springs, a few miles west of Rogers, through Fayetteville and towards Memphis, Tennessee. In 1912 the Ozark Land and Lumber Company began construction of a 5-mile extension east of Monte Ne from the White River to the Piney community and leased the line to the KC [...] The White River bridge consisted of 780 feet of trestle and 2,152foot steel spans, making it the longest railroad bridge in Benton County. This extension was used to haul out <b>forestry</b> <b>products.</b> The KC entered receivership in 1914, and in September of that year passenger service to Monte Ne ended. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, many railroads were seized by the United States government. The KC was not seized, and due to unfavorable rulings by the United States Railroad Administration and Arkansas Railroad Commission saw much of its revenue evaporate. In January 1918 Roscoe Hobbs, one of the court-appointed receivers of the KC, went to Washington, D.C. to provide testimony to the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on the effects of these decisions on small railroads. As part of that testimony Hobbs reported 215 cars from the Rogers White Lime Company and 216 cars of pit props and railroad ties being hauled on the Monte Ne portion of the railway in 1917. Hobbs was unsuccessful in having the decisions reversed, and most portions of the KC were abandoned by October 1918. The Monte Ne portion was used until 1919. The White River bridge survived longer and was used for horse and foot traffic before becoming unsafe. The steel spans were scrapped during World War II.|$|E
