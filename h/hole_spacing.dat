40|$|The present {{investigation}} focuses on studying {{the performance of}} three specially designed surfaces in flow boiling heat transfer. The surfaces are prepared by drilling holes of specific sizes using laser ablation drilling. The heat transfer characteristics for three laser drilled enhanced surfaces, and a smooth surface are obtained by collecting experimental data for flow boiling of subcooled water over heater surfaces with different matrix of holes. The matrix of laser etched cavities are as follows: Surface 1 9. 0 um diameter <b>holes</b> <b>spaced</b> at 58. 4 um Surface 2 - 3. 7 um diameter <b>holes</b> <b>spaced</b> at 38. 6 um Surface 3 - 3. 7 um diameter <b>holes</b> <b>spaced</b> at 58. 4 um Polished Surface - polished with a polishing wheel with 5. 0 um solution.

The experimental apparatus consisted of a 3 mm x 40 mm flow channel with a circular heater of 9. 5 mm mounted {{in the center of}} the lower wall. The heater is instrumented with thermocouples to provide a measurement of the surface temperature and heat flux at the heater surface. The experiments are conducted for two subcooling temperature values, 5 K and 10 K at atmospheric pressure.

The influences of hole diameter, vertical <b>hole</b> <b>spacing,</b> tube diameter, perforation pattern, transverse <b>hole</b> <b>spacing,</b> and hole reinforcement on the axial compressive behaviour of perforated GFRP tubes were experimentally investigated.

To address these problems, in this study, the sleeve fracturing method (SFM) was applied to weaken a hard roof. The numerical simulation software FLAC 3 D was used to develop three models based on an analysis of the SFM working mechanism. These models were applied to an analysis of the fracturing effects of various factors such as the borehole diameter, <b>hole</b> <b>spacing,</b> and sleeve pressure. Finally, the results of a simulation were validated using experiments with similar models. Our research indicated the following: (1) The crack propagation directions in the models were affected by the maximum principal stress and <b>hole</b> <b>spacing.</b> When the borehole diameter was fixed, the fracturing pressure increased with increasing <b>hole</b> <b>spacing.</b> In contrast, when the fracturing pressure was fixed, the fracturing range increased with increasing borehole diameter; (2) The most ideal fracturing effect was found at a fracturing pressure of 17. 6 MPa in the model with a borehole diameter of 40 mm and <b>hole</b> <b>spacing</b> of 400 mm.

40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus {{was designed}} and built to study the film cooling effectiveness from a single row of holes at various angles and hole spacings, using a foreign gas technique. Mixtures of Freon 12 and air were injected into an air mainstream to give a range of density ratios encompassing the values found in a gas turbine. The density ratio {{was found to be}} of importance and none of the commonly used parameters - e. g. blowing parameters - can be used to scale results, unless the density ratio is correctly modelled. The boundary layer thickness was varied independently of other parameters, and an increase in thickness was found to decrease the effectiveness, for normal and angled injection geometries for 20 hole diameters downstream. Favourable and adverse pressure gradients over the injection holes were tested and found to have little effect on the film cooling effectiveness. Changing the <b>hole</b> <b>spacing</b> produced considerable variations, with the smallest <b>hole</b> <b>spacing</b> giving the best performance in all respects. A <b>hole</b> <b>spacing</b> of greater than 3. 75 diameters was found to be the maximum to give overall coverage above 0. 10 effectiveness. The injection angle was also investigated and for low blowing rates the shallow angles gave the best results; but at high blowing rates, i. e. greater than 1. 4, normal injection gave the best performance as the shallow angles rapidly became detached from the surface with increasing velocity ratio. The normal injection was also superior in terms of lateral distribution of coolant at all values of blowing rate. A correlation was proposed that included the density and velocity ratios and <b>hole</b> <b>spacing</b> for normal injection and, in a modified form, for angled injection at 3 diameter spacings.
