Daily recession constant of surface runoff, interflow, and baseflow have been derived for 15 segments on Goseng subwatershed with area approximately 596 ha. Semi logarithmic plot is recession analysis method which plotting stream discharge in y-ordinate and time in x-coordinate in semi logarithmic scale. The start of time recession is denoted by a straight line in the graphic. This method was used for separating a hydrograph into linear components of surface runoff, interflow, and baseflow. The results of the research shows that recession segment from daily hydrograph has short time and does not have all three stream components. A short segment can only {{be divided into two}} flow components. Separation pattern for water catchment area are baseflow-interflow, baseflow-surface runoff, and interflow-surface runoff. Recession constant value differ from year to year but the differences do not have great influence in determining the average value of recession constant...|$|E
40|$|Mountains have {{a diverse}} array of microclimates arising from their varied topography. Due to the {{diversity}} of altitudes, climates and landscapes, they support a high diversity of plants, including many endemic and rare species. The objective {{of the project was}} to investigate the impact of climate, altitude and edaphic factors on the floral diversity in Hunza valley (Northern Areas, Pakistan), and further to investigate the changes in endogenous stress hormone (abscisic acid), sugar and proline (as osmoregulant) in plants with respect to variation in altitude. Five field areas viz. Ultar, Sheshpar, Updegar, Batura and Chupursan were selected for vegetation surveys, measurement of air temperature and humidity during summer, determination of chemical characteristics of the soils and ethnobotanical studies of selected flora. To record the important plants used as curatives by Brusho tribes of Hunza valley an ethnobotanical survey was conducted. Thermo- <b>hygrograph</b> with hair element and bimetal were installed for the measurement of temperature and humidity. Soil moisture determination was made by jet filled tensiometers. High Performance Liquid Chromatography was used for determination of a plant stress hormone abscisic acid whereas, sugars, protein and proline were determined spectrophotometerically. The Ultar pasture was chosen as the area for detailed study, because of its easy access and high plant species diversity. Chemical characteristics of soil were determined using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, as and where applied. The total number of identified species from the field areas of Sheshpar, Ultar, Batura, Updeger, and Chupursan was 218, belonging to 47 families. The important families were Asteraceae (37 species), Papilionaceae (20 species), Poaceae (14 species), Lamiaceae (11 species) and Rosaceae (10 species). The observed species richness pattern in the field areas showed that Sheshpar with 116 species had the highest species richness while Chupursan with 82 species inhabit minimum number of species. The number of observed species at one to five sites and the number of commonly occurring species differed significantly whereas, the number of rare species showed {{no significant difference in the}} five field areas. Species like Anaphalis nepalensis, Thymus serpyllum and Aristida showed a greater range of altitudinal limits as compared to other plant species observed in the areas of Ultar and Updegar. There was a significant difference in the number of species growing in the range of 0 - 300 m in the field areas of Ultar and Updegar. The yearly average maximum and minimum temperatures and humidity recorded from April to September at Ultar and Chupursan showed that 2002 was a relatively warm year than 2001. A decreasing trend of humidity patterns was observed from south (Ultar) to north (Chupursan), showing adequate moisture availability at Ultar as compared to Chupursan. The observed species richness was higher at Ultar as compared to Chupursan. Data showed that the soils of Ultar and Sheshpar are more acidic as compared to the other field areas. Values for K, Mn, P and N 03 - N were observed to be highest at Ultar as compared with other field areas. Chupursan soil showed significantly higher Fe content, lower EC values and lower value of N 03 - N content as compared to other areas. Endogenous sugar, protein, proline and abscisic acid content of leaves were higher in all the species collected at 3, 500 m a. s. l. as compared to 3, 000 m a. s. l. Higher average soil moisture values were recorded on north facing slope than south facing slope at Ultar. Over-gazing reduced the diversity of flora, and changed species composition, by depleting species at Ultar pastures. Stocking densities at Ultar pastures for three consecutive years (2000, 2001 and 2002) showed a general trend of increasing number of animal units. The increase in abscisic acid, protein, sugar and proline contents appeared to be correlated with the increase in altitude in all the plant species...|$|E

40|$|Floods {{are one of}} {{the most}} costly types of natural {{disasters}} in Australia and other parts of the world. It was reported that the average annual cost of flood damage in Australia was about 300 million as at 1994. However, the effects of flooding can be mitigated, and thereby reduce the loss of life and damage to property. Flood mitigation measures can be categorised into two groups. The first group, the structural measures, involves civil works in the flood plain and/or catchment. The second group, the non-structural measures, includes flood forecasting, flood warning and emergency planning, planning controls and acquisition of flood prone land within the catchment, and providing flood insurance to affected people. The flood damage mitigation in the catchment or basin depends on complex social, economical and environmental conditions. It is not always feasible to completely control or manage flood damage through structural measures due to economic, technological, environmental and social constraints. Therefore, non-structural measures such as flood forecasting and warning often play an important role in minimizing flood damage, especially, when there are no feasible structural measures that can be implemented. While planning, design, construction and operation of most structural measures can be done using definite mechanisms, the decisions of non-structural measures, especially flood forecasting and warning, are complex and are not uniquely defined. Therefore, such decisions require the aid of mathematical model results, and require both quantitative and qualitative decision modelling steps. Thus, these decisions can be effectively obtained through the use of a Decision Support System. The Decision Support Systems (DSSs) have recently become popular in making decisions related to complex water resource problems. However, the design and the development of some of these applications do not contain all essential elements of a modern-day DSS, such as effective databases and file management facilities, user-friendly interfaces, appropriate simulation models, spatial and graphical data display and analysis modules, and facilities for effective decision making. Moreover, the theory of DSS and computer science has developed rapidly since the initial development of some of these applications. Furthermore, only a few applications of DSS in flood control and warning exists in the literature. These applications cited in the literature mostly deal with planning aspects of flood control, and not real-time flood forecasting and warning. Therefore, considering the above facts, it is timely and necessary to develop an effective DSS to facilitate decision making of flood warning using all recent advances in DSS theory and computer science, and combining all necessary and desirable elements of a DSS into one system. The Maribyrnong River basin is a medium size catchment located in the northwest of Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. Its low-lying flood plains along the lower sections of the river have been frequently being inundated by floods. A flood warning system has been established in 1975 after a major flood in 1974 to minimise flood damage in the lower part of the catchment. This system uses several numerical models such as the RORB model and the HEC- 2 model for flood forecasting. However, there is no single computer-based system that integrates these models to facilitate analysis of different scenarios in controlling and managing the flood damage, and in making objective and effective decisions. Furthermore, the use of these separate models is time consuming and can lead to errors in transferring information from one model to another. Therefore, a computer-based DSS for flood forecasting and warning in the Maribyrnong River basin would enhance the effectiveness of flood warning in this catchment. As part of this research, the author has defined the DSS as an interactive computer-based system that helps decision-makers to use data and models to solve semi-structured problems effectively. This DSS should allow the user to participate in principal steps of the decision making process, to simulate many steps in the process of decision making, to investigate alternative scenarios, to seek the overall goal for decision, and to improve the effectiveness of decision making. The author also suggested a DSS in water resources, which in most cases deals with spatial data display and analysis, should include five essential components: a database subsystem, a modelbase subsystem, an interface subsystem, a decision support subsystem, and a spatial and graphic data display and analysis subsystem. Most previous research work on DSS development, especially in the area of water resources do not give details of the conceptual system design and details of the subsystems. This thesis provides the details of the conceptual system designs of all subsystems and their major functions. These approaches will help further system development of the DSS of this thesis. The general concept used in this thesis can be used for DSS studies in other water resource studies and in other fields. Based on well-designed system, a unique decision support system, DSSFCMR (Decision Support System for Flood Control in the Maribyrnong River basin) was developed in this thesis to help decision making in flood forecasting and warning from data entry to search of final decisions. The DSSFCMR consists of five subsystems, namely Database Management System (DBMS), Modelbase, Spatial and Graphic Data Display and Analysis (SGDDA), Decision Support, and Interface. The DSSFCMR can consider various forecast rainfall depths in three different forecast periods. The developed Database subsystem can perform various tasks for database management related to flood warning. The URBS hydrological and HEC-RAS hydraulic models in the Modelbase subsystem are used to calculate flood <b>hygrographs</b> and corresponding flood water levels along the flood prone area respectively. Based on the calculated water levels, the shapefile for flood inundated area is instantly created, which is then used for spatial analysis of the flood inundated area through the developed interactive map interface. Two separate methods were developed in the SGDDA subsystem to perform spatial data display and analysis of the flood inundated area for use by different users (with different computer skills) and/or for organizations with different levels of resources. The process of complicated data transfer within DSSFCMR (e. g. the peak discharge to the flood water level, then flood water level to the shapefile of flood area) is automated by the developed system functions. The technology developed for decision choice support in this study helps to locate the required scenarios from many scenario results using the database technology. All functions are properly integrated together for the benefit of the user to make the decisions effectively. The use of DSSFCMR to provide decision support for flood forecasting and warning in the Maribyrnong River basin was illustrated. The application was on the flood event that occurred on 04 October 1983, but under 1997 topographical conditions. Essentially, the application concentrated on flood forecasting and warning decisions at a particular time during the event. The system effectively performed calibration of the URBS and HEC-RAS models, forecasting of flood hydrographs, calculation of flood water levels, spatial data display of flood inundated areas and decision selection support for flood warning at this particular time. Generally, the developed system DSSFCMR can efficiently forecast flood hydrographs and calculate the flood water levels; the process of complex data transfer is done automatically and quickly; the data can be displayed flexibly in various formats; the system is easy to use by different users with different computer skills; the user can use DSSFCMR to investigate decision making variables related to flood warning (e. g. people relocation) conveniently and quickly. In summary, this system helps the decision maker to make the decisions in relation to flood forecasting and warning in the Maribyrnong River basin effectively. ...|$|R
