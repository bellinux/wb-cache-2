40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} scheme to provide {{security}} to dynamic multicast VoIP systems efficiently. Security is usually provided by <b>encrypting</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> packets sent from a user to other users {{with the help of}} a shared key called the session encryption key. The most time consuming process in a dynamic multicast VoIP environment is the group key management. Whenever there is a change in the group membership, the key needs to be updated and the updated key has to be sent to all active members in the group. Hence, by decreasing the number of update messages required for an updated key, the performance of the system can be improved considerably, thus making the scheme more efficient. The proposed secure multicast key management scheme combines the advantages of logical-key tree structure and Chinese remainder theorem to achieve an effective scheme. This paper compares the efficiency of the proposed scheme with the existing schemes and the comparison shows that the proposed scheme performs better than the existing schemes in terms of reduction in key update messages...|$|E

RTMPE makes use of well-known industry standard cryptographic primitives, consisting of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and HMACSHA256, generating a pair of RC4 keys, one of which is then used to <b>encrypt</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> data sent by the server (the audio or video stream), while the other key is used to encrypt any data sent to the server.

30|$|A {{prominent}} {{implementation of}} a streaming protocol is the Real Time Protocol (RTP) that has been specified in RFC 3550 [4]. It is based on UDP and uses the Real Time Control Protocol (RTCP) for QoS. The Real Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) has been published by Adobe in 2009 [5]. It uses TCP and guarantees the correct order of the datagrams in the stream. On the server side RTMP implements command messages, data messages, shared object messages to embed e.g. Flash events, media messages, and aggregate messages to combine various messages gaining efficiency. On the client and server side RTMP offers user control messages to notify about events like stream begin or end. There are several variants of RTMP that allow to tunnel through firewalls (RTMP-T), to <b>encrypt</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> streams (RTMP-E, RTMP-S), and {{a combination of both}} (RTMP-TE) [6]. Examples for RTMP streaming clients are the VLC player [7] and the browser based FlowPlayer [8].|$|R

50|$|The {{distributor}} {{can choose}} to <b>encrypt</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> (MXF) files with AES encryption to stop unauthorised access. The symmetric AES keys used to <b>encrypt</b> <b>the</b> content essence must be carefully protected, so they are never distributed directly. Instead the AES keys are themselves encrypted using asymmetric 2048 bit RSA. Each playback system has its own unique public/private key pair. The private key is never shared and is buried in the playback systems within secure hardware meeting FIPS-140 security standards. The matching public key is shared with the distributor, who can then create Key Delivery Messages (KDMs) which control access to <b>the</b> <b>encrypted</b> content for each playback system. KDMs are XML files containing <b>the</b> RSA <b>encrypted</b> AES keys that can be decrypted only by the private key within the destination device. A KDM is associated to the particular compositions (CPLs) which may include multiple encrypted picture, sound and subtitle assets, and each playback system requires a uniquely generated KDM. KDMs also provide the ability to define date/time windows within which the KDM is valid. Playback systems will not allow playback outside of this validity window, allowing distributors to ensure that content cannot be unlocked prior to release date and to enforce the rental agreement period agreed with the exhibitor.|$|R

Further we analyze the existing key exchange protocols namely MIKEY, ZRTP and SDES and their vulnerability towards Man-In-The-Middle attack. The focused research area in VoIP {{is related to}} the Security and Quality of service of the voice data. Among these areas VoIP security and confidentiality of voice data turns to be a challenging one.

Therefore {{there is a need for}} stronger key management protocol which will secure the voice data from all types of attack and which also provides a feasible key exchange mechanism. In our approach we go for a two tier key exchange mechanism, in which the first tier involves ECDH for key seeding and the second tier involves a Key Generation Function (KGF), which takes care to the key update by consuming absolutely zero bandwidth. Here we take care to that this mechanism yields a very effective mechanism for preserving the confidentiality of the voice data without affecting the quality of the voice in Mobile Based VoIP devices...|$|R

Therefore, an attacker can easily launch passive attacks to monitor WiMAX traffic and can retrieve valuable information from unencrypted MAC management messages. This research paper focuses on the analysis of security threats and their mitigation at MAC Layer of WiMAX.

The 128 bit key based AES (Advance Encryption Standard) encryption is also implemented. The target is to encrypt communication between WIMAX based BS (Base station) and MS/SS(Mobile station/subscriber station) using AES where encryption is applied on all the packets exchanged.
