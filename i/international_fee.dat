40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia 2 ̆ 7 s first {{international}} student {{to receive a}} scholarship said her postgraduate research is thriving thanks to the financial, academic and community support she receives from the University. Seren Dalkiran {{was born in the}} Netherlands and now calls Sydney home as the first recipient of Notre Dame 2 ̆ 7 s <b>International</b> <b>Fee</b> Remission Research Scholarship. Ms Dalkiran is undertaking a Doctor of Philosophy, and her research assesses the social change processes within the emerging empowered and conscious proportion of youth leaders across the globe. 2 ̆ 2 Notre Dame has a strong focus on treating each student as an individual, which is enhanced and enabled by its close-knit community, 2 ̆ 2 Ms Dalkiran said. 2 ̆ 2 As an international student conducting doctoral research, I have really appreciated that supportive environment. The scholarship funding has not only enabled me to conduct my research, it has also allowed me to attend leading conferences around the world to gain a deeper understanding of my field of research. 2 ̆ 2 Ms Dalkiran said Australia is an exciting place to work, study and socialise. 2 ̆ 2 Australia offers a totally different culture to my own; with so much space, the opportunity to get close to nature and easy access to the emerging dynamics of the Asia-Pacific region, 2 ̆ 2 Ms Dalkiran said. 2 ̆ 2 Australia is a young country and is open to innovation and creative and critical thinking and I like {{the fact that this is}} also reflected in its energetic and open-minded attitude towards higher education. 2 ̆ 2 Vice Chancellor Professor Celia Hammond said Notre Dame looks forward to welcoming other international students to its Sydney, Broome and Fremantle campuses in 2013 through the <b>International</b> <b>Fee</b> Remission Research Scholarships program. 2 ̆ 2 I am pleased to see Seren 2 ̆ 7 s research flourish at Notre Dame and hope the University can provide mentorship, academic support and a community connection for other international postgraduate students through this scholarship, 2 ̆ 2 Professor Hammond said. The <b>International</b> <b>Fee</b> Remission Research Scholarship program will provide up to five scholarship places per academic year to international students who wish to undertake a higher degree by research at Notre Dame. Notre Dame will support individuals undertaking research degrees (including Research Masters and Doctoral studies) in the University 2 ̆ 7 s areas of research strength, namely Health, Education, Indigenous Studies and Theology and Philosophy (including Ethics). However, the University will consider awarding Scholarships to students in other discipline areas where there is a compelling case for supporting the research student and the project and where appropriate supervision is available.

40|$|Instead of {{bragging about}} the number of {{students}} going abroad and hosting of <b>international</b> <b>fee</b> paying students, the number of courses in English and the abstract claim of making students global citizens, we want to focus on learning outcomes. How can we make sure that students receive the right learning outcomes that make them ready for a world that is more and more interculturally and internationally connected? What does that mean for faculty development? What are the implications for the assessment of students? How can instruments such as study abroad, international classrooms, teaching in another language, recruitment of international students and cross-border delivery, contribute to that process? Uwe Brandenburg and Hans de Wit, The Guardian, April 2012 I would argue strongly that the most fruitful education for the globe will be [...] . one that is not merely technical or appreciative but genuinely “liberating ” or “emancipatory ” by virtue of cultivating critical thought, self-reflection, and a sense of social responsibility [...] international educators will establish an intellectual and philosophical standpoint of their own that transcends the homeland perspective and can provide academic guidance for student experience overseas …making peace and justice issues an aspect of all overseas study.

40|$|The {{significant}} {{growth in}} one knowledge-driven service industry, ie tertiary education, {{has resulted in}} Universities seeking international students not only for financial awards but also {{to bring in a}} diversity of norms and cultures to enrich the learning experience. The increase in migration from Asian countries as per Legat (1996) in the mid-nineties, has resulted in non- English speaking background (NESB) students entering Tertiary Institutes in large numbers, more so in the Australian and New Zealand market. This trend continues with more <b>international</b> <b>fee</b> paying students (Sarkodie-Mensah, 1998). More than 75, 000 foreign students studied in New Zealand last year, earning the country $ 2. 5 billion and making education the fourth-largest export earner. Nearly 80 % of all foreign fee paying students are from Asia and as described by Biggs (1996) of Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC). At Unitec in Auckland, more than 60 % of the students enrolled in the Business Faculty are international students. With this dramatic increase in our classrooms of international students, the challenge for educational institutions and teachers {{is to be able to}} adopt innovative teaching strategies that meets the legitimate needs and expectations of this group of international CHC students. This is even more so pronounced in the entrepreneurial programs at Unitec like the Bachelors (BBIE) and Master of Business in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (MBIE), because as social scientists have postulated (Weber, 1964), Confucianism is hostile to entrepreneurship. Schaper and Volery (2004) highlight factors that are most commonly cited for entrepreneurship to occur, being an individual, an act, an organization and innovation. International students with a CHC background belong to collectivist societies (Hofstede, 1991) where personal relationships and contacts, the much cherishe...|$|E

For non-Tawjihi graduates, there is a set quota of 5% of places. Most graduates of foreign programs end up paying <b>international</b> <b>fees</b> to get a place in their desired faculty. The reason for this, is that the quota set for the number of seats was decided in the 80's when approximately only 4 schools taught international programs, and the number of places allocated seemed fair.
