60|$|Of course, Agrippina, {{when her}} husband's dying struggles were over, {{and she was}} {{satisfied}} that life was extinct, experienced for the moment a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>gratification</b> and relief. It might have been expected, however, that the pangs of remorse, after the deed was perpetrated, would have followed very hard upon the termination of her suspense and anxiety. But it was not so. Much still remained to be done, and Agrippina was fully prepared to meet all {{the responsibilities of the}} crisis. The death of her husband took place very early in the morning, the poisoning operations having been performed in the night, and having accomplished their final effect about the break of day. Agrippina immediately perceived that the most effectual means of accomplishing the end which she had in view, was not to allow of any interval to elapse between the announcement of the emperor's death and the bringing forward of her son for induction into office as his successor; since during such an interval, if one were allowed, the Roman people would, of course, discuss the question, whether Britannicus or Nero should succeed to power, and a strong party might possibly organize itself to enforce the claims of the former. She determined, therefore, to conceal the death of her husband until noon, the hour most favorable for publicly proclaiming any great event, and then to announce the death of the father and the accession of the adopted son together.|$|E
5000|$|The replay {{took place}} at the County Ground on the {{following}} Wednesday afternoon in front of a crowd estimated at between 12,000 and 15,000, netting gate receipts of £532. To the surprise of the national press, Southampton put on [...] "an outstanding display" [...] to win 4-0. At one stage in the match, the hugely partisan crowd spilled onto the pitch, with the match having to be halted temporarily. The Daily Mail was duly impressed:Southampton's success against Bolton Wanderers marks the dawning of a new era for professional football in the South, and it is now becoming more and more evident that absolutely first-class football is not to be for ever monopolised by the Northern organisations. While lamenting methods by which this condition of things has been brought about - that is to say, the hiring of aliens - one cannot escape a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>gratification</b> that the South is at last holding its own once more. This victory set up a semi-final tie with another First Division club, Nottingham Forest, which {{would turn out to be}} one of the most controversial in the history of the FA Cup to date.|$|E
40|$|Food is {{a potent}} natural reward and food intake is a complex process. Reward and {{gratification}} associated with food consumption leads to dopamine (DA) production, which in turn activates reward and pleasure centers in the brain. An individual will repeatedly eat a particular food to experience this positive <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>gratification.</b> This type of repetitive behavior of food intake leads to the activation of brain reward pathways that eventually overrides other signals of satiety and hunger. Thus, a gratification habit through a favorable food leads to overeating and morbid obesity. Overeating and obesity stems from many biological factors engaging both central and peripheral systems in a bi-directional manner involving mood and emotions. Emotional eating and altered mood {{can also lead to}} altered food choice and intake leading to overeating and obesity. Research findings from human and animal studies support a two-way link between three concepts, mood, food, and obesity. The focus {{of this article is to}} provide an overview of complex nature of food intake where various biological factors link mood, food intake, and brain signaling that engages both peripheral and central nervous system signaling pathways in a bi-directional manner in obesity...|$|E

30|$|Secondly, {{higher levels}} of OP, {{stemming}} from a rigid and uncontrollable urge to engage in physical activity, {{did not appear to}} be emotionally injurious on days when the women engaged in the activity. As per (Ratelle et al. 2004), our relationship between OP and daily positive daily affect was negative, though it was non-significant and this is consistent with Mageau and Vallerand (2007). Still, true to the DMP, engaging in physical activity out of an OP should be associated with poorer emotional states given one’s rigid and defensive orientation. A few factors could account for why our findings disagree with others that support this theoretical association. First, links have largely been documented during or shortly after activity engagement (Stenseng et al. 2011; Mageau et al. 2005), whereas in this study an overall daily rating of negative affect was unrelated to OP on days when the women engaged in their passion. Second, borrowing from recent motivational theory-based studies (e.g., Guérin and Fortier 2012) it stands to reason that more agreeable affect for women with higher OP could be tied to a catharsis type of effect on days when they engage in physical activity. Namely, they may experience relief from feelings of guilt and anxiety attached to the activity and/or, in this population specifically, possibly also a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>gratification</b> from having “fit it in”. Future qualitative work would be ideally suited to expose such possible origins of these results. Such investigations may be a good opportunity to examine the role of additional psychological characteristics such as neuroticism and/or mood disorders, which have been linked to excessive levels of guilt and may carry implications in terms of developing an obsessive passion (Beck & Alford, 2009). However, further restricting inclusion criteria among participants in order to highlight such qualities would limit the generalizability of unique results to other groups of individuals, which was already a limitation of using highly selective sample in the present study.|$|E
40|$|The {{transformation}} felt today {{among the}} Internet {{is creating a}} new paradigm for communication channels in general and in particular for advertising communication. If we combine {{the sense that the}} decline in recent years in advertising spending in traditional media, we found a turning point in how the communication re-aches the potential consumers. And consequently how it is distributed. In this sense, the study attempts to understand how today’s consumer, before this transformation, moves and how it is inﬂuenced and inﬂuences the advertising strategy of a brand. We understand that today we ﬁnd a consumer who is increasingly involved in internet communication and distribution of information and relationships. Although the performance of brands follows the trends, the study described here also wants to see how the tools can help webmarketing, draw the consumer’s attention and basically take you to positive action. Consequently, the strategy of brands has become the place to give what is called "Brand Entertainment. "This concept has created a new way for brands can reach consumers in an informal way, as it means the inclusion of advertisements in the content demanded by consumers. And one of the most known are Advergames, games created for brands that provide advertising spend fun. We understand that the growing implementation of advertising strategies in Advergames brands can create involvement by your target audience. Studies such as Wise et al (2008) show the positive effect of using this type of medium. The authors found advantages in the use of Advergames in regarding to the relationship established between mark and player. Freitas (s / d) believes are beneﬁcial for ﬁxing and awareness of the brand or product and, ulti- mately, help brands to create loyalty and rememberance. This type of advertising has strong acceptance and is considered less intrusive by nature, but strongly associated with the entertainment game. With these factors combined, the effect of Advergame can be achieved by creating the player feeling of immersion, through entertainment and commitment. The request made consumer attention is so striking achieved that which is detrimental to the viewing application, for example a television commercial of 30 seconds. The indicated effects are likely to generate meaning and relation creating due to {{the amount of time that}} the consumer is exposed to brand message. If we put the fun time of interaction with the branded product, then we can be creating retention and brand image in the background positive attitude towards it. ("Brand Awareness’) The study also looks at how the Advergames can prolong the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>gratiﬁcation</b> and distribute this knowledge. We therefore support the study of phenomena such as the "Word of Mouse"(Womo), ie, in a way that the consumer can distribute advertising content in your social network online and ofﬂine explaining the fun that got on your blog, promoting on Twitter, etc. ...|$|E

40|$|In sociology, the {{appropriateness}} of national approaches for understanding social inequality in today's societies is being increasingly questioned, and EU-wide approaches are advocated instead. In this paper, we link the growing debate about national or EU-wide approaches to reference group theory, investigating whether comparisons with foreign countries influence levels of individual life satisfaction. Our results indicate that, on the one hand, more people can be assumed to have a national frame of reference than a broader international one, on the other hand, among those who do {{have an idea of}} how average people in other countries live, cross-border comparisons certainly influence people's satisfaction with life. Upward comparisons in particular are important: The more people feel personally deprived, relative to other countries, the less satisfied they are with their lives. In contrast, the <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> relative <b>gratification</b> has a much smaller impact on life satisfaction, and often no impact at all.

50|$|Although Krusen's {{successes in}} administration, education, and {{research}} are impressive enough, {{what is most}} recognized about his contributions nationally and internationally is the key role he played in establishing the specialty of PM&R within the American Board of Medical Specialties. In addition, he joined John Stanley Coulter and others to establish the American Congress of Physical Therapy, and, as president, {{he was involved in}} the effort to establish an Academy of Physical Therapy Physicians, in 1938, the organization that became the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in 1955. Krusen, therefore, worked for nearly two decades to have PM&R recognized as a medical specialty.Krusen's efforts were supported by a strategic alliance with the wealthy and influential philanthropist M. Bernard Baruch and the formation of the Baruch Committee, which resulted in large grants to academic centers to create PM&R research and training programs throughout the country. Krusen's vision to establish the specialty of physical medicine was eventually codified by the American Board of Medical Specialties in 1947. Krusen was elected the first chairman of the new American Board of Physical Medicine, but the first Board certificate was granted to John S. Coulter, MD, in recognition of his pioneering role in the field. Krusen received Certificate No. 2 diary entry at this time reflects on the long road to this achievement. “I feel that I must record at this point in my diary my extreme gratification concerning the establishment of the American Board of Physical Medicine.

40|$|Research in {{motivation}} and emotion has been increasingly {{influenced by the}} perspective that processes underpinning the motivated approach of rewarding goals are distinct from those underpinning enjoyment during reward consummation.

In a university community sample (N = 97), we examined the TEPS subscales as predictors of (1) the willingness to expend effort for monetary rewards, and (2) affective responses to a pleasant mood induction procedure. Results showed that both anticipatory pleasure and a well-known trait measure of reward motivation predicted effort-expenditure for rewards when the probability of being rewarded was relatively low.

Here, we test {{the hypothesis that}} this impulse control capacity is driven by increased maturation of frontostriatal circuitry using a fiber-tracking approach combined with longitudinal imaging. In total, 192 healthy volunteers between 8 and 26 years underwent diffusion tensor imaging scanning and completed a delaydiscounting task twice, separated by a 2 -year interval. We investigated dynamic associations between frontostriatal white matter (WM) integrity and delay <b>of</b> <b>gratification</b> skills. Moreover, we examined the predictive value of frontostriatalWMintegrity for future delay <b>of</b> <b>gratification</b> skills. Results showed that delay discounting increases with age in a quadratic fashion, with greatest patience during late adolescence. Data also indicated nonlinear development of frontostriatalWM,with relative fast development during childhood and early adulthood and—on average—little change during mid-adolescence. Furthermore, the positive association between age and delay discounting was further increased in individuals with higher WM integrity of the frontostriatal tracts. Predictive analysis showed that frontostriatal WM development explained unique variance in current and future delay <b>of</b> <b>gratification</b> skills.
