5|$|Breckinridge rode into Abbeville, South Carolina on {{the morning}} of April 28. While there, Breckinridge and Brigadier General Basil W. Duke finally {{convinced}} Davis that further prosecution of the war was hopeless. Breckinridge was put in charge of the $150,000 in <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> remaining in the Confederate treasury; traveling southward by rail toward Washington, Georgia, a group of soldiers in his military escort – unpaid for months – threatened to divide the gold among themselves before it could be captured by federal troops. Breckinridge convinced them to abandon their scheme after paying them their wages from the treasury, but some of them refused to escort Breckinridge and the bullion any further. Breckinridge's party arrived in Washington on May 4 and, after paying out several requisitions from the treasury, deposited the rest in banks there. He also composed a letter to his remaining deputies in which he disbanded the War Department.|$|E
25|$|On April 15, 1864, {{two weeks}} before the lease was due to expire, Willard {{tendered}} the down payment to Tayloe in paper money. Tayloe refused to issue the mortgage and turn over the deed, claiming that the hotel was now worth much more than $22,500 and that Willard had not paid in gold (the only form of cash available in 1854) as specified in the lease. Worse, due to inflation, the Notes were worth only about half what <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> was worth. Willard sued for relief.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{great deal}} of money to be made in this way. The record breaker was the capture of the Spanish frigate Hermione, which was {{carrying}} treasure in 1762. The value of this was so great that each individual seaman netted £485 ($1.4million in 2008 dollars). The two captains responsible, Evans and Pownall, received £65,000 each ($188.4million). In January 1807 the frigate Caroline took the Spanish San Rafael which brought in £52,000 for her captain, Peter Rainier (who had been only a Midshipman some thirteen months before). All through the wars there are examples of this kind of luck falling on captains. Another famous 'capture' was that of the Spanish frigates Thetis and Santa Brigada which were loaded with <b>gold</b> <b>specie.</b> They were taken by four British frigates who shared the money, each captain receiving £40,730. Each lieutenant got £5,091, the Warrant Officer group, £2,468, the midshipmen £791 and the individual seamen £182.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war the Confederacy had some $47 million in bank deposits (compared to $189 million in northern banks), and $27 million in <b>specie</b> (<b>gold</b> and silver coins) holdings (compared to $45 million worth in the northern states).|$|R
60|$|On the contrary, {{the people}} in the {{southern}} unknown countries, being first of all very numerous, and living in a temperate climate, which requires clothing, and having no manufactures, or materials for manufactures, of their own, would consequently take off a very great quantity of English woollen manufactures, especially when civilized by our dwelling among them, and taught the manner of clothing themselves for their ease and convenience; and, in return for these manufactures, it is evident we should have <b>gold</b> in <b>specie,</b> and perhaps spices, the best merchandise and return in the world.|$|R
500|$|Secretary Boutwell {{was already}} {{keeping track of}} the {{situation}} and knew that the profits made in the manipulated rising gold market could ruin the nation's economy for several years. By September 21 the price of gold had jumped from $37 to $141, and Gould and Fisk jointly owned $50 million to $60 million in gold. Boutwell and Grant finally met on Thursday, September 23, and agreed to release gold from the treasury if the gold price kept rising. Grant wanted $5,000,000 in gold to be released while Boutwell wanted $3,000,000 released. [...] Then, on (Black) Friday, September 23, 1869, when the price of gold had soared to $160 an ounce, Boutwell released $4 million in <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> into the market and bought $4,000,000 in bonds. Boutwell had also ordered that the Tenth National Bank be closed on the same day. The gold market crashed and Gould and Fisk were foiled, while many investors were financially ruined.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the American Civil War, the Confederate government sought to counter the United States Navy in part by appealing to private enterprise world-wide to engage in privateering against United States shipping. Privateering was the practice of fitting ordinary private merchant vessels with modest armament, then sending them to sea to capture other merchant vessels in return for monetary reward. The captured vessels and cargo fell under customary prize rules at sea. [...] Prizes would be taken to the jurisdiction of a competent court, which could be in the sponsoring country or theoretically in any neutral port. If the court found that the capture was legal, the ship and cargo would be forfeited and sold at a prize auction. The proceeds would be distributed among owners and crew according to a contractual arrangement. Privateers were also authorized to attack an enemy's navy warships and then apply to the sponsoring government for direct monetary reward, usually gold or <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> (coins).|$|E
60|$|One day Joe Baldwin, {{assisted}} by his old friend, Rooney Machowl, was busily engaged {{down at the}} bottom of the sea, off the Irish coast, slinging a box of <b>gold</b> <b>specie.</b> He had given the signal to haul up, and Rooney had moved away to put slings round another box, when the chain to which the gold was suspended snapt, and the box descended on Joe. If it had hit him on the back in its descent it would certainly have killed him, but it only hit his collar-bone and broke it.|$|E
5|$|The {{second issue}} {{concerned}} United States Notes (commonly called greenbacks), {{a form of}} fiat currency first issued during the Civil War. The government accepted these notes as valid for payment of taxes and tariffs, but unlike ordinary dollars, they were not redeemable in <b>gold.</b> The <b>Specie</b> Payment Resumption Act of 1875 required the treasury to redeem any outstanding greenbacks in gold, thus retiring them from circulation and restoring a single, gold-backed currency. Sherman agreed with Hayes's favorable opinion of the Act, and stockpiled gold {{in preparation for the}} exchange of greenbacks for gold. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for <b>specie</b> (<b>gold),</b> however, few did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were actually redeemed. Together with the Bland–Allison Act, the successful specie resumption effected a workable compromise between inflationists and hard money men and, as the world economy began to improve, agitation for more greenbacks and silver coinage quieted down for the rest of Hayes's term in office.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{a general}} hostility to banking {{and the belief}} that <b>specie</b> (<b>gold</b> and/or silver) were the only true money, Jacksons reasons for {{opposing}} the renewal of the charter revolved around his belief that bestowing power and responsibility upon a single bank was the cause of inflation and other perceived evils.|$|R
50|$|Commodity {{money is}} {{inconvenient}} to store and transport in large amounts. Furthermore, {{it does not}} allow a government to manipulate the flow of commerce with the same ease that a fiat currency does. As such, commodity money gave way to representative money and <b>gold</b> and other <b>specie</b> were retained as its backing.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> {{standard}} {{ended in}} the United Kingdom {{and the rest of}} the British Empire at the outbreak of World War I, when Treasury notes replaced the circulation of gold sovereigns and gold half sovereigns. Legally, the <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> standard was not repealed. The end of the gold standard was successfully effected by the Bank of England through appeals to patriotism urging citizens not to redeem paper money for <b>gold</b> <b>specie.</b> It was only in 1925, when Britain returned to the gold standard in conjunction with Australia and South Africa that the <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> standard was officially ended.|$|E

5000|$|The British Gold Standard Act 1925 both {{introduced}} the {{gold bullion standard}} and simultaneously repealed the <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> standard. The new standard ended the circulation of <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> coins. Instead, the law compelled the authorities to sell gold bullion on demand at a fixed price, but [...] "only {{in the form of}} bars containing approximately four hundred ounces troy kg of fine gold". John Maynard Keynes, citing deflationary dangers, argued against resumption of the gold standard.|$|E
50|$|The gold {{exchange}} standard {{usually does}} not involve the circulation of gold coins. The main feature of the {{gold exchange standard}} {{is that the government}} guarantees a fixed exchange rate to the currency of another country that uses a <b>gold</b> standard (<b>specie</b> or bullion), regardless of what type of notes or coins are used as a means of exchange. This creates a de facto gold standard, where the value of the means of exchange has a fixed external value in terms of gold that is independent of the inherent value of the means of exchange itself.|$|R
5000|$|Benton was an unflagging {{advocate}} for [...] "hard money", that is <b>gold</b> coin (<b>specie)</b> or bullion as money—as opposed to paper money [...] "backed" [...] by gold as in a [...] "gold standard". [...] "Soft" [...] (i.e. paper or credit) currency, in his opinion, favored rich urban Easterners {{at the expense}} of the small farmers and tradespeople of the West. He proposed a law requiring payment for federal land in hard currency only, which was defeated in Congress but later enshrined in an executive order, the Specie Circular, by Jackson (1836). His position on currency earned him the nickname Old Bullion.|$|R
50|$|On July 11, 1836, Jackson ordered Secretary of the Treasury Levi Woodbury {{to issue}} the Specie Circular under federal law. After August 15, the {{government}} refused to take anything but <b>gold</b> and silver <b>specie</b> in exchange for public lands. It did make a special exception to accept certain types of Virginia scrip. The executive order allowed legitimate settlers (non-speculators) to use paper until December.|$|R

50|$|The <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> {{standard}} {{arose from}} the widespread acceptance of gold as currency.

50|$|The {{advantages}} of paper currency were numerous: it reduced {{the need to}} transport gold and silver, which was risky; it facilitated loans of gold or silver at interest, since the underlying <b>specie</b> (<b>gold</b> or silver) never left the possession of the lender until someone else redeemed the note; and it allowed a division of currency into credit and specie backed forms. It enabled the sale of stock in joint-stock companies, and the redemption of those shares in paper.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} with banks was over-issuance of banknotes. These were redeemable in <b>specie</b> (<b>gold</b> or silver) upon presentation to the chief cashier of the bank. When people lost trust in a bank they rushed to redeem its notes, and because banks issued more notes than their specie reserves, the bank couldn't redeem the notes, often causing the bank to fail. In 1860 there were over 8,000 state chartered banks issuing notes. In 1861 the U.S. began issuing United States Notes as legal tender.|$|R
2500|$|Congress used {{four main}} methods {{to cover the}} cost of the war, which cost about 66 million dollars in <b>specie</b> (<b>gold</b> and silver). Congress made two issues of paper money—in 1775–1780 and in 1780–81. The first issue {{amounted}} to 242 million dollars. This paper money would supposedly be redeemed for state taxes, but the holders were eventually paid off in 1791 at the rate of one cent on the dollar. By 1780, the paper money was [...] "not worth a Continental", as people said.|$|R
5000|$|In 1834, President Jackson began {{action to}} {{strengthen}} the U.S. economy. His goal was to retire the notes of the Bank of the United States prevalent in society {{at that time and}} to replace them with specie gold. In addition, he realized that the ratio between gold and silver must be adjusted if <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> was to remain in circulation. At that time, the gold to silver ratio was 15:1 while in Europe, the ratio was 15.5:1. This led to the practice of melting down contemporary U.S. gold coins for profit because there was a slightly higher gold content than the face value. This practice led to significant coin rarities in the Capped Bust series of gold coins minted from 1808-1834. <b>Gold</b> <b>specie</b> fineness was reduced from [...]9167 fine to [...]8992 fine and the gold to silver ratio was increased to 16:1. This action was extremely astute and ensured that the new $2.5 and $5 coins would remain in circulation. These were the first widely circulated gold coins in US history.|$|E

50|$|A year earlier, in 1933, Executive Order 6102 {{had made}} it a {{criminal}} offense for U.S. citizens to own or trade gold anywhere in the world, with exceptions for some jewelry and collector's coins. These prohibitions were relaxed starting in 1964 - gold certificates were again allowed for private investors on April 24, 1964, although the obligation to pay the certificate holder on demand in <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> would not be honored. By 1975 Americans could again freely own and trade gold.|$|E

50|$|In modern times, the British West Indies {{was one of}} {{the first}} regions to adopt a <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> standard. Following Queen Anne's {{proclamation}} of 1704, the British West Indies gold standard was a de facto gold standard based on the Spanish gold doubloon. In 1717, Sir Isaac Newton, the master of the Royal Mint, established a new mint ratio between silver and gold that had the effect of driving silver out of circulation and putting Britain on a gold standard.|$|E
50|$|A formal <b>gold</b> <b>specie</b> {{standard}} was first established in 1821, when Britain adopted it following {{the introduction of}} the gold sovereign by the new Royal Mint at Tower Hill in 1816. The United Province of Canada in 1853, Newfoundland in 1865, and the United States and Germany (de jure) in 1873 adopted gold. The United States used the eagle as its unit, Germany introduced the new gold mark, while Canada adopted a dual system based on both the American gold eagle and the British gold sovereign.|$|E

These packets bring over such vast quantities of <b>gold</b> in <b>specie,</b> either in moidores (which is the Portugal coin) or in bars of gold, that I am very credibly informed the carrier from Falmouth brought by land from thence to London at one time, in the month of January, 1722, or near it, eighty thousand moidores in gold, which came from Lisbon in the packet-boats for account of the merchants at London, and that it was attended with a guard of twelve horsemen well armed, for which the said carrier had half per cent. for his hazard.|$|R
