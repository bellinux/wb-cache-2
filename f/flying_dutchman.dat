5|$|The crew {{moved to}} a small island in the Bahamas called White Cay for the {{beginning}} and end of the Isla Cruces battle, before production took a break until August, where in Los Angeles the interiors of the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> were shot. On September 18, 2005, the crew moved to Grand Bahama Island to shoot ship exteriors, including the working Black Pearl and <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman.</b> Filming there was a tumultuous period, starting with the fact that the tank had not actually been finished. The hurricane season caused many pauses in shooting, and Hurricane Wilma damaged many of the accessways and pumps, though no one was hurt nor were any of the ships destroyed. Filming completed on September 10, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the guest}} artists who {{appeared}} {{with the company}} in the 1970s were the baritone Tito Gobbi, as Falstaff (1972), the sopranos Elisabeth Söderström as Emilia in The Makropoulos Case (1978) and Anne Evans as Senta in The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> (1972), and the conductors James Levine (Aida, 1970) and Reginald Goodall (Tristan and Isolde, 1979).|$|E
5|$|Bill Nighy as Davy Jones: Malevolent {{ruler of}} the ocean realm, Captain of The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman.</b> With his heart {{captured}} by James Norrington, he is now enslaved to Cutler Beckett who commanded him to kill the Kraken ("your pet"), and now serves the East India Trading Company, though he remains volatile and makes life difficult for the marines policing him.|$|E
5|$|Solti's {{recordings}} {{with the}} Chicago Symphony included the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner and Mahler. Most of his operatic recordings were with other orchestras, but his recordings of The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> (1976), Fidelio (1979), Moses und Aron (1984) {{and his second}} recordings of Die Meistersinger (1995) and Verdi's Otello (1991) were made with the Chicago players.|$|E
5|$|Bill Nighy as Davy Jones: Captain of the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman.</b> Davy Jones {{was once}} a human being who was unable to bear the pain of losing his true love. He carved out his heart {{and put it into}} the Dead Man's Chest, then buried it in a secret location. He has become a bizarre {{creature}} – part octopus, part lobster, part man. Jones collects the souls of dead or dying sailors to serve aboard his ship for one hundred years.|$|E
5|$|Great Western trains {{included}} long-distance {{express services}} such as the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> the Cornish Riviera Express and the Cheltenham Spa Express. It also operated many suburban and rural services, some operated by steam railmotors or autotrains. The company pioneered the use of larger, more economic goods wagons than were usual in Britain. It operated a network of road motor (bus) routes, {{was a part of}} the Railway Air Services, and owned ships, docks and hotels.|$|E
5|$|In April 1964 Monteux {{conducted}} {{his last}} concert, {{which was in}} Milan with the orchestra of Radiotelevisione italiana. The programme consisted of the overture to The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> Brahms's Double Concerto and Berlioz's Symphonie fantastique. Unrealised plans included his debut at The Proms, and his 90th birthday concert, at which he intended to announce his retirement. In June 1964 Monteux suffered three strokes and a cerebral thrombosis {{at his home in}} Maine, where he died on 1 July at the age of 89.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to historical sources, Poe {{was influenced by}} other writers. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a general influence, and scenes of Pym and Dirk Peters in a cave echo scenes in Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, which many reviewers noted at the time, including London publications such as the Court Gazette and the Torch. The ship of corpses recalls {{the legend of the}} <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> a ship which is cursed and unable to return home.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> recordings and subsequent Arista recordings, Winter in America utilized a sparse production quality and {{small number of}} sessions musicians. A small supporting line-up, featuring drummer Bob Adams and bassist Danny Bowens, contributed on a few cuts. Adams and Bowens, who studied with Scott-Heron at Lincoln University, arrived from the Pennsylvania-based college {{on the last day}} of recording on October 15, 1973. Scott-Heron and Jackson handled most of the vocals, songwriting, and instrumentation, and they were assisted by Williams with the production.|$|E
5|$|Lord Beckett gains {{power over}} Davy Jones and, {{with the help}} of the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> he is now {{executing}} his plans to extinguish piracy forever. To stand against the East India Trading Co., Will, Elizabeth, Barbossa, and the crew of the Black Pearl set out to rescue Captain Jack Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. As one of the Nine Pirate Lords, Jack is needed in order to release an ancient goddess with the power to defeat Beckett's forces.|$|E
5|$|Music too {{has been}} {{inspired}} by the ocean. Sea shanties were chanted by mariners to help coordinate arduous tasks and impressions in music have been created of calm waters, crashing waves, and storms at sea. Classical sea-related music includes Richard Wagner's The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> Claude Debussy's La mer (1903–05), Charles Villiers Stanford's Songs of the Sea (1904) and Songs of the Fleet (1910), Edward Elgar's Sea Pictures (1899), and Ralph Vaughan Williams's A Sea Symphony (1903–1909).|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia did {{not appear}} at the Olympics again until 1960, {{although}} Rhodesian athletes {{had the option of}} competing internationally for South Africa. Leonard Hall, for example, won a gold medal in the welterweight division of the 1930 British Empire Games under the South African banner. By the time of the 1960 Summer Olympics, Southern Rhodesia was part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland (which included what is now Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) that entered the Games under the banner of Rhodesia. Fourteen athletes — nine men and five women — took part in six sports: track and field, boxing, diving, sailing, shooting, and swimming. Competing in the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> class, sailors Alan David Butler and Christopher Bevan finished fourth, which was Rhodesia's best result under that name. After the Federation dissolved in 1963, Nyasaland became Malawi, while Northern and Southern Rhodesia began competing separately. The North entered the Games as Northern Rhodesia, but left under the flag of Zambia, while the South remained Southern Rhodesia. It sent 25 men (including its field hockey squad) and four women; both the field hockey team and the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> crew finished 11th, while no individual athlete placed better than 17th.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary sea-{{inspired}} novels {{have been}} written by Joseph Conrad, Herman Wouk, and Herman Melville; poems about the sea {{have been written}} by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Rudyard Kipling and John Masefield. The sea has inspired much music over the centuries including sea shanties, Richard Wagner's The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> Claude Debussy's La mer (1903–05), Charles Villiers Stanford's Songs of the Sea (1904) and Songs of the Fleet (1910), Edward Elgar's Sea Pictures (1899) and Ralph Vaughan Williams' A Sea Symphony (1903–1909). Burial at sea has been practised in various ways by countries around the world since the ancient civilisations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome.|$|E
5|$|Former Kenya Airways' {{frequent}} flyer programme Msafiri was {{merged with}} KLM's <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> in 1997, which was in turn merged with that of Air France and rebranded as Flying Blue in 2005, following the fusion of both companies. Gold Elite and Platinum Elite members of the Flying Blue programme are offered the JV Lounge. This service is provided to Kenya Airways passengers, and to passengers flying with its partner airlines as well. Simba Lounge is a service provided to Kenya Airways Business passengers only. Both lounges are located at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.|$|E
5|$|Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company arrests Will and Elizabeth for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow in the {{previous}} film. Beckett offers clemency if Will agrees to search for Jack's compass {{in a bid to}} find the Dead Man's Chest – and inside, the heart of villainous Davy Jones – which would give Beckett control of the seas. However, Jack wants the Chest to escape from an unpaid debt with Jones, who made Jack captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years in exchange for 100 years of service aboard Jones' ship, the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nighthawk is a steel flying {{roller coaster}} from Vekoma located at Carowinds {{amusement}} park. The roller coaster originally opened as Stealth at California's Great America on April 1, 2000. In 2003, Paramount decided to relocate {{the roller coaster}} to Carowinds. It reopened as Borg Assimilator – the first coaster {{in the world to}} be themed to Star Trek – on March 20, 2004. After Cedar Fair purchased Carowinds in 2006, Paramount themes were soon removed from the park, and the ride was renamed Nighthawk. It is one of only three <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> models still in existence from Vekoma.|$|E
5|$|The vitriolic {{campaign}} of Richard Wagner against Meyerbeer {{was to a}} great extent responsible for the decline of Meyerbeer's popularity after his death in 1864. This campaign was as much a matter of personal spite as of racism – Wagner had learnt a great deal from Meyerbeer and indeed Wagner's early opera Rienzi (1842) was facetiously called by Hans von Bülow 'Meyerbeer's best opera'. Meyerbeer supported the young Wagner, both financially and in helping to obtain the premiere productions of both Rienzi and The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> at Dresden.|$|E
5|$|In 2011 David Pountney was {{appointed}} to succeed Fisher as chief executive. He had worked with the company since the 1970s, most recently on a 2006 The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> with Terfel which was set in space. In 2013 he programmed a trilogy of operas set in Tudor England: Donizetti's Anna Bolena, Maria Stuarda and Roberto Devereux, with another trilogy the following year, {{on the theme of}} fallen women – Puccini's Manon Lescaut, Henze's Boulevard Solitude and Verdi's La traviata. For 2016 Pountney scheduled another trilogy, this time on the theme of Figaro, consisting of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro and Rossini's The Barber of Seville and a new work, Figaro Gets a Divorce with music by Elena Langer and libretto by Pountney.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} former label <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> Records, Gil Scott-Heron {{signed with the}} New York City jazz-based Strata-East label in early 1973, {{accompanied}} by jazz keyboardist and songwriter Brian Jackson, {{with whom he had}} worked with on his previous studio albums, Pieces of a Man (1971) and Free Will (1972). While some sources allege this may have been over financial or creative differences, Scott-Heron maintained the switch was due to producer Bob Thiele's unwillingness to give Jackson co-billing. By the time of their move to Strata-East, Scott-Heron and Jackson had achieved underground notice among R and soul music listeners, particularly for the political and social nature of their music's themes, as well as Scott-Heron's emphasis on African-American culture and social plight in his compositions. Their musical fusion of jazz, blues, soul and spoken word styles helped them earn some notice among less-mainstream black music listeners at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{express services}} were often given nicknames by railwaymen but these names later appeared officially in timetables, on headboards {{carried on the}} locomotive, and on roofboards above {{the windows of the}} carriages. For instance, the late-morning <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> express between London and Exeter was named after the winning horse of the Derby and St Ledger races in 1849. Although withdrawn at the end of 1867, the name was revived in 1869– following a request from the Bristol and Exeter Railway– and the train ran through to Plymouth. An afternoon express was instigated on the same route in June 1879 and became known as The Zulu. A third West Country express was introduced in 1890, running to and from Penzance as The Cornishman. A new service, the Cornish Riviera Express ran between London and Penzance– non-stop to Plymouth– from 1 July 1904, although it ran only in the summer during 1904 and 1905 before becoming a permanent feature of the timetable in 1906.|$|E
5|$|The {{wedding of}} Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is halted when Lord Cutler Beckett, {{chairman}} of the East India Trading Company, arrives with arrest warrants for them, and also for Commodore James Norrington, who allowed Captain Jack Sparrow to escape. Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's flagship, HMS Dauntless in a hurricane while pursuing Sparrow. Jack Sparrow is visited by Will’s father Bootstrap Bill Turner, aboard the Black Pearl. Bootstrap is now a crewman on the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> captained by Davy Jones. Jack previously bartered a deal with Jones to raise the Pearl from the depths. Now Jack must join Jones' crew or be dragged to Davy Jones' Locker by the Kraken. Beckett, meanwhile, promises to free Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's magic compass which points to whatever the holder wants most.|$|E
5|$|After {{seeing how}} well the first film was made, {{the cast and crew}} signed for two sequels to be shot back-to-back, a {{practical}} decision on Disney's part to allow more time with the same cast and crew. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio knew that with an ensemble cast, they weren't free to invent totally different situations and characters, as with the Indiana Jones and James Bond series, and so had to retroactively turn The Curse of the Black Pearl into the first of a trilogy. They wanted to explore the reality of what would happen after Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's embrace {{at the end of the}} first film, and initially considered the Fountain of Youth as the plot device. They settled on introducing Davy Jones, the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> and the Kraken, a mythology mentioned twice in the first film. They introduced the historical East India Trading Company (also mentioned in the first film), which for them represented a counterpoint to the themes of personal freedom represented by pirates.|$|E

25|$|In autumn 1876 at the Lyceum Theatre, {{again with}} Carl Rosa, Santley revived his <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> {{this time in}} English, with Ostava Torriani as Senta. Between the London season and the provincial tour which {{followed}} they performed it 50 times. Among the cities visited were Edinburgh (four performances) and Glasgow (two performances).|$|E
25|$|The {{animated}} series SpongeBob SquarePants {{theme song}} is sung by Painty the Pirate, voiced by Pat Pinney.

25|$|In 1863 and '64 rate wars erupted {{again when}} Irving's old rival, Moore {{returned}} from the Stikine River, rich with profits and {{ready to take on}} the new Reliance with his <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> and Alexandra. Nevertheless, Irving managed to keep most of his customers and Moore claimed bankruptcy and his boats were taken from service.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, Moore {{returned}} the JW Moore and the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> to the Fraser River and, deciding to invest his Stikine fortune, ordered another sternwheeler from James Trahey, the Alexandra, which (having two funnels) was styled {{in the manner}} of Mississippi paddle steamers and would be the largest steamboat to that date on the Fraser.|$|E
25|$|Fokker's {{nickname}} was The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman.</b> In popular media, Hurd Hatfield portrayed {{him in the}} 1971 film Von Richthofen and Brown and {{the character}} Roy Fokker from the animated series Macross was {{named in honor of}} Anthony Fokker. Fokker is portrayed by Craig Kelly in the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles: Attack of the Hawkmen.|$|E
25|$|New Westminster {{soon had}} an {{opportunity}} to be grateful to Captain Moore, when the bitterly cold winter of 1861-62 froze the Fraser River from Lulu Island to Hope and isolated New Westminster from December until March 12, when Moore used the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> paddlewheel first and spent three days smashing a passage through the ice so supplies could be delivered to the little community.|$|E
25|$|The era {{came to an}} end in March 1914 with {{a three-week}} visit of the Quinlan English Opera Co at His Majesty's Theatre, Montreal; Wagner's {{complete}} Der Ring des Nibelungen was sung in Canada for the first time (and by 1990 still the only time), along with Tannhäuser, Lohengrin, The <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman,</b> and Tristan und Isolde. But attendance was poor, and the company decided to cut its losses and terminate its visit to Canada, even though performances had already been announced for Toronto.|$|E
25|$|With the {{liberalization}} of the European market, KLM started developing its hub at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol by feeding its network with traffic from affiliated airlines. As part of its development of a worldwide network, KLM acquired a 20% stake in Northwest Airlines in July 1989. In 1990, KLM carried 16,000,000 passengers. KLM president Jan de Soet retired {{at the end of}} 1990 and was succeeded in 1991 by Pieter Bouw. In December 1991, KLM was the first European airline to introduce a frequent flyer loyalty program, which was called <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman.</b>|$|E
25|$|The album {{marked the}} first of several future collaborations by Scott-Heron with {{musician}} Brian Jackson. It is one of Scott-Heron's most critically acclaimed albums and one of the <b>Flying</b> <b>Dutchman</b> label's best-selling LP's. Earning modest success upon its release, Pieces of a Man has since received retrospective notice and praise from critics. Music writers have noted Scott-Heron's and Jackson's musical fusion of soul, jazz-funk, and proto-rap styles on the album and its influence on subsequent dance and hip hop music. The album was reissued on compact disc by RCA Records in 1993.|$|E
