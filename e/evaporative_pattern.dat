5000|$|The American Metal Products Company {{was founded}} on June 6, 1914, in Milwaukee, WI by {{inventor}} August Littman, {{with a small group}} of other entrepreneurs. The company's first product was a specially-formulated bronze alloy hard enough to cut steel, aptly named Bronze — a name derived from the new company's own identity.An early version of the company's present diamond-shaped logo saw the day. It has remained in use in substantially the same recognizable format ever since. The American Metal Products Company slowly expanded its activities into the production of aluminium bronze alloys as sand castings, forgings and centrifugal castings.The company was renamed [...] "AMPCO METAL" [...] in 1930, by which time it had built itself a reputation as a reliable producer of high quality alloys.The Second World War strongly increased the demand for copper-based alloys and industrial bronzes, especially in the field of aeronautics. By 1944, manufacturing operations had grown from 100 to 2,500 employees, and every American airplane carried AMPCO METAL parts somewhere in its structure—in its engines, landing gear, propellers or airframe.In the marine environment, AMPCO METAL propellers were manufactured for landing barges and ships, and generally, AMPCO METAL alloys could be found in most sectors of military operations.Innovation was an important part of company philosophy from the outset. From 1922 onward into the 1970s, intensive research was done on the development of special non-sparking, non-magnetic hand tools for highly specialised fields such as the petroleum and natural gas industries, fire fighting and prevention, and the non-ferrous-metal welding sector. Centrifugally-cast bronzes, special hard bronzes for tooling and die applications, nickel-aluminium bronzes, high-strength aeronautical alloys as well as high-conductivity welding electrodes were all flagship products in these diverse industries.From the late 1950s, AMPCO METAL developed an extensive sales and distribution network in different countries, primarily across Europe, in order to increase contact with its various markets.In the 1970s, AMPCO METAL became the first alloy producer certified by the ASME (American Society of Mechanical Engineers) and in the 1980s, the first company to use EPC (<b>Evaporative</b> <b>Pattern</b> Casting) manufacturing processes in copper-based alloy production.In 2003, AMPCO METAL launched a sales and marketing department in Tian-Jin, China.AMPCO METAL is now active on three continents and in twelve countries.|$|E

40|$|Several {{problems}} {{not seen}} in conventional casting processes are encountered with the <b>evaporative</b> <b>pattern</b> casting process. A major one occurs when the foam pattern is evaporated by pouring molten metal. The pyrolysis of poly (methyl methacrylate) foam patterns by molten metal produce methyl methacrylate, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unburned hydrocarbons, and possibly small amounts of benzene. These volatile pyrolysis gases are harmful and released during metal casting using foam patterns. Consequently, caution must be exercised when handling these gases. Handling and disposal guidelines of these gases should also be developed at each site of use {{for the preservation of}} natural environment.

In the technique of <b>evaporative</b> <b>patterns,</b> the process of mould filling with molten metal (the said mould holding inside a polystyrene pattern) is interrelated with the process of thermal decomposition of this pattern. The process of polystyrene pattern evaporation in foundry mould under the effect of molten metal is of a very complex nature and depends on many different factors, still not fully investigated. The technology of <b>evaporative</b> <b>patterns</b> was used in manufacture of pilot castings of the high abrasion resistance plates. The material and the properties of the resultant castings were determined by the customer (patent protection). At the beginning of the studies, the properties of the pattern material were determined, patterns were assembled, the properties of the ceramic layer were determined as well as the technique of its preparation and application. The technique of molten metal feeding to the mould cavity was examined along with the parameters of the gating and feeding system, and casting cooling and solidification conditions (large contraction, shrinkage cavities and depressions) ...|$|R
40|$|Characterising the {{development}} of evapotranspiration through time is a difficult task, particularly when utilising remote sensing data, because retrieved information is often spatially dense, but temporally sparse. Techniques to expand these essentially instantaneous measures are not only limited, they are restricted by the general paucity of information describing the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of <b>evaporative</b> <b>patterns.</b> In a novel approach, temporal changes in land surface temperatures, derived from NOAA-AVHRR imagery and a generalised split-window algorithm, are used as a calibration variable in a simple land surface scheme (TOPUP) and combined within the Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology to provide estimates of areal evapotranspiration at the pixel scale. Such an approach offers an innovative means of transcending the patch or landscape scale of SVAT type models, to spatially distributed estimates of model output. The resulting spatial and temporal patterns of land surface fluxes and surface resistance are used to more fully understand the hydro-ecological trends observed across a study catchment in eastern Australia. The modelling approach is assessed by comparing predicted cumulative evapotranspiration values with surface fluxes determined from Bowen ratio systems and using auxiliary information such as in-situ soil moisture measurements and depth to groundwater to corroborate observed responses...|$|R

40|$|Because {{the pattern}} made of {{polystyrene}} {{is liable to}} deform in the molding process and its deformation reflects greatly on the dimension of castings, its deformation is very important problem for the <b>evaporative</b> <b>pattern</b> casting process. The method to accurately measure the occurred deformation by the strain gauge is proposed. It is found with 2. 5 inch gate valve pattern that the suitable washing on the pattern markedly decreases the deformation of the pattern and that the dimension of castings without casting practically can be assumed accurately by the pattern dimension on last molding process.

30|$|The {{reason for}} these slight {{accuracy}} drops {{is due to}} the fact that Autoflow© performs end-use classification based on pre-trained models with data collected across Australia, as a result, the maximum model efficiency would be obtained when it is tested against Australian data. On the other hand, the working mechanism in AutoflowU is independent of any existing collected data, which may lead to some misclassification errors when dealing with properties having complicated flow rate patterns. However, the most significant advantage of this new AutoflowU package is the classifying Type 2 <b>Evaporative</b> Cooler <b>pattern</b> as the achieved accuracy is higher than that using HMM and ANN (85.1 % compared to 82.6 %). The verification process has pointed out that due to the variant patterns of this complicated end use, which can be similar to tap, toilet, dishwasher and clothes washer, the efficiency of the advanced HMM and ANN model in Autoflow© dropped considerably when analysing any home whose <b>evaporative</b> cooler <b>patterns</b> possess similar features to the above mentioned end uses (i.e. this technique performs the classification based on assessing the flow rate pattern and physical characteristics of each event to make decision without inspecting the time pattern). In summary, the first testing has clearly indicates that the proposed enhanced system is able to address most of the end-use classification problems without the need of collecting data for model development and calibration.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the refractory coating which {{is a mixture of}} silica flour and kaolin on the surface roughness of the plate castings produced using <b>evaporative</b> <b>patterns</b> had been considered in this work. The kaolin was used as a binder and ratio method was employed to form basis for the factorial design of experiment which led to nine runs of experiments. Methyl alcohol at 99 % concentration was used as the carrier for the transfer of the coating {{to the surface of the}} patterns. Pouring temperature was observed as a process parameter alongside the mix ratios of the coating. Attempts were made to characterize the refractory coating by using two methods; differential thermal analysis (DTA) and X-ray diffraction. Attempt was also made to characterize the casting material. Gating system design was done for the plate casting to determine the correct proportions of the gating parameters in order to construct the gating system properly to avoid turbulence during pouring of liquid metal. A digital profilometer was used to take the measurements of the surface roughness. It was observed that the mix ratio 90 % silica flour- 10 % kaolin produced the lowest value of the surface roughness of the plate castings and had the lowest material loss in the DTA test. The pouring temperature of 650 °C produced best casting...|$|R
40|$|Extreme Quaternary climatic {{variation}} in Australia brought radical environmental changes to {{various parts of}} the continent. In this article, I discuss these changes in terms of mega-lake development in Central Australia, and in particular the southern Lake Eyre Basin (SLEB). The formation of these features, together with the fossil record of the region, throws light on the palaeoclimatic and palaeobiological relationships of megafauna and other animal groups, and the trophic development required to support them. Australian continental drying during the late Quaternary has been noted by many workers, but this process was punctuated by strong pluvial episodes of decreasing strength from MIS 5 e. Mega-lake development during MIS 5 resulted from unusual monsoonal and <b>evaporative</b> <b>patterns</b> at that time. However, the climatic forcing behind mega-lake formation and the rate of lake growth is not well understood, although species composition in SLEB aquatic fossil fauna assemblages attests to the size and development of these lakes and indicates their long-term persistence. The degree of trophic development and the maintenance of broad, well-bedded aquatic and terrestrial ecological frameworks and biotic variety support that conclusion. The fossil record contributes to our understanding of mega-lake and palaeoriverine trophic complexity, the speed and duration of lake-fill and the intensity and persistence of the supporting intracontinental moisture balance. Although other more remote mega-lakes formed in Central Australia, they were not populated by complex trophic systems or megafauna populations. This discrepancy between the various geographic areas sheds light on the biogeography and population distribution of megafauna, thus helping form a better picture of the reasons behind the final extinction of relict populations of this group in MIS 4...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{comparative}} study on the properties of Aluminium alloy (LM 6 - 12 %Si) castings in sand casting and <b>Evaporative</b> <b>pattern</b> casting (EPC) process.

40|$|In the <b>evaporative</b> <b>pattern</b> casting process, {{casting defects}} occur {{depending}} on {{the properties of the}} foam pattern itself and the coating material. In particular, the permeability of the coat strongly affects product quality. However, there are some difficulties in improving casting defects caused by the permeability because there exists no appropriate evaluating method for hot permeability. We propose a new convenient method for the high precision measurement of coating permeability from room temperature to elevated temperature (hot permeability) using a suction type permeability tester. Remarkable difference in the hot permeability of the coat is found even if the room temperature permeability of coat is the same. Additionally the nature of hot permeability of the coat is classified into three types, they are decrement in permeability, constant, and increase from room temperature. Evaluation of castings based on the hot permeability data obtained by this method in the actual production site reveals a slight influence on the pouring rate. Measurement of the hot permeability of coating should therefore be useful for preventing casting defects...|$|E
40|$|Estimates of hydrologic budgets from {{arid zones}} are {{constrained}} by difficulties in evaluating evaporation loss from groundwater discharge areas, especially playa surfaces. Evaporation from a salt-encrusted playa surface (Lake Amadeus, central Australia) is estimated by field measurement of moisture loss from sediment blocks in plastic receptacles {{set into the}} playa. The evaporation process consists of two distinctively different <b>evaporative</b> <b>patterns.</b> E I is a very low rate (70 =/year, 2. 4 % of pan evaporation) from the salt-encrusted surface. Ez is a much higher rate which occurs after rain dissolves the surface salt crust. The total E 2 evaporation {{is lower than the}} rainfall, indicating that a portion of rainfall recharges the playa brine. Therefore, the total E l (70 mm/year) can only be used as an upper limit of the net evaporation and the actual value may be significantly lower. In a laboratory analogue experiment, a very thin (2 mm) salt crust diminishes the evaporation to about 2 % of that from a fresh water surface, even though the sediments underlying the crust remain saturated. When distilled water was added to the salt crust, the evaporation rate increased by nearly 20 times for a short period, then returned to the previous low rate. However, a portion of the distilled water infiltrated to the watertable, and became part of the brine supply to the sediments. Both the salt crusts of Lake Amadeus and those formed in the laboratory experiment are porous and buckled, and significantly drier than the underlying sediments. The significant reduction of evaporation from salt-encrusted sediment surface seems to be mainly due to the porous, buckled and dry nature of the crust which inhibits the removal of the vapour from the underlying sediments. The vapour pressure decrease of the brine has relatively less effects...|$|R

Significant differences are found to be common and widespread for droughts, but not wet periods, when monthly data are examined. At pentad temporal resolution, which is more able to isolate floods and situations of atmospheric rivers, values of relative entropy over North America are typically 50 - 400 larger than at monthly time scales. Significant differences suggest that moisture transport may be the key to precipitation extremes. Where evaporative sources do not change significantly, it implies other local causes may underlie the extreme events...|$|R

Aluminum powder (0. 074 to 0. 104 mm) {{was used as}} the alloying element in the experiment. An alloying coating with excellent properties was fabricated, which mainly consisted of adhesive, co-solvent, suspending agent and other ingredients according to desired proportion. Mg-alloy melt was poured under certain temperature and the degree of negative pressure. The microstructure of the surface layer was examined by means of scanning electron microscopy. It has been found that a large volume fraction of network new phases were formed on the Mg-alloy surface, the thickness of the alloying surface layer increased with the alloying coating increasing from 0. 3 mm to 0. 5 mm, and the microstructure became compact. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was used to determine the chemical composition of the new phases. It showed that the new phases mainly consist of β-Mg 17 Al 12, in addition to a small quantity of inter-metallic compounds and oxides. A micro-hardness test and a corrosion experiment to simulate the effect of sea water were performed.

The transformation of an <b>evaporative</b> <b>pattern</b> (e. g. made from foamed polystyrene) from the solid into liquid and then gaseous state occurs {{as a result of the}} thermal effect that the liquid metal exerts onto this pattern.

40|$|The {{research}} of new ceramic coatings {{has an important}} role in the improvement and development of new casting methods, especially casting with meltable and evaporable patterns. The selection of ceramic materials to be used as refractory fillers, materials for the binding system and additives for maintaining suspension stability, will be carried out in accordance with the casting method selected for the actual alloys and types of castings. The actual importance of these problems is reflected in the fact that the application of quality coatings increases the production efficiency by producing high quality castings, increases the metal yield and eliminates the expensive casting operations-cleaning and machining. Cordierite ceramic are of great importance in modern technology. Standard raw materials, kaolin, talc, MgO, alumina, feldspar were used in the synthesis of cordierite ceramics. Sintered cordierite of the composition 2 MgO · 2 Al 2 O 3 · 5 SiO 2 was used as a refractory filler in a ceramic coating for evaporative polystyrene patterns in a new casting technology, the EPC Method. Cordierite characterization was carried out by means of X-ray diffraction. The characteristic temperatures for carrying out solid state reactions in the three component system 2 MgO · 2 A 12 O 3 · 5 SiO 2 were determined by differential thermal analysis in the range from ambient temperature to 1100 °C. In order to realistically evaluate possible cordierite application in the production of <b>evaporative</b> <b>pattern</b> ceramic coatings, concurrent analyses with a talc-based coating were carried out.

40|$|Liquid {{droplets}} containing {{suspended particles}} deposited on a solid, flat surface generally form ring-like structures {{due to the}} redistribution of solute during evaporation (the "coffee ring effect"). The forms of the deposited patterns depend on complex interactions between solute(s), solvent, and substrate in a rapidly changing, far from equilibrium system. Solute self-organization during evaporation of colloidal sessile droplets has {{attracted the attention of}} researchers {{over the past few decades}} due to a variety of technological applications. Recently, pattern formation during evaporation of various biofluids has been studied due to potential applications in medical screening and diagnosis. Due to the complexity of ‘real’ biological fluids and other multicomponent systems, a comprehensive understanding of pattern formation during droplet evaporation of these fluids is lacking. In this PhD dissertation, the morphology of the patterns remaining after evaporation of droplets of a simplified model biological fluid (aqueous lysozyme solutions + NaCl) are examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy. Lysozyme is a globular protein found in high concentration, for example, in human tears and saliva. The drop diameters, D, studied range from the micro- to the macro- scale (1 µm – 2 mm). In this work, the effect of evaporation conditions, solution chemistry, and heat transfer within the droplet on pattern formation is examined. In micro-scale deposits of aqueous lysozyme solutions (1 µm < D < 50 µm), the protein motion and the resulting dried residue morphology are highly influenced by the decreased evaporation time of the drop. The effect of electrolytes on pattern formation is also investigated by adding varying concentrations NaCl to the lysozyme solutions. Finally, a novel pattern recognition program is described and implemented which classifies deposit images by their solution chemistries. The results presented in this PhD dissertation provide insight into the <b>evaporative</b> behavior and <b>pattern</b> formation in droplets of simplified model biological fluids (aqueous lysozyme + NaCl). The patterns that form depend sensitively on the evaporation conditions, characteristic time and length scales, and the physiochemical properties of the solutions. The patterns are unique, dependent on solution chemistry, and may therefore act as a “fingerprint” in identifying fluid properties. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{colloidal}} suspension {{is a small}} constituent of insoluble solid particles suspended in a liquid medium. Control over the wetting, evaporation, and deposition patterns left by {{colloidal suspension}}s is valuable in many biological, medical, industrial, and agricultural applications. Understanding the governing principles of wetting and evaporative phenomena of these colloidal suspensions may lead to greater control over resultant deposition patterns. Perhaps the most familiar pattern forms when an initially heterogeneous colloidal suspension leaves a dark ring pattern {{at the edge of}} a drop. This pattern is referred to as a coffee-stain and it can be seen from dried droplets of spilled coffee. This coffee-stain effect was first investigated by Deegan et. al. who discovered that these patterns occur when outward radial flows driven by evaporation at the triple contact line dominate over other effects. While the presence of coffee-stain patterns is undesirable in many printing and medical diagnostic processes, it can also be advantageous in the production of low cost transparent conductive films, the deposition of metal vapor, and the manipulation of biological structures. Controlling the interactions between the substrate, liquid, vapor, and particles can lead to control over the size and morphology of <b>evaporative</b> deposition <b>patterns</b> left by aqueous colloidal suspensions. Several methods have been developed to control the evaporation of colloidal suspensions to either suppress or enhance the coffee stain effect. Electrowetting on Dielectric (EWOD) is one promising method that has been used to control colloidal depositions by applying either an AC or DC electric field. EWOD actuation has the potential to dynamically control colloidal deposition left by desiccated droplets to either suppress or enhance the coffee stain effect. It may also allow for independent control of the fluidic interface and deposition of particles via electrowetting and electrokinetic forces. Implementation of this technique requires that the colloidal droplet be separated from the active electrode by a dielectric layer to prevent electrolysis. A variety of polymer layers have been used in EWOD devices for a variety of applications. In applications that involve desiccation of colloidal suspensions, the material for this layer should be chosen carefully as it can play an important role in the resulting deposition pattern. An experimental method to monitor the transient evolution of the shape of an evaporating colloidal droplet and optically quantify the resultant deposition pattern is presented. Unactuated colloidal suspensions will be desiccated on a variety of substrates commonly used in EWOD applications. Transient image profiles and particle deposition patterns are examined for droplets containing fluorescent micro-particles. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of these results will be used to compare multiple different cases in an effort to provide insight into the effects of polymer selection on the drying dynamics and resultant deposition patterns of desiccated colloidal materials. It was found that the equilibrium and receding contact angles between the surface and the droplet play a key role in the evaporation dynamics and the resulting deposition patterns left by a desiccated colloidal suspension. The equilibrium contact angle controls the initial contact diameter for a droplet of a given volume. As a droplet on a surface evaporates, the evolution of the interface shape and the contact diameter can generally be described by three different regimes. The Constant Contact Radius (CCR) regime occurs when the contact line is pinned while the contact angle decreases. The Constant Contact Angle (CCA) regime occurs when the contact line recedes while the contact angle remains constant. The Mixed regime occurs when the contact radius and angle both reduce over time. The presence of the CCA regime allows the contact line to recede creating a more uniform deposition. However, not all droplets move into the CCA regime. Some remain in the CCR regime creating a coffee-stain pattern. In order to transition into the CCA regime, the dynamic contact angle of the droplet must be reduced to an angle close to the receding contact angle. Transient interface shapes and deposition patterns were examined on four surfaces: (i) Glass, (ii) Kapton HN polyimide tape, (iii) SU- 8 3005, and (iv) Teflon AF. Glass has a low equilibrium contact angle and a very low receding contact angle resulting in a large uniform coffee-stain deposition. Kapton HN and SU- 8 3005 have similar equilibrium contact angles that result in similar initial contact diameters. However, Kapton HN pins at that initial diameter due to a low receding contact angle producing a smaller more intense coffee-stain. SU- 8 3005 has a large receding contact angle that allows for the transition into the CCA regime which results in a smaller, more uniform, and more intense spot. Teflon AF has the largest equilibrium and receding contact angle producing the smallest, most uniform, and most intense spot. Results presented here suggest that a lower receding contact angle is beneficial in areas where the coffee-stain effect needs to be enhanced while a larger receding contact angle is beneficial in areas where the coffee-stain needs to be suppressed. Preliminary results are also presented examining droplets actuated via AC electrowetting to examine the effect of electrode geometry and applied voltage on electrowetting behavior and colloidal depositions in these cases. It was found that the Young-Lippmann equation needs to be modified to satisfy the modified capacitance per unit area of a system with different electrode geometries...|$|R
