Stocking density and <b>graded</b> <b>size</b> after harvest significantly affected their composition. Higher total lipid contents were found in large (> 0. 6 g) P. helleri(16 – 19 g kg 1 WM) and those grown at the lowest density(1000 m 2 : 18 g kg 1 WM) than in small (≤ 0. 6 g) ones (14 g kg 1 WM) and those grown at the highest densities (4000 – 6000 m 2 : 13 – 16 g kg 1 WM).

Recipients of optimally functioning, long-standing allografts and living donors undergoing nephrectomy served as functional (n = 14) and structural controls (n = 10), respectively. Marked elevation above control of fractional clearance of dextrans of <b>graded</b> <b>size</b> was consistent with transtubular backleak of 57 % of filtrate (inulin) in sustained ARF. No backleak was detected in recovering ARF. To explore a structural basis for backleak, allograft biopsies were taken intraoperatively, 1 h after reperfusion in all recipients, and again on day 7 after transplant in a subset (n = 10). Electron microscopy revealed disruption of both apical and basolateral membranes of proximal tubule cells in both sustained and recovering ARF, but cell exfoliation and tubule basement membrane denudation were negligible. Histochemical analysis of membrane-associated adhesion complexes confirmed an abnormality of proximal but not distal tubule cells, marked in sustained ARF but not in recovering ARF. Staining for the zonula occludens complex (ZO- 1) and adherens complex (alpha, beta, and gamma catenins) revealed diminished intensity and redistribution of each cytoskeletal protein from the apico-lateral membrane boundary.

40|$|As {{ubiquitous}} conduits for intercellular {{transport and}} communication, gap junctional pores {{have been the}} subject of numerous investigations aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying permeability and selectivity. Dye transfer studies provide a broadly useful means of detecting coupling and assessing these properties. However, given evidence for selective permeability of gap junctions and some anomalous correlations between junctional electrical conductance and dye permeability by passive diffusion, the need exists to give such studies a more quantitative basis. This article develops a detailed diffusion model describing experiments (reported separately) involving transport of fluorescent dye from a “donor” region to an “acceptor” region within a pair of Xenopus oocytes coupled by gap junctions. Analysis of transport within a single oocyte is used to determine the diffusion and binding characteristics of the cellular cytoplasm. Subsequent double-cell calculations then yield the intercellular junction permeability, which is translated into a single-channel permeability using concomitant measurements of intercellular conductance, and known single-channel conductances of gap junctions made up of specific connexins, to count channels. The preceding strategy, combined with use of a <b>graded</b> <b>size</b> series of Alexa dyes, permits a determination of absolute values of gap junctional permeability as a function of dye size and connexin type. Interpretation of the results in terms of pore theory suggests significant levels of dye-pore affinity consistent with the expected order of magnitude of typical (e. g., van der Waals) intermolecular attractions. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction - The risk {{of breast}} cancer {{recurrence}} has been linked to tumour <b>size,</b> <b>grade,</b> oestrogen (ER) receptor status, and degree of lymph node (LN) involvement. However, the role of these variables in predicting time to relapse is not well defined. This study was designed to identify patient and primary tumour characteristics that predict risk periods for breast cancer recurrence within our institution, to enable more tailored surveillance strategies. Methods - We retrospectively studied a cohort of 473 patients who presented to The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Adelaide, Australia, with recurrent breast cancer between 1968 and 2008. Patient and primary tumour characteristics were collected, including age, menopausal status, tumour <b>grade,</b> <b>size,</b> ER and progesterone receptor (PR) status, and LN involvement and modeled against time to relapse using Kaplan–Meier survival curves. Results - High tumour <b>grade,</b> <b>size</b> ≥ 20 mm, ER negativity, and PR negativity were shown on univariate analysis to correlate significantly with earlier recurrence (P < 0. 0001, P = 0. 0012, P = 0. 0006, and P = 0. 006). Multivariate analysis identified tumour <b>grade</b> and <b>size</b> as significant predictors of timing of relapse after adjustment for other variables. LN involvement, menopausal status, and age did not significantly correlate with earlier recurrence. Conclusions - High tumour <b>grade</b> and larger <b>size</b> were shown to independently predict earlier breast cancer relapse. While LN involvement increases absolute recurrence risk, our study proposes that it does not influence timing of relapse. Use of these predictors will enable key risk periods for onset of relapse to be characterised according to tumour profile with more appropriate discharge to primary care providers for ongoing surveillance.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years the average grade of ore bodies has {{significantly}} decreased while {{the proportion of}} waste removal has in many cases more than doubled. This in turn {{has led to a}} major increase in energy consumption and decrease in productivity across mining operations. Metal preconcentration at coarse scale (10 – 100 mm) by screening has the potential to reverse decreasing mining productivity trends through early rejection of uneconomic grade material prior to energy intensive comminution. Metal preconcentration of feed grades using screening exploits the propensity of certain ores to preferentially deport metal into specific size fractions during breakage. This phenomenon is referred as preferential <b>grade</b> by <b>size</b> deportment. The exploitation of preferential <b>grade</b> by <b>size</b> response involves generation of multiple streams with different metal content post screening. Streams can be engineered for different grade characteristics suitable for different processing destination (eg: as waste, leach, and mill).

Studies using tetrahexylammonium were not quantitatively analyzed as its effect was insufficiently reversible. Each in this series of symmetric ions of <b>graded</b> <b>size</b> blocks the potassium conductance when added to the internal perfusion fluid. There is a general trend for blocking potency to increase with increasing size. We attribute this to stronger interactions of the longer alkyl side chains with hydrophobic regions of the membrane near the channels. Steady-state block by the TAA ions, n = 2 - 5, showed identical voltage dependence, apparently sensing about 15 % of the transmembrane voltage, and kinetics block onset were qualitatively similar. We conclude that the site of action for these ions is the same. Block by TMA is about twice as steeply dependent on voltage. In its action, TMA resembles the alkali cations (French et al., 1979, Biophys, J. 25 (2, pt. 2) : 307 a) more than the larger TAA ions. Our results suggest that access to the inner mouth of the K channel is even less restricted than has been previously thought. A calculation indicates that the lumen of the channel cannot be both wide enough to admit the TAA ions and long enough to account for the voltage dependence of block.

To elucidate the abnormality of body fluid homeostasis that attends the nephrotic syndrome, {{we compared the}} atrial hormonal and renal excretory and vasomotor responses to water immersion of nephrotic patients (N = 10) with those of healthy controls (N = 9). Nephrotics exhibited depressed baseline levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP, P < 0. 05) and lower rates of urine flow and sodium excretion (P < 0. 01). Although immersion-induced hypervolemia increased plasma ANP to equivalent levels (75 ± 19 vs. 60 ± 6 pg/ ml), the disparity in corresponding urinary flow (5 ± 1 vs. 13 ± 2 ml/ min, P < 0. 01) and sodium excretion (171 ± 42 vs. 540 ± 65 µEq/min, P < 0. 01) grew larger. In contrast, immersion caused an equivalent reduction of renal vascular resistance by 16 and 17 %, respectively (P < 0. 01). Despite higher renal plasma flow and lower oncotic pressure of plasma, the glomerular filtration rate remained constant during immersion in both groups. Similar constancy of fractional clearances of dextrans of <b>graded</b> <b>size</b> suggests that immersion may have lowered the glomerular transcapillary hydraulic pressure difference (ΔP). We conclude that renal vasomotor responsiveness to hypervolemia is preserved in nephrotics, but that the mediatory role of ANP in this response is uncertain. By contrast, diminished responsiveness of the distal nephron to the natriuretic action of endogenous ANP could contribute to edema formation in the nephrotic syndrome...|$|E

To {{determine the}} reliability of creatinine {{as a measure of}} the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), we compared the simultaneous clearance of creatinine to that of three true filtration markers of <b>graded</b> <b>size</b> in 171 patients with various glomerular diseases. Using inulin (radius [rs] = 15 Å) as a reference marker, we found that the fractional clearance of 99 mTc-DTPA (rs = 4 Å) was 1. 02 ± 0. 14, while that of a 19 Års dextran was 0. 98 ± 0. 13, with neither value differing from unity. In contrast, the fractional clearance (relative to inulin) of creatinine (rs = 3 Å) exceeded unity, averaging 1. 64 ± 0. 05 (P < 0. 001), but could be lowered towards unity by acute blockade of tubular creatinine secretion by IV cimetidineCross-sectional analysis of all 171 patients revealed fractional creatinine secretion to vary inversely with GFR. This inverse relationship was confirmed also among individual patients with either deteriorating (N = 28) or remitting (N = 26) glomerular disease, who were studied longitudinally. As a result, changes in creatinine relative to inulin clearance were blunted considerably or even imperceptible. We conclude that true filtration markers with rs < 20 Å, including inulin, are unrestricted in glomerular disease, and that creatinine is hypersecreted progressively by remnant renal tubules as the disease worsens. Accordingly, attempts to use creatinine as a marker with which to evaluate or monitor glomerulopathic patients will result in gross and unpredictable overestimates of the GFR...|$|E

To examine whether persistence of postischemic, tubular cell injury accounts for delayed recovery from ARF, we studied 10 patients developing protracted (36 +/- 4 d) ARF after cardiac surgery. The differential clearance and excretion dynamics of probe solutes of <b>graded</b> <b>size</b> were determined. Inulin clearance was depressed (5. 0 +/- 1. 7 ml/min), while the fractional urinary clearance of dextrans (radii 17 - 30 A) were elevated above unity. Employing a model of conservation of mass, we calculated that 44 % of filtered inulin was lost via transtubular backleak. The clearance and fractional backleak of technetium-labeled DTPA ([99 mTc]DTPA, radius = 4 A) were identical to those of inulin (radius 15 A). The time at which inulin or DTPA excretion reached a maximum after an intravenous bolus injection was markedly delayed when compared with control subjects with ARF of brief duration, 102 vs. 11 min. Applying a three-compartment model of inulin/DTPA kinetics (which takes backleak into account) revealed the residence time of intravenously administered inulin/DTPA in the compartment occupied by tubular fluid and urine to be markedly prolonged, 20 vs. 6 min in controls, suggesting reduced velocity of tubular fluid flow. We conclude that protracted human ARF is characterized by transtubular backleak of glomerular ultrafiltrate, such that inulin clearance underestimates true glomerular filtration rate by approximately 50 %, and by sluggish tubular fluid flow, which strongly suggests the existence of severe and generalized intraluminal tubular obstruction. Because all patients also exhibited extreme hyperreninemia (16 +/- 2 ng/ml per h) that was inversely related to inulin clearance (r value = - 0. 83) and urine flow (r value = - 0. 70), we propose that persistent, angiotensin II-mediated renal vasoconstriction may have delayed healing of the injured tubular epithelium...|$|E

Sieving coefficients of uncharged dextrans of <b>graded</b> <b>size</b> (radii 30 to 60 Å) {{were used to}} characterize barrier size-selectivity in nonazotemic diabetic humans with microalbuminuria (Group 1, N = 11) or macroalbuminuria (Group 2, N = 21). Compared to a non-diabetic control group (N = 21) the low radius end of the sieving profile was depressed, whereas the high radius end was elevated in each diabetic group, more so in Group 2 than Group 1. A heteroporous membrane model revealed the major portion of the glomerular barrier to be perforated by restrictive pores of ∼ 56 Å radius in all three groups. However, in keeping with a parallel trend for GFR, the relative density of restrictive pores was control > Group 1 > Group 2. The remaining minor portion of the barrier was perforated by large, shunt-like pores, the relative prominence of which ranked Group 2 > Group 1 > control. Although the hypothetical, fractional clearance of macromolecule s attributable to the shunt-like pores varied directly with fractional clearances of albumin and IgG, the progressive increment in the latter fractional protein clearances in the two diabetic groups was disproportionate. This {{raises the possibility that}} factors in addition to barrier size defects contribute to the development, magnitude and composition of proteinuria early in the course of diabetic glomerular disease. Such factors could include: (1) a progressive decrement in fractional reab-sorption as the filtered protein load increases, and (2) a concomitant loss of barrier charge-selectivity, permitting albumin but not IgG to escape through restrictive pores, and thereby accounting for an observed excess of albumin over IgG clearance in both micro- and macroalbuminuric stages of diabetic glomerular disease...|$|E

The diagnostic feature of the data determined by this preliminary investigation indicate the possibilities of utilizing heavy mineral characteristics, as analternative to fossil evidence, for the differentiation or correlation of these quartzites. ...|$|R
40|$|Early gangue {{rejection}} {{or metal}} preconcentration at coarse scale (millimetres) based on size {{has been identified}} as a feasible operating alternative whereby energy efficiency and unit metal productivity can be greatly increased. This is achieved by understanding and exploiting ore-specific preferential <b>grade</b> by <b>size</b> responses. Preferential <b>grade</b> by <b>size</b> refers to the propensity of some ores to naturally concentrate metal into specific size fractions during breakage. The magnitude of metal deportment is described through a Ranking Response parameter (RR). This parameter has been used to measure the extent of "liberation at coarse scale". Mineral Liberation is defined as the measurable rock property that can link with a downstream separation technique which aims to concentrate valuable material to produce a saleable product. Liberation traditionally has been defined at grain scale whereby the efficiency of processes such as flotation is greatly dependent on particle properties at micro scale (microns). However, in size-based coarse separation the efficiency relies on having a processing stream with a strong <b>grade</b> variability across <b>size</b> fractions (i. e. high <b>grade</b> by <b>size</b> response) and therefore a high RR value. This work aims to develop a model to predict preferential <b>grade</b> by <b>size</b> response, in terms of the RR of ores as a function of particle size distribution and size reduction process. To achieve these aims a novel methodology has been developed comprising a new preferential <b>grade</b> by <b>size</b> characterisation method coupled with Monte Carlo and comparative statistical methods (analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test). Six run of mine (ROM) bulk samples from 3 different geological style deposits (stock work vein hosted, Cu-Mo breccia porphyry and Cu-Mo volcanic porphyry) have been utilised in the analysis. This methodology provides useful insights for the development of an optimum coarse separation circuit flowsheet design for preconcentration prior to energy intensive and inefficient grinding...|$|R
