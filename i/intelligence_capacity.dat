On 14 June 1927, Lieutenant Reino Hallamaa was transferred to the Statistics Office of Defence Command, a cover for the military intelligence unit, and ordered to create a radio <b>intelligence</b> <b>capacity</b> for the Finnish Defence Forces. To kickstart the process, Hallamaa studied radio intelligence theory and methods around Europe, recruited mathematicians and Russian translators, procured signal detectors and radio receivers, built listening stations and started exchanging decrypted messages with counterparts. For example, he visited Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Czechoslovakia and Poland to examine SIGINT and cryptanalysis capabilities and equipment.|$|E
