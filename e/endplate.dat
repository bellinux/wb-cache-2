5|$|Several teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. McLaren, Red Bull, and Williams all revised their front wings. McLaren's revision was designed to separate airflow into two separate channels, with both directing airflow around the outside of the car's front tyres. Red Bull's design, used in the Friday practice sessions, had two vertical slots to the rear of its <b>endplate</b> along with another to avoid creating a vortex when it operated with the planes and <b>endplate.</b> A previous design, debuted at the British Grand Prix, was used both in qualifying and in the race. In addition, the team used a revised diffuser to allow for better management of airflow {{to the top of the}} diffuser's side section. Williams's design debuted for the first time and was designed to make the tyre act like a diffuser which took air in to improve its efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg {{served a}} three-place grid penalty {{following}} qualifying after being deemed at-fault for {{a collision with}} Williams driver Felipe Massa at the previous event in Singapore. Red Bull equipped both of their cars with new turning vanes for the Grand Prix {{in order to improve}} the airflow underneath the car and therefore create more downforce. The new device had previously only been used by Daniil Kvyat during the previous race in Singapore. After a poor performance in Singapore, Mercedes introduced a revised rear wing <b>endplate,</b> while McLaren brought a new front wing to Suzuka.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{hit back}} in the second session on Friday night, with Nico Rosberg leading his {{teammate}} Lewis Hamilton by about a tenth of a second. The Ferraris were about half a second behind, with Räikkönen again the faster of the two. It was another dismal session for Jenson Button who had to park his car halfway through the session, though he was able to come back for a couple of laps {{towards the end of the}} session. A late red flag came out when Vettel, braking slowly into turn one, was clipped by the Force India of Sergio Pérez, taking off part of his front wing <b>endplate.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the expression of}} fetal and adult acetylcholine receptor (AChR) isoforms among extraocular muscle (EOM) en plaque and en grappe <b>endplates.</b> Methods. Antibodies against peptide fragments of the y- and e-subunits of the fetal and adult AChRs and a-bungarotoxin were used in immunofluorescence experiments to stain rat neonatal leg, adult diaphragm, and extraocular rectus muscle <b>endplates.</b> Results. Anti-e antibodies intensely stained diaphragm <b>endplates</b> and weakly stained rare neonatal <b>endplates.</b> Anti-y antibodies stained neonatal, but not diaphragm, <b>endplates.</b> Anti-e antibodies bound to all en plaque and en grappe <b>endplates</b> of extraocular muscle. Anti- 7 antibodies bound to global and orbital en grappe <b>endplates.</b> All en plaque <b>endplates</b> of the orbital region and a subset of <b>endplates</b> in the global region stained with anti-y antibodies. Conclusions. All en grappe <b>endplates</b> and certain en plaque <b>endplates</b> of EOM are the only mature <b>endplates</b> that coexpress the adult and fetal AChR isoforms. The expression of both isoforms may be important to determine contractile properties, protein expression regulation, and EOM susceptibility to myasthenia gravis.

40|$|International audienceExtraction and {{acceleration}} {{of positive and}} negative ions from a strong electronegative plasma and from an ion&# 8208;ion plasma is investigated in the PEGASES thruster, working with SF 6. The plasma is generated in a cylindrical quartz tube terminated by metallic <b>endplates.</b> The electrons are confined by a static magnetic field along the axis of the cylinder. The electron mobility along the field is high and the electrons are determining the sheaths in front of the <b>endplates.</b> The core plasma potential can therefore be controlled by the bias applied to the <b>endplates.</b> An ion&# 8208;ion plasma forms at the periphery as a result of electron confinement and ions can freely diffuse along the perpendicular direction or extraction axis. Langmuir probe and RFEA measurements are carried out along this axis. The measured ion energy distributions shows a single peak centered around a potential consistent with the plasma potential and the peak position could be controlled with a positive voltage applied to the <b>endplates.</b> When the <b>endplates</b> are biased negatively, the plasma potential saturates and remained close to 15 V. A beam of negatively charged particles can be observed under certain conditions when the <b>endplates</b> were biased negatively...|$|R
5|$|King {{made contact}} with Canamasas in the fourth corner while driving {{alongside}} him during lap four. Both went off the circuit, with Canamasas sustaining front wing damage, which stopped his car. He became the race's second (and final) retirement. King continued but rejoined in 12th. Leal's pace had slowed due to tyre degradation. This allowed Haryanto to close up to Leal who passed him by deploying DRS {{to move into the}} lead around the inside on lap eight in turn one. Evans attempted to move in front of Leal but ran wide, allowing the latter to retake the second position. Visoiu took advantage and overtook Leal for second place. Evans again drove aggressively but Leal was defensive and his front wing <b>endplate</b> glanced Evans' front-left tyre at the turn eight hairpin. Evans drove to the pit lane for replacement tyres. Leal remained on the track, but was overtaken by Visoiu for second at the first corner on lap 10. Rossi moved ahead of Leal for sixth place, while King recovered to run in ninth position.|$|E
5|$|Some teams {{modified}} {{their cars}} {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull and Williams revised their brake ducts. Williams team changed their brake ducts at the front to improve airflow inside the tyres and direct the duct towards their car's central section more efficiently. Red Bull's brake ducts, which had been changed for the third consecutive Grand Prix, reintroduced a small fin seen at the Singapore Grand Prix; for Korea two aerodynamic fins were fitted and a larger duct was introduced. McLaren modified a version of their front wings first introduced in Singapore. The team added a vertical gurney flap and an additional vertical slot at the front wing <b>endplate</b> to improve airflow outside the front tyres and increase the amount of downforce and therefore grip produced by the bodywork. The team also brought a new rear wing and tested a new revision of their F-duct system that débuted at the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka. Ferrari revised their diffuser with curved profiles and one large middle plate designed to improve the extraction of air {{from the bottom of the}} F10. As in Suzuka, Toro Rosso ran an F-duct system in the Friday practice sessions.|$|E
5|$|The {{third round}} of green-flag pit stops {{commenced}} fifteen laps later when Bräck became the first driver to stop. Franchitti inherited the first position until he made his pit stop on lap 143, handing it to Manning. This meant Manning became the first driver to lead his début CART race twice. The fourth caution was necessitated on the 155th lap when Manning's right-hand rear wing <b>endplate</b> became detached and landed on the track {{between the first and}} second turns. Manning made a pit stop but his crew elected not to make repairs to his rear wing. It assisted in making his car develop less understeer and slightly improved its balance. Racing resumed on lap 163 with Bräck leading a single-file restart. The left side of Kanaan's car collided heavily with the wall on the backstraight six laps later, triggering the fifth (and final) caution. All drivers (including Bräck) made pit stops under caution. A crew member on Bräck's team dropped a left-rear wheel nut dropping him to ninth place. Fernández was observed speeding and was required to move to the rear of the field. Da Matta's team were slow to fit his right-rear tyre preventing him from taking the first position and he emerged in second place.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{scientific}} study of mummies provides an insight {{into the life of}} past populations. Using CT-Osteoabsorptiometry (CT-OAM), a noninvasive technique based on conventional CT-data sets, it is possible to visualize the mineral density distribution in the subchondral bone plate, representing the long-term loading conditions of the articulation surface. The objective of the current study was to investigate the applicability of CT-OAM on mummies for the load analysis of joints as a new investigation technique in the field of mummy research. Material and methods: In order to clarify if apparent malpositions of the spinal column have existed during lifetime or occurred post-mortem, we evaluated the long-term loading patterns within the thoracic and lumbar <b>endplates</b> of 8 mummies. Results: The implementation of CT-OAM on mummies for load analysis of joints was feasible. The mineral density distribution within the <b>endplates</b> was not homogenous but followed distinct distribution patterns. In all of the <b>endplates</b> investigated the marginal zones were higher and the central areas lower mineralized, whereby the areas of greatest density were found in the peripheral marginal zones. The vertebra columns without malposition showed within the thoracic <b>endplates</b> an almost even circular allocation of the density maxima, whereas within the lumbar <b>endplates</b> an increased localization of the density maxima dorsomedial, dorsolateral and ventral was observed. The thoracic <b>endplates</b> of the spines with kyphosis did not show an even circular allocation anymore but a concentration of the density maxima in the ventral area and the <b>endplates</b> of the spines with scoliosis exhibited a predominant localization of the density maxima on the concave side. The examined <b>endplates</b> showed characteristic reproducible density patterns consistent with the long-term loading conditions. Conclusions: With help of CT-OAM pathological load distributions can be visualized before macroscopical changes appear and the information obtained can be useful to solve paleopathological and paleoarchaeological questions...|$|R

5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{dominant}} run was derailed in Abu Dhabi {{when his}} car {{was found to have}} insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved {{to the back of the}} grid. As Lewis Hamilton led the race away from the start, Vettel started from pit lane and took advantage of a chaotic opening corner that saw Nico Hülkenberg, Paul di Resta, Romain Grosjean and Bruno Senna tangle; Hülkenberg was forced out, while di Resta and Grosjean pitted with damage. Vettel began to round up the HRTs, Marussias and Caterhams, but his early progress came at the expense of his front wing <b>endplate</b> when he made contact with Senna at Turn 8 switchback. He chose not to pit for the time being, as the race was interrupted by the intervention of the safety car. Nico Rosberg, who had been forced to pit with damage to his front wing, was in the process of overtaking Narain Karthikeyan as Karthikeyan's car began to fail and the Indian quickly slowed. Rosberg, caught unawares by Karthikeyan's troubles, was launched over the back of the HRT and into the barrier. During the safety car period, Vettel was forced to pit when he swerved to avoid Daniel Ricciardo and crashed into the polystyrene bollard marking the start of the DRS zone, further damaging his wing. Red Bull Racing took the opportunity to pit him early, with the downside being that Vettel would have to do 42 laps on the soft tyre when supplier Pirelli predicted they could only do 36. Meanwhile, Hamilton suffered another mechanical failure while leading the race, and was once again forced out, handing the lead to Kimi Räikkönen while Fernando Alonso inherited second. Vettel began to work his way through the field again, but was forced to make a second stop when his tyres started losing grip. He was saved by the second appearance of the safety car moments later, brought about when di Resta forced Sergio Pérez wide; as Pérez rejoined the circuit, he cut back across the front of Grosjean and the two made contact, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Mark Webber. Grosjean and Webber retired, whilst Pérez was given a stop-go penalty. When racing resumed, Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso, who was being harried by Jenson Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, and he started chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Räikkönen held on to secure his – and Lotus F1's – first victory of the season. Alonso was second, while Vettel caught and passed Button to complete the podium, keeping a ten-point championship lead in the process. With both Alonso and Vettel finishing on the podium with him, Räikkönen's win was not enough to keep him in contention for the World Drivers' Championship, leaving the title to be fought out between Alonso and Vettel over the final two races of the season.|$|E

25|$|The General Aircraft Corporation was {{established}} to build an aircraft designed by Doctor Otto C. Koppen from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The aircraft was the G1-80 Skyfarer, a two-seat cabin high-wing braced monoplane with a light alloy basic structure and a mixed steel tube and fabric covering. It had an unusual tail unit, a cantilever tailplane with the elevator mounted on the upper surface of the tail with aluminum <b>endplate</b> fins and no movable rudders.|$|E
25|$|Configured with 85 seats, {{the cabin}} was spacious and {{well-appointed}} with comfortable seats widely spaced, giving plenty of legroom, {{but due to}} the low cabin floor and wide diameter, there was much unusable space which limited baggage and cargo volume. The inefficient use of cabin volume contributed greatly to the low payload/TOW ratio which was much {{lower than that of}} the contemporary Ilyushin Il-18, but which was still higher than the Tupolev Tu-104. A later production version, the An-10A, addressed some of the efficiency concerns by increasing the number of seats from 85 to 89 and 100 (in the two versions of the An-10A), then to 117–118 and finally 132 through reducing seat pitch and changing the cabin layout. Powered by Ivchenko AI-20K engines the An-10A demonstrated superior performance and an increased maximum payload of 14.5 Tonnes (31,970lb). The auxiliary <b>endplate</b> fins eventually gave way to improved splayed ventral fins under the rear fuselage. The directional stability was now acceptable and the new ventral fins also improved longitudinal stability at high g and on landing approach, as well as delaying the onset of Mach buffet to M0.702. Due to being sited in an area of flow separation, the new ventral fins also caused unpleasant vibrations. Following results of flight tests and at least two fatal crashes, an effective tailplane deicing system was retrofitted to all remaining aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The {{first race}} began at 12:00 Azerbaijan Time (...) on 18 June. Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the event were hot with an air temperature at [...] and an track temperature of [...] At the outset, Giovinazzi made a slow start and fell to fifth. Matsushita took over the lead and maintained the position heading into the first corner. Sirotkin moved from third to seventh. A multi-car collision occurred at the first turn when Gasly attempted to overtake Nato around the outside. But, as the amount of room going alongside the inside barriers was reduced, the two drivers made contact. Nato was sent into a spin, and as Gasly drove slowly away from the corner, Canamasas went into the rear-end of his car. Kirchhöfer drove into Lynn and Latifi was caught up in the incident. With the exception of Nato, all drivers retired from the race because of the damage sustained to their cars. Sirotkin battled with a Racing Engineering car in turn five but made contact with him, which damaged the front wing's left <b>endplate.</b> The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car which drove into the pit lane {{at the start of the}} third lap to allow racing to continue. Marciello passed Matsushita to take over first place in the first corner by running in his slipstream, although the latter reclaimed the position by passing Marciello on the start/finish straight after drafting behind him.|$|E
40|$|Chamber <b>endplates</b> {{in which}} {{the inner and outer}} radii are at the same z {{coordinate}} (such as both <b>endplates</b> of the BaBar drift chamber) suffer large deflections under the wire load if they are only supported at the outer radius. By making the inner cylinder load bearing the deflections of the <b>endplates</b> would be reduced by a factor of ≈ 30. This would permit the use of thinner <b>endplates,</b> or simplify the prestressing operation, or both. Of course, both the inner and outer cylinders must be stable against buckling under the wire load. Calculations indicate that a 540 -µm-thick carbon-fiber inner cylinder would be just at the buckling limit, while a 1. 5 -mm-thick cylinder would buckle only at 10 times nominal load. A recent destructive test at Princeton supports these calculations. A 1. 5 -mm-thick inner cylinder would present 0. 7 % radiation lengths to particles, a modest increment to that of the adjacent PEP-II support tube (presently spec’ed to be 1. 2 % of a radiation length, not counting aluminum needed for an rf shield) ...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{recovery}} after transection of the {{sciatic nerve}} in adult rats is poor, {{probably because of}} abnormalities in reinnervation. Denervation and reinnervation patterns were studied morphologically in the lateral gastrocnemius (LGC), tibialis anterior (TA), and soleus (SOL) muscles for 21 weeks after nerve transection (motor <b>endplates</b> by acetylcholinesterase staining; nerves by silver impregnation). Motor <b>endplates</b> in the TA showed improving morphology with age, and, at 21 weeks, three-quarters of these were normal. Poorest recovery was observed in the SOL, as, at 21 weeks, only one-third of the motor <b>endplates</b> had a normal morphology. Polyneuronal innervation initially was more pronounced in the SOL, but, at 21 weeks, 10 % of the motor <b>endplates</b> in all three muscles were still polyneuronally innervated. Our results indicate important differences in the reinnervation of these three hindleg muscles, and, even at 5 months, abnormalities were still present.

500|$|On lap 39, Webber asked Red Bull {{to advise}} Vettel {{to reduce his}} speed but his request was {{rejected}} due to the quick pace and the close distance between themselves and the McLaren cars. Webber entered fuel-saving mode on lap 40 which lost him performance while Vettel had saved one kilogram of fuel and opted to run on a faster engine setting. Vettel got a run exiting turn eleven and took to the inside lane to draw alongside Webber on the back straight. As the pair approached turn twelve, they made contact at high-speed which sent Vettel spinning through 360 degrees twice. Both drivers ended on the run-off area and Vettel almost hit Webber again as Hamilton and Button overtook them and took the lead. Vettel retired with a punctured right-rear tyre. Webber sustained damage to his front wing <b>endplate.</b> [...] The expected rain only manifested as a very light drizzle on lap 41, as Webber made a pit stop for a replacement front wing two laps later. Hamilton was informed by McLaren to conserve fuel on lap 44 as the drivers drove cautiously through turn one because of the light rain.
