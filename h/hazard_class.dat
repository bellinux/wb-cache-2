A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air.

40|$|The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is {{a widely}} used drought index to provide good estimations of the intensity,magnitude and spatial extent of droughts. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the spatial pattern of drought bySPI index. In this paper, the patterns of drought hazard in Iran are evaluated according to the data of 40 weather stationsduring 1967 - 2009. The influenced zone of each station was specified by the Thiessen method. It was attempted to make anew model of drought hazard using GIS. Three criteria for drought were studied and considered to define areas of vulnerability. Drought hazard criteria used in the present model included: maximum severity of drought in the period, trend ofdrought, and the maximum number of sequential arid years. Each of the vulnerability indicators were mapped and theseas well as a final hazard map were classified into 5 <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> of drought: one, slight, moderate, severe and very severe. The final drought vulnerability map was prepared by overlaying three criteria maps in a GIS, and the final hazard classeswere defined on the basis of hazard scores, which were determined according to the means of the main indicators. Thefinal vulnerability map shows that severe hazard areas (43 % of the country) which are observed in the west and easternparts of country are much more widespread than areas under other <b>hazard</b> <b>classes.</b> Overall, approximately half of thecountry was determined to be under severe and very severe <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> for drought...|$|R

40|$|Fire risk is a {{major threat}} to life, {{property}} and natural resources in southern California. Recent fire disasters occurred in autumn 2003 and 2007. Fire risk management deals with these hazards, input data are collected, analyzed and evaluated. One of the most important input data is the vegetation density in the endangered areas. Here we describe methods to map vegetation density forming five <b>hazard</b> <b>classes.</b> The main objective {{of this study is to}} explore the benefits of using remote sensed data for the accurate classification of vegetation in San Diego city canyons. Three very high resolution remote sensing data sets (< 1 m) were used in comparison: scanned color infrared film (CIR) airborne, digital multi-spectral airborne (ADS 40) and digital multi-spectral satellite imagery (QuickBird). Different classification approaches (e. g. pixel-based, segment-based and knowledge-based) were tested and analyzed to separate the vegetation into five <b>hazard</b> <b>classes.</b> Accuracy assessment indicated low overall accuracies of 58 % on average. With regard to an optimized classification result in particular unsupervised and segment-based classification can be recommended. The overall accuracy for these two methods reached around 62 %. The use of specially selected reference areas for validation helped to increase the accuracies up to 81 %. Also a separating between three instead of five different <b>hazard</b> <b>classes</b> resulted in accuracies around 80 %. Furthermore it could be shown that all three data sets can be used for successful classification procedures. The resulting fire risk maps can help to reduce or prevent fire hazards. The maps are a basis for the brush management of the Fir...|$|R
