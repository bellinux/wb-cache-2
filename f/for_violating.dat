5|$|Maryland was sanctioned <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> a Southern Conference rule, passed {{halfway through}} the 1951 season, that banned postseason play. The punishment, for {{participating}} in the Sugar Bowl, disallowed the Terrapins from playing any conference games during the 1952 season. This compelled Maryland to schedule all but three games on the road.|$|E

They were promptly arrested <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> the currency laws, and spent eight days in prison before the Jewish Council paid their fines.|$|E
5|$|As this {{statement}} was not true, Alvarez was indicted <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> the Stolen Valor Act. The United States District Court for the Central District of California, {{the place where}} the trial was to occur, rejected Alvarez's claim that the Act was unconstitutional. This decision was reversed by a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which held the law invalid.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{widespread}} power outages along the Florida Panhandle, electrical companies enlisted extra workers to repair downed lines. Officials {{had put a}} curfew in place for Tallahassee due to power outages created by the hurricane, and the curfew was lifted on November24 after power was gradually restored and roads were cleared of debris. Police officers in the city arrested 20people <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> curfew or creating unrest.|$|E
5|$|In August 1996, a {{photographer}} and reporter {{from the paper}} were arrested by the United States Forest Service for trespassing {{at the site of}} a timber protest in a national forest.

The criminal charges were later dropped and the civil suit was settled out of court.|$|E
5|$|Mamie largely raised Emmett {{with her}} mother; she and Louis Till {{separated}} in 1942 after {{she discovered that}} he had been unfaithful. Louis later abused her, choking her to unconsciousness, to which she responded by throwing scalding water at him. <b>For</b> <b>violating</b> court orders to stay away from Mamie, Louis Till was forced by a judge in 1943 to choose between jail or enlisting in the U.S. Army.|$|E

30|$|That is, our {{approach}} {{is capable of}} detecting violations of various classes of constraints and suggesting repair solutions <b>for</b> any <b>violated</b> structural and/or conformity constraint. In addition, <b>for</b> every <b>violated</b> semantic constraint, it produces warning messages and information {{about the impact of}} the constraint violation on the quality of the analysis results. This paper presents our proposed approach with special focus on repair rules as they represent the underlying knowledge base from which repair solutions can be suggested.|$|R

5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, {{finding that}} {{cannabis}} grown within California for medical purposes is indistinguishable from illicit marijuana. Moreover, because the intrastate medical cannabis market {{contributes to the}} interstate illicit marijuana market, the Commerce Clause applies. Even where California citizens are using medical cannabis in compliance with state law, those individuals and businesses can still be prosecuted by federal authorities <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> federal law.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} ACLU {{case of the}} 1920s was Gitlow v. New York, in which Benjamin Gitlow was arrested <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism. Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the incorporation doctrine) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to compute counterexamples <b>for</b> <b>violated</b> ω-regular properties of discrete-time Markov chains and Markov decision processes. Whereas most approaches compute a set of system paths as a counterexample, we determine a critical subsystem that already violates the given property. In earlier work we introduced methods to compute such subsystems based on a search for shortest paths. In this paper we use SMT solvers and mixed integer linear programming to determine minimal critical subsystems...|$|R

Virdon continues to serve as a special outfield instructor for the Pirates during spring training.|$|E
5|$|After initial resistance, Gibbs also {{successfully}} pushed {{legislation in}} 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers {{who fail to}} comply with Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move designed to improve accessibility and safety on I-70, which bisected Gibbs' house district. In later years, Gibbs and state officials attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> the chain law {{to the passage of}} the bill.

40|$|Lorentz {{transformation}} of three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state is studied. Also we obtain the relativistic spin joint measurement for the transformed state. Using these results it is shown that Bell's inequality is maximally <b>violated</b> <b>for</b> three-qubit GHZ state in relativistic regime. For ultrarelativistic particles we obtain the critical value for boost speed which Bell's inequality is not <b>violated</b> <b>for</b> velocities smaller than this value.

5|$|During the strike, despite {{considerable}} tensions, {{the city}} of Philadelphia remained mostly calm {{and there were no}} major outbreaks of violence. All of the city's newspapers editorialized against the strike and the public was, by and large, opposed to the strike as well. Several of the strike leaders, including James McMenamin and Frank Carney, were arrested <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> the anti-strike act. The NAACP played an active role both in pressuring the PTC and the federal government to institute fair hiring practices at the PTC for several years before the strike, and in maintaining the calm during the strike itself.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, the Rangers did not {{exercise}} their option, and traded Fleury's playing {{rights to the}} San Jose Sharks, which entitled the Sharks to a compensatory draft pick if Fleury signed elsewhere. He did so with a two-year, $8.5million contract with the Chicago Blackhawks. Two days prior {{to the opening of}} the 2002–03 season, he was suspended by the NHL <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> the terms of the league's substance abuse program. The Blackhawks hired one of Fleury's friends, also a recovering alcoholic, to ensure that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and abided by the terms of the NHL's aftercare program.|$|E
5|$|If {{the police}} {{identified}} Bostic {{even before the}} shooting occurred, he would have faced a two-year prison sentence <b>for</b> <b>violating</b> the terms of his parole, since he was out past his curfew. After the shooting, police discovered the BMW had been stolen from the Five Towns Mitsubishi car dealership in Inwood, Long Island, where Bostic worked as a salesman.
