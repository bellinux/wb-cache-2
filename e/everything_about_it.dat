However, facing a situation where existing ad revenue couldn't cover the costs anymore, Brown sought additional ad sources. In early October 2014, having just been rejected for a sponsorship by Wiser's whisky, he announced a crowdfunding initiative through Patreon, seeking funds {{in order to keep}} Canadaland afloat, admitting that <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> works except the financing while also revealing that the podcast attracts some 10,000 listeners every week.|$|E

The synth quality, the {{composition}} quality... <b>Everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> quality." [...] He cited the [...] "town" [...] themes as Shimomura's weakest, but said that the more [...] "emotional" [...] pieces were much better. Gann also noted Ljungberg as an [...] "amazing" [...] vocalist. RPGamer's review of the album was also praising, calling the composition [...] "excellent", the sound quality [...] "superb", and that it kept the [...] "atmosphere" [...] of previous Mana game soundtracks.|$|E

500|$|After The Sword in the Stone was released, storyman Bill Peet {{claimed to}} Walt Disney that [...] "we [...] {{can do more}} {{interesting}} animal characters" [...] and suggested that Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book {{could be used for}} the studio's next film. Disney agreed and Peet created an original treatment, with little supervision, as he had done with One Hundred and One Dalmatians and The Sword in the Stone. However, after the disappointing reaction to The Sword in the Stone, Walt Disney decided to become more involved in the story than he had been with the past two films, with his nephew Roy E. Disney saying that [...] " [...] certainly influenced <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> (...) With Jungle Book, he obviously got hooked on the jungle and the characters that lived there." ...|$|E
500|$|Nimoy wanted The Search for Spock to be [...] "operatic" [...] in scope; [...] "I {{wanted the}} {{emotions}} {{to be very}} large, very broad, life and death themes [...] and the [...] and <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> derives everything from sizable characters playing out a large story on a large canvas," [...] he said. In addition, he wanted the characters to have significant scenes, however small, that made them grounded and real. Bennett started writing the script with the ending, where Spock says, [...] "Your name is... Jim", and worked backwards from that point. [...] Elements such as Kruge killing his lover were added to establish context and add drama and intrigue. Originally, the Romulans were the villains, but Nimoy preferred the more [...] "theatrical" [...] Klingons, feeling that their pursuit of Genesis was analogous to the Soviet race for nuclear weaponry. Bennett {{took the opportunity to}} flesh out the alien race, who he felt were ill-defined in the television series. The name of the class of the antagonists' ship, Bird of Prey, remained unchanged.|$|E

He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, [...] "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. <b>Everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> I touched, handled and so forth ...

500|$|Graham {{was happy}} with the episode himself and {{received}} letters from [...] "loads of kids" [...] who enjoyed it. When discovering that older fans had reacted negatively, he thought, [...] "Well, it's a shame that they have, but it wasn't meant for them". IGN's Ahsan Haque gave the episode a 5 out of 10 rating, calling it [...] "flat and formulaic" [...] and <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "slightly underwhelming", though he thought what did work was the mother-daughter teamwork at the end. He also noted [...] "annoying self-aggrandizing moments that made no sense and served only to make the episode feel unnecessarily campy", such as the audience disappearing from the stadium and the Doctor carrying the torch. Comparing the episode to [...] "The Idiot's Lantern" [...] in terms of plot, {{he felt that the}} latter was [...] "far more entertaining" [...] and that [...] "Fear Her" [...] lacked originality and humour. Dave Bradley of SFX awarded [...] "Fear Her" [...] three out of five stars, describing the plot as [...] "ordinary" [...] but thought it was [...] "a decent breather before grander adventures to come". He particularly praised the dialogue and thought [...] "the claustrophobic effect of limiting the action to one household works". Arnold T Blumburg, writing for Now Playing, gave the episode a grade of B+. He felt that the guest cast were [...] "only just adequate" [...] and that the story [...] "plods along in places", but the story worked because of the [...] "delightful" [...] interactions between the Doctor and Rose and the feel-good ending.|$|E

Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "It's a great, IQ-flattering entertainment both wonderful and wise".|$|R

2500|$|Hilton Als' {{review in}} The New Yorker called Xanadu [...] "probably {{the most fun}} you’ll have on Broadway this season, one reason being that <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is so resolutely anti-Broadway. In its wildness and ecstasy, Xanadu is a welcome relief from the {{synthetic}} creations that some Broadway producers have been peddling for years. Here you can’t count the disco balls fast enough—not to mention the roller skates, the frosted-pink lips, and the glittering spandex that the director, Christopher Ashley, hurls at you like a PCP flashback. Xanadu is far sleazier and cheesier than conventional musical theatre, and it points out just how tame most other musicals are." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing game Star Trek Online, {{the mission}} [...] "City on the Edge of Never" [...] involves the player character using the Guardian to travel through time to 2270 to stop Klingons intent on altering history. The episode features the USS Kirk, {{and has the}} Guardian projecting a time portal into space, allowing the player to take their vessel through to the past. It featured voice acting by Nimoy, and was well received by reviewers with Kotaku writer Mike Fahey saying [...] "This mission might have just made the entire game for me. <b>Everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> was simply perfect. If Star Trek Online fails for some reason, this mission will always be remembered." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1973 Strummer {{moved to}} Newport, Wales. He did not study at Newport College of Art but {{met up with}} college musicians in the Students' Union in Stow Hill and became vocalist for Flaming Youth, {{renaming}} the band the Vultures. b) The Vultures in time led to The 101ers, a group of West London-based squatters named after their squat address. The 101ers were eventually supported by a nascent Sex Pistols. [...] Mellor adopted the stage name of [...] "Joe Strummer". Impressed {{by the power of}} the Sex Pistols, the newly self-coined Strummer determined that the 101ers were [...] "yesterday's papers" [...] by comparison. It was time to strike out anew. And this led to the start of The Clash. [...] c) [...] "This is my Indian summer...I learnt that fame is an illusion & <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is just a joke.

50|$|Alahan Monastery (Koja Kalessi) is {{a complex}} of fifth century {{buildings}} located {{in the mountains of}} Isauria in southern Asia Minor (Mersin province in modern day Turkey). Located at an altitude of 4,000 ft, it stands 3,000 ft over the Calycadnus valley and is a one-hour walking distance from the village of Geçimli. Although termed a monastery in many sources, this attribution is contested and more recent scholarship consider it to be a pilgrimage shrine. The complex {{played a significant role in}} the development of early Byzantine architecture, and practically <b>everything</b> known <b>about</b> <b>it</b> can be attributed to the excavations of Michael Gough.|$|R

2500|$|Sonnet 33 is {{the first}} to {{introduce}} the idealizing metaphor of the young man as the sun. The sonnet and the ones that follow have been especially attractive to critics interested in biographical reference in the sonnet; George Wyndham deplores this tendency, as does Stephen Booth. Hammond critiques that the experience of reading this sonnet is almost to fall into collusion with the poet, [...] "for <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> from its poetic and syntactic structures to its use of metaphor and pun, invites acceptance." [...] M. P. Tilley describes the sonnet as playing on the proverb 'the morning sun never lasts the day'. Hilton Landry notes that the poem is an extended simile with metaphors in each branch of the simile; he also called it the [...] "simplest and sweetest" [...] of the group. Elizabeth Sagaser notes that the poem is counterposed to Sonnet 116, stating that the ideas of some sonnets are neutralized temporarily by others.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, Debussy too was a {{devotee of}} Wagner's music, but - {{eager to please}} his father - he was {{probably}} more swayed by Mendès' promise of a performance at the Paris Opéra and the money and reputation this would bring. Mendès' libretto, with its conventional plot, offered rather less encouragement to his creative abilities. In the words of Victor Lederer, [...] "Desperate to sink his teeth into a project of substance, the young composer accepted the type of old-fashioned libretto he dreaded, filled with howlers and lusty choruses of soldiers calling for wine." [...] Debussy's letters and conversations with friends reveal his increasing frustration with the Mendès libretto and the composer's enthusiasm for the Wagnerian aesthetic was also waning. In a letter of January 1892, he wrote, [...] "My life is hardship and misery thanks to this opera. <b>Everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is wrong for me." [...] And to Paul Dukas, he confessed that Rodrigue was [...] "totally at odds with all that I dream about, demanding a type of music that is alien to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deleuze's unusual metaphysics entails {{an equally}} {{atypical}} epistemology, {{or what he}} calls a transformation of [...] "the image of thought". According to Deleuze, the traditional image of thought, found in philosophers such as Aristotle, René Descartes, and Edmund Husserl, misconceives of thinking as a mostly unproblematic business. Truth may be hard to discover—it may require a life of pure theorizing, or rigorous computation, or systematic doubt—but thinking is able, at least in principle, to correctly grasp facts, forms, ideas, etc. It may be practically impossible to attain a God's-eye, neutral point of view, but that is the ideal to approximate: a disinterested pursuit that results in a determinate, fixed truth; an orderly extension of common sense. Deleuze rejects this view as papering over the metaphysical flux, instead claiming that genuine thinking is a violent confrontation with reality, an involuntary rupture of established categories. Truth changes what we think; it alters what we think is possible. By setting aside the assumption that thinking has a natural ability to recognize the truth, Deleuze says, we attain a [...] "thought without image", a thought always determined by problems rather than solving them. [...] "All this, however, presupposes codes or axioms which do not result by chance, but which do not have an intrinsic rationality either. It's just like theology: <b>everything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is quite rational if you accept sin, the immaculate conception, and the incarnation. Reason is always a region carved out of the irrational—not sheltered from the irrational at all, but traversed by it and only defined by a particular kind of relationship among irrational factors. Underneath all reason lies delirium, and drift." ...|$|E
