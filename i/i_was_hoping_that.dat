2500|$|In 2016 Obama {{stated in}} an {{interview}} with The Atlantic that he tried with his speech to persuade Muslims to more closely examine the roots of their unhappiness and acknowledged he didn't succeed in this goal. [...] "My argument was this: Let’s all stop pretending that the cause of the Middle East’s problems is Israel. We want to work to help achieve statehood and dignity for the Palestinians, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> my speech could trigger a discussion, could create space for Muslims to address the real problems they are confronting—problems of governance, and the fact that some currents of Islam have not gone through a reformation that would help people adapt their religious doctrines to modernity. My thought was, I would communicate that the U.S. is not {{standing in the way of}} this progress, that we would help, in whatever way possible, to advance the goals of a practical, successful Arab agenda that provided a better life for ordinary people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon signing, Kewell said, [...] "I {{wanted to}} move on and this is the best way. I can't wait to get started, it's just what I'm looking forward to, a new challenge." [...] His {{transfer}} to Galatasaray provoked strong criticism from fans and teammates of his former club Leeds United as he was a Leeds player when two of their fans were killed in clashes before a UEFA Cup semi-final against Galatasaray in Istanbul in April 2000. Kewell responded and in an open letter he stated, [...] "I chose the No 19 shirt when I signed for Galatasaray SK as a sign of respect for Leeds because that was the number I got when I first became a regular member of the Leeds United starting XI. I felt that it might be a way to demonstrate that I had not forgotten where it all started and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> in a small way it would help the healing process of the tragedy that occurred on 5 April 2000. To blame the Galatasaray club for the tragedy in Istanbul is simply wrong and discriminatory." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will not}} deny it," [...] the boy answered. [...] "I {{will admit that}} <b>I</b> wish to <b>be</b> alone. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> very soon you will be going." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “From the East,” said he, “and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> {{you will}} give him the message on the Square—for the sake of my Mother {{as well as your}} own.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} so kind of you," [...] she murmured, [...] "to talk to us. And yet, do you know, I am a little disappointed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> {{you might have been}} able to tell us {{something}} more about the poor fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, laddie, you {{are doing}} no good here, and now that my knee is getting more limber <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> I might get on active service again. I {{wondered}} whether maybe {{you might like to}} do a little soldiering under me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{first had}} the hammer examined. There was Dr. Wood {{there to help}} me. We found no signs of {{violence}} upon it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> if Mr. Douglas defended himself with the hammer, he might have left his mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat. But there was no stain." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{glad you}} think so," [...] she murmured, {{with a very}} sweet {{answering}} light in her eyes, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> you have other things to tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is my business," [...] John declared, [...] "because I {{have asked}} Miss Maurel {{to be my}} wife, and because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> some day, before very long, she will consent." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{started to}} laugh, too. Under these {{circumstances}} {{it is always}} supposed to be very funny if a man has got married. The notion of old Peter (whoever he is) being married is presumed to be simply killing. I kept on chuckling away quietly at the mere idea of it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> I might manage to keep on laughing till the train stopped. I had only fifty miles more to go. It's not hard to laugh for fifty miles if you know how.|$|E
60|$|On {{the last}} scene of that dreadful fight I need not dwell. It was a {{slaughter}} great and grim, {{in which no}} quarter was asked or given. One incident, however, is worth detailing. Just as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> it was all done with, suddenly from under a heap of slain {{where he had been}} hiding, an unwounded warrior sprang up, and, clearing the piles of dying dead like an antelope, sped like the wind up the kraal towards the spot where I was standing at the moment. But he was not alone, for Umslopogaas came gliding on his tracks with the peculiar swallow-like motion for which he was noted, and as they neared me I recognized in the Masai the herald of the previous night. Finding that, run as he would, his pursuer was gaining on him, the man halted and turned round to give battle. Umslopogaas also pulled up.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's very sad," [...] she said, [...] "to find {{how much}} we've been mistaken in you, Captain Parsons. When {{we were making}} all sorts of {{preparations}} to welcome you, we never thought that you would repay us like this. It grieves me {{to have to tell}} you that you have done a very wicked thing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> your conscience would have something to say to you, but unhappily I was mistaken. You induced Mary to become engaged to you; you kept her waiting for years; you wrote constantly, pretending to love her, deceiving her odiously; you let her waste the best part of her life, and then, without excuse and without reason, you calmly say that you're sick of her, and won't marry her. I think it is horrible, and brutal, and most ungentlemanly. Even a common man wouldn't have behaved in that way. Of course, it doesn't matter to you, but it means the ruin of Mary's whole life. How can she get a husband now when she's wasted her best years? You've spoilt all her chances. You've thrown a slur upon her which people will never forget. You're a cruel, wicked man, and however you won the Victoria Cross I don't know; I'm sure you don't deserve it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Monday.--No letters to-day. Sacré chien, Dieu de Dieu--and I {{have written}} with {{exemplary}} industry. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> no news <b>is</b> {{good news and}} shall continue so to <b>hope</b> until all <b>is</b> blue.--Ever yours, ...|$|R

5000|$|Though he has {{recently}} been starring a character actor, Chunky doesn't want to be pigeonholed into doing comic roles. [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> restricting myself to doing only comedy. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> someone offers me something else," [...] Pandey said. [...] "It {{requires a lot of}} guts for someone to cast me in something else. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> just <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> someone sees something else in me other than comedy." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{said the}} reputation: Yes, this episode remains Alogidh {{non-existent}} in my career. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> I would bring actual achievements with the Egyptian national team, {{but there are}} many circumstances prevented that, including poor preparation and poor planning and confusion. Egypt's strongest team of Africa but the conditions did not allow us to qualify and these things that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> I add to Register.|$|E
5000|$|Fogerty stated, [...] "On 'Lodi', I saw a {{much older}} person than I was, 'cause {{it is sort}} of a tragic telling. A guy is stuck in a place where people really don't {{appreciate}} him. Since I was {{at the beginning of a}} good career, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> that wouldn't happen to me." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "In {{the facial}} {{features}} of Vincent Gallo {{there is something}} that is difficult to identify. Nobody knows where he is. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> even if Vincent will not be received as a native Arab or Muslim, and so it will always be different, neither here nor there. Besides, it could be someone like John Walker Lindh, the famous Californian who was Taleb and joined Osama bin Laden affiliates." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{as much as}} I should like," [...] he confessed. [...] "She {{seems to}} think and dream of nothing but this play of yours. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> when it <b>is</b> once {{produced}} she will be more free." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> along {{about this}} time I shall hear that the machine is {{beginning}} its test in the Herald office. <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> very glad indeed to know the result of it. I wish <b>I</b> could <b>be</b> there.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am bearing up," [...] Crawshay rejoined, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> with {{kindness}} and consideration, and with opportunity {{to prove to}} you what a domestic and faithful person <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> you will perceive that {{of the two men}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> the more worthy." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{wanted to}} be part of a high-class scene of musicians. It was half-inspired because I didn't have many friends, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> I would meet people and fall in love and start a {{community}} around me, the way they used to do in the '60s. I {{wanted to be}} seen as a good singer, and not much more than that." [...] —Del Rey on the difficulty of her career beginnings ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{has also}} been {{referenced}} by the media as an expert concerning Barack Obama's political strategies as related to unemployment ratings and economic policy. Darity criticized Obama's October 2011 economic strategy as [...] "bribing {{the private sector to}} put people back to work. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> there would be some effort to create a plan, there would be some effort to have a plan for direct job creation, where the federal government would directly put people back to work." ...|$|E
5000|$|People {{who play}} games {{and people who}} love {{classical}} music are not necessarily sharing {{the same type of}} interests. Most people in Japan know the name of Frederic Chopin; however, {{most of the people who}} know of Chopin think he is just some kind of a great music composer without knowing any more about him. Most of them have heard Chopin's music but not a lot could put his name to it immediately. By creating a colorful fantasy world in Chopin's dream, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> people would get into this game easily and also come to know how great Chopin's music is.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{police have}} been known to {{overlook}} things. Of course, what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> amongst Mr. Orden's papers there may be some indication as to where he has deposited our property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have come}} to see us about your story, I suppose, Mr. Jesson?" [...] he began. [...] "A very fair story indeed for a beginner, as <b>I</b> suppose you <b>are.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> some day {{we may be able to}} make use of it for the Ibex." ...|$|R
5000|$|Whilst {{working on}} the opera in 1859, Rubinstein wrote to a friend:I have {{absolutely}} no luck with opera texts.

5000|$|Well, I {{had this}} girlfriend one time, and I {{was at home}} working, at my desk, working at my songwriting which I had been doing all week since I was on a roll, and my girlfriend was somewhere {{drinking}}, drinking somewhere. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> {{no one else would}} get their hands on her, because she was pretty good lookin'! And that's how I wrote the song 'Sundown,' {{and as a matter of}} fact, it was written just around Sundown, just as the sun was setting, behind the farm I had rented to use as a place to write the album.|$|E
5000|$|... Foreign Minister Emma Bonino said: [...] "I {{am deeply}} pained {{at what is}} going on in Egypt, and at the loss of human life there. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hoping</b> <b>that</b> the squares where the sit-ins took place would empty out once the parties had reached an agreement, and not through the {{intervention}} of the police, which doesn't make it any easier to find a solution to the political crisis. I appeal to all the Egyptian forces to do everything in their power to halt the violence that has erupted there, and to avoid a blood bath. All forces of order must exert the maximum self-control, and everyone must likewise avoid any form of incitement to violence." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2013, {{the actor}} Lou Gossett, Jr., {{dedicated}} his 2013 audiobook performance of Twelve Years a Slave to Eakin.
