2500|$|In 1994, Billman {{used his}} model of SCD {{to test the}} ability of omega-3 {{polyunsaturated}} fatty acids to prevent fatal arrhythmias. In the test, eight dogs otherwise susceptible to ventricular fibrillation were given a direct infusion of fish oil. [...] Seven of the eight did not have VF during the test. Five of five animals re-tested in a <b>follow-up</b> <b>control</b> test (i.e. without treatment) had VF. The observed effect most likely resulted {{from a combination of}} direct chemical interaction on the cardiac cell membrane and a reduced heart rate caused by the omega-3s. [...] The study was picked up by a nationally syndicated columnist, and thus reported in various popular media outlets. [...] Follow-up studies in 1997 and 1999 confirmed the results (P<0.005) and found both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid (found in fish oil), as well as α-Linolenic acid (found in vegetable oil) to have antiarrhythmic effects.|$|E

Aiming the {{problems}} caused by the narrow path recognition range of auto-tracking smart cars, this paper proposes a <b>follow-up</b> <b>control</b> based on the Freescale K 10 microcontroller. A laser detection sensor was used to percept the path information. And a follow-up steering servo was used to drive the laser detection sensor to track the road path and controlled by the PID algorithm.

40|$|Pinning with {{metallic}} wires is {{a suitable}} therapeutic option for proximal humeral fractures. Loosening and migration of such devices from this site is uncommon. Despite infrequently occurring, however, the literature reports dramatic and potentially lethal complications related to wires dislocation. A 69 -year-old woman underwent closed reduction and fixation of a proximal 3 -part humeral fracture {{by mean of}} two retrograde Kirschner wires and one anterograde threaded pin. One month after surgery, during a routine <b>follow-up</b> <b>control,</b> it was diagnosed the migration of the threaded pin in the left lung parenchyma. In the meantime, the only symptom the patient complained was an episodic intercostal pain of mild intensity, with referred onset 1 week after surgery. The migrated pin was removed through thoracoscopic approach in the emergency setting, without intra- or post-operative complications. Only a few authors reported similar complications after fixation of proximal humeral fractures. Immediate surgical removal of the device is always mandatory.

A reliable and automatic method for DaTSCAN evaluation can provide objective quantification; it is desirable for longitudinal studies, and it allows for a better <b>follow-up</b> <b>control.</b> Moreover, it is crucial for an automated method to produce coherent measures related to the severity of motor symptoms.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Occupational allergy {{forms an}} {{attractive}} model {{to study the}} development of allergic responses, as in some occupations it has a high incidence and develops quickly. In a cohort of starting laboratory animal workers, we previously found 20 % sensitization to animal allergens within 2 [*]years. METHODS: We compared cellular responses of incident laboratory animal workers who developed rat-specific sensitization (cases, n[*]=[*] 18) during 2 [*]years of <b>follow-up</b> to <b>control</b> animal workers matched for atopic status but without sensitization after <b>follow-up</b> (<b>controls,</b> n[*]=[*] 18). Practically, this is a case-control study, nested within the cohort. Rat-specific IgE antibodies were measured in sera, and allergen-specific and nonspecific cytokine responses were measured in whole blood and in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Self-reported allergic symptoms {{were related to the}} presence of rat-specific IgE (P[*]≤[*] 0. 01).

40|$|Particulate embolisation as a {{minimally}} invasive method represents a capable treatment strategy in cancer. To enable the full benefits of embolisation therapy, it would be highly advantageous to have particles which are observable in medical imaging systems such as X-ray or MRI. Bartling et al.
