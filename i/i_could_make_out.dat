[...] "It {{appeared}} to be Holly kneeling down and Drew [...] They {{looked like they were}} kneeled down, facing each other in the garage, and they were talking back and forth. Holly sounded very upset and heated. He was doing much of the talking, and she would answer back and things like that. I couldn't make out hardly any of the words. The only words <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> from here were Holly saying, 'No, why? Clint said that he believed Holly and Drew were breaking up. At some point Karen Bobo called home and spoke to Clint. [...] "I said, 'Clint, that's not Drew. Get a gun and shoot him. Clint reportedly replied [...] "You want me to shoot Drew?", still believing the man was Holly's boyfriend.|$|E
60|$|I {{bent over}} and felt his pulse. As far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> it still beat feebly.|$|E
60|$|To {{my great}} surprise, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> somehow that Lemarchant was meddling with the bottles in the medicine-chest.|$|E
60|$|In {{a corner}} of the room was {{something}} neatly covered up with a large white cloth. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> what that was.|$|R
60|$|Sixth side. October and November. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> their occupation; {{they seem}} to be {{roasting}} or boiling some root over a fire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep so," [...] advised Nasmyth. [...] "Of course, that's unnecessary; but <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{why women}} {{should want to}} smoke. From my point of view, it isn't becoming." ...|$|R
60|$|Twice or thrice {{they spoke}} together, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> that Neil (for all his obsequiousness) was an angry man.|$|E
60|$|Then all up the dim {{hillside}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the Boers halting {{and riding}} back. One rifle across there flashed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, ma'am, I {{could see}} him well enough. He was talkin' an' laughin', as far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> with an {{uncommon}} pretty girl." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> <b>Make</b> a Livin' (<b>Out</b> of Lovin' You)" [...] (Dave Loggins) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have {{explained}} the likeness <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> once saw {{a photograph of}} a Cecily, with exactly the character you mention. It was that of which she reminded me.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remembered the}} old custom of burying suicides at cross-roads: 'Ah! I see, a suicide. How interesting!' But {{for the life}} of me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> why the horses were frightened.|$|R
6000|$|... "Brownish-red, {{as near as}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> {{and very}} long. And he had rather a long beard and a large nose," [...] went on our hero.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not definitely," [...] he replied. [...] "So far as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{from what}} the {{sergeant}} said, it was keeping bad company as much as anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all a mystery, {{the most}} {{beautiful}} mystery of life," [...] Wanhope resumed. [...] "I don't believe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the case as I feel it to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{continued}} Joe, [...] "he comed from Washington, but <b>I</b> never <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> right {{whether he}} wos a government man or not. Anyhow, he wos a pheelosopher--a natter-list I think he call his-self." ...|$|R
60|$|The lady's face became serious, {{but still}} {{there was the}} {{expression}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out.</b> In an instant {{she seemed to have}} scrutinized me with a precision from which there could be no appeal.|$|R
60|$|They turned towards me, and {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the expressions of their faces, in the gloom, yet I doubted not {{but that they}} were puzzled ones at that lengthy and apparently meaningless harangue.|$|R
60|$|As he spoke, he {{indicated}} {{with his hand}} a huge pile of books, gayly jacketed in white and blue. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the title in big gilt lettering--GOLDEN DREAMS.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure you}} could {{let me have a}} {{thousand}} or so,' said Undy. 'I think a couple of thousand would carry it, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the other myself.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} they were. I {{know that the}} oldest of all were Latin, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> nothing <b>out</b> in them but {{something}} about Manoriem and Carminster, and what looked like the names {{of some of the}} fields at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{gave me a}} look, but in {{the dusk}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> very well what it conveyed. Then he bent over his mother, kissing her. 'My news isn't {{particularly}} satisfactory. I am going for you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Peter was {{certainly}} not in a gracious mood when he was here last week. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out</b> whether seeing her a governess were too much for him, or whether he suspected me of ill-using her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As near as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> Werner {{is going}} {{off into the}} woods on a hunt and wants Glutts to go with him," [...] {{returned}} Fred. [...] "I wonder where they are going?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I came close, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> {{that there}} was someone behind the bars, but I could not see who it was. Of course, I did not come {{straight}} to the spot, but went about promiscuously.|$|E
6000|$|... “I have {{no doubt}} {{whatever}} {{that it is the}} work of pirates,” the officer said on his return. “Her bulwarks are burnt away, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> several piles on deck which looked like dead men.” ...|$|E
6000|$|At that moment, or, perhaps, {{the moment}} after, I {{became aware of}} Ransome {{standing}} in the cabin. Something in his expression startled me. It had a meaning which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>make</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> exclaimed: [...] "Somebody's dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it is a {{very good}} idea, Jerry; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not think what was up when I got there and did not see anybody. I see you have another fire over the other side. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> it <b>out</b> clear enough as we came on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dearest, {{you must}} calm yourself, {{and try to}} explain. You know I {{understand}} nothing yet, except from your resolute little advocate downstairs, and your own note, which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>make</b> <b>out,</b> except {{that you were in}} great trouble.' ...|$|R
60|$|From {{the voices}} and the steps there seemed {{now to be}} several people round me. I {{understand}} Italian a great deal better than I speak it, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> very well what they were saying.|$|E
60|$|I knew no fear. My pulses throbbed and {{my heart}} beat ponderously but rapturously as I watched the vision growing more and more {{distinct}} until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the pale face of ineffable sweetness and the veiled eyes.|$|E
60|$|Zenobia turned, sidelong, {{a strange}} {{kind of a}} glance upon me; but, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>make</b> <b>out</b> what it meant, we had entered the kitchen, where, in {{accordance}} with the rustic simplicity of our new life, the supper-table was spread.|$|E
60|$|And {{then the}} cry was repeated. It {{proceeded}} from the hut. I {{advanced to the}} window, took courage and peered in. By {{the light of a}} little brass oil lamp with a single wick <b>I</b> <b>could</b> faintly <b>make</b> <b>out</b> the interior.|$|R
60|$|She spoke so vehemently, mumbling {{the words}} between her toothless gums, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>make</b> them <b>out.</b>|$|R
