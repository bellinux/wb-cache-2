5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee <b>joint</b> <b>area,</b> where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study has}} been {{designed}} to collate distribution, morphology, petrology of columnar joint in South Korea. Reported columnar <b>joint</b> <b>areas</b> in South Korea are 68, until the present time. These can be divided into five group by geography and volcanic activity. 1) The 16 columnar <b>joint</b> <b>areas</b> are distributed in Hantangang region. The 15 areas in this region are composed of basaltic lava in the Quaternary period, and the other 1 area is composed of volcanic rocks in the Cretaceous period. 2) The 18 columnar <b>joint</b> <b>areas</b> are distributed in Jeju island. Most of them are composed of basaltic lava(alkali basalt and Hawaiite), and the Sanbangsan and Baegrokdam area are composed of trachyte in the Quaternary period. Colonnade, entablature and chisel mark of the columnar joint are typically occur in basaltic lava. 3) The 5 columnar <b>joint</b> <b>areas</b> are distributed into the Ulleung island and Dokdo including Guksubawi. These are consisted of relatively well-formed trachyte columns in the Quaternary period. 4) The 8 columnar <b>joint</b> <b>areas</b> are distributed into the Pohang, Gyeongju and Ulsan region and consist of the Tertiary period volcanic rock.

40|$|Maintenance {{costs of}} {{reinforced}} concrete infrastructure (bridges, tunnels, harbours, parking structures) are increasing due to aging of structures under aggressive exposure. Corrosion of reinforcement due to chloride ingress {{is the main}} problem for existing structures in marine and de-icing salt environments. Corrosion cannot be ruled out completely for new infrastructure, even with today's emphasis on design for long service life (e. g. 100 years), a. o. due to local effects such as leakage of joints; consequently, repairs may be necessary. This study reports on total life cost calculations for various options to prevent or remediate corrosion damage in an example bridge which is exposed to de-icing salts, locally aggravated by leakage of expansion joints. Scenarios were developed to predict - the occurrence of corrosion damage in the <b>joint</b> <b>areas,</b> - total life cycle cost (LCC) effects of using stainless steel reinforcement, (repeated) hydrophobic treatment and cathodic prevention in the <b>joint</b> <b>areas,</b> - cost effects of conventional concrete repair and cathodic protection in the <b>joint</b> <b>areas,</b> depending on the working life of these corrective measures. Summarising the preliminary results, using stainless steel reinforcement and (repeated) hydrophobic treatment of concrete in the endangered areas is surprisingly economic. Furthermore, the working life of conventional repairs and cathodic protection are major parameters affecting the total life costs. A simple tool was developed for predicting the total life costs depending on working life and costs of various preventive and corrective measures. </p...|$|R

50|$|Resistance {{soldering}} {{is unlike}} using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then {{passed through a}} thermally conductive tip into the <b>joint</b> <b>area.</b> A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the <b>joint</b> <b>area</b> and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, {{can be used for}} difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.|$|E
