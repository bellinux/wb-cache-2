5|$|A Slight Specimen of Moral Songs, such as I wish some {{happy and}} condescending genius would {{undertake}} {{for the use}} of children, and perform much better... The sense and subjects might be borrow'd plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon, from all the common appearances of nature, from all the occurrences in the civil life, both in city and country: (which would also afford matter for other Divine Songs.) Here the language and measures should be easy and flowing with chearfulness, and without the solemnities of religion, or the sacred names of God and holy things; that children might find <b>delight</b> <b>and</b> profit together.|$|E
5|$|Although most Chinese {{workers in}} 1880 were {{employed}} in the coal mines around Wyoming and Sweetwater County, the Chinese in Rock Springs worked mostly in occupations outside of mining. In addition to Chinese laborers and miners, a professional gambler, a priest, a cook, and a barber resided in the city. In Green River, Wyoming, there was a Chinese doctor. Chinese servants and waiters found work in Green River and in Fort Washakie. In Atlantic City, Miner's <b>Delight,</b> <b>and</b> Red Canyon, Wyoming, Chinese gold miners were employed. However, {{the majority of the}} 193 Chinese residing in Sweetwater County by 1880 worked in the coal mines or on the railroad.|$|E

Margo invites Lincoln to visit, much to Maisie's <b>delight,</b> <b>and</b> Lincoln and Margo kiss. One night, Susanna stops by the beach house unannounced in her tour bus to pick Maisie up, but Maisie chooses to stay with Margo and Lincoln instead. After shouting at her, Susanna realizes that Maisie is scared of her {{and that it is}} in Maisie's best interests to stay behind.|$|E

5|$|The main {{character}} of The Sandman is Dream, {{also known as}} Morpheus and other names, {{who is one of}} the seven Endless. The other Endless are Destiny, Death, Desire, Despair, Delirium (formerly <b>Delight)</b> <b>and</b> Destruction. The series is famous for Gaiman's trademark use of anthropomorphic personification of various metaphysical entities, while also blending mythology and history in its horror setting within the DC Universe. The Sandman is a story about stories and how Morpheus, the Lord of Dreams, is captured and subsequently learns that sometimes change is inevitable. The Sandman was Vertigo's flagship title, and is available as a series of ten trade paperbacks, a recolored five-volume Absolute hardcover edition with slipcase, in a black-and-white Annotated edition, and is available for digital download.|$|E

25|$|Titus, of {{the same}} surname as his father, was the <b>delight</b> <b>and</b> darling of the human race; such surpassing ability had he, by nature, art, or good fortune, to win the {{affections}} of all men, and that, too, which is no easy task, while he was emperor.|$|E

25|$|In early 1982, {{the last}} album for EMI/BMG was released, Strangers in Paradise. The {{departure}} from Chinnichap became notable, {{and the four}} members of Smokie appeared unable to recreate their success using their own material. Shortly {{after the release of}} Strangers In Paradise, work began on two parallel albums, one released by Smokie as Midnight <b>Delight,</b> <b>and</b> the other Chris Norman's solo debut, Rock Away Your Teardrops. Neither release sold well.|$|E
25|$|For Zion’s sake, {{the prophet}} would not hold his peace, until Jerusalem’s triumph would burn brightly for the nations to see, and Zion {{would be called}} by a new name given by God. Zion would be a crown of beauty in God’s hand, and no more would she be called Forsaken or Desolate, but she would be called <b>Delight</b> <b>and</b> Espoused, for God would rejoice over her as a bridegroom over his bride.|$|E
25|$|Verhoeven {{followed}} those successes {{with the}} equally intense and provocative Basic Instinct (1992), an erotic thriller. The ninth-highest-grossing {{film of the}} year, the movie was a return to themes Verhoeven had explored in Turkish <b>Delight</b> <b>and</b> The Fourth Man. The film's most notorious scene shows Sharon Stone's character in a police interrogation, where she uncrosses her legs, briefly revealing her vulva (she does not wear underwear underneath her skirt). The film received two Academy Awards nominations, for Film Editing and for Original Music.|$|E

25|$|After failed {{attacks against}} San Juan de Puerto Rico and Panamá, during which Francis Drake and John Hawkins had perished from dysentery, the English fleet {{anchored}} in Portobello to reorganize and careen their ships {{prior to return}} to England. Sir Thomas Baskerville, Colonel-General of the landing forces, was then elected by his officers as the new commander of the retreating fleet, whose number of ships soon decreased to 18, as two of them, the <b>Delight</b> <b>and</b> the Elizabeth, had to be burned or sunk {{due to lack of}} crew. Two generals, 15 captains and 22 officers had died in combat or from disease; a loss which demoralized the men on board.|$|E
25|$|He {{was born}} in Chelsea, London. His father, a native of Lanark, {{had served as a}} soldier, losing an arm at the Battle of Fontenoy, and was admitted, first as an inmate, and {{afterwards}} as an outdoor pensioner, at Chelsea Hospital. Gillray commenced life by learning letter-engraving, at which he soon became adept. This employment, however, proved irksome to James, so he wandered about for a time with a company of strolling players. After a very checkered experience, he returned to London and was admitted as a student in the Royal Academy, supporting himself by engraving, and probably issuing a considerable number of caricatures under fictitious names. His caricatures are almost all in etching, some also with aquatint, and a few using stipple technique. None can correctly be described as engravings, although this term is often loosely used to describe them. Hogarth's works were the <b>delight</b> <b>and</b> study of his early years. Paddy on Horseback, which appeared in 1779, is the first caricature which is certainly his. Two caricatures on Admiral Rodney's naval victory at the Battle of the Saintes, issued in 1782, were among the first of the memorable series of his political sketches.|$|E

500|$|Taruskin has {{listed a}} number of sources that Roerich {{consulted}} when creating his designs. Among these are the Primary Chronicle, a 12th-century compendium of early pagan customs, and Alexander Afanasyev's study of peasant folklore and pagan prehistory. The Princess Tenisheva's collection of costumes was an early source of inspiration. When the designs were complete, Stravinsky expressed <b>delight</b> <b>and</b> declared them [...] "a real miracle".|$|E
500|$|The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius {{wrote in}} his Meditations that {{conscience}} was the human capacity to live by rational principles that were congruent with the true, tranquil and harmonious nature of our mind and thereby that of the Universe: [...] "To move from one unselfish action to another with God in mind. Only there, <b>delight</b> <b>and</b> stillness... the only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts." ...|$|E
