50|$|About 1800 walkers {{complete}} the track each year. The closest town is Tuatapere, although people often stay in Te Anau and opt to drive south {{the morning of}} beginning the track. The track was established in November 2001, with the initial cost for the project at $3,950,000 NZD. The track crosses Māori land and much privately owned land.

5000|$|... “Our {{electronic}} classification yards {{are one of}} {{the best}} examples of advanced cybernation at work in the railroad industry. For example, when a freight train leaves Toledo, Ohio its consist is electronically stored in a memory system at Elkhart, Indiana, 100 miles away. When the train leaves Elkhart, it is pushed over a hump. When a freight car rolls down the hump, an analog computer goes to work to control the car’s speed. The computer takes into account the car’s weight, the kind of bearings, the condition of the lubricant in the journals, the direction and velocity of the wind, on which track the car must come to rest, how many curves it must go around to get there, and how far down that track it will be going before encountering another car. In the time it takes the car to move 150 feet down the incline, the computer has calculated the precise speed the car must leave the <b>hump</b> <b>track</b> in order to roll to its classification track and couple safely with the next car.|$|E

50|$|The yard has eleven arrival <b>tracks,</b> two <b>hump</b> <b>tracks</b> and 40 {{classification}} tracks up to 920 m long. The {{freight wagons}} or sets of wagons are run {{over the hump}} and then retarded {{by a series of}} automatic retarders and finally pushed together for coupling. The wagons are then coupled together with their brake hoses and the brakes are tested by a remote-controlled brake test system. The entire marshalling operation is automatically controlled by a central electronic interlocking. Intervention by the signallers is only required if there is a fault.|$|R

50|$|The Hinterland railway {{opened on}} 1 April 1910, {{making it the}} fourth line {{connecting}} to the station. It had an extensive freight yard with a <b>hump,</b> with 27 <b>tracks</b> and 102 sets of points. It suffered major damage {{at the end of}} the Second World War. The German Wehrmacht blew up the signal boxes and an air strike by U.S. fighter-bombers destroyed the storage shed and 70% of the track and points. After the occupation by Thuringia by Soviet troops in July 1945, operations were suspended on the main lines to Coburg and Stockheim. The station lost much of its traffic. Four freight tracks and a platform track were removed to provide reparations for the Soviet Union.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{scientific}} {{paper has}} a purpose to choose rational technological {{parameters of the}} transportation organization process, which would enable the freight train movement with the most efficient train traffic arrangement, the decrease in idle time due to the increased speed of cargo delivery {{and the increase in}} the working capacity of the marshalling yard. Methodology. The work presents the technical and operational characteristics of marshalling yards in Europe and Ukraine. The research methods include the station operation analysis, the car traffic flow analysis, analysis of the train sheet, the DU- 1 natural sheets upon arrival and departure of trains. Schemes were developed for calculating working capacity of necks, rehandling capacity of marshalling hump, acceptable levels of system loading. Findings. The research resulted in the calculated working (rehandling) capacity of the main elements of the station. Daily loads of marshalling <b>hump</b> and turnout <b>tracks</b> vary significantly by variations and gradations of movement volume. This affects the idle time of trains and, in general, the value of the criterion according to which the optimal technical equipment, optimum interaction of the subsystems and gridiron of the station will be chosen. This criterion must take into account the costs of technical equipment, construction of tracks, locomotives, as well as related operating costs in all cases. Thus, the selection of the optimal interaction should establish the economically viable level of operational reliability of the sub-systems, their technical and track capacity. Originality. By increasing the productivity of train departure channel, marshalling <b>hump</b> and turnout <b>tracks</b> it is possible the thetrain handling processes and reduce the car idle time. Intensification of production processes in marshalling yards provides a reduction in car turnover and in idle time and high economic efficiency of capital investments. The work covers the issues related to improving the efficiency of functioning of marshalling yards in the railway transport reforming conditions. Practical value. Using the methods of determining the rational working (rehandling) capacity of marshalling yards for distribution of train traffic flows between them makes it possible to improve the quality indicators of marshalling yard operation...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the planning of}} railway freight classification at hump yards, where the problem involves the formation of departing freight train blocks from arriving trains subject to scheduling and capacity constraints. The hump yard layout considered consists of arrival tracks of sufficient length at an arrival yard, a <b>hump,</b> classification <b>tracks</b> of non-uniform and possibly non-sufficient length at a classification yard, and departure tracks of sufficient length. To increase yard capacity, freight cars arriving early can be stored temporarily on specific mixed-usage <b>tracks.</b> The entire <b>hump</b> yard planning process is covered in this paper, and heuristics for arrival and departure track assignment, as well as hump scheduling, have been included to provide the neccessary input data. However, the central problem considered is the classification track allocation problem. This problem has previously been modeled using direct mixed integer programming models, but this approach did not yield lower bounds of sufficient quality to prove optimality. Later attempts focused on a column generation approach based on branch-and-price that could solve problem instances of industrial size. Building upon the column generation approach we introduce a direct arc-based integer programming model, where the arcs are precedence relations between blocks on the same classification track. Further, the most promising models are adapted for rolling-horizon planning. We evaluate the methods on historical data from the Hallsberg shunting yard in Sweden. The {{results show that the}} new arc-based model performs as well as the column generation approach. It returns an optimal schedule within the execution time limit for all instances but from one, and executes as fast as the column generation approach. Further, the short execution times of the column generation approach and the arc-indexed model make them suitable for rolling-horizon planning, while the direct mixed integer program proved to be too slow for this. Extended analysis of the results shows that mixing was only required if the maximum number of concurrent trains on the classification yard exceeds 29 (there are 32 available tracks), and that after this point the number of extra car roll-ins increases heavily...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the situation of}} rearranging freight trains in a shunting yard with a <b>hump</b> and several <b>tracks.</b> Here, an elementary shunting operation is to push a all cars of one <b>track</b> over the <b>hump.</b> On {{the way back to}} the tracks the cars can be guided individually to an arbitrary track. The goal is to create one or several trains that have their cars in a particular order. We measure the efficiency of a shunting plan by the number of elementary shunting operations, and to a lesser extent by the total number of car movements. We find optimal shunting operations in the following situations: – The incoming trains are unsorted and the shunting yard has sufficiently many tracks but the length of the tracks is limited (capacities). – The order of the cars in a single incoming train is given, the tracks of the shunting yard are sufficiently long, but there is only a limited number of tracks. In contrast, we show that the following problems are N P-complete: – There are several incoming trains and for each the order of the cars is given, but the order in which to start shunting the trains can be chosen. – There is one train with given order of the cars, and the lengths of the tracks is limited. These results are based on expressing the shunting task as finding a suitable set of codes. The results will perhaps not solve the practical problem directly, but rather provide some first structural insights and complexity limits that can guide the search for practical algorithms. ...|$|R
