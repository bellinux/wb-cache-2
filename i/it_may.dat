5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be involved in horizontal gene transfer; <b>it</b> <b>may</b> provide nutrients; and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; <b>it</b> <b>may</b> contribute to biofilm formation; and <b>it</b> <b>may</b> contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E

5|$|Appearing from January to April, A. ocreata occurs {{later in}} the year than other amanitas except A. calyptroderma. It is found in mixed {{woodland}} on the Pacific coast of North America, from Washington south through California to Baja California in Mexico. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> feasibly occur on Vancouver Island in British Columbia though this has never been confirmed. It forms ectomycorrhizal relationships and is found in association with coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), as well as hazel (Corylus spp.). In Oregon and Washington, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> also be associated with the Garry oak (Quercus garryana).|$|E
5|$|B.integrifolia is {{a highly}} {{variable}} species. It is most often encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas <b>it</b> <b>may</b> grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in highly exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> even be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E

5|$|Both the mycelia and {{the fruit}} bodies of M.haematopus (both young and mature specimens) are {{reported}} to be bioluminescent. However, the luminescence is quite weak, and not visible to the dark-adapted eye; in one study, light emission was detectable only after 20hours of exposure to X-ray film. Although the biochemical basis of bioluminescence in M.haematopus has not been scientifically investigated, in general, bioluminescence {{is caused by the}} action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: <b>it</b> <b>may</b> help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, <b>it</b> <b>may</b> be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
