5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E

25|$|Jesus {{does not}} resist or {{contend with the}} world because he doesn't {{recognize}} the importance of the world.

25|$|The pace of our Cavalry {{increased}} <b>every</b> <b>moment,</b> {{until they}} went thundering along the valley, making the ground tremble beneath them.

25|$|Rajneesh {{presented}} meditation {{not just}} as a practice but as a state of awareness to be maintained in <b>every</b> <b>moment,</b> a total awareness that awakens the individual from the sleep of mechanical responses conditioned by beliefs and expectations. He employed Western psychotherapy in the preparatory stages of meditation to create awareness of mental and emotional patterns.|$|E

25|$|In {{classical}} mechanics, {{a particle}} has, at <b>every</b> <b>moment,</b> an exact position and an exact momentum. These values change deterministically as the particle moves according to Newton's laws. Under the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, particles {{do not have}} exactly determined properties, {{and when they are}} measured, the result is randomly drawn from a probability distribution. The Schrödinger equation predicts what the probability distributions are, but fundamentally cannot predict the exact result of each measurement.|$|E

To understand {{the power of this}} theorem, imagine also that you are not allowed {{to look out the window}} of the car, so that you have no direct evidence of how far the car has traveled.|$|E
25|$|After the {{cumbrous}} {{army had}} passed through Metz it encountered an isolated corps of the enemy {{near the village of}} Mars-la-Tour, which was commanded by the brilliant leader Constantin von Alvensleben, and promptly attacked the French. At almost <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> of the day victory was in Bazaine's hands. Two corps of the Germans fought all day for bare existence. But Bazaine had no confidence in his generals or his troops, and contented himself with inflicting severe losses on the most aggressive portions of the German army.|$|E

25|$|Rooftop solar array: A rooftop {{solar panel}} {{installation}} {{was completed in}} February 2006. The 33.6kW (DC) photovoltaic (PV) arrays consist of 168 Sharp Solar 200 watt DC PV modules laminated to PowerLight's flat-roof PowerGuard mounting system and utilizes a Xantrex PV-30208 30kW AC 3 phase inverter. Integration with the school's computer network allows students to monitor the solar panels' production of electricity in real time, while saving on the school's energy cost.

25|$|Karmana sarira nama karma {{gives the}} karman body which is possessed by all worldly souls. This body is the {{receptacle}} for karman matter. It changes <b>every</b> <b>moment,</b> because new karman is continually assimilated by {{the soul and}} the already existing one consumed. Accompanied by it, the jiva at death leaves his other bodies and betakes himself {{to the place of}} his new birth, where the karman body then forms the basis of the newly produced other bodies. This body is destroyed only when all the karma are destroyed.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of the 30th we had not a moment of repose, as <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> we heard the loud crush of houses {{collapsing}} under of stones, mud, and ashes piled upon them, and feared that the turn of the convento and the church of Casasay would come in next. Shortly before daybreak of December 1 there was a tremendous crash as if the house were coming down on our heads: the roof of the apse of the church had caved in! Not long afterward, the roof of their kitchen gave away with a thud. Both were tile roofs.|$|E

25|$|The {{fate of the}} French fugitives from Fort Caroline was various and eventful. When Laudonnière {{reached the}} forest, he found there a party of men who had escaped like himself, and {{three or four of}} whom were badly wounded. A {{consultation}} was held as to what steps should be taken, for it was impossible to remain where they were for any length of time, without food, and exposed at <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> to an attack from the Spaniards. Some of the party determined to take refuge among the natives, and set out for a neighboring Indian village. These were subsequently ransomed by Menéndez and returned by him to France.|$|E
25|$|The {{group on}} the pier was a rusty one — men and women, and boys and girls, all ragged, and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and by instinct, education, and profession, beggars. They trooped after us, and never more, while we tarried in Fayal, did {{we get rid of}} them. We walked up the middle of the {{principal}} street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides, and glared upon us; and <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> excited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back, just as village boys do when they accompany the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street.|$|E
25|$|The series The Lion King's Timon & Pumbaa had a direct-to-video film named Around the World with Timon and Pumbaa, with Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella reprising {{their roles}} as Timon and Pumbaa respectively. The story tells of Pumbaa getting struck by {{lightning}}, losing all his memory, and Timon helps refrain <b>every</b> <b>moment</b> they spent. After Pumbaa gets his memory back, lightning strikes Timon losing his memory this time, making Pumbaa break the fourth wall by telling the viewers to rewind the tape {{to start at the}} beginning, being {{it was the only way}} to help Timon remember. Several episodes from the series are featured in this film. Aside from this film, two other DVDs, Dining Out... and On Holiday... are an hour compilation of other episodes of the series. No DVDs have been released in the U.S. but were released on VHS.|$|E
