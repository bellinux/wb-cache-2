Hot Wire Mass Airflow Sensors are used in automotive industry to measure the mass air flow intake into the internal combustion engine according to heat transfer principles.

40|$|Tile-based {{self-assembly}} is a {{model of}} 2 ̆ 2 algorithmic crystal growth 2 ̆ 2 in which square 2 ̆ 2 tiles 2 ̆ 2 represent molecules that bind to each other via specific and variable-strength bonds on their four sides, driven by random mixing in solution but constrained by the local binding rules of the tile bonds. In the late 1990 s, Erik Winfree introduced a discrete mathematical model of DNA tile assembly called the abstract Tile Assembly Mode. Winfree proved that the Tile Assembly Model is computationally universal, i. e., that any Turing machine can be encoded into a finite set of tile types whose self-assembly simulates that Turing machine. In this thesis, we investigate tile-based self-assembly systems that exhibit Turing universality, geometric universality and intrinsic universality. We first establish a novel characterization of the computably enumerable languages in terms of self-assembly [...] the proof of which is a novel proof of the Turing-universality of the Tile Assembly Model in which a particular Turing machine is simulated on all inputs in parallel in the two-dimensional discrete Euclidean plane. Then we prove that the multiple temperature tile assembly model (introduced by Aggarwal, Cheng, Goldwasser, Kao, and Schweller) exhibits a kind of 2 ̆ 2 geometric universality 2 ̆ 2 in the sense that there is a small (constant-size) universal tile set that can be programmed via deliberate changes in the system temperature to uniquely produce any finite shape. Just as other models of computation such as the Turing machine and cellular automaton are known to be 2 ̆ 2 intrinsically universal, 2 ̆ 2 (e. g., Turing machines can simulate other Turing machines, and cellular automata other cellular automata), we show that tile assembly systems satisfying a natural condition known as local consistency are able to simulate other locally consistent tile assembly systems. In other words, we exhibit a particular locally consistent tile assembly system that can simulate the behavior [...] as opposed to only the final result [...] of any other locally consistent tile assembly system. Finally, we consider the notion of universal fault-tolerance in algorithmic self-assembly with respect to the two-handed Tile Assembly Model, in which large aggregations of tiles may attach to each other, in contrast to the seeded Tile Assembly Model, in which tiles aggregate one at a time to a single specially-designated 2 ̆ 2 seed 2 ̆ 2 assembly. We introduce a new model of fault-tolerance in self-assembly: the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>temperature</b> model of faults having the following informal characterization: the system temperature is normally 2, but may drift down to 1, allowing unintended temperature- 1 growth for an arbitrary period of time. Our main construction, which is a tile set capable of uniquely producing an n × n square with log n unique tile types in the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>temperature</b> model, is not universal but presents novel technique that we hope will ultimately pave the way for a 2 ̆ 2 universal fuzzy-fault-tolerant 2 ̆ 2 tile assembly system in the future...|$|E
40|$|Homogeneous {{temperature}} {{regions are}} necessary for use in hydrometeorological studies. The regions are often delineated by analysing statistics derived from time series of maximum, minimum or mean temperature, rather than attributes influencing temperature. This practice cannot yield meaningful regions in data-sparse areas. Further, independent validation of the delineated regions for homogeneity in temperature is not possible, as temperature records form the basis {{to arrive at the}} regions. To address these issues, a two-stage clustering approach is proposed in this study to delineate homogeneous temperature regions. First stage of the approach involves (1) determining correlation structure between observed temperature over the study area and possible predictors (large-scale atmospheric variables) influencing the temperature and (2) using the correlation structure as the basis to delineate sites in the study area into clusters. Second stage of the approach involves analysis on each of the clusters to (1) identify potential predictors (large-scale atmospheric variables) influencing temperature at sites in the cluster and (2) partition the cluster into homogeneous <b>fuzzy</b> <b>temperature</b> regions using the identified potential predictors. Application of the proposed approach to India yielded 28 homogeneous regions that were demonstrated to be effective when compared to an alternate set of 6 regions that were previously delineated over the study area. Intersite cross-correlations of monthly maximum and minimum temperatures in the existing regions were found to be weak and negative for several months, which is undesirable. This problem was not found in the case of regions delineated using the proposed approach.

Thermal technologies depend on heat transfer and traditionally operate on differential temperature measurements between two temperature sensitive materials to generate a signal directly proportional to the temperature differential and mass flow rate. In this thesis, the development of an open-loop <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>Temperature</b> Compensation Scheme (FTCS) for Hot Wire Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor is presented. The FTCS for Hot Wire MAF Sensor is used in automotive application to measure the volume and density of air entering the engine at any given time. The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) uses this information in conjunction with input from other sensors to calculate the correct amount of fuel to deliver to the engine and also used indirectly to help calculate desired ignition timing and transmission operating strategies. This FTCS used to compensate the error occurred for the Hot Wire MAF Sensor measurement caused by the temperature variation in the air. The data collection for Hot Wire MAF Sensor inaccuracy analysis is done using NI PCI 6251 DAQ, NI Elvis Board and LABVIEW software. Based on the collected data, the absolute error and percentage error for the sensor output voltage have been calculated compared to the output voltage for the standard temperature value. Then, based on the offset error, six rules for Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) have been developed. The Sugeno type FIS is used for the FTCS design. In order to verify the performance of the proposed Hot Wire MAF Sensor temperature compensation scheme, first a simulation model is developed using Matlab/Simulink. The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy compensation scheme is verified at different temperature variations compared with Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) Temperature Compensation Scheme.
