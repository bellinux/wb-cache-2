The improvement is the result of changes in copper’s nano- and microstructure, not from graphene’s independent action as an added heat conducting channel. High temperature chemical vapor deposition stimulates grain size growth in copper films. The larger grain sizes improve heat conduction. The heat conduction improvement was more pronounced in thinner copper films, which is useful as copper interconnects shrink.|$|E

This paper deals with second stationary flows generated in a <b>heat-conducting</b> fluid contained between two permeable cylinders rotating in the same direction. Among other papers where similar problems are treated mention should be made of [1 – 4] for {{the case of a}} noncompressible fluid and [5] for the case of a <b>heat-conducting</b> fluid. The permeability of the cylinders changes the character of the obtained operator equations, which results in nonsymmetricity of the kernels of the corresponding integral equations. This fact necessitates to another method of investigation of this problem {{and this is what we}} do here. 1. Let a homogeneous viscous <b>heat-conducting</b> fluid fill up the hollow space between two rotating permeable cylinders heated up to different temperatures. The radii, angular velocities, and temperatures of the internal and outer cylinders are denoted by R 1, Ω 1, θ 1 and R 2, Ω 2, θ 2, respectively. It is assumed that there are no external mass forces, the velocity of the flow across the cross-section of the hollow space between the cylinders is zero, and the fluid inflow through one cylinder is equal to the fluid outflow through the other. The scales of length, velocity, and temperature will be denoted by R 1, Ω 1 R 1, θ 1, while the density scale will be understood as the fluid density at the temperature θ 1.
