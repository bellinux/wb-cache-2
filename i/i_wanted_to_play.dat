[...] However, he [...] "found the record stiff and one dimensional", with [...] "its style laid down in stifling arrangements." [...] Fenriz, drummer for Darkthrone, cited Show No Mercy as {{the inspiration for the}} band's [...] "current style of fusing NWOBHM with black metal". Terry Butler of Obituary and former member of Death defined the album as [...] "the blueprint for the beginning of death metal" [...] and said: [...] "When I heard Show No Mercy <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> that way....It was a whole new level of mayhem. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> that way".|$|E

Loup said that when he was thirteen, [...] "My dad had me in the backyard almost every day—or at least it seemed that way. I was always doing something, whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> baseball and knew that I needed to work hard to get there.

500|$|According to Brungardt, the {{recording}} of the project's earlier songs, [...] "Heart Attack", was critical in their decision for the album. The song was recorded during Saadiq's break from touring for The Way I See It and had originally featured that album's sound, {{with which they were}} not satisfied. When they revisited the song, Saadiq reconstructed the original recording after stripping track's individually recorded instrument parts, {{with the exception of the}} vocals and some of its drums. In an interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt said of their approach, [...] "We wanted to evolve the songs, and I wanted to evolve the engineering, as well. On The Way I See It, everything was pretty much tube pre's and tube compressors. On this one, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> around with some of the more solid-state gear".|$|E

Dumervil led the nation in sacks (20) and forced fumbles (10) during the regular season. Prior to the game, he announced that he was looking forward to the contest, saying, [...] "To me, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the best possible team in the Gator Bowl, and I think that's what we've got".|$|E

Lofton finished the regular season with a [...]275 batting average and a career-low seven stolen bases. With the Yankees looking to reshape their roster and the Philadelphia Phillies looking for a player with post-season experience, Lofton was dealt on December 3, 2004, which {{as part of the}} deal also had the Yankees sending $1.525 million to Philadelphia and the Phillies giving up reliever Felix Rodríguez. After the trade, Lofton stated, [...] "It's been very tough. I'm the kind of guy that likes to be settled down. It's been very tough the last three or four years. Everyone in New York understood <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> I just wanted an opportunity to perform and be a part of the team. I didn't feel as much of a part of the team." ...|$|E

[...] While both were students at Alabama, he partnered with Bear Bryant to operate a laundromat in Tuscaloosa called Captain Kidd Cleaners. However, neither were educated in laundering, and they sold the business after two years. While in Green Bay, Hutson opened the Packer Playdium bowling alley, which proved so successful that he twice considered retirement from football to fully dedicate his time to its operation. He then started the Hutson Motor Car Co. dealership and in 1951 purchased Chevrolet and Cadillac agencies in Racine, Wisconsin. [...] "I never aimed for automobiles," [...] said Hutson. [...] "That {{just happened to be}} the thing I got into. I just wanted to run a business, any business.|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "I’m sure I’ll wish I was still out there playing."

[...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby.

[...] The understated guitar solo played {{in the middle of the}} song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' [...] "Siberian Khatru": [...] "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> something that contrasted between the solo and the background." [...] "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay.

Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion has never been the same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome.

However, when Chopra was first considering the possibility of doing a television series in America, Lee learned that another studio was also trying to sign her, to which she reacted by saying, [...] "No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India." [...] Later, Lee traveled to India and was finally able to convince her to accept the offer. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Chopra revealed the only condition she put forward to Lee for doing a show was that she wanted them to find her a series that would put her in the same position that she currently enjoyed in India. She said [...] "There were TV shows and movies that were offered [...] before this one as well.
