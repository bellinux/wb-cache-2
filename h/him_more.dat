5|$|Before 1937–38 he {{had scored}} 43 goals in four seasons, and full-backs began to mark <b>him</b> <b>more</b> tightly; {{because of this}} he decided to drop deeper to collect the ball and aim to play {{pinpoint}} crosses as opposed to going for glory himself. Though he would never again score more than six goals in a season, this made <b>him</b> <b>more</b> an effective team player and a greater threat to the opposition.|$|E
5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{called the}} episode {{one of his}} all time favorites. Actor Steven Williams felt that his {{portrayal}} of X in this episode helped endear <b>him</b> <b>more</b> to the show's viewers.|$|E

She thanks him for his support, but points out that Dr. Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) loves him and needs <b>him</b> <b>more</b> than she does. In the final scenes, Meredith reunites with her kids.|$|E

5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} <b>him</b> <b>more</b> space and time on the ball. In this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E
5|$|Imelda was {{expected}} to be sophisticated, elegant, and well versed by her husband. Marcos knew that having a supportive wife, a trophy that he could be proud of, would gain <b>him</b> <b>more</b> supporters as well as votes. Imelda began dressing herself with expensive clothes and made every effort to become the person whom her husband wanted her to be.|$|E
5|$|Millennium {{centers on}} {{offender}} profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen), who investigates unusual crimes {{as part of}} the private investigative organisation the Millennium Group. In this episode, when Black investigates several killings by a pack of savage dogs, he discovers a strange old man who teaches <b>him</b> <b>more</b> than he ever knew about the Group.|$|E

5|$|Vanbiesbrouck {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan to a Belgian {{immigrant}} bricklayer, Robert Vanbiesbrouck, and an Italian immigrant Sara. He grew-up with two brothers; the oldest, Frank, {{who was also a}} goaltender in youth hockey. He inspired Vanbiesbrouck to play goaltender. John later noted that he learned more about goaltending just from watching Frank than any coaching could, adding that no one ever helped <b>him</b> <b>more</b> to become the player he was.|$|E
5|$|Yotsuba&! {{is drawn}} {{not in the}} {{vertical}} four-panel strips of Azuma's earlier series, Azumanga Daioh, but in a full-page format, giving <b>him</b> <b>more</b> artistic scope. Azuma's work on Yotsuba&! has been noted for its clean art, detailed backgrounds, and expressive faces. Azuma is also praised for his joyous tone, slice-of-life storytelling, comedic writing, and eccentric yet realistic characters, especially Yotsuba herself.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} figures have followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving <b>him</b> <b>more</b> ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told <b>him</b> <b>more</b> about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally {{going to be part}} of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew he would return to Lost at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E
5|$|As a {{young and}} {{promising}} defenceman, Bourdon was regularly mentioned in rumours of trades for more offence at the forward positions. Most significantly, he was speculated {{to be part of}} a package in exchange for Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brad Richards. Although Bourdon had a powerful shot, he did not play defence responsibly enough to earn a regular spot on the roster. He began to show signs of improvement and maturity as the Canucks used <b>him</b> <b>more</b> in the 2007–08 season.|$|E
5|$|At the MCM London Comic Con 2009, a Tekken 6 player named Eliot Smith-Walters {{was awarded}} the Guinness World Record for the longest winning streak in Tekken 6, by winning 68 {{consecutive}} matches, playing mainly Lars. Other competitive Tekken players have expressed their preference for Lars, though one stated he enjoyed <b>him</b> <b>more</b> in Tag Tournament 2 over Tekken 6 due to how Namco managed to balance him. The character has also been popular with cosplayers; most notably, in 2012 a Brazilian duo won an award at the 2012 World Cosplay Summit for cosplaying as Lars and Alisa.|$|E

5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the story. As a result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make <b>him</b> <b>more</b> memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Berg {{returned}} to Columbia {{after the season}} to continue working on his law degree. Despite White Sox owner Charles Comiskey offering <b>him</b> <b>more</b> money to come to spring training, Berg declined, and informed the White Sox {{that he would be}} reporting late for the 1927 season. Noel Dowling, a professor to whom Berg explained his situation, told Berg to take extra classes in the fall, and said that he would arrange with the dean a leave of absence from law school the following year, 1928.|$|E
5|$|Bolt was {{a member}} of the silver medal winning relay team with Asafa Powell, Marvin Anderson, and Nesta Carter in the 4×100 metres relay. Jamaica set a {{national}} record of 37.89 s. Bolt did not win any gold medals at the major tournaments in 2007, but Mills felt that Bolt's technique was much improved, pinpointing improvements in Bolt's balance at the turns over 200 m and an increase in his stride frequency, giving <b>him</b> <b>more</b> driving power on the track.|$|E

5|$|Burton {{originally}} did {{not want}} to direct another Batman film. Warner Bros. developed a script with Sam Hamm which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after they granted <b>him</b> <b>more</b> creative control and replaced Hamm with Daniel Waters. Wesley Strick did an uncredited rewrite, removing Harvey Dent and Robin and rewriting the climax. Annette Bening was originally cast as Catwoman but became pregnant and was replaced with Pfeiffer. Filming began in June 1991 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Rhodes left school, aged 16, he had joined Kirkheaton Cricket Club {{and started to}} take cricket seriously: he watched Yorkshire when they played close to his home and began to {{consider}} {{a career as a}} professional cricketer. Around 1893 he took a job working on the railway in the local town of Mirfield. By now playing regularly for Kirkheaton Second XI, Rhodes's keenness to reach one game on time led him to ring the off-duty bell {{before the end of the}} shift and as a result he lost his job. Subsequently, he worked on a local farm, which allowed <b>him</b> <b>more</b> time for cricket. By 1895 he achieved a place in the Kirkheaton first team, and was recommended to Gala Cricket Club, of Galashiels, Scotland, as a professional.|$|E
5|$|Christian, {{given the}} {{character}} of a vampire, formed an alliance with Gangrel and Edge, who (in storyline) was finally persuaded to join what became known as The Brood.

Upon learning that Christian was beaten into telling Ken Shamrock the whereabouts of Stephanie McMahon, The Undertaker punished Christian by flogging <b>him.</b> <b>More</b> loyal to The Brood than to The Ministry, Edge and Gangrel betrayed The Undertaker and rescued Christian from sacrifice later on.|$|E
