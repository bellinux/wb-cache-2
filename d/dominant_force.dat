5|$|In the 1980s, public {{attention}} in the United States was drawn to prosperity theology through the influence of prominent televangelists such as Jim Bakker. Bakker's influence waned, however, after he was implicated in a high-profile scandal.

5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The <b>dominant</b> <b>force</b> in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of Muhammad's life, the Quraysh tribe he belonged to became a <b>dominant</b> <b>force</b> in western Arabia. They formed the cult {{association}} of hums, which tied members of many tribes in western Arabia to the Kaaba and reinforced the prestige of the Meccan sanctuary. To counter the effects of anarchy, Quraysh upheld the institution of sacred months during which all violence was forbidden, and it was possible to participate in pilgrimages and fairs without danger. Thus, although the association of hums was primarily religious, it also had important economic consequences for the city.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his victory}} at Marj Ibn Amer, 4,000 locals, {{including}} many residents of Nazareth, joined Zahir's forces to completely subdue Jabal Nablus. Among Zahir's supporters were Christian women from Nazareth who supplied his troops {{with food and}} water. Zahir's forces pursued the Jarrars to their throne village of Sanur, but ultimately withdrew after failing to subdue the fortress. This defeat marked the limit of Zahir's influence south of Marj Ibn Amer and established the Jarrars as the <b>dominant</b> <b>force</b> of Jabal Nablus over their rivals, the Tuqans. While the Jarrars and Zahir eventually concluded a truce, the former continued to mobilize the clans of Jabal Nablus to prevent Zahir's southward expansion.|$|E
5|$|From the Forth {{south to}} the River Humber lay the kingdom of Northumbria. Once the <b>dominant</b> <b>force</b> in Britain, it {{remained}} a powerful kingdom, but {{the end of the}} old dynasty of kings with the death of Osric in 729 led to conflict between rival families for the throne. The growing power of the Mercian kingdom to the south added to the problems faced by Northumbrian kings. For most of Óengus's reign Northumbria was ruled by the capable King Eadberht Eating.|$|E

5|$|Water is the <b>dominant</b> <b>force</b> in the Everglades, {{shaping the}} land, vegetation, and animal life in South Florida. Starting {{at the last}} glacial maximum, 21,000 years ago, {{continental}} ice sheets retreated and sea levels rose. This submerged portions of the Florida peninsula and caused the water table to rise. Fresh water saturated the limestone that underlies the Everglades, eroding some of it away, and created springs and sinkholes. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and formed convective thunderstorms over the land through evaporation.|$|E
5|$|European traders had {{established}} outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the British East India company subdued local kingdoms and established {{themselves as the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>force</b> by the 18th century.

The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montague–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed {{the enactment of the}} repressive Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of non-cooperation and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.|$|E
