40|$|The disease risks {{associated}} with sedentary behavior are now firmly established, and consequently there is much interest in methods of increasing low-intensity physical activity. In this context, it is a widely held belief that altering posture allocation can modify energy expenditure (EE) to impact upon body weight regulation and health. However, we recently showed the existence of two distinct phenotypes pertaining to the energy cost of standing–with the majority of a Caucasian cohort showing no sustained increase in EE during standing relative to sitting. Here we investigated whether this phenomenon is also observed across a multi-ethnic male cohort. Objective: To determine the magnitude and time-course of changes in EE and respiratory quotient (RQ) during steady-state standing versus sitting, and to explore inter-individual variability in these responses across 4 ethnic groups (European, Indian, Chinese, African) Design: Min-by-min monitoring using posture-adapted ventilated-hood indirect calorimetry was conducted in 35 healthy, men (20 – 43 years) during 10 min of steady-state standing versus sitting comfortably. Results: 69 % of subjects showed little or no increase (< 5 %) in EE during standing compared to sitting (<b>energy</b> <b>savers).</b> Furthermore, the proportion of <b>energy</b> <b>savers</b> did not significantly differ between ethnic groups, despite ethnic differences in anthropometry; with body weight as the primary predictor of the energy cost of standing maintenance (r 2 = 0. 30, p = 0. 001). Conclusion: Our {{results indicate that the}} majority of individuals in a multi-ethnic cohort display a postural energy-saver phenotype. The mechanisms by which the large majority of individuals appear to maintain sitting and standing postures at the same energetic cost remains to be elucidated but is of considerable importance {{to our understanding of the}} spontaneous physical activity compartment of EE and its potential as a target for weight regulation...|$|R

The Climate Clever <b>Energy</b> <b>Savers</b> (CCES) Project is designed to raise awareness among school students about ways of reducing electricity consumption at their schools. Students are invited to tender for funds of up to $ 2000. 00 to support a program (such as an education campaign, or building or appliance modification) to reduce electricity consumption. The overarching research question concerns the extent to which and ways in which the program has achieved the desired behaviour changes and educational outcomes.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} find out the effect of different light intensities on the production performance of broiler chickens. One hundred and fifty broiler chickens were randomly divided into 15 equal experimental units. Three experimental units (replicates) were randomly assigned to each of the five experimental groups. Light treatment T 1 (20 lux at first week and 5 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group A, T 2 (20 lux at first week and 10 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group B, T 3 (20 lux at first week and 20 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group C, T 4 (20 lux at first week and 30 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group D, T 5 (20 lux at first week and 40 lux from 2 - 6 week) was given to group E. Results indicated a non-significant effect of light intensity on body weight and feed consumption whereas, feed conversion ratio (FCR) was significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by light intensities. The birds in group A showed significantly better FCR and fetched more profit. Mortality rate was the highest (13. 33 %) in the birds kept under group E.

50|$|The {{plans to}} tear the Glaspaleis down were the last straw for some admirers of the building. In 1993 Nic Tummers started a {{workgroup}} ('Werkgroep Behoud Glaspaleis') and Wiel Arets and others started the F.P.J.Peutz Foundation. These efforts were supported by alderman Seijben and in 1994 the City council applied for a monument status. In 1995 the building was declared a National Monument and in 1997 the City bought it (a unanimous decision) {{to turn it into}} a cultural centre. In 1999, the international architect and Peutz-admirer Wiel Arets, and Jo Coenen were commissioned to restore the building to its original state (done by building contractor Laudy-Heijmans). Only minor changes were made to the original design. For instance, the floors were made 17 cm thicker to hide the piping and wiring and floor heating and cooling. And the original highly transparent flint glass was no longer available in the appropriate dimensions. But these differences are not visible to the naked eye (unlike some others - see below). These have to do with modern standards such as construction regulations, durability, double glazing (without losing transparency, so no heat-absorbing coating was used) and other <b>energy</b> <b>savers.</b> For this it won the Nationale Renovatieprijs (National Renovation Award) in the Utiliteitsbouw category.

40|$|The heating units {{shown in}} the {{accompanying}} photos are Panelbloc infrared heaters, <b>energy</b> <b>savers</b> which burn little fuel {{in relation to their}} effective heat output. Produced by Bettcher Manufacturing Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio, Panelblocs are applicable to industrial or other facilities which have ceilings more than 12 feet high, such as those pictured: at left the Bare Hills Tennis Club, Baltimore, Maryland and at right, CVA Lincoln- Mercury, Gaithersburg, Maryland. The heaters are mounted high above the floor and they radiate infrared energy downward. Panelblocs do not waste energy by warming the surrounding air. Instead, they beam invisible heat rays directly to objects which absorb the radiation- people, floors, machinery and other plant equipment. All these objects in turn re-radiate the energy to the air. A key element in the Panelbloc design is a coating applied to the aluminized steel outer surface of the heater. This coating must be corrosion resistant at high temperatures and it must have high "emissivity"-the ability of a surface to emit radiant energy. The Bettcher company formerly used a porcelain coating, but it caused a production problem. Bettcher did not have the capability to apply the material in its own plant, so the heaters had to be shipped out of state for porcelainizing, which entailed extra cost. Bettcher sought a coating which could meet the specifications yet be applied in its own facilities. The company asked The Knowledge Availability Systems Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a NASA Industrial Applications Center (IAC), for a search of NASA's file...|$|R
40|$|This thesis treats angle-resolved optical {{properties}} {{and the energy}} efficiency of windows. A theoretical evaluation of optical and thermal properties of windows is briefly surveyed and the energy performance of a large selection of windows, under different conditions, is examined. In particular, angle dependent {{optical properties}} are analysed. A new model assessing angle dependence of the total solar energy transmittance, g, of windows is presented. A comparison of simple models for angle-dependence prediction has been performed, including both fictitious and measured real window glazings. The new proposed model illustrates low errors for both the real and the fictitious glazings. The impact of inaccuracy in the angle dependence of the g-factor has been assessed and found to be clearly noticeable but not necessarily critical. A simple model for comparing the energy efficiency of different windows in different types of buildings and different climates has been further developed and analysed for several conditions. The energy performance {{of a large number}} of windows has been analysed using this model, and also by using other building and window simulation models. Typical savings when changing from a standard double glazed window to the optimal window for the investigated case is in the order of 100 - 150 kWh/m 2 yr. The annual energy balance of modern low emittance windows illustrates that they can be annual <b>energy</b> <b>savers</b> rather than <b>energy</b> losers, unlike traditional windows. However, it is shown that it is not important to argue about small changes (~ 0. 01) of the thermal emittance value. Furthermore, advance solar control glazings effectively reduce solar transmittance with maintained high light transmittance. AR-coatings and low-iron glazings can increase the transmittance of glazings considerably. In fact, a "super" low emittance window with a U-value below 1 W/m 2 K can have higher light transmittance than a common double-glazed unit. Windows with variable transmittance, switchable windows, are compared with high-performing solar control windows, illustrating some degree of potential energy savings compared to high performing static solar control windows, depending on the type of control that is used. This is accompanied by the potential for automatic thermal comfort- and glare control. Different models for energy rating of windows have been evaluated, demonstrating that a simple linear rating depending on the U and g-factor of the window may be sufficient with certain restrictions. Division into climate zones is essential. In all, the results demonstrate that energy-efficient windows provide huge energy-saving potentials on a large (regional, national, global) scale...|$|R

Successfully implementing lobbying regulations and techniques is of extreme importance for any public system, where social participation in the decision-making process can strongly contribute to social, political and economic / fi nancial effi - ciency. Over the last 15 years, several legislative initiatives have tried to design a coherent framework for lobby, but they are still unapplied either due to insuffi cient public understanding of the concept, or due to more or less justifi ed uncertainties and fears. The necessity of regulating lobbying in Romania is placed in a context where an important number of anticorruption international and domestic recommendations and state reliability statistics, added to a certain lack of effectiveness in time and public money management, show that the public administration system needs to be reformed. And lobbying is, as the following article shows, a must for any public reform of public administration in Romania.

"While the {{electrical}} grid in the United States is very reliable, {{it is currently}} somewhat limited {{in its ability to}} incorporate new renewable energy sources; to effectively manage demand response; to sense and monitor trouble spots; and to repair itself." [...] This reliability will not last if the grid systems stay the same as populations rise and electricity demands rise.
