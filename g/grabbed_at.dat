5|$|Rathbone {{jumped from}} his seat and {{struggled}} with Booth, who dropped the pistol and drew a knife, then stabbed Rathbone in the left forearm. Rathbone again <b>grabbed</b> <b>at</b> Booth as Booth prepared to jump from the box to the stage, a twelve-foot drop; Booth's riding spur became entangled on the Treasury flag decorating the box, and he landed awkwardly on his left foot. As he began crossing the stage, many in the audience thought {{he was part of}} the play.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid leaning {{over in his}} seat, and unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to get his attention. After she {{asked him what he}} was doing, Reid <b>grabbed</b> <b>at</b> her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the TATP and prevented it from igniting.|$|E
25|$|Chard {{realised}} {{that the}} north wall, under near constant Zulu attack, could not be held. At 6:00 pm, he pulled his men back into the yard, abandoning the front two rooms of the hospital in the process. The hospital was becoming untenable; as the loopholes had become a liability: rifles poking out were <b>grabbed</b> <b>at</b> by the Zulus, yet if the holes were left empty, the Zulu warriors stuck their own weapons through in order to fire into the rooms. Among the soldiers assigned to the hospital were Corporal William Wilson Allen and Privates Cole, Dunbar, Hitch, Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams, Alfred Henry Hook, Robert Jones, and William Jones.|$|E

500|$|In {{reaction}} to this attempt, the Secret Service began keeping Ford at a more secure distance from anonymous crowds, a strategy that may have saved his life seventeen days later. As he left the St. Francis Hotel in downtown San Francisco, Sara Jane Moore, standing in a crowd of onlookers across the street, pointed her [...]38-caliber revolver at him. Moore fired a single round but missed because the sights were off. Just before she fired a second round, retired Marine Oliver Sipple <b>grabbed</b> <b>at</b> the gun and deflected her shot; the bullet struck a wall about six inches above {{and to the right}} of Ford's head, then ricocheted and hit a taxi driver, who was slightly wounded. Moore was later sentenced to life in prison. She was paroled on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years.|$|E
2500|$|Fruing <b>grabbed</b> <b>at</b> Potter's proposal. Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes was {{released}} in October 1917 with a revised edition of Peter Rabbit's Painting Book and the new Tom Kitten's Painting Book. Appley Dapply sold well. Potter was satisfied and wrote Warne in late October, [...] "I am much pleased with A. D., it makes a pretty book." [...] It was reprinted in November 1917, and, {{by the end of}} the year, 20,000 copies had been sold. The dummy book would be raided again in 1922 to compile a collection of nursery rhymes called Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes as a companion to Appley Dapply.|$|E

60|$|We were {{climbing}} a precipitous path sufficiently dangerous in the dark, Dominic, {{more familiar with}} it, going first and I scrambling close behind in order that I might <b>grab</b> <b>at</b> his cloak if I chanced to slip or miss my footing. I remonstrated against this arrangement as we stopped to rest. I had no doubt I would <b>grab</b> <b>at</b> his cloak if I felt myself falling. I couldn’t help doing that. But I would probably only drag him down with me.|$|R

2500|$|... "His way" [...] could {{generally}} {{be summed up}} as domineering and increasingly paranoid. In one well-known incident, he claimed that a secretary's cut thumb {{was the result of}} a malicious act and he demanded lie detector tests to find the culprit, when in reality, the secretary had simply <b>grabbed</b> <b>at</b> a door handle that happened to have an exposed tack on it for the purpose of hanging paper notes on. After he received the Nobel Prize in 1956 his demeanor changed, as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic, erratic and hard-to-please management style. In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the [...] "traitorous eight", resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors. They went on to form Fairchild Semiconductor, a loss from which Shockley Semiconductor never recovered. Over the course of the next 20 years, more than 65 new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to Fairchild.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{began at}} 2:37p.m., and was {{played on a}} soggy field {{resulting}} from [...] "a constant rain of fourteen hours." [...] The rain continued throughout the game, resulting in a slippery ball and numerous fumbles. [...] Illinois turned the ball over four times on fumbles, and Michigan did so three times. [...] In the Detroit Free Press, Joe S. Jackson wrote: [...] "All during the game there was a heavy rainfall[...] [...] [...] [...] With a strong west wind driving this on a slant into the faces of one set of players, and down the necks of all the spectators {{the joy of the}} day was not extreme." [...] On the first play of the game, John Garrels ran 90 yards for a touchdown. [...] Joe S. Jackson wrote: [...] "Seldom does one see a run of ninety yards to a touchdown[...] [...] [...] On the first kick-off, [...] [...] [...] Garrels got the ball on his own twenty-yard line. [...] For twenty yards he went through the weaving mass of players, practically alone. [...] Then interference began to form. [...] Once or twice he was <b>grabbed</b> <b>at,</b> but shook off the tackler. [...] How he got through is a marvel, unless the rain, beating directly into the faces of the Illini, partially blinded them[...] [...] [...] He had gone by twenty-one men, friends and foes, when he touched the ball down behind the Illinois goal posts." ...|$|E
