50|$|In {{enclosed}} rooms {{not only}} the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> from a sound source is arriving at the listener's ears, but also sound which has been reflected at the walls. The auditory system analyses only the <b>direct</b> <b>sound,</b> which is arriving first, for sound localization, but not the reflected sound, which is arriving later (law of the first wave front). So sound localization remains possible even in an echoic environment. This echo cancellation occurs in the Dorsal Nucleus of the Lateral Lemniscus (DNLL).|$|R
50|$|Haas {{found that}} humans {{localize}} sound {{sources in the}} direction of the first arriving sound despite the presence of a single reflection from a different direction. A single auditory event is perceived. A reflection arriving later than 1 ms after the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> increases the perceived level and spaciousness (more precisely the perceived width of the sound source). A single reflection arriving within 5 to 30 ms can be up to 10 dB louder than the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> without being perceived as a secondary auditory event (echo). This time span varies with the reflection level. If the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> is coming from the same direction the listener is facing, the reflection's direction has no significant effect on the results. A reflection with attenuated higher frequencies expands the time span that echo suppression is active. Increased room reverberation time also expands the time span of echo suppression.|$|R

The present experiments ask how such spectral transitions affect the fusion and segregation of parts of a vowel sound. The vowels in "itch" or "etch" were played through a filter to simulate the effects of an undistorted <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> with a later-arriving, complex pattern of reflections. This filter was designed to impair identification of the two test-vowels in a way that is independent of the reflections' delay.

This index was obtained when the reflections' delay was varied, as well as when parts of the vowel before or after the spectral transition were replaced with "signal correlated noise". The pattern of results indicates that the reflections fused with the part of the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> that follows the spectral transition, while the part before the spectral transition is hardly affected by the subsequent reflections.
