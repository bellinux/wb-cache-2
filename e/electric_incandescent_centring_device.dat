That dual lens device had been developed by Cornell University's Dr. William Churchill, while he was working at Corning Glass Works.

5000|$|Light {{has been}} used for {{architectural}} effect throughout human history. However, the modern concept of light art emerged with the development of artificial <b>electric</b> <b>incandescent</b> light sources and experimentation by modern artists of the Constructivist and Bauhaus movements. [...] "Prounenraum (Proun room) (1923), by El Lissitzky, is considered by many art historians to be the first time an artist incorporated architectural lighting elements as a component integral to his work." [...] The first object-based light sculpture was the Light-Space Modulator (1922-1930), by László Moholy-Nagy. Experimentation and innovations in theatrical light have often influenced other areas of light use such as light art. The development of Modernism and the electric light go hand-in-hand; the idea of the modern city with high-rises and electric light epitomizes this development.|$|R

And with the last flickering gleam of that baleful light the Frenchman broke into a shout of joy.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of this publication, the {{following}} month, that is in February 1896, professors Zegers and Salazar began experimenting on this new technique in Chile. Success was finally obtained on March 22, 1896, as the first radiograph was made, not only in Chile but in all of Ibero-America. This accomplishment was announced and published on March 27 in the Actes de la Societé Scientifique du Chili (Proceedings of the Scientific Society of Chile), Vol. VI (1896), a monograph of 46 lines: [...] "Experiments on the production of Roentgen rays by means of <b>electric</b> <b>incandescent</b> lights". This was the first work on X-rays published in Latin America. The publication is written in what some termed [...] "rational orthography", which Salazar espoused. The article shows a schematic of the electric circuit used as well as a radiograph of four fingers of Zegers’ right hand, taken five days before the publication. The exposure for this radiograph lasted 14 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first known}} {{electrically}} illuminated Christmas tree {{was the creation}} of Edward H. Johnson, an associate of inventor Thomas Edison. While he was vice president of the Edison Electric Light Company, a predecessor of today's Con Edison electric utility, he had Christmas tree light bulbs especially made for him. He proudly displayed his Christmas tree, which was hand-wired with 80 red, white and blue <b>electric</b> <b>incandescent</b> light bulbs the size of walnuts, on December 22, 1882 at his home on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Local newspapers ignored the story, seeing it as a publicity stunt. However, it was published by a Detroit newspaper reporter, and Johnson has become widely regarded as the Father of Electric Christmas Tree Lights. By 1900, businesses started stringing up Christmas lights behind their windows. [...] Christmas lights were too expensive for the average person; as such, electric Christmas lights did not become the majority replacement for candles until 1930.|$|R
5000|$|One {{important}} point is, {{that there is}} no source to confirm Goebel's alleged source of knowledge in the fields of electricity and vacuum physics. Goebel claimed that he had worked together with a certain Professor Münchhausen in the 1840s, that he had constructed equipment for experiments at today's University of Hanover ( [...] at that time called Höhere Gewerbeschule), that he had assisted experiments related to electric light, that he had got the idea and the basic concept of the design of an <b>electric</b> <b>incandescent</b> lamp from Professor Münchhausen and that he had continued with experiments on electric light on his own in New York. A person Professor Münchhausen was not known in the Kingdom of Hanover in the 1830s and 1840s, there is no documentation of experiments on electric light in the Kingdom of Hanover in the 1840s and no source for deliveries of equipment or any other kind of relation of Henry Goebel to today's University of Hanover.|$|R

40|$|About 30 % of all {{primary energy}} {{resources}} worldwide {{are used to}} generate electrical energy. Since {{the invention of the}} <b>electric</b> <b>incandescent</b> light bulb in 1879, the growth of electric power systems progressed at an exponential rate, particularly after the development of AC (alternating current) power generation and the transformer. Transforming AC power from one voltage level to much higher levels meant that losses and voltage drops in the supply lines could be kept at acceptable values. The contribution of different renewable energy sources to the electricity generation mix varies from one country to another, but generally this is currently a small proportion of the total installed capacity. The increase in renewable energy generation involves significant challenges in establishing cost-effective and reliable renewable energy systems in addition to solving the technical problems associated with their connection to the grid. In order to understand the impact of increased connection of RES on the grid and the need for smart grid solutions, it is important first to understand how electricity is currently generated, the characteristics of generation from RES, and some aspects of grid control...|$|R

Fishing with torches was eventually improved with the use of fuel oil, kerosene, gas and electricity, so that throughout the centuries, the light fishery have used fires, torches, acetylene, kerosene, gas and <b>electric</b> <b>incandescent</b> and fluorescent lamps, as fishing lights. Many countries in the world have some methods of fishing with light, but Japanese light fishery is the largest light fishing industry in the world.

50|$|Nineteenth-century {{technology}} revolutionized stage lighting, which {{until then}} had been primitive. The introduction of gas lighting {{was the first}} step. In 1816, Philadelphia's Chestnut Street Theater became the earliest gas-lit playhouse in the world. The introduction of gas lighting revolutionized stage lighting. It provided a somewhat more natural and adequate light for the playing and the scenic space upstage of the proscenium arch. However, this new richness in lighting provided difficulties at first. Though scenic painters {{had to learn to}} subdue their colors to the increased candle-power, the brightness only further highlight the disparity between three-dimensional set pieces and their two-dimensional backdrop and led to the latter's eventual decline. The advent of limelight, also known as Drummond light, also effectively introduced spotlighting to theater. Thomas Edison's <b>electric</b> <b>incandescent</b> lamp, invented in 1879, was the next step. It made electricity the most flexible, most controllable, and safest form of lighting, in the twentieth century, it would make stage lighting design a true art. These new means of illumination tremendously increased the control over stage light and stimulated interest in imitating lighting phenomena of nature.|$|R
