In 1866 the Pharmaceutical Journal {{stated that it}} was found as a {{contaminant}} in Alexandrian senna, being found in cultivated fields in the valleys {{to the east and}} south of Assouan, in the Elephantine Islands, opposite Assouan, along the Nile, and Edfou and Hermonthis. In Israel it grows in the Judean desert, the Dead Sea Valley, the Negev hills and Eilat.|$|E
5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E

The NGO Survival International has reported that throughout the 1980s up to forty thousand gold prospectors entered Yanomami territory bringing diseases the Yanomami had no immunity to, the prospectors shot and destroyed entire villages, and Survival International estimates that up to twenty per cent of the people were dead within seven years.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefit of}} measles {{vaccination}} in preventing illness, disability, and death <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> The first 20 years of licensed measles vaccination in the U.S. prevented an estimated 52 million {{cases of the}} disease, 17,400 cases of intellectual disability, and 5,200 deaths. During 1999–2004, a strategy led by the World Health Organization and UNICEF led to improvements in measles vaccination coverage that averted an estimated 1.4 million measles deaths worldwide. Between 2000 and 2013, measles vaccination resulted in a 75% decrease in deaths from the disease.|$|E

Browning in response to chronic cold exposure <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> and is a reversible process. A study in mice demonstrated that cold-induced browning can be completely reversed in 21 days, with measurable decreases in UCP1 seen within a 24-hour period. A study by Rosenwald et al. revealed that when the animals are re-exposed to a cold environment, the same adipocytes will adopt a beige phenotype, suggesting that beige adipocytes are retained.|$|E

Retired Miami-Dade police officer (and licensed polygraph operator) Joe Harper will hook Stugotz up to a lie-detector, ask him if statements he made actually happened, and then announce the result, often with hilarious results.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing {{has greatly}} {{affected}} many fisheries around the world. As much as 85% of the world's fisheries may be over-exploited, depleted, fully exploited or in recovery from exploitation. Significant overfishing {{has been observed}} in pre-industrial times. In particular, the overfishing of the western Atlantic Ocean from {{the earliest days of}} European colonisation of the Americas <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> Following World War Two, industrial fishing rapidly expanded with rapid increases in worldwide fishing catches. However, many fisheries have either collapsed or degraded to a point where increased catches are no longer possible.|$|E
25|$|Insectivorous birds prey {{upon the}} larva of the gypsy moth, but the egg {{clusters}} {{are protected by}} their hair coverings. The effects of bird predation have not been fully studied in North America, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> in Japan and Eurasia. When outbreaks of gypsy moths occur, bird predation has no {{significant effect on the}} population. Birds that consume gypsy moth larvae, pupae and adults include the bluejay, red-eyed vireo, rufous-sided towhee, northern oriole, catbird and the robin. The black-capped chickadee preys upon the entire life cycle, including the eggs.|$|E

25|$|The SD was the {{overarching}} agency {{under which the}} Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD, {{also known as the}} Einsatzgruppen, was subordinated; {{this was one of the}} principal reasons for the later war-crimes indictment against the organization by the Allies. The Einsatzgruppen’s part in the Holocaust <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented.</b> Its mobile killing units were active in the implementation of the Final Solution in the territories overrun by the Nazi war machine. This SD subsidiary worked closely with the Wehrmacht in persecuting Jews, communists, partisans, and other groups, as well. Starting with the invasion of Poland throughout the campaign in the East, the Einsatzgruppen ruthlessly killed anyone suspected of being an opponent of the regime, either real or imagined. The men of the Einsatzgruppen were recruited from the SD, Gestapo, Kripo, Orpo, and Waffen-SS.|$|E
25|$|The Bible {{describes}} Jesus's tomb {{as being}} {{outside the city}} wall, as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean. Today, {{the site of the}} Church is within the current walls of the old city of Jerusalem. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> by archaeologists that in the time of Jesus, the walled city was smaller and the wall then was to the east of the current site of the Church. In other words, the city had been much narrower in Jesus' time, with the site then having been outside the walls; since Herod Agrippa (41–44) is recorded by history as extending the city to the north (beyond the present northern walls), the required repositioning of the western wall is traditionally attributed to him as well.|$|E
25|$|Many extant lung-breathing marine {{vertebrates}} {{are capable}} of deep diving. There are some indications about the diving capacity of ichthyosaurs. Quickly ascending from a greater depth can cause decompression sickness. The resulting bone necrosis <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> with Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs, where it is present in 15% and 18% of specimens respectively, but is rare in Triassic species. This could {{be a sign that}} basal forms did not dive as deeply, but might also be explained by a greater predation pressure during the later epochs, more often necessitating a fast flight to the surface. However, this last possibility is contradicted by the fact that, with modern animals, damage is not caused by a limited number of rapid ascension incidents, but by a gradual accumulation of non-invalidating degeneration during normal diving behaviour.|$|E

25|$|A {{decline in}} giant {{trevally}} numbers around inhabited regions <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> in Hawaii, with both catch data as presented above and ecological studies showing this decrease in numbers. A biomass {{study in the}} Hawaiian Islands indicates the main Hawaiian Islands are heavily depleted in the species, which in untouched ecosystems comprises 71% of the apex predator biomass. In contrast, it comprises less than 0.03% of the apex biomass in exploited habitats, with only a single fish observed {{during the course of}} this research study. Prior to this, a 1993 report suggested the population around the main Hawaiian islands were not stressed, though several biological indicators suggested to the contrary. This was due to the highly size-selective nature of the fishery, which theoretically should prevent a decrease in numbers. Despite this, populations have decreased, and in light of their continued falling abundance in Hawaii, several recommendations, including banning the commercial take of the species, increasing minimum lengths and decreasing bag limits for anglers, as well as reassessment of protected areas for the species, have been proposed by officials. The species (nor any other carangid) has not been assessed by the IUCN.|$|E
500|$|Accidental {{intoxication}} {{of humans}} by [...] mad honey <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>well</b> <b>documented</b> by several Classical authors, notably Xenophon, while the deliberate {{use of such}} honey as a medicine and intoxicant (even hallucinogen) is still practiced by the Gurung tribe of Nepal, who have {{a long tradition of}} hazardous cliff-climbing to wrest the precious commodity from the nests of Apis dorsata laboriosa, the giant Himalayan honeybee. The honey thus collected by the Gurung owes its inebriating properties to the nectar which the giant bees gather from a deep red-flowered species of Rhododendron, which, in turn, owes its toxicity to the compound grayanotoxin, widespread in the plant family Ericaceae, to which the genus Rhododendron belongs.|$|E
