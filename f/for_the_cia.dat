5|$|The 1949 Intelligence Survey Group had {{produced}} the Dulles-Jackson-Correa Report, {{which found that}} the CIA had failed in its responsibilities in both the coordination and production of intelligence. In response, the U.S. National Security Council accepted the conclusions and recommendations of the report. It remained to implement them. In May 1950, President Truman decided that Smith was the man he needed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> Before Smith could assume the post on 7 October, {{there was a major}} intelligence failure. The North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950, which started the Korean War, took the administration entirely by surprise, and it raised fears of a third world war.|$|E
5|$|The family then {{initiated}} {{a long journey}} in exile that would take them first to Mexico, then to Canada, where they went to pick up Arabella (the Árbenzs' oldest daughter), and then to Switzerland via the Netherlands and Paris. They hoped to obtain citizenship in Switzerland based on Árbenz's Swiss heritage. However, the former president {{did not wish to}} renounce his Guatemalan nationality, as he felt that such gesture would have marked the end of his political career. Árbenz and his family were the victims of a CIA-orchestrated and intense defamation campaign that lasted from 1954 to 1960.

5|$|As well {{as using}} events from his past, Fleming also used names of {{individuals}} he knew {{for some of}} his characters. The editor of The London Magazine, Alan Ross, had provided Fleming with details {{about the effects of}} the electroshock therapy that Bond went through and, by way of thanks, the novel's SIS station chief in Jamaica, Commander Ross, was named after him. Similarly, Fleming used the name of the secretary of the Royal St George's Golf Club, Mark Nicholson, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> representative at the hotel. Tony Hugill, the sugar planter mentioned in the novel, was named after a member of Fleming's 30 AU unit who managed the Tate & Lyle plantations in West Indies after the war and the book's main villain, Francisco Scaramanga, was named after George Scaramanga, an Etonian contemporary of Fleming's: the pair are said to have fought at school.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after joining}} <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> Morales became an {{operative}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA's</b> Directorate <b>for</b> Plans. It's alleged {{that he was}} involved in Executive Action, a series of projects designed to kill foreign leaders deemed unfriendly to the United States. Morales reportedly was involved in Operation PBSUCCESS, <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> covert operation that overthrew the democratically elected President of Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{involvement}} of the Kersten committee and of Kersten and Hillings caused concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA.</b> Dulles constantly worried that their investigation would damage CIA operations, particularly when Hillings visited Guatemala shortly before PBSUCCESS was to begin. Additionally, Congresspeople had not officially been informed of the CIA's role in the coup, and Dulles wished to keep them uninformed. By supplying them with PBHistory documents, Dulles hoped to forestall them from inadvertently exposing the CIA's other projects. Following the hearings, a subcommittee headed by Hillings produced a final report. In addition to stating without evidence that the Guatemalan government had been acting under orders from the Soviet Union, this report also falsely claimed that Soviet weapons had been brought covertly to Guatemala by submarine. This unintentionally drew attention to Operation WASHTUB, a CIA effort to foist incriminating weapons on the Guatemalan government.|$|E
5|$|The Camp Chapman {{attack was}} a suicide attack by Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi against the Central Intelligence Agency {{facility}} inside Forward Operating Base Chapman on December 30, 2009. FOB Chapman is located near the eastern Afghanistan city of Khost, which is about 10 miles northwest of the border with Pakistan. One of the main tasks of the CIA personnel stationed at the base was to provide intelligence supporting drone attacks against targets in Pakistan. Seven American CIA officers and contractors, an officer of Jordan's intelligence service, and an Afghan working <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA</b> were killed when al-Balawi detonated a bomb sewn into a vest he was wearing. Six other American CIA officers were wounded. The bombing was the most lethal attack against the CIA in more than 25 years.|$|E

25|$|In {{his grand}} jury testimony, Rove testified {{he learned of}} Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials.

Rove told the grand jury that three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>CIA,</b> though he never used her name.
