5|$|Gens {{was shot}} by the Gestapo on 14 September 1943, shortly before the ghetto was {{liquidated}} {{and most of the}} residents sent either to labor camps or to execution at an <b>extermination</b> <b>camp.</b> His Lithuanian wife and daughter escaped the Gestapo and survived the war.|$|E
50|$|Jews-Polish {{researchers}} {{have determined that}} the Nazis murdered 1,860,000 Polish Jews in the <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> in Poland, plus another 1.0 million Polish Jewish deaths in prisons and ghettos. In addition 970,000 Jews from other nations were murdered in the Nazi <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> in Poland.|$|R

5|$|When {{the other}} Jewish {{children}} {{were sent to}} Chelmno, Syvia's family smuggled the children from cellar to cellar. The book also relates tragic events: one of Syvia's friends disappears, and another is killed and burned in an <b>extermination</b> <b>camp.</b> The ghetto is liberated one day shy of Syvia's tenth birthday, on January 19, 1945. Syvia, her older sister Dora, and a younger cousin, Isaac, were three of only twelve children who survived.|$|E
5|$|A SS-Sonderkommando unit led by SS-Sturmbannführer Herbert Lange murdered 1,201 {{psychiatric}} {{patients at}} the Tiegenhof psychiatric hospital in the Free City of Danzig, 1,100 patients in Owińska, 2,750 patients at Kościan, and 1,558 patients at Działdowo, as well as hundreds of Poles at Fort VII, where the mobile gas van and gassing bunker were developed. In 1941–42, SS-Sonderkommando Lange set up and managed the first <b>extermination</b> <b>camp,</b> at Chełmno, where 152,000 Jews were killed using gas vans.|$|E
5|$|All {{but four}} of the women from Lidice were {{deported}} immediately to Ravensbrück concentration camp (four were pregnant– they were subjected to forced abortions at the same hospital where Heydrich had died and the women were then sent to the concentration camp). Some children were chosen for Germanization, and 81 were killed in gas vans at the Chełmno <b>extermination</b> <b>camp.</b> Both towns were burned and Lidice's ruins were levelled. At least 1,300 people were massacred after Heydrich's death.|$|E

5|$|As the Decepticons {{retreated from}} Earth, with a {{critically}} injured Megatron, {{it created a}} void among the Decepticon ranks. Many of Megatron's former generals take turns trying to gain power. Others go rouge, like Overlord as he takes control of the Garrus 9 penal facility and turns it into an <b>extermination</b> <b>camp.</b> A new team of Wreckers is sent by Prowl to retake the prison. They manage, however, at a heavy price with most members dead or critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|Every few weeks, the Nazis {{staged a}} roundup in the Lvov ghetto of people unable to work. These roundups {{typically}} took place while the able-bodied were absent doing forced labour. In one such deportation, Wiesenthal's mother and other elderly Jewish women were transported by freight train to Belzec <b>extermination</b> <b>camp</b> {{and killed in}} August 1942. Around the same time, a Ukrainian policeman shot Cyla's mother to death {{on the front porch}} of her home in Buczacz while she was being evicted. Cyla and Simon Wiesenthal lost 89 relatives during the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{estimates}} {{of the total number}} of people killed at Treblinka; most scholarly estimates range from 700,000 to 900,000, meaning that more Jews died at Treblinka than at any other Nazi <b>extermination</b> <b>camp</b> apart from Auschwitz. The Treblinka museum in Poland states that at least 800,000 people died at Treblinka; Yad Vashem, which is Israel's Holocaust museum, puts the number killed at 870,000; and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gives a range of 870,000 to 925,000.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{evidence}} submitted by the prosecution {{took the form of}} depositions made by leading Nazis. The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence's right to cross-examination would not be abrogated. But Hausner, in his role as Attorney General, declared that he would be obliged to have any war criminals who entered Israel arrested. The prosecution proved that Eichmann had visited places where exterminations had taken place, including Chełmno <b>extermination</b> <b>camp,</b> Auschwitz, and Minsk (where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews), and therefore was aware that the deportees were being killed.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, it was {{reported}} that Gröning had been charged by state prosecutors with having been an accessory to murder for his role at Auschwitz receiving and processing prisoners and their personal belongings. The indictment stated that Gröning economically advanced Nazi Germany and aided the systematic killing of 300,000 of the 425,000 Hungarian Jews who were deported to Auschwitz by 137 railway transports during the summer of 1944. Gröning's prosecution has been reported {{to be a part of}} Germany’s final effort to bring the last Nazi war-crimes suspects to justice. State prosecutors managed to charge the defendant on a legal precedent set in 2011 by the conviction of the former Sobibor <b>extermination</b> <b>camp</b> guard John Demjanjuk by a court in Munich.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1955, Steiger {{played an}} obnoxious film tycoon, {{loosely based on}} Columbia boss Harry Cohn, {{opposite}} Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich's film noir The Big Knife. Steiger bleached his hair for the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff, read {{a book about the}} Treblinka <b>extermination</b> <b>camp</b> to understand his character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills, California, to try to understand his character's contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, feeling {{that he was trying to}} steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.|$|E
50|$|In 1942, the Nazis began Operation Reinhard, the {{systematic}} deportation to <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> during the Holocaust. The authorities deported Jews from everywhere in Europe to the ghettos of the East, or {{directly to the}} <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> designed and operated in Poland by Nazi Germans. There were no Polish guards {{at any of the}} camps, despite the sometimes used misnomer Polish death camps.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} half of 1942 <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> for Polish and European Jews were established, {{especially}} in East Poland, under Operation Reinhard, that were able to draw on the experience gained under Action T4. About a third of the employees at the Sonnenstein Death Institute were deployed during 1942 and 1943 to the <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> of Bełżec, Sobibor and Treblinka.|$|R

5|$|As {{part of the}} Holocaust during World War II, German Nazis used gas vans at Chelmno <b>extermination</b> <b>camp</b> and {{elsewhere}} to kill an estimated over 700,000 prisoners by carbon monoxide poisoning. This method was also used in the gas chambers of several death camps such as Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec. Gassing with carbon monoxide started in action T4, the euthanasia programme developed by the Nazis in Germany to murder the mentally ill and disabled people before the war started in earnest. The gas was supplied by IG Farben in pressurized cylinders and fed by tubes into the gas chambers built at various mental hospitals, such as Hartheim Euthanasia Centre. Many key personnel were recruited from the T4 programme to murder much larger numbers {{of people in the}} gas vans and the special gas chambers used in the death camps such as Treblinka. Exhaust fumes from tank engines for example, were used to supply the gas to the chambers.|$|E
5|$|Franz Stangl was a {{supervisor}} at the Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, part of Action T4, an early Nazi euthanasia programme that {{was responsible for}} the deaths of over 70,000 mentally ill or physically deformed people in Germany. In February 1942, he was commander at the Sobibor <b>extermination</b> <b>camp</b> and in August of the same year he was transferred to Treblinka. During his time at these camps, he oversaw the deaths of nearly 900,000 people. While in U.S. detention for two years, he remained unidentified as a war criminal because so few witnesses had survived Sobibor and Treblinka that authorities never realised who he was. He escaped while on a roadwork detail in Linz in May 1948. After he made his way to Rome, the Caritas relief agency provided him with a Red Cross passport and a boat ticket to Syria. His family joined him there a year later and they emigrated to Brazil in 1951.|$|E
5|$|The killing {{process at}} Treblinka {{differed}} {{significantly from the}} method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, Chełmno, and Bełżec, the victims died from suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his <b>extermination</b> <b>camp.</b> The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when {{the doors of the}} gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the dead were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the Sonderkommandos later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.|$|E
50|$|Holocaust deniers often {{start by}} {{pointing}} out legitimate public misconceptions about the <b>extermination</b> <b>camps.</b> For example, widely published images in America were mostly of typhoid victims and Soviet POWs at the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps - {{the first to be}} liberated by American troops and the most available imagery in America. In early news reports and for years afterwards these images were often used by the news media somewhat inaccurately in conjunction with descriptions of <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> and Jewish suffering. Holocaust deniers, after pointing out such common errors, put it forward as evidence that <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> did not exist and the limited evidence about them is mostly a hoax arising out of a deliberate Jewish conspiracy.|$|R

5|$|When Odilo Globocnik made a {{surprise}} visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth's adjutant from Bełżec, Josef Oberhauser, Eberl was dismissed on the spot. Among {{the reasons for}} dismissal were: incompetently disposing of {{the tens of thousands}} of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of killing, and not properly concealing the mass killing. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler's Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped up the pace of the programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had previously been the commandant of the Sobibór <b>extermination</b> <b>camp,</b> to assume command of the camp as Eberl's successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project's objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.|$|E

50|$|By 1940, the CCI {{came under}} the control of the Verwaltung und Wirtschaftshauptamt Hauptamt (VuWHA; Administration and Business office) which was set up under Oswald Pohl. Then in 1942, the CCI became Amt D (Office D) of the {{consolidated}} main office known as the SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt (SS Economic and Administrative Department; WVHA) under Pohl. In 1942, the SS built a network of <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> to systematically kill millions of prisoners by gassing. The <b>extermination</b> <b>camps</b> (Vernichtungslager) and death camps (Todeslager) were camps whose primary function was genocide. The Nazis themselves distinguished the concentration <b>camps</b> from the <b>extermination</b> <b>camps.</b> The British intelligence service had information about the concentration camps, and in 1942 Jan Karski delivered a thorough eyewitness account to the government.|$|R
