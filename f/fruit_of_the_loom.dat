Before the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220), plain weave and figure-weave fabrics were produced on similar <b>looms.</b> But after <b>the</b> Han Dynasty, <b>the</b> two kinds <b>of</b> <b>looms</b> evolved into all kinds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> treadle <b>loom,</b> <b>the</b> multi-heald and multi-treadle <b>loom</b> and <b>the</b> draw <b>loom...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{black and}} white cotton warp threads first need to be wound onto <b>the</b> <b>loom.</b> This is done in 64m lengths, and the threads are wound onto <b>the</b> back beam <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loom.</b> <b>The</b> warp has 60 threads per inch and is {{approximately}} 20 inches wide, each thread needs to be threaded through a heddle in <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loom,</b> and then through the reed at <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loom.</b> This threading process is done by hand using a threading hook. Once the machine is threaded up, the warp threads are secured at <b>the</b> front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loom</b> onto <b>the</b> front beam. <b>The</b> <b>loom</b> then needs to be calibrated to advance the warp threads at the correct speed to weave 84 threads per inch.|$|R

50|$|Nomads usually use a {{horizontal}} loom.

In Persia, loom beams were mostly made of poplar, because poplar is the only tree which is easily available and straight.
