The sustainability of the approach is difficult to establish, but further complications are introduced if firms use their <b>geographical</b> <b>flexibility</b> to create labour insecurity in all countries in which they operate, in the stereotypical “race to the bottom” in labour standards. From a European perspective there are differences between <b>geographical</b> <b>flexibility</b> that extends {{to other parts of the}} world, and that contained within the basic rules of EU social and labour policy. This has of course become particularly important since the entry of the new member states in central and eastern Europe. This has led, not merely to competition between Europe and the rest of the world, but – at least as importantly – competition within Europe between different member states, different regions, and, by implication, different social models.|$|E

40|$|Flexibility {{has become}} a buzzword in organizations. However, {{flexibility}} is an overarching term that incorporates {{a number of different}} types of strategy. Flexible working time and place arrangements, which are the subject of this chapter, are only one strand along with functional, contractual, numerical, financial, and <b>geographical</b> <b>flexibility.</b> This chapter focuses on flexible working arrangements (FWAs), that is organizational policies and practices that enable employees to vary, at least to some extent, when and/or where they work or to otherwise diverge from traditional working hours. They include, for example, flexitime, term time working, part-time or reduced hours, job sharing, career breaks, family-related and other leaves, compressed workweeks and teleworking. These working arrangements are also often referred to as family-friendly, work–family, or more recently work–life policies. This implies an employee focus, but {{the extent to which these}} policies primarily benefit employees or employers, especially in the 24 / 7 economy (Presser, 1998), or contribute to mutually beneficial solutions, has been the subject of much debate (e. g., Barnett & Hall, 2001; Hill, Hawkins...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{have been}} {{witnessing}} {{significant changes in}} the television ecosystem, particularly in terms of the any time any where concept, where an array of technological advances allow viewers to watch their programs without constraints from the TV programing guides, the viewing location and the type of viewing equipment. This temporal and <b>geographical</b> <b>flexibility</b> creates conditions for a profound change in the viewing habits, confronting the advertising market with new challenges that are reflected in the way viewers are exposed to advertising, how they can skip the advertising, and how they integrate the complementary devices in the viewing practices where TV ads spreads. In this sense, this paper theorizes about the paradoxical relationship that technology delivers by allowing confronting the new ecosystem that emerges from it, with the potential it has to open new business models related to the TV advertising market. So, after an analysis of the emergent television consumption dynamics, the paper focuses on the potential of interactivity for television advertising, featuring a taxonomy of rising interactive advertising models centred on TV or complemented with companion devices. It concludes with a discussion on the challenges to the advertising market derived from the transformations being witnessed in the TV ecosystem...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to uncover the hidden gender {{consequences}} of three current trends in the workplace, the increase in knowledge work, information and communication technology (ICT) and work-life balance policies. Design/methodology/approach - The paper synthesizes and analyses existing empirical evidence from research on knowledge work, work-life balance and boundary, women's work and careers. Findings - Knowledge work, ICT and work-life balance policies are found to increase the temporal and <b>geographical</b> <b>flexibility</b> of work. Such enhanced flexibility should facilitate women's participation and advancement in work and therefore gender equality. However, all three trends also have hidden gender consequences that significantly prevent women from participating and advancing. Research limitations/implications - Research needs to explicitly integrate evidence from across research areas and disciplines to appreciate the complexity and contentiousness of current workplace developments from a gender perspective. Practical implications - A public debate is needed that better communicates and challenges the complexity of gender issues in the twenty-first century workplace, in order to raise critical awareness amongst individual workers, as well as practitioners and policy makers, and to lead to better informed decision making. Originality/value - A gender-focused analysis and synthesis of evidence across the research areas included in this paper is currently lacking. The paper thus makes a novel contribution to the academic debate on gender equality in the workplace and provides an improved basis for better informed discussions between academics, policy makers and practitioners about how to achieve gender equality in today's world of work...|$|E
40|$|The pious sex. Catholic {{constructions of}} masculinity and {{femininity}} in B elgium (c. 1800 - 1940) This study has a double goal. On {{the one hand}} it wants to improve the kn owledge of Catholic constructions of masculinity and femininity in Belgi um. On the other hand, by studying these gender constructions, it wants reconsider the feminisation thesis. This thesis has developed in histo rical research into a container term that covers various contents. It po ints not only at a numeric preponderance {{of women in the}} religious field, but also at content changes and at a quasi-identification of feminini ty and religiosity. The nineteenth-century feminisation of Christia nity has been studied and documented in various European countries and d enominations, but in the research on Belgian Catholicism it has not yet been a major theme. Still, Belgian society offers an interesting case as the Catholic realm covered a wide range of activities. As such, women a nd men could confirm their Catholic identity in both public and more pri vate fields. This study therefore focuses on the Belgian case, and more specific on the way in which gender differentiation was created and expr essed. Focus is put on the Catholic adult laity and his or her (ideal) i mage in the Sacred Heart devotion, Catholic Action and sermons. These pe rspectives offer the opportunity to point at the diversity and the flexi bility of these gender constructions. The construction of the Catholic m an in the discourse of the Apostolat de la Prière (a devotional movement dedicated to the Sacred Heart) for instance illustrates how masculinit y and emotionality were not necessarily considered mutually exclusive. This nineteenth-century emotionally expressive masculinity therefore m akes it hard to define the nineteenth-century Sacred Heart devotion as  feminised on the ground of her emotionality and sentimentality, as has been suggested in other studies. Terms such as feminisation and th e parallel masculinisation not only come close to an essentialist visi on, they also seem to point at a kind of permanent construction of masc ulinity and femininity whereas in current gender research stress is p ut on the historical, social and <b>geographical</b> <b>flexibility</b> of gender cons tructions. Furthermore the stereotype of the pious sex appears to be o lder than the nineteenth century and it was not always used in a positiv e way in Catholic sources of the nineteenth- and twentieth century. The Catholic clergy noted the preponderance of women in religious practices also in the seventeenth century. The clergys observation of mens small er interest in the religious field crystallised into a narrative of loss {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century; it incited men-oriented initiativ es and (re) definitions of religion as masculine. Similar initiatives h ave been described in other research as masculinisation, but as indica ted this term is confusing. In order to be able to grasp in historical r esearch this special attention for mens involvement, this study suggest s stepping away from the somewhat confining terms feminisation and masculinisation and put the emphasis on differentiation instead, the crea tion of the difference. This offers the opportunity to describe the incr easing attention for gender difference as can be remarked in the evoluti on of the mixed Apostolat de la Prière movement into the gender-exclusiv e Leagues of the Sacred Heart. Moreover, men do not necessarily have t o oppose women: Catholic men can be compared to other men, e. g. soc ialist men. By shifting the attention towards differentiation, other ca tegories such as class can receive ample attention and e. g. the evolutio n of the  originally workers-oriented  Leagues of the Sacred Heart can be better defined. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{the face}} of major {{sustainability}} challenges posed by social exclusion and ecologic degradation there is a pressing need to change mobility practices {{as well as the}} physical structures that condition mobility. The overarching aim {{of this study is to}} expand knowledge about everyday accessibility strategies beyond private automobility, to inform social as well as ecological sustainability in community and transport planning. A time-geographical approach to accessibility is used to view everyday life as a context of interwoven activities that serve to fulfill a multitude of projects. Departing from the time-geographical notion of maneuvre space as the ability to acquire opportunities within one’s geographical reach, accessibility is defined as overcoming time-space constraints through a variation of strategies. Apart from mobility, geographical proximity and other strategies that reduce the need to be mobile is considered as well as the resources this require. The study focuses empirically on families with small children as a group with a large share of time-bound activities and specific accessibility needs to make ends meet. It is based on eight semi-structured, in-depth interviews with voluntarily carless parents residing in semi-central parts of Gothenburg. The accessibility strategies applied by the families are generally aimed at enabling flexibility and coordination of activities so that the opportunities available within their geographic reach can be acquired. Most of the families in the study apply a combination of modes that include car travel at occasions outside their daily routines. The bicycle is an important mode of transport to organize fixed daily activities as it allows flexibility. Public transportation is used for short leisure trips and mainly when several family members are involved, such as day trips or attending to regular, fixed leisure activities. However, it has constraining effects through its reach and time tables. When the families need to get outside the tempo-spatial reach of public transport and overcome the capacity constraints set by the bicycle and their own bodies, most of them apply car based mobility. Car based mobility is also applied when the families need to conform to the highly mobile society. Geographic proximity appear as a fundamental aspect and fundamental priority in the daily life of the respondents, enabling voluntarily carless life. The strategies based on ICT and social relations as resources function in different ways to create further space for temporal and spatial flexibility through coordination, planning and relief of mobility needs. The conclusions of the study are that 1) strategies that favor <b>geographical</b> proximity, <b>flexibility</b> and coordination of activities reduces the need for high speed mobility, 2) Voluntarily carless life demands resources and may be temporary due to transitions over the life course, and 3) perceived constraints from carlessness to a large extent arise from norms and expectations associated with automobility. The study shows that it is indeed possible to live a carless life without unacceptable constraints to opportunities in daily life. However, such relatively non-constraining carlessness is evidently contingent on personal conditions and access to resources...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates {{how young}} adults in {{vocational}} education perceive risk {{in regard to}} their professional futures in East Germany and the United States. It analyzes students’ career aspirations and life plans in both countries and how they cope with uncertainties at the labor market. It further outlines underlying values, beliefs, and attitudes that guide young Americans and East Germans in their planning. Several theoretical frameworks ground this study and comprise {{the majority of the}} relevant literature. This cross-cultural comparative case study takes a mixed method approach using a concurrent triangulation design. The inquiry is framed by theories in the field of risk and cultural risk perception, school-to-work transition, vocational education and training, and welfare studies. In both countries, 129 students filled out a questionnaire. Additionally, narratives from nine focus groups and 29 biographical interviews were conducted. A three level analysis of the data was compiled that outlines the themes and categorizes them according to an individual, institutional, and macro-structural level of influence on risk perception in each country. Emerging premises on an individual level were choice, family and career planning concerns, <b>geographical</b> and occupational <b>flexibility,</b> further education and training, and agency. On the institutional level the influence of public career advisement institutions, teachers, parents, peers and friends was outlined. On the macro-structural level unemployment, political welfare reforms, the vocational education and training system were themes that have been of concern among the East German population. The dissertation also offers a comparative analysis of the data. This study reveals that young adults in East Germany are highly concerned about their occupational futures and tend to be pessimistic about current welfare reforms. They hold on {{to the idea of a}} standard biography and try to make strategic career plans. Their counterparts in the United States are highly optimistic about their futures, expressed little concern about labor market policies, but also appeared to be short term oriented in their life planning in order to remain flexible and mobile...|$|R
40|$|Information {{revolution}} {{provides us}} with unforeseen opportunities for improving the productivity of services via the optimized planning of production, distribution and delivery. Now companies and clients alike can track and trace mobile resources not only inside their own factories and warehouses but also in all other service facilities and in transit between. Tracking in real time covers all products, vehicles, people and equipment. With ever shortening response times and planning periods, however, the concerns of rescheduling, rerouting, splitting and joining of production batches, product deliveries and value-added service activities will be overwhelming, especially, if realistically counting for the ramifications in time and cost of capacity each activity consumes, including all transfers and set-ups required. To be effective, this kind of time capacitated resource allocation planning also presupposes two properties from production and service resources: mobility and flexibility. In this dissertation, we provide new views and computational methods for the real time planning of production, distribution and service delivery. The new approaches improve capacity utilization simultaneously with more flexible customer service vital for competing in the environment with increasing outsourcing and networking. Efficient capacity utilization, mobility and flexibility are achieved by the simultaneous planning of all required activities and resources by mathematical optimization applied to reliable time-based data. Our approach to capacitated timing balances resource time used for actual production and for capacity consuming set-ups between different production batches or service activities. The explicit consideration of the capacity time consumed by all activities is critical for the realistic planning of high capacity utilization. Mobility of resources in production concerns availability in different time periods, involving costs of setting up and moving back resources through inventory build-up, work-in-process buffers and reserve machines. In service networks, mobility of resources means availability in different locations achieved by moving products, vehicles, containers and service resources, such as cleaning crews or maintenance people, and equipment, among clients, sites and <b>geographical</b> locations. <b>Flexibility</b> of resources is included by allowing production batches or service tasks to be split, joined, rescheduled and reallocated to be performed by any efficient combination {{of one or more}} different service resources, such as machines or crews. This dissertation consists of two articles and two essays considering mobile and flexible resource allocation in time-capacitated settings. The first article deals with production planning involving shared resources and the explicit time requirements of the set-ups. The introduction of set-up carry-overs is shown to generate substantial savings in the three key factors of production costs: the number of set-ups, utilization of production capacity and level of inventory. In the second article, vehicle routing problems are solved by minimizing the sum of the traveling cost and the total cost of vehicles actually employed when transportation technology offers scale economies. New methods are introduced for efficiently solving very large problems featuring heterogenous vehicles and time windows of deliveries to as many as 1000 customers, ten times more than in earlier studies. The two essays combine the allocation of shared resources, split tasks and variable set-ups in mobile service operations. The first essay presents a flexible service resource allocation model with a new kind of time-based splitting of work in tasks among available resources. The potential for capacity time savings achievable via this kind of modeling approach is also demonstrated by examples. In the second essay, two different time capacitated resource allocation models for service applications, one with and the other without task splitting, are tested and compared. The tests with a set of synthetic problems indicate up to 33 % savings in the number of identical resources needed when the average length of tasks to split is just over half of resource capacity and the distance between task sites is short. The results imply high capacity savings potential for practical service applications by task splitting. Despite the growing economic importance of time dependent service allocations with mobile and flexible resources, these problems have eluded the traditional modelers due to the technical and conceptual complexities involved. The new modeling and solution approaches suggested here provide some eye opening insights to the general theory while the planning methods with clearly documented results are ready for managerial applications and further development...|$|R
