5000|$|Example 3. [...] In Fig. 3a and Fig. 3c two {{determinate}} oscillations {{are presented}} and in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3b</b> and Fig. 3d are shown according their averages. It {{is clear from}} <b>Fig.</b> <b>3b</b> and Fig. 3d that in both cases, the average {{does not have a}} limit, i.e., both processes are statistically unstable.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{the toaster}} models drawn in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3(b)</b> are not SP-DEVS because the total state {{associated}} with [...] "idle" [...] (I), is passive but it moves to an active state, [...] "toast" [...] (T) whose toating time is 20 seconds or 40 seconds. Actually, the model shown in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3(b)</b> is FD-DEVS.|$|E
50|$|In {{plant tissue}} this virus makes {{characteristic}} viral inclusion bodies {{which can be}} diagnostic. They are hexagonal in shape (Fig.1) and stain both in a protein stain and a nucleic acid stain. The inclusions can also be rhomboidal (Fig. 2b), may appear hollow (Fig. 1) and can form larger aggregates (<b>Fig.</b> <b>3b).</b> The inclusions are not uniformly distributed {{and can be found}} in epidermal (Figs. 1 and 2b), mesophyll (<b>Fig.</b> <b>3b),</b> and stomatal cells (Fig. 4b). These inclusions are made up of virus particles.|$|E

50|$|As Fig. 3a documents, the US {{economy has}} {{exhausted}} (from employment viewpoint) all three productive sectors and has {{reached for the}} 17% in GWU. In <b>Fig.</b> <b>3b</b> we separate the last workforce bar from Fig. 3a, {{in order to see}} the impact of productivity growth today.|$|E
50|$|Single-chip packaging, {{as shown}} in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3(b),</b> is {{implemented}} after wafer dicing, using pre-fabricated ceramic or organic packages, such as LCP injection molded packages or LTCC packages. Pre-fabricated packages require hermetic cavity sealing through clogging, shedding, soldering or welding. Figures of merit for single-chip packaging techniques are chip size, hermeticity, and processing temperature.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fig</b> <b>3(b)</b> {{shows the}} cross {{sectional}} {{view of the}} axial sensor where the temperature difference is established between {{the top and bottom}} surfaces. Thermocouples are embedded into a matrix and aligned parallel with respect to the heat flow, forming junctions at top and bottom. This arrangement permits a reduction of the total sensor thickness to 0.5 mm (Fig 4).|$|E
50|$|Mathieu wavelets can {{be derived}} from the lowpass {{reconstruction}} filter by the cascade algorithm. Infinite Impulse Response filters (IIR filter) should be use since Mathieu wavelet has no compact support. Figure 3 shows emerging pattern that progressively looks like the wavelet's shape. Depending on the parameters a and q some waveforms (e.g. <b>fig.</b> <b>3b)</b> can present a somewhat unusual shape.|$|E
50|$|All four sectors {{are subject}} to {{accelerated}} productivity growth rates in the near future. The only expanding space of the workforce is the grey region “?” in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3b,</b> essentially reflecting the decline in workforce participation rate. This grey area is also {{the space of the}} new transformation: that’s where those who left unemployment registers are starting new ventures and enterprises, and participating in regional economies.|$|E
50|$|As {{shown in}} Fig. 3a and 3b, the {{observer}} {{has a direct}} view of mirror M1 seen through the beam splitter, and sees a reflected image M'2 of mirror M2. The fringes {{can be interpreted as}} the result of interference between light coming from the two virtual images S'1 and S'2 of the original source S. The characteristics of the interference pattern depend {{on the nature of the}} light source and the precise orientation of the mirrors and beam splitter. In Fig. 3a, the optical elements are oriented so that S'1 and S'2 are in line with the observer, and the resulting interference pattern consists of circles centered on the normal to M1 and M'2 (fringes of equal inclination). If, as in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3b,</b> M1 and M'2 are tilted with respect to each other, the interference fringes will generally take the shape of conic sections (hyperbolas), but if M1 and M'2 overlap, the fringes near the axis will be straight, parallel, and equally spaced (fringes of equal thickness). If S is an extended source rather than a point source as illustrated, the fringes of Fig. 3a must be observed with a telescope set at infinity, while the fringes of <b>Fig.</b> <b>3b</b> will be localized on the mirrors.|$|E
50|$|In a few femtoseconds {{it takes}} the wave packet to cross the {{potential}} well, the laser intensity is still modest and the 3-photon gap is small allowing the wave packet to cross it diabatically. At large internuclear separations, the gentle slope of the potential well slowly turns the wave packet back, so when the packet returns to the 3-photon gap, the laser intensity is significantly higher and the gap is wide open trapping the wave packet in a bond-hardened state, which lasts throughout the highest intensities (<b>Fig.</b> <b>3b).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{extent of}} the fringes depends on the {{coherence}} length of the source. In <b>Fig.</b> <b>3b,</b> the yellow sodium light used for the fringe illustration consists {{of a pair of}} closely spaced lines, D1 and D2, implying that the interference pattern will blur after several hundred fringes. Single longitudinal mode lasers are highly coherent and can produce high contrast interference with differential pathlengths of millions or even billions of wavelengths. On the other hand, using white (broadband) light, the central fringe is sharp, but away from the central fringe the fringes are colored and rapidly become indistinct to the eye.|$|E
5000|$|Weak links {{play a very}} {{important}} role in modern superconductivity. In most cases weak links are oxide barriers between two superconducting thin films, {{but it can also be}} a crystal boundary (in the case of high-Tc superconductors). A schematic representation is given in Fig. 4. Now consider the ring which is thick everywhere except for a small section where the ring is closed via a weak link (<b>Fig.</b> <b>3b).</b> The velocity is zero except near the weak link. In these regions the velocity contribution to the total phase change in the loop is given by (with Eq.(15)) ...|$|E
50|$|Next, the {{introduction}} of N-acetylglucoseamine (GlcNAc) to the aldehyde tagged proteins via oxime formation was carried out through the treatment with aminooxy GlcNAc (AO-GlcNAc) (<b>Fig.</b> <b>3B).</b> The conjugation was confirmed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) and lectin blot with the GlcNAc-binding wheat germ agglutinin attached to AlexaFluor 647. Having successfully introduced GlcNAc, the monomer was extended with a glycan structure containing GlcNAc, mannose (Man) and galactose (Gal) (Fig. 3C). A mutant endoglycosidase EndoS (EndoS-D233Q) was utilised as it is highly speciﬁc for IgG Fc N-linked GlcNAc residues and does not elongate Asn-GlcNAc sites on other proteins or on denatured IgGs. Product formation was again monitored by LC-ESI-MS and lectin blot probing with the sialic acid-binding sambucus nigra agglutinin attached to ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate.|$|E
50|$|A Michelson {{interferometer}} consists minimally {{of mirrors}} M1 & M2 and {{a beam splitter}} M.In Fig 2, a source S emits light that hits the beam splitter (in this case, a plate beamsplitter) surface M at point C. M is partially reflective, so part of the light is transmitted through to point B while some {{is reflected in the}} direction of A. Both beams recombine at point C' to produce an interference pattern incident on the detector at point E (or on the retina of a person's eye). If there is a slight angle between the two returning beams, for instance, then an imaging detector will record a sinusoidal fringe pattern as shown in <b>Fig.</b> <b>3b.</b> If there is perfect spatial alignment between the returning beams, then there will not be any such pattern but rather a constant intensity over the beam dependent on the differential pathlength; this is difficult, requiring very precise control of the beam paths.|$|E
50|$|Several {{capsaicin}} analogs of the urea type {{were developed}} by acylation of homovanillylamine and related amines with different 4-(α-pyridyl)piperidine-1-acyl chlorides. The presence of a polar amino moiety in the hydrophobic C region of capsacinoids was crucial to couple potency and hydrophilicity, mimicking similar observations {{that led to the}} discovery of phenylacetylrinvanil (<b>fig.</b> <b>3b)</b> from olvanil(fig. 3a). Phenylacetylrinvanil is the most potent capsaicinoid reported to date, ~500-fold more potent than capsaicin. Several other ureas emerged as remarkably active TRPV1 antagonists. Compared with capsazepine, the piperazinyl urea (fig. 5a and 5b) showed a higher selectivity profile against a wide variety of enzymes and channels whereas the related very potent and specific TRPV1 antagonist A-425619 (fig. 5c) could reduce pain associated with inflammation and tissue injury in rats. Further research has led to a variety of small-molecule antagonists of TRPV1, including the ureas SB-705498 (fig. 5d), SB-452533 (fig. 5e)16,17 and ABT-102(fig. 5f), compounds that have entered clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} catalysed, for instance, by Cre-recombinase {{may lead}} to excision of the DNA segment flanked by the two sites (Fig. 3A), but may also lead to integration or inversion of {{the orientation of the}} flanked DNA segment (<b>Fig.</b> <b>3B).</b> What the outcome of the reaction will be is dictated mainly by the relative location and the orientation of sites that are to be recombined, but also by the innate specificity of the site-specific system in question. Excisions and inversions occur if the recombination takes place between two sites that are found on the same molecule (intramolecular recombination), and if the sites are in the same (direct repeat) or in an opposite orientation (inverted repeat), respectively. Insertions, on the other hand, take place if the recombination occurs on sites that are situated on two different DNA molecules (intermolecular recombination), provided {{that at least one of}} these molecules is circular. Most site-specific systems are highly specialised, catalysing only one of these different types of reaction, and have evolved to ignore the sites that are in the ‘wrong’ orientation.|$|E
5000|$|When [...] {{decreases}} {{at higher}} fields due to field-quenching cause by Poole-Frenkel excitation of holes from Coulomb attractive hole traps, that consequently enhances electron recombination through recombination centers, and thereby deforms the [...] curve at higher fields {{as shown in}} Fig. 2(B). When the bias is increased the current curve [...] is shifted upwards and to the right, and when it crosses [...] again, it produces a second singular point II. With further increased bias this singular point II reaches {{the value of the}} boundary density , and the solution curve changes from a monotonic increasing Schottky-solution, to a high-field domain, curve (b): that remains constant near the cathode, and then changes within a few Debye lengths to approach the constant value in the bulk, near the singular point I. The width of the domain increases with bias (Fig. 3a), while the current remains constant (Fig. 3c). The domain is visible as dark part in the transmission picture through the [...] platelett, extending from the cathode as shown in Fig. 3a. The field in the domain can be obtained from the slope of the domain that increases with bias (<b>Fig.</b> <b>3b).</b>|$|E
