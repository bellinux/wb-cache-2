2500|$|One-dollar {{bills were}} again {{the subject of}} {{experimentation}} in May 1992, when the BEP began to test a web-fed Intaglio printing press. Because of a need for greater quantities of $1 FRN's, the BEP sent out a REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) (year 1985) NO. BEP-85-73 to procure a web-fed intaglio printing press to dramatically increase the production of currency notes {{within the confines of}} their current (1985) 14th & C street facility. Instead of printing one side of a square sheet of 32 notes at a time, the web-fed press used 96 engraved images or plate-cylinder to print the back of the note, then another 96 image engraved plate-cylinder to print the front of the note. Both sides of notes were printed from a continuous roll of paper. The Alexander-Hamilton intaglio Web press printed both sides of intaglio at the same time. The web-press was actually designed as a full-blown production press as opposed to an experimental press. The notes were issued in Series 1988A, 1993, and 1995. Because of mechanical problems, operator error, as well as the sometimes poor quality of the notes, production was ended in July 1996.

40|$|The work {{covers the}} {{prospecting}} {{holes in the}} conditions of the Northern Caucasus and also the vibratory systems of aerohydrodynamic and mechanical action. The aim is to analyse the driling technology indices and to substantiatedthe application fields of the <b>face</b> <b>check</b> and control aids; to investigate theoretically and experimentally the vibratory systems in the drilling tool - hole system for constructing transducers and automatic control systems of face parameters. The verivied analytical relation of the mechanical vibratory system balance x spiral with changing spiral length has been obtained. The characteristics of the different mechanical and aerodynamic frequency transducers of face parameters have been found. The conditions at which the automatic control system of the drilling fluid pressures in face keeps the stability have been determined, and the control quality parameters have been found. The automatic control system of drilling fluid pressure in face and also the automatic control system of space hole shaft position have been developed. The physical-technical effects according to the author's certificate have been entered into the data bank of the system INTELLEKT-A. The tests of 20 mock-ups of the different type face transducers protected by author's certificates have been performed.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 <b>Face</b> <b>checking</b> in {{decorative}} maple veneered plywood panels is {{a significant}} problem for hardwood plywood manufacturers, furniture makers, cabinetmakers, and consumers. Efforts made by panel producers and researchers to minimize checking conducted to-­‐date have been limited, and produced contradictory results. In this study the impact of four manufacturing factors believed to contribute to check development in decorative maple veneer panels were determined. The factors investigated were face veneer thickness and preparation, lathe-­‐check orientation, adhesive and core type. An efficient, automated, optical technique based on digital image correlation principles was developed and used to detect and measure checks as they develop. The novel new method for characterizing check severity and development was effective in efficiently measuring checking for {{a substantial number of}} samples. The results of the factor screening analysis reveal intricate four way interactions between factor levels contribute to check development, and that some combinations are likely to exhibit much more checking than others...|$|R
