It said many people had claimed free prescriptions without any problems since they were first diagnosed without having a certificate, until the NHSBSA's new, more efficient checking systems uncovered the problem.

While YF vaccination (YFV) is not generally recommended for travellers to Tanzania, proof of YFV may be required upon arrival.

The traveller's consultant has to balance the risk of YFV {{and the risk of}} encountering problems when entering a country without a valid YFV, especially because countries are slowly implementing the requirements.; We performed a survey among 421 travellers to Tanzania with a pre-travel consultation at the Travel Clinic of the University of Zurich about their experiences with YFV certificate inspections upon arrival in Tanzania between January and November 2015.; There were three main findings: (i) most vaccine card checks were done while crossing the land border of Tanzania. Inspections were frequently conducted at Arusha airport, less often in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. In the latter a significantly larger percentage of individuals arriving by ferry/boat were checked than those arriving by plane. (ii) Checks appeared to be non-systematic. They were also performed in travellers who did not enter Tanzania from a YF-endemic country. No seasonal or daytime pattern could be identified; the thoroughness of checks varied widely. (iii) In the case of travel without valid YFV, an <b>exemption</b> <b>certificate</b> was always accepted. In travellers with neither a valid YFV nor an <b>exemption</b> <b>certificate,</b> travellers reported forced YF vaccination and fines before entry was granted.; We recommend YFV or a YF <b>exemption</b> <b>certificate</b> for all travellers to Tanzania until further notice.
