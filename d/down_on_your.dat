500|$|Lynott's second solo album, The Philip Lynott Album, {{was delayed}} until 1982 while Renegade was {{completed}} and released in November 1981. Renegade was not successful, only reaching no. 38 in the UK and no. 157 in the US. A single, [...] "Hollywood (<b>Down</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Luck)", also flopped, {{although it did}} reach no. 24 on the US Mainstream Rock chart. Despite only two songs from the album being written solely by Lynott, {{and other members of}} the band contributing more to the compositions, both Gorham and Wharton have since stated their dissatisfaction with some of the songs, such as [...] "Angel of Death", [...] "Fats" [...] and [...] "Mexican Blood". Wharton was omitted from the band photos on the back of the record sleeve, despite the fact that he was by this time a permanent member of the band. [...] "It hurt me a great deal", he later said.|$|E

500|$|Away {{from his}} expeditions, Shackleton's life was {{generally}} restless and unfulfilled. In {{his search for}} rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press, but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was [...] "rediscovered", and rapidly became {{a role model for}} leadership as one who, in extreme circumstances, kept his team together in a survival story described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as [...] "incredible". In his 1956 address to the British [...] Association, Sir Raymond Priestley, one of his contemporaries, said [...] "Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> knees and pray for Shackleton", paraphrasing what Apsley Cherry-Garrard had written in a preface to The Worst Journey in the World.|$|E
500|$|In May 1975, Roddenberry {{entered a}} {{development}} deal with Paramount, with principal photography intended {{to start on}} July 15, 1976, and a budget of $5 million. He started work on treatments; his first involved {{the formation of the}} Enterprise crew, including their training at Starfleet Academy and the formation of Starfleet, but this idea was never submitted to Paramount. His first major submitted script was The God Thing. A scene involving a discussion in which Spock's tutors describe religion on Earth worried the studio. The tutor says, [...] "We have never really understood your Earth legend of gods. Particularly in that so many of your gods have said, 'You have to bow <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> bellies every seven days and worship me'. This seems to us like they are very insecure gods." [...] Roddenberry completed the script on 30 June; Paramount rejected it the following month. The studio was also unhappy with, and rejected, scripts by Robert Silverberg, Chris Knopt, Dick Simmons and Theodore Sturgeon. Roddenberry blamed religious Paramount executives including Barry Diller for turning down The God Thing, a story that writer Jon Povill summarized as [...] "God was a malfunctioning spaceship".|$|E

2500|$|The band's manager {{suggested}} they {{write a song}} with Green {{early on in the}} writing process. Gaskarth ended up writing [...] "Do You Want Me (Dead?)", [...] "Guts", [...] "Under a Paper Moon", [...] "A Daydream Away" [...] and [...] "Get <b>Down</b> <b>on</b> <b>Your</b> Knees and Tell Me You Love Me" [...] with Green within three days. Barakat said the pair had [...] "an amazing chemistry together. He added this sweet dynamic to the band we never had before. He made us think in ways we never would have thought before."

Kahne produced [...] "That Girl", {{to which}} Green provided additional production and was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge. U4L produced [...] "Merry Christmas, Kiss My Ass", which was mixed by Green. Asked about {{the choice of}} using several producers, Barakat said [...] "We're all about using multiple producers on our records. ... I'm not 100% into the one producer/one record thing because {{you get a lot}} of the same sounding songs. It's cool to have a bunch of variety." [...] Gaskarth added [...] "working with a lot of different producers is good, because it pulls you in all kinds of new directions." [...] He added that, similar to Nothing Personal, they [...] "kinda split up the [...] with different producers that we wanted to work with in the past, but for scheduling or monetary reasons, we couldn’t lock them in for the whole record." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2nd century CE, the Christian theologian Marcion {{composed}} a work (now lost) entitled Antithesis. In the Antithesis, Marcion {{set out in}} detail and discussed at length the contradictions between the Old Testament and New Testament. The Old and New Testaments, Marcion argued, cannot be reconciled to each other. The code of conduct advocated by Moses was [...] "an eye for an eye", but [...] Marcion pointed to Isaiah 45:7 [...] "I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all these things. He contrasted this with Jesus' saying that [...] "a tree was known by its fruit, a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit" [...] and then pointed to several injunctions and lessons in the Old Testament that the New Testament contradicts. For example, Elisha had children eaten by bears; Jesus said, [...] "Let the little children come to me". Joshua had the sun stopped in order to prolong the slaughter of his enemies. Paul quoted Jesus as commanding [...] "Let not the sun go <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>your</b> wrath"(Eph 4:26). In the Old Testament, divorce was permitted and so was polygamy; in the New Testament, neither is allowed. Moses enforced the Jewish Sabbath and Jewish Law; Jesus has de-institutionalised both. Even within the Old Testament, Marcion found contradictions. For example, [...] God commanded that no work should {{be done on the}} Sabbath, yet he told the Israelites to carry the ark around Jericho seven times on the Sabbath. No graven image was to be made, yet Moses was directed to fashion a bronze serpent. Marcion therefore rejected the entire Old Testament.|$|E
