25|$|The {{function}} is Lebesgue <b>integrable</b> if {{and only if}} its absolute value is Lebesgue <b>integrable</b> (see Absolutely <b>integrable</b> function).|$|E
25|$|The Newlander–Nirenberg theorem {{states that}} an almost complex {{structure}} J is <b>integrable</b> if {{and only if}} NJ=0. The compatible complex structure is unique, as discussed above. Since the existence of an <b>integrable</b> almost complex structure is equivalent to the existence of a complex structure, this is sometimes taken as the definition of a complex structure.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuous}} real function on {{the closed}} unit interval is Riemann <b>integrable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Conversely, all locally <b>integrable</b> {{functions}} {{satisfying the}} (volume) mean-value property are both infinitely differentiable and harmonic.|$|E

25|$|Egorov's theorem {{can be used}} {{along with}} compactly {{supported}} continuous functions to prove Lusin's theorem for <b>integrable</b> functions.|$|E
25|$|Since {{we started}} from an {{arbitrary}} partition {{and ended up}} {{as close as we}} wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number , so this function is not Riemann <b>integrable.</b> However, it is Lebesgue <b>integrable.</b> In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero almost everywhere. But this is a fact that is {{beyond the reach of the}} Riemann integral.|$|E
25|$|The Fourier {{transform}} may {{be defined}} in some cases for non-integrable functions, but the Fourier transforms of <b>integrable</b> functions have several strong properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{first is}} a {{construction}} of an <b>integrable</b> function whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere. The second is a strengthening to divergence everywhere. In French.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of an almost complex structure is a topological question and {{is relatively easy to}} answer, as discussed above. The {{existence of}} an <b>integrable</b> almost complex structure, on the other hand, is a much more difficult analytic question. For example, it is still not known whether S6 admits an <b>integrable</b> almost complex structure, despite a long history of ultimately unverified claims. Smoothness issues are important. For real-analytic J, the Newlander–Nirenberg theorem follows from the Frobenius theorem; for C∞ (and less smooth) J, analysis is required (with more difficult techniques as the regularity hypothesis weakens).|$|E
25|$|As {{described}} next, {{there are}} straightforward mappings from both locally <b>integrable</b> functions and Radon measures to corresponding distributions, {{but not all}} distributions can be formed in this manner.|$|E
25|$|Remark 3. If μ(S) < ∞, the {{condition}} {{that there is a}} dominating <b>integrable</b> function g can be relaxed to uniform integrability of the sequence {fn}, see Vitali convergence theorem.|$|E
25|$|In particular, any {{set that}} is at most {{countable}} has Lebesgue measure zero, and thus a bounded function (on a compact interval) with only finitely or countably many discontinuities is Riemann <b>integrable.</b>|$|E
25|$|All of {{the basic}} {{properties}} listed above hold for the -dimensional Fourier transform, as do Plancherel's and Parseval's theorem. When the function is <b>integrable,</b> the Fourier transform is still uniformly continuous and the Riemann–Lebesgue lemma holds.|$|E
25|$|Some {{calculus}} books {{do not use}} general tagged partitions, but limit {{themselves to}} specific types of tagged partitions. If the type of partition is limited too much, some non-integrable functions {{may appear to be}} <b>integrable.</b>|$|E
25|$|More generally, a {{function}} of several complex variables that is square <b>integrable</b> over every compact subset of its domain is analytic {{if and only if}} it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations in the sense of distributions.|$|E
25|$|Today, however, exact S-matrix {{results are}} a {{crowning}} achievement of Conformal field theory, <b>Integrable</b> systems, and several further areas of {{quantum field theory}} and string theory. S-matrices are not substitutes for a field-theoretic treatment, but rather, complements and the end results of such.|$|E
25|$|Using {{elementary}} {{properties of}} the symplectic form ω, one can show that a compatible almost complex structure J is an almost Kähler structure for the Riemannian metric ω(u, Jv). Also, if J is <b>integrable,</b> then (M, ω, J) is a Kähler manifold.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominated}} convergence theorem applies also to measurable functions with {{values in}} a Banach space, with the dominating function still being non-negative and <b>integrable</b> as above. The assumption of convergence almost everywhere can be weakened to require only convergence in measure.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{note that}} the winding number is closely related with the (2+1)-dimensional {{continuous}} Heisenberg ferromagnet equations and its <b>integrable</b> extensions: the Ishimori equation etc. Solutions of the last equations are classified by the winding number or topological charge (topological invariant and/or topological quantum number).|$|E
25|$|In formal terms, this {{representation}} is a wavelet series {{representation of a}} square-integrable function with respect to either a complete, orthonormal set of basis functions, or an overcomplete set or frame of a vector space, for the Hilbert space of square <b>integrable</b> functions. This is accomplished through coherent states.|$|E
25|$|In {{the table}} below, P(x), Q(x), P(y), Q(y), and M(x,y), N(x,y) are any <b>integrable</b> {{functions}} of x, y, and b and c are real given constants, and C1, C2,... are arbitrary constants (complex in general). The differential equations {{are in their}} equivalent and alternative forms {{that lead to the}} solution through integration.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} ways of {{formally}} defining an integral, not {{all of which are}} equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing special cases which may not be <b>integrable</b> under other definitions, but also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used definitions of integral are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals.|$|E
25|$|Loosely speaking, the Riemann {{integral}} is {{the limit}} of the Riemann sums of a function as the partitions get finer. If the limit exists then the function {{is said to be}} <b>integrable</b> (or more specifically Riemann-integrable). The Riemann sum can be made as close as desired to the Riemann integral by making the partition fine enough.|$|E
25|$|For example, when Σ is a 2-sphere, this Hilbert {{space is}} {{one-dimensional}} {{and so there}} is only one state. When Σ is a 2-torus the states correspond to the <b>integrable</b> representations of the affine Lie algebra corresponding to g at level k. Characterizations of the conformal blocks at higher genera are not necessary for Witten's solution of Chern–Simons theory.|$|E
25|$|The predual of the von Neumann algebra L∞(R) of {{essentially}} bounded functions on R is the Banach space L1(R) of <b>integrable</b> functions. The dual of L∞(R) is strictly larger than L1(R) For example, a functional on L∞(R) that extends the Dirac measure δ0 on the closed subspace of bounded continuous functions C0b(R) cannot be {{represented as a}} function in L1(R).|$|E
25|$|By {{taking the}} limit of the {{expression}} as the norm of the partitions approaches zero, we arrive at the Riemann integral. We know that this limit exists because f {{was assumed to be}} <b>integrable.</b> That is, we take the limit as the largest of the partitions approaches zero in size, so that all other partitions are smaller and the number of partitions approaches infinity.|$|E
25|$|A general {{approach}} to solve DEs uses the symmetry property of differential equations, the continuous infinitesimal transformations of solutions to solutions (Lie theory). Continuous group theory, Lie algebras, and differential geometry {{are used to}} understand the structure of linear and nonlinear (partial) differential equations for generating <b>integrable</b> equations, to find its Lax pairs, recursion operators, Bäcklund transform, and finally finding exact analytic solutions to the DE.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} statement, one {{may say that}} {{whenever}} the classical equations of motion are <b>integrable</b> (e.g. rectangular or circular billiard tables), then the quantum-mechanical version of the billiards is completely solvable. When the classical system is chaotic, then the quantum system is generally not exactly solvable, and presents numerous difficulties in its quantization and evaluation. The general study of chaotic quantum systems is known as quantum chaos.|$|E
25|$|A {{major goal}} {{is to provide a}} general form of the Fourier {{transform}} and the Plancherel theorem. This is done by constructing a measure on the unitary dual and an isomorphism between the regular representation of G on the space L2(G) of square <b>integrable</b> functions on G and its representation on the space of L2 functions on the unitary dual. Pontrjagin duality and the Peter–Weyl theorem achieve this for abelian and compact G respectively.|$|E

500|$|Despite its name, {{the delta}} {{function}} is not truly a function, {{at least not}} a usual one with range in real numbers. For example, [...] the objects [...] and [...] are equal everywhere except at [...] yet have integrals that are different. [...] According to Lebesgue integration theory, if f and g are functions such that [...] almost everywhere, then f is <b>integrable</b> {{if and only if}} g is <b>integrable</b> and the integrals of f and g are identical.
