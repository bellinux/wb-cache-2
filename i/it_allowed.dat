5|$|After the {{purchase}} of the original site in 1919, {{the purchase}} of Gilwellbury and adjoining land in 1945 is probably the next most important in Gilwell Park's Scouting history because <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> The Scout Association to close the original road and fully utilize Branchet Field. It was originally used for small retreats and conferences but is now used as staff accommodation. The Ministry of Education assisted in the purchase.|$|E
5|$|Alonso {{ran across}} the grass at turn one again on lap 15, which {{resulted}} in him falling further behind Hamilton. Three laps later he made a similar mistake at the same turn, resulting in him sliding across the grass {{for the third time}} in the race. This caused him to drop back to fourth as <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> Massa to go round the inside of Alonso into third.|$|E

5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E
5|$|Hawkins benefited {{greatly from}} the public's {{reaction}} to the dinosaurs, which was so strong <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> {{for the sale of}} sets of small versions of the dinosaur models, priced at £30 for educational use. But the building of the models was costly (having cost around £13,729) and in 1855, the Crystal Palace Company cut Hawkins's funding. Several planned models were never made, while those half finished were scrapped, despite protest from sources including the Sunday newspaper, The Observer.|$|E
5|$|In {{less than}} a year, {{extensions}} to the Gell-Mann–Zweig model were proposed. Sheldon Lee Glashow and James Bjorken predicted {{the existence of a}} fourth flavor of quark, which they called charm. The addition was proposed because <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> for a better description of the weak interaction (the mechanism that allows quarks to decay), equalized the number of known quarks with the number of known leptons, and implied a mass formula that correctly reproduced the masses of the known mesons.|$|E
30|$|Element: Abstract concept {{from which}} Cluster and ClusteredElement extends. <b>It</b> <b>allows</b> that a {{relation}} can have as source/target two Clusters or one Cluster and one ClusteredElement.

5|$|Like the Stimson Doctrine, Welles' {{declaration}} {{was largely}} symbolic in nature, although it offered some material benefits {{in conjunction with}} Executive Order 8484. It enabled the diplomatic representatives of the Baltic states in various other countries to fund their operations and protected the ownership of ships flying Baltic flags. By establishing a non-recognition policy, <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> some 120,000 postwar displaced persons from the Baltic states to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union and advocate independence from abroad.|$|E
5|$|Parliament {{was summoned}} in 1559 to {{consider}} the Reformation Bill {{and to create a}} new church. The Reformation Bill defined the Communion as a consubstantial celebration as opposed to a transubstantial celebration, included abuse of the pope in the litany, and ordered that ministers should not wear the surplice or other Roman Catholic vestments. <b>It</b> <b>allowed</b> ministers to marry, banned images from churches, and confirmed Elizabeth as Supreme Governor of the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|The British had ceded {{some power}} in Egypt with the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1922 {{and more in}} the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. The 1936 treaty was {{designed}} to counter Benito Mussolini's ambition to link Libya to Ethiopia via Sudan in a new Italian empire. The treaty recognized Egyptian claims of sovereignty in Sudan in return for British rights in the Nile valley and the Suez Canal. <b>It</b> <b>allowed</b> for unrestricted immigration of Egyptians to Sudan and {{for the return of}} Egyptian troops. The Sudanese were not consulted.|$|E

5|$|The Cadet Nurses Corps was {{the largest}} of the federal nurse-training programs; <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> young women to serve their country in uniform and without discrimination. It also {{influenced}} the way in which nurses would be educated and trained in the United States. The American Hospital Association credited the cadet student nurses with helping to prevent the collapse of civilian nursing care, and commended them for replacing graduate nurses who enlisted in the armed forces during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The Garden of Words was {{directed}} by Makoto Shinkai, who also wrote the original story and screenplay. He {{was responsible for the}} storyboards, animation composite, key animation, and editing. According to Shinkai, his numerous roles in the production of his works is due to the small size of the company, and in this film, <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> him to tailor many elements of the film to more accurately portray his ideas.|$|E
5|$|The Jean and Johnnie {{dance was}} an {{important}} part of Barbadian culture until it was banned in the 19th century. This was a popular fertility dance performed outdoors at plantation fairs and other festivals, and was functional in that <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> women to show off to men, and more rarely, vice versa. The dance was eventually banned because the dance was associated with non-Christian African traditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{first season}} was {{produced}} by the ABC Studios in association with The Mark Gordon Company and Random Acts Productions. Safran, Gordon, Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Jake Coburn served as the executive producers. The show was designed to have a flashback narrative, shifting between two timelines. Safran incorporated the flashforward storytelling technique as he thought <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> them to spread out the plot points.|$|E
5|$|The {{truth is}} that Puerto Rican liberal {{interests}} benefited directly from the Cánovas assassination, since by Cánovas' death a pact made (previous to the event) between the new Spanish prime minister, Práxedes Mateo Sagasta, and Puerto Rican liberals headed by Luis Muñoz Rivera would come into effect soon after. <b>It</b> <b>allowed</b> {{the establishment of a}} new autonomy charter for the island territory, which gave Puerto Rico broader political powers {{than at any other time}} before or since.|$|E
5|$|Though {{this routine}} made his play {{air-tight}} in one way, it simplified opposing captains' field-placing to curb his scoring, it {{left him with}} a back-foot addict's liability to go leg-before-wicket or be caught behind on either side, and <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> his attackers to bowl their most awkward length... he could have made more runs since the war as a stroke-player, and won popular backing as a candidate for the title of world's best batsman, instead of the austere distinction of looking the hardest Australian to get out.|$|E
50|$|Transpiration can be {{regulated}} through stomatal closure or opening. <b>It</b> <b>allows</b> for plants to efficiently transport {{water up to}} their highest body organs, regulate the temperature of stem and leaves and <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> for upstream signaling such as the dispersal of an apoplastic alkalinization during local oxidative stress.|$|R
40|$|Many {{applications}} {{dealing with}} large data structures {{can benefit from}} keeping them in compressed form. Compression has many benefits: <b>it</b> can <b>allow</b> a representation to fit in main memory rather than swapping out to disk, and it improves cache performance since <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> more data {{to fit into the}} cache. However, a data structure is only useful if <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the application to perform fast queries (and updates) to the data...|$|R
40|$|ECO-COMPACT CITY is more {{efficient}} than SPRAWL CITY: it consumes less territory; <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> a correct density; <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> small retail to be on street and on square; it maximizes investment; <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> {{the creation of an}} efficient network of public utilities; <b>it</b> <b>allows</b> the creation of an efficient public transit system. It is based on the urban-neighbourhood pattern: the urban neighbourhood is an organic portion of the polycentric city, with a certain functional and administrative authonomy. Rich in public spaces, both open and built, proportionally to the social life of the group of citizens residents there. A Neighborhood is always presenting a centre, defined by clear boundaries and articulated through a structure of streets, squares and urban blocks. A Neighborhood includes a balanced system of activities: commercial, residential, productive, lodging, administrative, educational, office...|$|R
5|$|While {{the central}} plot is a murder mystery, the initial idea {{was of a}} writer with PTSD who cannot write and is instead {{fronting}} for his blacklisted best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between first- and third-person narration because <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> him to tell a broader story. He was also {{trying to create a}} layered story that would reward repeated reading, so he avoided extraneous details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s to stay in the right frame of mind.|$|E

It includes a suite of basic applications developed with the Microsoft Windows API, and is designed to have features and appearance somewhat similar to desktop versions of Windows. <b>It</b> <b>allowed</b> third party developers to develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were purchasable from Windows Marketplace for Mobile during the service's lifespan.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>allowed</b> {{the militia}} men to draw Native American blood in revenge, {{the result of}} the battle was {{inconclusive}} with respect to its original purpose of stopping the Native American raids in the area. The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards the militia. After the disastrous defeat at Stillman's Run in May, the battle at Yellow Creek coupled with the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, helped to demonstrate that the militia could stand up to and defeat Black Hawk's warriors.|$|E
