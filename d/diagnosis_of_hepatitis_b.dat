METHODS: The study group consisted of a total of 824 commercial sex workers who attended an STD clinic to undergo screening for STDs including chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> and HIV- 1 infection during the period from 1990 to 1993. For detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, endocervical smear specimens were taken from the women. Blood samples were obtained for serological <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> syphilis, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> and HIV- 1. Commercial sex workers who visited the clinic during the period from November to December of 1993 were interviewed concerning past (1990 and 1991) and recent (1992 and 1993) condom use patterns. RESULTS: The annual detection rates of C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae declined significantly from 16. 3 % in 1990 to 12. 2 % in 1993 (P < 0. 0001) and from 1. 5 % in 1990 to 0. 8 % in 1993 (P = 0. 0096), respectively. There was a remarkable reduction in the annual syphilis infection rate, from 7. 5 % in 1990 to 0. 5 % in 1993 (P = 0. 0011). The positive rate for the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> surface antigen in the women ranged from only 0. 6 % to 1. 9 % and none were found to be positive for HIV- 1 during the 4 -year period.

The sensitivity of guanidium hydrochloride method for extracting the HBV DNA from serum were evaluated and compared with phenol–chloroform and boiling methods. Diagnostic PCR kit was obtained from Cynagene contained taq polymerase, reaction mixture, dNTP, and buffer for reaction. A 353 bp product were amplified by amplification program provided in used PCR protocol. The comparison of results indicated that procedure was successful for amplification of the designed products from Hepatitis B in sera. Number of positive results were 16, 19, 23 and number of negative result were 14, 11, 7 for the boiling, phenol-chloroform and guanidium-hydrochloride extraction methods respectively. PCR method is the fastest diagnosis method and the most accurate procedure to identify Hepatitis B. Guanidium hydrochloride method was the most successful procedure studied in this survey for viruses...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B is a liver {{inflammation}} {{caused by}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{and can be}} diagnosed in clinical stage by hepatitis B core antibody from IgM class (anti-HBcIgM). Hepatitis B core antibody from IgG class (Anti-HBcIgG) appears quickly after IgM, reaching high titers in chronic hepatitis, and remains even after cure. Since hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) is the first antibody identified and sometimes the only marker detected {{during the course of}} infection, it can be used both to indicate HBV acute infection (anti-HBc-IgM) and to identify individuals who have come into contact with the virus (anti-HBc-IgG). In this work we propose a recombinant hepatitis B core multiepitope antigen (rMEHB) to be used for <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B.</b> For this purpose, a synthetic gene coding for rMEHB was designed and cloned into vector pET 21 a with a 6 xHis tag at the C-terminal. Time course induction in E. coli showed an induced protein with an apparent molecular mass of ~ 21 [*]kDa. Protein purification was performed by a single step with affinity chromatography Ni-NTA. Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated rMEHB as a thermal stable protein at pH 7. 0 and 8. 0. In these conditions rMEHB was successfully used to perform an enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA) with positive and negative sera...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the clinicopathologic features of 22 patients with hepatitis B virus-related membranous nephropathy, all with detectable glomerular hepatitis B e antigen, and of 26 patients with lupus nephritis class V. Both groups of patients similarly presented with heavy proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome; however, the patients with hepatitis B virus-related membranous nephropathy, who were predominantly male, {{did not have}} the extrarenal manifestations and autoantibodies seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. The glomerular lesions in both clinical entities were similar and at times indistinguishable, demonstrating polyclonal immunoglobulins and polytypic complements in similar subepithelial ultrastructural distribution. No morphologic feature, single or combined, carrying a high positive predictive value for the diagnosis of either nephritis was identified. Lesions such as hematoxyphil bodies and fingerprint dense deposits, distinctive of systemic lupus erythematosus, were rarely found. At the time of biopsy, when systemic lupus erythematosus is not clinically suspected, the diagnosis between hepatitis B virus-related membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis may be difficult or impossible to differentiate, especially in geographic areas where both lupus nephritis and hepatitis B surface antigen carriers are common. This study focused on the use of specific monoclonal antisera to detect glomerular hepatitis B virus antigens, which contribute to the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus-related nephritis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2008 Hepatit B kor antikoru, Hepatit B enfeksiyonun tanısında duyarlı ve spesifik serum işaretleyicisi olarak bilinmektedir. Ayrıca bazı hastalarda Hepatit B kor antikoru, hepatit yüzey antijeninin ya da yüzey antijenine karşı vücudun geliştirdiği yüzey antikorunun yokluğunda tek serum belirleyicisi olarak kullanılmaktadır. Bu kapsamda tanı kitlerinin ülkemizde de pratik bir şekilde üretilebilmesi ve ekonomiye kazancının arttırılması için virüsü tanımlayacak kor antijenine karşı temel olan antikor üretimi amaçlanmıştır. Bu çalışmada, hücre füzyon yöntemi kullanarak Hepatit B virusünün antijenlerinden biri olan kor antijenine karşı monoklonal kor antikoru üretilmiştir. Aynı amaç doğrultusunda bu çalışmada Hepatit B kor antijenine karşı poliklonal antikor tavşanda üretilmştir. Üretilen antikor saflaştılırılıp, ultrafiltrasyon yöntemi ile konsantre edildikten sonra tanı kitlerinin optimizasyonu için saklanmıştır. Antikor üretme sonuçları, literatürdeki çalışmalarla karşılaştırdığımızda önerilen yöntemler ile geliştirilen monoklonal ve poliklonal antikorlar ileride kullanım açısından yeterli yakınsaklığı sağladığı gözlenmiştir. The <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> core {{antibody}} {{is known}} to be sensitive and specific serum marker for the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> infection. Besides these, for some patients the <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> core antibody is also used as the sole serum diagnostic in the absence <b>of</b> the <b>hepatitis</b> surface antigen or the surface antibody which is produced in order to fight against the surface antigen. For this extent to be able to practically produce diagnostic kit systems and to increase the benefit into the our country economy, the purpose was to produce antibody against the core antigen that diagnoses the virus. In this approach, using the fusion method, the monoclonal antibody has been produced against core antigen {{which is one of the}} antigen <b>of</b> the <b>Hepatitis</b> virus. With the same purpose, polyclonal antibody has been produced against the <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> core antigen from the rabbit. After the purification and the concentration of the antibody with the method of ultrafiltration, it is preserved for the optimization of the diagnostic kit systems. Comparing the results of the antibody production with the studies in the literature, the development of the monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies with the aid of recommended approaches reflect accurate results and convergence.

40|$|Objectives <b>Diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> {{the occult}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus (HBV) {{infection}} in patients co-infected with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) is important {{due to the fact}} that the HBV infection may have a clinical impact on liver disease in coinfected HIV/HCV patients. Isolated <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> core antibody (HBcAb) positive HBV infection has been reported in HIV patients. The aim of this study was to determine the occult <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> in patients co-infected with HCV-HIV. Methods In a cross-sectional study, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBcAb tests were performed for all HIV-HCV co-infected patients, referred to the HIV Clinic of Hamadan. HBsAb was requested for HBsAg negative-HBcAb positive individuals and in the case of negative HBsAb, HBV-DNA PCR was performed. Finally the collected data was analyzed with SPSS. Results Of 103 HIV-HCV coinfected patients, both HBsAg and HBcAb were positive in 7 patients (6. 8 %), negative in 44 (42. 7 %) patients and 52 (50. 5 %) of all patients were HBsAg negative and HBcAb positive, which positivity of HBsAg had statistical correlation with positivity of HBcAb. In the last group HBsAb and HBV-DNA PCR were done, which resulted in the titer of antibody to be positive in 4 patients (7. 7 %) and the PCR to be negative in all (100 %) patients. Conclusions The significant number of coinfected HIV-HCV patients only had HBcAb positive test without detectable HBV-DNA. Further studies for detection of HBV-DNA in both serum and liver biopsy specimens may help clarify the impact of HBV infection in coinfected HIV/HCV patients...|$|R
40|$|<b>Diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> Virus (HBV) is {{important}} for treatment and prevention of further spread of the virus. Today, detection <b>of</b> <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus surface antigen (HBsAg) is the method of choice for the screening and initial <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> HBV. Genetic diversity and discovery of HBV variants with mutations in the immunological dominant region of HBsAg caused none reactivity in some diagnostic assays. Characterization of anti-HBs monoclonal antibodies lead to discovery of a unique monoclonal antibody revealing the true topology of the small s-protein. The knowledge of the antibody recognition spectra, {{lead to the development}} of a diagnostics assay showing for the first time detection of all HBsAg mutants based on three different epitope regions. The three epitope regions should in theory enable detection of all known HBsAg mutants, which was proven after testing HBsAg mutants in direct comparison to other diagnostic assay lacking complete mutant detection. The improved HBsAg screening assay permitted better and earlier <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> HBV infections, leaving the diagnosed HBV patient for treatment. Today the main motivation for intervening in an on-going HBV infection is in case the liver is compromised. Depending on the status of the patient, antiviral therapy is started or in worse case when the liver stops to function, a liver transplantation is the final choice. Transplantation of the liver is preceded by antiviral therapy in combination with <b>Hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> immunoglobulin (HBIg) additions. In a quest for an alternative source for HBig we isolated and selected single-domain antibodies (VHHs) that recognize the major small s-protein of HBV. Testing of five VHH in an in-vitro neutralization experiment identified one VHH that could neutralize HBV comparable with good neutralizing anti-HBs reference antibodies. Pepscan analysis and amino acid substitution experiments suggested mutual recognition of the VHH of both the “a”-determinant and c-terminus of the s-protein, fixating the structure and preventing conformational changes needed during viral entry. Alternatively binding to a yet to be discovered HBV (co-) receptor is blocked by the VHH. Ab initio modeling of the dimer “a”-determinant sequence (aa 100 - 155) with VHH S 5 revealed a tempting structure that could explain our and published observations. Mainly the location of the cysteine residues in the newly found structure was striking, showing possible formation of inter and intra chain disulfide bridges. Separate analysed c-terminal hydrophobic region (155 - 226) showed structural homology with Arfaptin 2, a BAR domain protein. The homologous structure predicted importance of the region giving curvature to the aggregated s-proteins in the HBsAg particles. We conclude from the modelling data that the protruding spikes are dimers of the “a”-determinant with peripheral stabilized c-terminal s-protein fragments on the 3 - and 5 -fold axis...|$|R
