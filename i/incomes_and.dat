5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median <b>incomes</b> <b>and</b> stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E
5|$|Once war was declared, Voorhis {{supported}} the internment of Japanese-Americans, though {{he suggested that}} the evacuations be done in as voluntary a manner as possible and that officials be appointed to administer their property to avoid forced sales at bargain prices.

Voorhis also opposed dominance of big business in the war effort. Congress, for the most part, ignored Voorhis's pleas.|$|E

The state's Hispanic population rose by 92% from 2000 to 2010, with two-thirds of Hispanics living in Northern Virginia. Hispanic citizens in Virginia have higher median household <b>incomes</b> <b>and</b> educational attainment than the general Virginia population. As far as Hispanic groups, {{there is a large}} Salvadoran population in the DC suburbs of Northern Virginia, and a large Puerto Rican population in the Hampton Roads region of Southeast Virginia. Northern Virginia also has a significant population of Vietnamese Americans, whose major wave of immigration followed the Vietnam War, and Korean Americans, whose migration has been more recent and was induced in part by the quality school system. The Filipino American community has about 45,000 in the Hampton Roads area, many of whom have ties to the U.S. Navy and armed forces.|$|E

5|$|De la Rúa's first Minister of Economy was the progressivist José Luis Machinea, who was {{proposed}} by Alfonsín and Álvarez. Menem {{had left a}} deficit of 5 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) points that Machinea tried to compensate with higher taxes to people with the highest <b>incomes,</b> <b>and</b> a reduction of the highest retirement pensions. The deficit was reduced but the crisis continued. The scandal over the labor law and the resignation of Álvarez increased the country risk, and made Argentina's access to international credit more difficult. The government negotiated a US$38 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) line of credit to prevent a default and allow the economy to grow again. Machinea also proposed to appoint the former minister Cavallo as {{the new president of}} the Central Bank of Argentina. However, Machinea was unable to achieve the levels of austerity negotiated with the IMF and resigned a few days later. The Minister of Defense Ricardo López Murphy became the new Minister of Economy. During the election camapain, De la Rúa had promised not to appoint him to that ministry, but with the ongoing crisis {{he did not want to}} risk problems caused by a temporary lack of minister. López Murphy announced a stricter austerity plan, with reduction to the health and education budgets. His plan was rejected by street demonstrations and the Frepaso, so De la Rúa declined it. Murphy resigned after being minister for 16 days.|$|E

The Current Population Survey Annual Statistical and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) from the Census Bureau and the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE) program from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are household surveys used to produce micro estimates of household <b>income</b> <b>and</b> expenditures. The CPS-ASEC collects detailed data on household <b>income</b> <b>and</b> on health insurance coverage.

25|$|Although China {{suffered}} {{large population}} loss and a devastated economy during the Mongol conquest, the succeeding Ming dynasty brought economic growth, with per capita <b>incomes</b> <b>and</b> economic output surpassing its highest {{point during the}} Song dynasty. Late Ming laissez-faire policies such as nonintervention in markets and low taxes further stimulated commerce and trade. During the Ming dynasty, the Chinese economy became very commercialised, as market agriculture replaced subsistence farming. Wage labour became increasingly common, as large-scale private industry developed, displacing and often buying out government workshops. Historian Robert Allen estimates that family <b>incomes</b> <b>and</b> labor productivity of the Ming-era Yangtze Delta Region, the richest province of China, was far higher than contemporary Europe and exceeded the later Qing dynasty.|$|E

40|$|China {{has been}} {{experiencing}} a great {{transition from a}} socialist collective economy {{to a market economy}} since 1978. Before the transition started, the Communist Party had established a socialist collective system with very low levels of <b>income</b> <b>and</b> wealth inequality. With the deepening of the rural reform and the development of rural industry, {{a large number of people}} were lifted out of poverty. However, as the people’s living standards are rising, disparities in <b>income</b> <b>and</b> wealth are also being accentuated. This thesis’s main purpose is to study the extent <b>and</b> determinants of <b>income</b> <b>and</b> wealth inequality in rural China. Based on a sample survey data from Anhui and Sichuan provinces, the thesis answers the following five questions: 1.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study used}} {{data on the}} total {{population}} to examine the longitudinal association between midlife <b>income</b> <b>and</b> mortality <b>and</b> late-life <b>income</b> <b>and</b> mortality in an aging Swedish cohort. We specifically examined {{the shape of the}} associations between <b>income</b> <b>and</b> mortality with focus on where in the income distribution that higher incomes began to provide diminishing returns. The study is based on a total Swedish population cohort between the ages of 50 and 60 years in 1990 (n= 801, 017) followed in registers for up to 19 years. We measured equivalent disposable household <b>income</b> in 1990 <b>and</b> 2005 and mortality between 2006 and 2009. Cox proportional hazard models with penalized splines (P-spline) enabled us to examine for non-linearity in the relationship between <b>income</b> <b>and</b> mortality. The results showed a clear non-linear association. The shape of the association between midlife (ages 50 – 60) <b>income</b> <b>and</b> mortality was curvilinear; returns diminished as income increased. The shape of the association between late-life (ages 65 – 75) <b>income</b> <b>and</b> mortality was also curvilinear; returns diminished as income increased. The association between late-life <b>income</b> <b>and</b> mortality remained after controlling for midlife income. In summary, the results indicated that a non-linear association between <b>income</b> <b>and</b> mortality is maintained into old age, in which higher incomes give diminishing returns...|$|R
