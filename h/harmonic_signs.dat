40|$|Dizziness {{is one of}} {{the most}} common reasons {{patients}} visit their physicians. Balance control depends on receiving afferent sensory information from several sensory systems: vestibular, optical and proprioceptive. Bioelectric signals, generated by body movements in the semicircular canals and in the otolithic apparatus, are transported via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nucleus. All four vestibular nuclei, located bilaterally in medial longitudinal fasciculus, are linked with central nervous system structures. These central nervous system structures are involved in maintaining visual stability, spatial orientation and balance control. Nystagmus is a result of afferent signals balance disorders. Nystagmus due to peripheral lesions is conjugate nystagmus, because there is a bilateral central connection. Lesions above the vestibular nuclei induce deficits in synchronization and conjugation of eye movements, thus the nystagmus is dissociated. This paper shows that in peripheral vestibular disorders spontaneous nystagmus is rhythmic, associated, horizontal-rotatory or horizontal, with subjective sensation of dizziness which decreases with time and <b>harmonic</b> <b>signs</b> whose direction coincides with the slow phase of nystagmus and it is associated with mild disorders during pendular stimulation with statistically significant vestibular hypofunction. Spontaneous nystagmus in central vestibular lesions is severe, dissociated, horizontal, rotatory or vertical, without changes related to optical suppression; if vestibular symptoms are present, they are non-harmonic. In central disorders, findings after thermal stimulation are either normal or pathological, with dysrhythmias and inhibition in pendular stimulation. This paper deals with differential diagnosis of vertigo based on anamnesis and clinical examination, as well as objective diagnostic tests. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{phase lag}} {{structure}} between the hard and soft X-ray photons observed in GRS 1915 + 105 and XTE J 1550 + 564 {{has been said}} to be ``complex'' because the phase of the Quasi-Periodic Oscillation fundamental Fourier mode changes with time and because the even and odd <b>harmonics</b> <b>signs</b> behave differentely. From simultaneous X-ray and radio observations {{this seems to be}} related to the presence of a jet (level of radio emission). We propose a simple idea where a partial absorption of the signal can shift the phases of the Fourier modes and account for the phase lag reversal. We also briefly discuss a possible physical mechanism that could lead to such an absorption of the quasi-periodic oscillation modulation. Comment: accepted by A&A Letter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Distorted voltage {{and current}} {{waveforms}} {{is one of the}} problems associated to electric power quality. Continuous use of non-linear loads provokes the existence of voltage waveforms with a high distortion. Thus, it is necessary to know the responsible of this problem by means of the commonly named distortion sources identification. In this paper, the problem is analyzed through the <b>harmonic</b> power <b>sign,</b> with the objective of knowing the sense of harmonic power flow between source and one load in distorted systems. Nowadays, it has already been established in the Literature that an analysis of this kind does not solve the problem. Recently, new indices have been introduced to evaluate a specific consumer distortion level. In this paper, a comparative analysis of these indices is carried out, having as reference a practical case. The results obtained show that, in fact, these indices can help to valuate the harmonic distortion, although none of them solve the question definitively...|$|R
40|$|We use frequency-resolved {{spectroscopy}} {{to examine}} the energy spectra of the prominent low frequency QPO and its harmonic in GX 339 - 4. We track the evolution of these spectra as the source makes a transition from a bright low/hard to hard intermediate state. In the hard/intermediate states, the QPO and time averaged spectra are similar and the harmonic is either undetected or similar to the QPO. By contrast, in the softer states the harmonic is dramatically softer than the QPO spectrum and the time averaged spectrum, and the QPO spectrum is dramatically harder than the time averaged spectrum. Clearly, the existance of these very different spectral shaped components mean that the time-averaged spectra are complex. We use the frequency resolved spectra to better constrain the model components, and find that the data are consistent with a time-averaged spectrum which has an additional low temperature, optically thick Comptonisation component. The harmonic can be described by this additional component alone, while the QPO spectrum {{is similar to that}} of the hard Comptonisation and its reflection. Neither QPO nor <b>harmonic</b> show <b>signs</b> of the disc component even when it is strong in the time averaged spectrum. While the similarity between the harmonic and QPO spectra in the intermediate state can be produced from the angular dependence of Compton scattering in a single region, this cannot explain the dramatic differences seen in the soft state. Instead, we propose that the soft Compton region is located predominantly above the disc while the hard Compton is from the hotter inner flow. Our results therefore point to multiple possible mechanisms for producing harmonic features in the power spectrum. The dominant mechanism in a given observation is likely a function of both inclination angle and inner disc radius. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|Planing hulls {{sometimes}} exhibit dynamic instabilities, {{endangering the}} safety of passengers and crew. Most of the efforts in understanding these phenomena have concentrated in the vertical plane (e. g., porpoising). Little {{has been done in}} the horizontal plane, where the emphasis has been placed in the understanding of progressive heeling. The physics and conditions under which planing hulls will develop oscillatory roll instabilities (e. g., chine walking) are still not well understood and therefore there are not accepted guidelines to prevent them. Consistent with this need of understanding, in this research a method for investigating the conditions under which high-speed planing hulls can exhibit large oscillatory roll motions parametrically excited by small heave and pitch motions is proposed. A one-way coupling between heave-pitch and roll is assumed, and the roll equation of motion is written as a Hill's equation with third order non-linearities. The stability boundaries in the Ince-Strutt diagram are obtained, the influence of the different terms in the roll equation of motion on these boundaries is discussed, and conditions to be satisfied in order to avoid large amplitude periodic roll motions {{in the vicinity of the}} principal parametric resonance are derived. In order to reduce the coefficients for the roll equation of motion, the generalized forces and moments acting on a planing hull in asymmetric conditions are obtained by the 2 D+t approach. Non-linear models are proposed for roll added mass and roll damping, based on Fourier analysis of the roll moment time series. It is shown that the presence of a third order <b>harmonic</b> of different <b>sign</b> than the first order harmonic in the out-of-phase component reduces the linear roll damping, increasing the probability of parametric roll. Lastly, two of the conditions tested by Judge at the United States Naval Academy are used as case studies. The results show that high-speed planing hulls running at low mean wetted length and low trim are more prone to develop parametric roll than planing hulls running at high mean wetted length and high trim. This is consistent with what is observed in the field where lightly loaded high-speed planing hulls sometimes exhibit "chine-walking"...|$|R
40|$|Uno  de  los  temas  que  actualmente  está  ocupando  el  mundo  de  los  diseñadores  y  explotadores  de transformadores es el  del funcionamiento de estos equipos con cargas no lineales, productoras de distorsiones o armónicos en las señales de tensión y corriente. Entre los problemas ocasionados por los armónicos, la generación adicional de pérdidas y de calentamiento en los transformadores, está entre los más importantes. Si la carga que estos equipos alimentan, se mantiene constante, el resultado es la pérdida de vida útil del transformador, {{entre otros}} problemas que pueden presentarse. Una solución muy empleada en muchos países para esta problemática, es la reducción de la capacidad de los transformadores, es decir, la utilización limitada de su potencia nominal. Aunque en Cuba se fabrican transformadores de distribución, no existe una guía para tratar este problema, pero cada día urge más establecer una política a seguir desde el punto de vista de proyección y en busca de una explotación eficiente. Se pretende en este trabajo, abordar el tema exponiendo los resultados investigativos que existen  en el mundo sobre el mismo y tratando de aportar un punto de vista que pueda ayudar a abrirse paso entre lo ya estudiado y hacer una propuesta.     One {{of the topics}} {{that at the moment}} is occupying the world of the {{designers}} and exploiters of transformers it is that of the operation of these teams with non lineal loads, producers of distortions or <b>harmonic</b> in the <b>signs</b> of tension and current. Among the problems caused by the harmonic, the additional generation of losses and of heating in the transformers, it is among the most important. If the load that these teams feed, stays constant, the result is the loss of useful life of the transformer, among other problems that can be presented. A solution very employee in many countries for this problem, is the reduction of the capacity of the transformers, that is to say, the limited use of her nominal power. In Cuba, although we are manufacturing of distribution transformers, a guide doesnt exist to treat this problem, but every day it urges more to establish a politics to continue from the projection point of view and in search of an efficient exploitation. It is sought in this work, to approach the topic exposing the investigative results that exist in the world on the same one and trying to contribute a point of view that he/she can help to already open up step among it studied and to make a proposal. </p...|$|R
