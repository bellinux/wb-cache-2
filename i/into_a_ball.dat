5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members {{of the families}} Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} two weapons {{new to the}} Metroid series: the tri-splitting Spazer Laser Beam, and the Plasma Beam, which {{passes through}} enemies when shot. Samus can only equip one beam at a time; however, she can switch between them by returning to where they are first found. Metroid II features the Space Jump, a new suit enhancement that allows Samus to jump infinitely and access otherwise unreachable areas. The game also sees the return of Samus' Morph Ball, a mode in which she curls up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> to travel through small tunnels. In addition, the game {{is the first in}} the series to feature the Spider Ball and Spring Ball. The Spider Ball allows Samus to climb most walls or ceilings, giving her freedom to explore both the surfaces and ceilings of caverns, and the Spring Ball gives Samus the ability to jump while curled up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> in the Morph Ball form.|$|E
5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across their bodies and those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop from the trees. However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E
25|$|The most {{effective}} strategy predators use against schooling fish is first to scare them <b>into</b> forming <b>a</b> bait <b>ball.</b> Strategies {{such as those}} outlined {{in the previous section}} can work to a degree against freely streaming fish schools, but work much better if the fish school is first compacted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bait <b>ball.</b> It is difficult for predators working individually to scare <b>a</b> fish school <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bait <b>ball,</b> and they usually work together.|$|R
5000|$|Flea as Roller Man, who rolls <b>into</b> <b>a</b> big <b>ball</b> and {{launches}} at high speed.|$|R
50|$|Players blocked <b>into</b> <b>a</b> kicked <b>ball</b> inbounds {{will not}} be {{considered}} to have touched the kick.|$|R
5|$|The Metroid series {{contains}} gameplay {{elements from}} shooter, platformer, and adventure games. The series is notable for its non-linear progression and solitary exploration format where the player only controls Samus Aran, with {{few or no}} other characters to interact with. The series has been a 2D side-scroller in all its incarnations until the Metroid Prime series changed the perspective to a first-person perspective, leading to a new first-person shooter element. The player gains items and power-ups for Samus's cybernetic suit primarily through exploration, and occasionally by defeating alien creatures through real-time combat with the suit's arm cannon. Many such upgrades enable further avenues of exploration. A recurring upgrade is the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to curl <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> roll into tight places and plant bombs.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{idea for}} a video game that {{presented}} the Metroid series in a pinball setting came to Kensuke Tanabe after he learned that Fuse Games had previously worked on Mario Pinball Land, another pinball video game. Recalling that the series' protagonist, Samus, can morph <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> Tanabe {{was convinced that the}} Metroid universe could be adapted to a pinball setting. The game was sold with a Rumble Pak accessory for the Nintendo DS, marking the first time the accessory was available for the Nintendo DS.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E
50|$|When threatened, tropidophiids coil up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> tight <b>ball.</b> <b>A</b> more {{peculiar}} defensive {{behavior is}} {{their ability to}} bleed voluntarily from the eyes, mouth, and nostrils.|$|R
60|$|Billie Dore {{finished}} {{skimming through}} her mail, and crumpled the letters up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> large <b>ball,</b> which she handed to Mac.|$|R
60|$|Instead {{of getting}} angry, Hal laughed in return. Then {{he picked up}} some snow, made it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hard <b>ball,</b> and let fly.|$|R
5|$|Isopoda is {{an order}} of {{crustaceans}} that includes woodlice and their relatives. Isopods live in the sea, in fresh water, or on land. All have rigid, segmented exoskeletons, two pairs of antennae, seven pairs of jointed limbs on the thorax, and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen {{that are used in}} respiration. Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax. Isopods have various feeding methods: some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter, others are grazers, or filter feeders, a few are predators, and some are internal or external parasites, mostly of fishes. Aquatic species mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater bodies of water, but some more derived taxa can swim for a short distance. Terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool, moist places. Some species are able to roll themselves <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> as a defence mechanism or to conserve moisture.|$|E
5|$|The katipo has {{medically}} significant venom in humans, although bites are rare. The {{incidence of}} bites is low {{as it is}} a shy, non-aggressive spider. Their narrow range, diminishing population, and human awareness of where they live means interaction between humans and the spider is minimal. The katipo will only bite as a last resort; if molested, the spider will usually fold up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> and drop to the ground or retreat to the nearest cover. If the threat continues, the spider may throw out silk against the interference. When restrained in any way or held against skin, such as if tangled up in clothing, the spider will then bite defensively. However, if the female is with an egg sac it will remain close by it and sometimes move offensively to bite any threat.|$|E
5|$|They {{discover}} that an unknown source of Eichner radiation {{is causing the}} growth. Separately, Ian (R.J. Williams), now appearing as an eight-year-old, confides to Troi {{that he is the}} source of the crew's problems and will have to leave. Troi realizes Ian is dying and calls for medical assistance. As Pulaski tries to keep Ian alive, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) scans him and discovers that he is the source of radiation. Ian dies in Troi's arms, and turns <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> of energy, which settles into Troi's hands, communicating telepathically with her for a moment, then leaves the ship. The lifeform told her that he wished to learn about humans through experiencing standard human development and living among the crew. With Ian gone, the plague sample returns to normal and the crew continues on their mission.|$|E
50|$|Guiro, the {{armadillo}} monster, always {{fought with}} hand-to-hand martial arts, he can furl his body <b>into</b> <b>an</b> iron <b>ball</b> to attack and has impenetrable armor skin.|$|R
50|$|A meatball {{is ground}} or minced meat rolled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> small <b>ball,</b> {{sometimes}} {{along with other}} ingredients, such as bread crumbs, minced onion, eggs, butter, and seasoning.|$|R
50|$|Ice Ball : Transforms the <b>ball</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> glowing <b>ball</b> of ice, {{with the}} same effect as Fire Ball. Will also affect Laser, and may be {{combined}} with Blitz Ball.|$|R
5|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the game, the player can acquire power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, as well as grant her special abilities, {{allowing}} them to gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible. The Morph Ball allows Samus to curl <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> roll into tight places and plant bombs; the Spring Ball adds an ability to jump while in Morph Ball form. The Speed Booster can be used to run at high speeds, and can crash onto barriers and enemies. The Space Jump allows Samus to jump infinite times to cover great distances, and the Hi-Jump Boots allow for a higher jump. The Grapple Beam can be used to swing across open areas. The X-ray Scope is used to see items and passages through hidden walls and other surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, players {{must find}} and collect items that improve Samus's arsenal and suit, {{including}} weapons, armor upgrades for Samus's Power Suit and items that grant abilitiesincluding the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to compress herself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> {{in order to}} roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs, and the Grapple Beam, which works by latching onto special hooks called grapple points, allowing Samus to swing across gaps. Unlike those in earlier games in the series, the beam weapons in Metroid Prime have no stacking ability, in which the traits of each beam merge. Instead, the player must cycle the four beam weapons; there are charge combos with radically different effects for each. Other upgrades include boots that allow Samus to double-jump and a Spider Ball upgrade that allows her to climb magnetic rails.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the amphipods, {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} isopods are entirely benthic. This gives them little chance to disperse to new regions and {{may explain why}} so many species are endemic to restricted ranges. Crawling is the primary means of locomotion, and some species bore into the seabed, the ground or timber structures. Some members of the Flabellifera can swim to a limited extent and have their front three pairs of pleopods modified for this purpose, with their respiratory structures limited to the hind pleopods. Most terrestrial species are slow-moving and conceal themselves under objects or hide in crevices or under bark. The semi-terrestrial sea slaters (Ligia spp.) can run rapidly on land and many terrestrial species can roll themselves <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> when threatened, a feature that has evolved independently in different groups {{and also in the}} marine sphaeromatids.|$|E
50|$|GoGo Tomago (Leiko Tanaka) {{is known}} as the hothead of Big Hero 6. GoGo {{transforms}} her body <b>into</b> <b>an</b> explosive <b>ball</b> of energy, which can be projected at vast speeds.|$|R
60|$|Again he paused. Again {{there were}} a few seconds' silence--silence save for the quick {{breathing}} of the Duchess, who was crumpling her lace handkerchief <b>into</b> <b>a</b> little <b>ball</b> in her hands.|$|R
50|$|Humpback whales {{use another}} type of bubble ring when they forage for fish. They {{surround}} a school of forage fish with a circular bubble net and herd them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> bait <b>ball.</b>|$|R
25|$|Curl <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> while {{protecting}} {{your head and}} ears if knocked over.|$|E
25|$|Kotlet mielony - {{minced meat}} with eggs, bread crumbs, garlic, {{and salt and}} pepper rolled <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> and fried on onion butter.|$|E
25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, we needed {{to come up with a}} special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
5000|$|Keibi Doubler: This monster {{appeared}} in episode 30. Its powers include high jumping, morphing <b>into</b> <b>a</b> levitating <b>ball,</b> bouncing head bombs, regeneration, {{a pair of}} magnetic spheres, a kanabo, and a sword.|$|R

50|$|Striker: {{appears in}} episode 24. Powers include {{morphing}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> flying soccer <b>ball,</b> <b>a</b> large iron <b>ball</b> {{stored in the}} torso, and a machine gun in the mouth.|$|R
25|$|Fishermen on {{coasts of}} the indopacific ocean remove Nephila webs and form them <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball,</b> which is {{thrown into the}} water. There it unfolds and is used to catch bait fish.|$|E
25|$|Common {{names for}} {{woodlice}} vary throughout the English-speaking world. A number of common names {{make reference to}} the fact that some species of woodlice can roll up <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball.</b> Other names compare the woodlouse to a pig.|$|E
25|$|The game {{begins as}} a young girl runs to her father's room in a castle. She defeats a group of creatures who attack her, and enters the room to find a man {{standing}} over the body of her dead father. The man disappears <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>ball</b> of light.|$|E
5000|$|Some manufacturers' claimed [...] "diameter" [...] of <b>a</b> beach <b>ball</b> is {{actually}} the tip-to-tip length of <b>a</b> deflated <b>ball</b> (approximately half <b>a</b> circumference), or even {{the length of the}} panels before they have their ends cut and joined <b>into</b> <b>a</b> beach <b>ball.</b> Thus the actual diameter may be about [...] (≈ 0.6366…) of the nominal [...] "⌀".|$|R
50|$|Erik, as Goliath, is seen {{among the}} enthralled villains {{defending}} Krona's stronghold, {{along with other}} members of the Masters of Evil. He is shown being struck by Plastic Man, who has turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> giant <b>ball.</b>|$|R
