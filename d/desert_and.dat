5|$|A {{semi-arid}} desert or a steppe is {{a version}} of the arid desert with much more rainfall, vegetation and higher humidity. These regions feature a semi-arid climate and are less extreme than regular deserts. Like arid deserts, temperatures can vary greatly in semi deserts. They share some characteristics of a true <b>desert</b> <b>and</b> are usually located at the edge of deserts and continental dry areas. They usually receive precipitation from 250mm (10in) to 500mm (20in) but this can vary due to evapotranspiration and soil nutrition. Semi deserts {{can be found in the}} Tabernas <b>Desert</b> (<b>and</b> some of the Spanish Plateau), The Sahel, The Eurasian Steppe, most of Central Asia, the Western US, most of Northern Mexico, portions of South America (especially in Argentina) and the Australian Outback. They usually feature BSh (hot steppe) or BSk (temperate steppe) in the Köppen climate classification.|$|E
5|$|Alexander sent much of {{his army}} to Carmania (modern {{southern}} Iran) with general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the Gedrosian <b>Desert</b> <b>and</b> Makran. Alexander reached Susa in 324BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{there were}} two further fatal crashes, killing a total of 19 marines, and the V-22 was again {{grounded}} while the cause of these crashes was investigated and various parts were redesigned. In June 2005, the V-22 successfully completed its final operational evaluation; this had included long range deployments, high altitude, <b>desert</b> <b>and</b> shipboard operations. The problems identified in various accidents had reportedly been addressed.|$|E

5|$|S. t. salicamans occurs {{west of the}} Sierra Nevada range {{during the}} summer and in south and central Baja California Peninsula to the Mojave <b>Desert</b> <b>and</b> Colorado Desert in winter. In winter, the plumage of both sexes is browner than other {{subspecies}}, and in summer, the male's black cap is smaller than that of other subspecies. This subspecies has been called the willow goldfinch.|$|E

5|$|The Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve on the {{southern}} summit flank of Mauna Kea was established in 1981.

5|$|The {{route of}} US395 in California is {{split into two}} segments, as the highway exits and reenters California via Nevada.

The northern segment also follows the Sierra Nevada and crosses the Modoc Plateau.|$|E
5|$|A single {{reference}} in {{the tomb of}} Ahmose Pen-Nekhebet indicates another campaign in Iamu {{in the land of}} Kehek. Unfortunately, the location of Kehek is unknown. It was long believed that Kehek was a reference to the Libyan tribe, Qeheq, and thus it was postulated that invaders from Libya took advantage of the death of Ahmose to move into the western Nile Delta. Unfortunately for this theory, the Qeheq people only appeared in later times, and Kehek's identity remains unknown. Nubia is a possibility, since Amenhotep did campaign there, and the western <b>desert</b> <b>and</b> the oases have also been suggested, since these seem to have fallen under Egyptian control once again.|$|E

5|$|After {{an hour on}} the ground, the {{helicopters}} left with the first 61 evacuees, including all American civilians and four heads of mission. Evacuees were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm. Complications with the only in-flight refueling on the return nearly prevented refueling, which would have forced {{the helicopters}} to divert to the Somali <b>desert</b> <b>and</b> await a rescue. At 9:40, the helicopters arrived on Guam and unloaded the evacuees.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the <b>desert,</b> <b>and</b> was amused by mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend {{hours at a time}} in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Grierson, {{commander}} of the 10th Cavalry, traversed the hot Chihuahuan <b>Desert</b> <b>and</b> then the narrow valleys of the Chinati Mountains, reaching Rattlesnake Springs {{on the morning of}} August 6, 1880. His cavalrymen and their mounts were worn down from the forced march of over 65miles in 21 hours. After resting and getting water, Grierson carefully placed his men in ambush positions. Carpenter, with his two cavalry troops, arrived as reinforcements and were posted in reserve a short distance south of the spring. The cavalrymen settled down to wait as Indian scouts brushed away any sign of their presence.|$|E

5|$|Damage in the United States was considerable. California {{received}} record rainfall, {{with over}} {{a foot of}} rain falling in some areas. Flooding caused catastrophic destruction to Ocotillo, and six people drowned. Flooding extended west; railway tracks were destroyed in Palm <b>Desert</b> <b>and</b> high winds and severe flooding were recorded in Arizona. Overall, the damage total was $160 million (1976 USD) and 12 deaths were attributed to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its size}} and {{geologic}} features such as the Balcones Fault, Texas contains diverse landscapes that resemble both the U.S. Southern and Southwestern regions. Although Texas is popularly associated with the U.S. southwestern deserts, less than 10% of Texas' land area is desert. Most of the population centers are located in areas of former prairies, grasslands, forests, and the coastline. Traveling from east to west, one can observe terrain that ranges from coastal swamps and piney woods, to rolling plains and rugged hills, and finally the <b>desert</b> <b>and</b> mountains of the Big Bend.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} two millennia, locust plagues {{continued}} to appear at irregular intervals with the main recorded outbreaks of the <b>desert</b> <b>and</b> migratory locusts occurring in Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. Other species of locusts caused havoc in North and South America, Asia, and Australasia; 173 outbreaks {{over a period of}} 1924 years have been recorded in China. The Bombay locust (Nomadacris succincta) was a major pest in India and southeastern Asia in the 18th and 19th centuries, but has seldom swarmed since the last plague in 1908.|$|E
