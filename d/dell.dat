5|$|As {{early as}} 2006, the Nashville Sounds {{had planned to}} leave Herschel Greer Stadium for a new {{ballpark}} to be called First Tennessee Field, but the project was abandoned after the city, developers, and team could not come to terms {{on a plan to}} finance its construction. Instead, Greer was repaired and upgraded to keep it close to Triple-A standards until a new stadium could be built. In late 2013, talks about {{the construction of a new}} ballpark—later called First Tennessee Park—were revived. Three possible sites were identified by the architectural firm Populous as being suitable for a new stadium: the east bank of the Cumberland River, the North Gulch area, and Sulphur <b>Dell.</b> Sulphur <b>Dell,</b> the site of the city's original ballpark from 1870 to 1963, was chosen.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office {{began working}} toward a new stadium, with the city {{identifying}} three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder Populous to study each. The three sites were an area on {{the north end of}} The Gulch, the site of Nashville's first ballpark (Sulphur <b>Dell),</b> and various areas directly adjacent to Nissan Stadium and the eastern terminus of the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge. The Sounds still preferred the Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (Ascend Amphitheater was eventually built there). Mayor Karl Dean preferred the Sulphur <b>Dell</b> site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37million downtown ballpark at Sulphur <b>Dell.</b> Construction on First Tennessee Park began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time {{for the start of the}} 2015 season.|$|E

5|$|After Sulphur <b>Dell</b> was {{dismantled}} on April 16, 1969, the ballpark's sunken {{field was}} filled in with rock, dirt, and {{the remains of}} the demolished Andrew Jackson Hotel. It was then converted to a number of state-owned parking lots for the nearby the Tennessee State Capitol. While Sulphur <b>Dell</b> was nestled in an area that was home to the city's garbage dump, stockyards, the Atlantic Ice House building, and other various warehouses, First Tennessee Park is now surrounded by new apartments, parking ramps, and restaurants. The facade surrounding the home plate entrance on the stadium's north side is constructed from cast ultra-high-performance concrete planks, zinc panels, and an array of windows that stretches across the full width of the entrance. To the south of the stadium, beyond the outfield wall, is an area that connects the city's Cumberland River Greenway to the Bicentennial Mall Greenway. It will be open to the public on non-game days after the surrounding apartment buildings and retail spaces are completed in spring 2018.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{describes}} the dolomite relief of the @ibr{e hills where <b>dells</b> are a characteristic relief feature. It discusses the main geomorphological characteristics and {{genesis of the}} relief. Carbonate rock covers almost one half of Slovenia's surface area, of which dolomite comprises about one quarter. Dolomite relief with <b>dells,</b> which cover {{a little less than}} one tenth of the dolomite areas, is par-ticularly interesting. The relief with <b>dells</b> is neither typical fluviodenudational relief because there are no surface water streams nor typical karst relief because <b>dells</b> are linear relief features. Their occurrence and development have not previously been studied in detail. The paper {{describes the}} principal characteristics of dolomite relief with <b>dells</b> in the @ibr{e hills northeast of Logatec. Considered geomorphologically, the studies of the geological structure and chemistry stud-ies indicate that the <b>dells</b> were formed by periglacial processes during the cold periods of the Pleistocene, and due to the carbonate nature of the rock, by karst processes as well...|$|R
