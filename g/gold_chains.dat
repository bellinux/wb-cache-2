5|$|Razor Ramon and Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.) began feuding {{prior to}} SummerSlam 1993 {{because of an}} angle in which Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and I.R.S.) teased Ramon about losing to the 1-2-3 Kid, a {{newcomer}} to the WWF. The rivalry heated up when I.R.S. stole Ramon's <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> while Shawn Michaels had Ramon distracted. Ramon and I.R.S. agreed to settle the feud at Royal Rumble 1994 with Ramon's Intercontinental Championship on the line.|$|E
5|$|Razor Ramon {{continued}} {{with two of}} his feuds after Survivor Series. Irwin R. Schyster stole Ramon's <b>gold</b> <b>chains,</b> which set up a match for the Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. Despite interference from Shawn Michaels, Ramon pinned Schyster to retain the title. Michaels and Ramon then faced each other at WrestleMania X. Diesel got involved, but Ramon won the match. Ramon then defended his title against Diesel on April 13, 1994. Diesel won the match and became the new WWF Intercontinental Champion. Ramon regained the belt in a rematch at SummerSlam 1994, however. Meanwhile, the 1–2–3 Kid and Marty Jannetty {{continued with}} their push from the promotion and won the WWF Tag Team Championship on January 10, 1994.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels also dated back to {{the fall}} of 1993. Jack Tunney {{announced}} that he was stripping Michaels of the WWF Intercontinental Championship for not defending the title often enough. There have been reports that the real reason for vacating the title was because Michaels refused to drop the belt. Ramon won the title after competing in a battle royal and defeating Rick Martel, the other finalist in the match. In the angle, Michaels refused to acknowledge the title change, however, as he insisted that he was the true Intercontinental Champion. To gain revenge against Ramon for taking the belt, Michaels attacked Ramon and helped Irwin R. Schyster to steal Ramon's <b>gold</b> <b>chains.</b>|$|E

25|$|Usually a cloth's {{value was}} {{relatively}} big. Accessories were no exception. For example, a pearl bonnet alone could {{cost as much}} as 100 dollars; this was three years' salary for a carpenter. Expensive were also <b>gold</b> <b>chains,</b> bonnets with ostrich feathers, etcetera. As such clothes were not only a matter of dressing, but also a part a family's capital.|$|E

Crossed keys are in the upper arm, an eagle's head lies in the left arm, and a scroll lies in its right arm. In the bottom arm lie two clasped hands and seven stars.|$|E
25|$|Because Alcman {{discusses}} Spartan {{customs and}} characteristics, {{his work is}} of interest to historians as well. For example, the assertion {{that there was little}} possession of material goods in Sparta – a part of the 'Spartan Mirage' – is disproved by Alcman's observation of various women wearing <b>gold</b> <b>chains.</b> Details like this allow for a more intricate understanding of life in Sparta.|$|E

25|$|Many {{whimsical}} fashions {{were introduced}} in the extravagant eighteenth century. Cameos {{that were used in}} connection with jewellery were the attractive trinkets along with many of the small objects such as brooches, ear-rings and scarf-pins. Some of the necklets were made of several pieces joined with the <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> were in and bracelets were also made sometimes to match the necklet and the brooch. At the end of the Century the jewellery with cut steel intermixed with large crystals was introduced by an Englishman, Matthew Boulton of Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|Popular {{accessories}} included large eyeglasses (Cazals), Kangol bucket hats, nameplates, name belts, {{and multiple}} rings. Heavy gold jewelry was also {{popular in the}} 1980s; heavy jewelry in general would become an enduring element of hip hop fashion. In general, men's jewelry focused on heavy <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> and women's jewelry on large gold earrings. Performers such as Kurtis Blow and Big Daddy Kane helped popularize gold necklaces and other such jewelry, and female rappers such as Roxanne Shanté and the group Salt-N-Pepa helped popularize oversized gold door-knocker earrings. The heavy jewelry was suggestive of prestige and wealth, and some have connected the style to Africanism.|$|E
25|$|The {{silver and}} gold {{manufactured}} in the city during the 19th century and early 20th century was of exceptionally high quality, with its own hallmark. These products are now considered collectibles. In the 19th century, other products such as chains were manufactured. Some chains were produced to be purely ornamental and to be attached to watches. However, some larger chains were manufactured for industrial uses. These chains sometimes contained silver, and rarely gold. <b>Gold</b> <b>chains</b> would sell, on average, for £250,000. The first silver guard chain made in Birmingham was made in 1806. At around the mid-19th century, between 1,500 and 1,600 people were manufactured in the chain-making industry, 500 of which were women.|$|E

500|$|Jay-Z's fashion {{was noted}} to be Kanye-esque, with pieces worn by him {{including}} rotating ensembles of black leather {{as well as}} [...] "giant, billowing pant scarves". For the opening performance, Jay-Z appeared on stage in black sunglasses, <b>gold</b> <b>chains,</b> {{a black and white}} star speckled shirt and a black jacket. During the performance of [...] "Big Pimpin'" [...] Jay-Z wore a fedora.|$|E
500|$|... "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" [...] {{was part}} of the set list of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's co-headlining On the Run Tour (2014) where the shows were opened with the {{performance}} of the song. A black-and-white video was shown on the screen accompanied by sirens as the duo appeared onstage surrounded by smoke. They started performing the song with Beyoncé wearing a see-through fishnet mask and Jay-Z wearing black sunglasses, a star-speckled shirt, black jacket and <b>gold</b> <b>chains.</b> The song was in line with the show's overall criminalistic theme.|$|E
500|$|Dahl and Meier {{regularly}} mocked disco {{records on}} the radio. Dahl also recorded his own parody: [...] "Do Ya Think I'm Disco?", a satire of Rod Stewart's disco-oriented hit [...] "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?" [...] This parody song presented [...] as populated by effeminate men and frigid women. The lead character, named Tony like Travolta's character in Saturday Night Fever, {{is unable to}} attract a woman until he abandons the disco scene, selling his three-piece white suit at a garage sale and melting down his <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> for a Led Zeppelin belt buckle.|$|E

500|$|Eric B. & Rakim {{appeared}} with the Marley Marl produced [...] "Eric B. Is President" [...] and [...] "My Melody" [...] on Zakia Records in 1986. Both tracks appeared on Paid in Full (4th & Broadway, 1987). Just as B.D.P. had, the pair reflected changes in street life on their debut's cover, which depicted the two wearing huge <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> {{and surrounded by}} money. Like Criminal Minded, the sampling prevalent in the album cemented James Brown's status as a hip hop source, while Rakim's allusions showed the growing influence of mystic Islam-offshoot The Nation of Gods and Earths in hip-hop. [...] The music was minimalist, austerely so, with many writers noting that coupled with Rakim's precise, logical style, the effect was almost one of scientific rigour. [...] The group followed Paid in Full with Follow The Leader (Uni, 1988) (on which they were open-minded enough to sample The Eagles), Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em (MCA, 1990) and Don't Sweat The Technique (MCA, 1992).|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins in}} an office with the mail guy (played by Kennedy), handing out mail to co-workers, while Brown's song [...] "BeautifulPeople" [...] plays in the background. As the audio of [...] "Till I Die" [...] begins, Brown, wearing a grey suit, beanie, gold fronts and <b>gold</b> <b>chains,</b> appears out of nowhere {{tripping}} the mail guy, and starts rapping his verse. He then appears in an elevator where he meets Wiz Khalifa and Big Sean, who then raps his verse. As they leave work, the trio catch a ride with Snoop Dogg in his yellow Pontiac Parisienne, as Sean continues rapping his verse. This scene is intercut with scenes of them hanging out in an abandoned warehouse surrounded by smoke and flashing lights. Khalifa then raps his verse as they arrive at a mansion where Method Man and Redman are seen smoking. The video ends with more scenes of the trio back at the abandoned warehouse and shows the memory to Adam Yauch.|$|E

500|$|To promote My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West {{performed}} the song at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. During the performance, West wore black peacoat, fur vest, shiny gold shirt, <b>gold</b> <b>chains,</b> and a headband. According to a reviewer from Rap-Up, he was lip syncing the song during the performance. Due to the controversy {{stemming from the}} MTV Video Music Awards, {{it was reported that}} West was booed during the performance. The booing garnered press coverage and was reported by several publications. During his set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, West performed [...] "Lost in the World" [...] towards the end of his performance. Justin Vernon joined Kanye during the performance, and it was described as [...] "one of the most memorable performances in Coachella history." [...] The track was featured during West's set at the Big Chill music festival. At the festival, West announced plans for the song to be the fifth single from the album, however plans to do never surfaced.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] {{during her}} appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on April 9, 2015. She adorned {{herself in a}} black jacket covered with gold dollar symbols {{and a number of}} <b>gold</b> <b>chains</b> around her neck. The performance began with Madonna in the backstage where she put finishing touches to her make-up, then entered Diplo's dressing room where he was having a party surrounded by women. Madonna did a dance routine in the hallway where her son Rocco appeared mouthing the chorus. The singer and her troupe then moved into the studio area where the audience was present. Energetic dancing continued with Madonna straddling one member of the audience at one point. Still photos of Minaj were projected on video screens with Diplo DJing on a console. Madonna also climbed atop Fallon's desk and made him sing the chorus line. The performance ended with another energetic dance routine and crumping.|$|E
500|$|Mars and The Hooligans {{perform the}} song {{along with a}} simple {{synchronized}} choreography in matching red suits, leopard print shirts and <b>gold</b> <b>chains.</b> The set features a disco ball, vintage stage lights, the set up of the instruments {{in the background and}} other elements present in the disco era. The style of the music video greatly resembles the performance held at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards. Following the 1970s theme, the video is unavailable in high definition, and is rather shown in standard-definition quality and with a 4:3 aspect ratio. For EW, Kyle Anderson, pointed out [...] "It’s all there: The suits, the setting, and the bong-water video effects", while Melinda Newman for HitFix noticed that [...] "to complete the look, the video features special effects, including crude back lighting, wacky dissolves, geometric shapes, [...] and a Space Wars-like background". All of these and the videotape wear were also added to the footage to bring a retro-feel to it.|$|E
