40|$|Frequency {{modulation}} {{continuous wave}} (FMCW) lasers are key components in modern optical imaging. However, current intracavity modulation lasers do not exhibit low-frequency jitter rate and high linearity {{due to the}} inherent relaxation oscillations. Although this may be compensated in a direct modulation laser diode using an optoelectronic feedback loop, the available <b>sweep</b> <b>speed</b> is moderately small. In this letter, a special external modulation method is developed to improve the performance of FMCW. Since only the first sideband optical field is used during the entire generation process, phase noise is {{kept to a minimum}} and is also independent of the <b>sweep</b> <b>speed.</b> We demonstrate that the linearity and jitter rates do not deteriorate appreciably when the <b>sweep</b> <b>speed</b> is changed over three orders of magnitude, even up to the <b>highest</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>speed</b> of 2. 5 GHz/ μs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} the first widely tunable, single-mode 1310 nm MEMS VCSELs with> 100 nm tuning range, {{and the first}} application of these VCSELs to ultra-high-speed swept source OCT imaging at axial scan rates up to 760 kHz. Swept source Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{has emerged as a}} powerful technique for obtaining micron scale 3 D images of biological tissue [1]. Emerging applications which require real-time acquisition of high-density, high volume data sets have driven the search for commercially viable swept laser sources around 1310 nm with ~ 40 mW output power,> 100 nm tuning range, and several hundred kHz or <b>higher</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds</b> [2, 3]. MEMS tunable Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are an ideal swept source for OCT imaging, because of their micron scale cavity length and low mirror mass enabling <b>high</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>speeds,</b> single-mode operation without mode hops, long dynamic coherence length [4] enabling deep imaging, and compatibility with low-cost wafer-scale fabrication and testing. Though MEMS tunable VCSELs have existed for well over a decade [5, 6], limited tuning range and output power have thus far precluded application to OCT. In this work we demonstrate record sweep rates and bandwidths from VCSEL sources by integrating a wide-gain InP-based quantum well active region with a GaAs-based fully oxidized mirror through wafer bonding, as shown in Figs. 1, 2. A suspended top dielectric mirror moves through electrostatic actuation, generating tunable 1310 nm laser emission as the structure is optically pumped at 980 nm.

40|$|We have {{developed}} experimental methods for {{the generation of}} chirped laser pulses of controlled frequency evolution in the nanosecond pulse length range for coherent atomic interaction studies. The pulses are sliced from the radiation of a cw external cavity diode laser while its drive current, and consequently its frequency, are sinusoidally modulated. By the proper choice of the modulation parameters, {{as well as of}} the timing of pulse slicing, we can produce a wide variety of frequency sweep ranges during the pulse. In order to obtain the required frequency chirp, we need to stabilize the center frequency of the modulated laser and to measure the resulting frequency evolution with appropriate temporal resolution. These tasks have been solved by creating a beat signal with a reference laser locked to an atomic transition frequency. The beat signal is then analyzed, as well as its spectral sideband peaks are fed back to the electronics of the frequency stabilization of the modulated laser. This method is simple and it has the possibility for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> frequency <b>sweep</b> with narrow bandwidth that is appropriate, for example, for selective manipulation of atomic states in a magneto-optical trap...|$|R
40|$|Cathode {{spots on}} arc‐cleaned copper and {{molybdenum}} electrodes in vacuum were studied by fast image converter framing and streak camera photography with high {{temporal and spatial}} resolution. The frame exposure time was 20 ns and the interframe period was 200 ns; the streak sweep time was between 200 ns and 1 μs. Spatial structures with a resolution of 5 μm could be determined by observing the spot movement with a small slit at the streak camera and a <b>high</b> <b>sweep</b> <b>speed.</b> Strong fluctuations of the light emission of the spot were found with characteristic times of 50 – 100 ns. When the spot {{moved out of the}} slit field of view a stepwise decrease occurred in the measured light, indicating an internal substructure of the spot with distances between fragments less than 10 μm and even smaller fragment diameters. The current per fragment was estimated to be 20 – 40 A. The frames confirm the short time constants of the spot. From frame to frame a spot motion was observed in most cases, yielding spot residence times < 200 ns...|$|R
40|$|Power gain is {{the main}} {{objective}} in any motorbike competition. Despite of the wide literature on theoretical and experimental methods for increasing engine power, {{there is a general}} lack of data about tests on racing engine performance due to the obvious manufacturers' reluctance to spread information, especially for recent high technological level applications. This paper, instead, presents all the main results of the experimental tests conducted on a motorbike engine both in the original stock arrangement and in a modified configuration proposed in compliance with the Technical Regulations of the 2007 FIM Road Racing Supersport Italian Championship (CIV). Traditional testing techniques (steady-flow discharge coefficients measurements and chassis dynamometer tests performed in the slow speed ramp mode) are chosen to reduce time and costs and to limit engine wearing while obtaining an acceptable degree of accuracy. It is also proved that the tests to assess the improvements obtained with design changes could not have been completed in the steady-state mode using a single engine because of the short life cycle of racing engines due to wearing, which would have altered the comparisons. Test results show a 16 % and 33 % rise in torque and power for the racing configuration, reaching {{the state of the art}} of the best performing engines in the Italian Supersport racing class. <b>High</b> <b>speed</b> engine testing <b>Sweep</b> test reliability Discharge flow coefficients...|$|R
40|$|The {{instantaneous}} linewidth {{of rapidly}} wavelength-swept laser sources as used for {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) is of crucial interest for {{a deeper understanding of}} physical effects involved in their operation. Swept lasers for OCT, typically sweeping over ~ 15 THz in ~ 10 μs, have linewidths of several gigahertz. The <b>high</b> optical-frequency <b>sweep</b> <b>speed</b> makes it impossible to measure the instantaneous spectrum with standard methods. Hence, up to now, experimental access to the instantaneous linewidth was rather indirect by the inverse Fourier transform of the coherence decay. In this Letter, we present a method by fast synchronous time gating and extraction of a “snapshot ” of the instantaneous spectrum with an electro-optic modulator, which can subsequently be measured with an optical spectrum analyzer. This newmethod is analyzed in detail, and systematic artifacts, such as sideband generation due to the modulation and residual wavelength uncertainty due to the sweeping operation, are quantified. The method is checked for consistency with results from the common, more indirect measurement via coherence properties. © 2010 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 110. 4500, 140. 3600.

Using <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> video {{photography}} at framing rates between 10000 - 100000 fps, the bubble entrapment regime was studied for water drops impacting on a deep pool of water.

40|$|Nowadays, {{cyber-physical system}} (CPS) relies on {{wireless}} networks for devices control and information backhaul. But the mass deployment CPS devices make operators' spectrum scarce situations even more worse. Hence, cellular network operators anticipate the Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) technology {{to solve the}} spectrum shortage problem {{in the context of}} cognitive radio (CR). Femtocells, acting as gateways in CPS, integrate CPS devices into cellular networks in a seamless manner. The concept of cognitive femtocell can solve the spectrum congestion problem even within a massive network on the CPS scale. However, in practical systems, cellular white space spectrum should be quantitatively measured to guide cognitive femtocell access algorithms design. We are the first to conduct a comprehensive measurement study for the purpose of measurement, discovery and model features of GSM white space spectrum. We evaluate availabilities of extra 21. 4 MHz capacity in GSM white space spectrum as a reason of artificial GSM network spectrum planning.
