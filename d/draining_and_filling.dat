2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1863, {{frequent}} {{design changes}} were causing growing problems for the contractors. Stimers {{and his team of}} thirty draftsmen at the monitor office continued to submit changes even as the vessels {{were in the process of}} production, leading to long delays. One yard in Boston received a total of 83 drawings and 120 letters of explanation from Stimers, and the specification manual for the ships grew to 92 pages of small print. The final design called for a total of thirteen auxiliary engines and pumps per ship, fancy brasswork in place of cast iron, and a complex system of pipes for <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> the water tanks. The added weight to a ship designed with only a [...] freeboard at the outset raised questions about the ships' eventual seaworthiness.|$|E
50|$|Kenner's growth {{began in}} the late 1950s when {{developers}} began subdividing, <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> the swampland in the northern half of the city. During the 1960s, the construction of Interstate 10 and improvements to Veterans Memorial Highway aided the rapid development of Kenner as a suburb of New Orleans.|$|E
50|$|Since Lilium iridollae {{has become}} an {{endangered}} and threatened species {{there are ways to}} protect and manage them. One way is to protect streams from siltation or sedimentation during logging and road construction. In addition, avoid logging on slope forests. Furthermore, avoid <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> wetlands. Since wildfires benefit Lilium iridollae, we should avoid placing firebreaks in ecotones. The wildfires should be allowed to burn into edges of streamside forests. Lastly, eradicate feral hogs because they can be harmful.|$|E

5000|$|The former marsh {{is a low}} {{tract of}} mainly {{agricultural}} land created by <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling,</b> separated from the sea by sand dunes. The area amounts to about 80,000 ha (800 km2; 310 sq mi). [...] The Via Appia, a Roman military road constructed in 312 BC, crosses the inland side of the former marsh in a long, straight stretch flanked by trees. Before then, travelers {{had to use the}} Via Latina along the flanks of the mountains; Terracina could not be reached across the marsh.|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the area}} being marshland, {{completion}} of the highway required damning, <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> remnants of a distributary known as Bayou Metairie. Development in the area lagged until about the 1960s due to limited road access, challenges with water drainage {{and the creation of}} the Industrial Canal, completed in 1923. Before Interstate 10 and the Seabrook Bridge were completed in the 1960s and 1970s, small draw bridges at Chef Menteur Highway, Gentilly Road and the Lake-Industrial Canal juncture were the only means of crossing the Industrial Canal north of Florida Avenue.|$|E
5000|$|The Controlled Coupling HydraMatic {{incorporated}} a secondary fluid coupling {{and a pair}} of sprag clutches in place of the former friction clutch and brake bands, shifting in part by alternately <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> the secondary coupling. It was a later version of GM's [...] "dual range Hydra-Matic", first introduced in some 1952 models. The dual range feature allowed the driver to hold the transmission in third gear until the maximum allowable upshift points, for improved performance in traffic or in mountain driving. The new, dual coupling transmission also {{incorporated a}} separate park position, falling in line with other automatic transmissions of the day.|$|E

50|$|Lying in the {{northwest}} corner of North Korea, Sindo borders the People's Republic of China to the north and west, and faces the Yellow Sea to the south; to the east, it looks across a narrow expanse of sea at Ryongch'ŏn. Much of the county's land has been reclaimed through <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling.</b> There are various islands offshore, although the Sindo archipelago has been joined to the land. The island of Pidansŏm is the westernmost point in Korea; it was formed by a 1958 reclamation project from several smaller islands. Other islands include Ssarisŏm, Kanŭnsŏm, and Munbakto. There are various alluvial plains and extensive reed fields.|$|E
5000|$|In 1913, the Squamish {{residents}} of the Kitsilano Reserve, on the False Creek sandbar, were forced to relocate. According to Maracle, the settlement was burned down following the forced evacuation. In 1916, the sandbar on which this settlement was located was built into Granville Island to create new industrial land. In 1917, the eastern basin of False Creek was infilled to create land for the Canadian Northern Railway's Pacific Central Station; transcontinental railway terminals such as this helped earn Vancouver the moniker of [...] "Terminal City". Talk of <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> the inlet to Granville Street continued into the 1950s, but that never occurred.|$|E
50|$|The {{ponds and}} lagoons are {{remnants}} of the tidal marsh and channel system which originally occupied the area between the Schuylkill and Delaware rivers. Diking, <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> of these marshes probably started with the first settlement of the area by the Swedes in the early 17th century, culminating in the installation of a tide gate designed to permit drainage from the park while minimizing inflow from the Delaware River.The Pennsylvania Audubon Society has designated the park as an Important Bird Area (IBA). Birds that have natural habitat to watch for in the park are shovelers, gadwall, wigeon, ring-necks, bufflehead, redhead, scaup, ruddys, pintail, pied-billed grebes, snow geese, Canada goose, and herons.|$|E
50|$|The rink is on a {{site that}} was {{formerly}} part of the pond on {{the southeast corner of}} Central Park which was <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> in.|$|R
50|$|After a {{few years}} of debate, in 1909, the three creeks were buried, and turned into sewers. Smalls Pond also became polluted, <b>and</b> was <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> in, in 1935.|$|R
50|$|On August 25, 2016, Disney {{announced}} that they would <b>drain</b> <b>and</b> <b>fill</b> in Upstream Plunge, the 330,000 gallon pool. There are no immediate plans to tear down {{any other part of}} the park.|$|R
5000|$|Prior {{to about}} 1850, much of Portland's {{development}} {{took place in}} the central portion of the Portland peninsula, whose western end was somewhat swampy. Most of the southwestern portion of the peninsula, between Danforth and Congress Streets, was owned by J.B. Brown, who in the mid-1850s built a large mansion house (called [...] "Bramhall"). The city had in 1836 acquired some land at the western escarpment, and established the Western Promenade, a public park, and the Western Cemetery had been established in the late 18th century. In the 1860s the city began to grow westward, and Brown platted out a road network and began selling off building lots, <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> the swampy areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{location}} of Lavinium {{has never been}} lost to historians nor does there {{appear to have been}} any significant break in its habitation. Today's settlement remains a walled village of medieval design, Pratica di Mare, in the comune of Pomezia. The latter is a city constructed in 1939 and settled according to a plan of Benito Mussolini, whose engineers completed the millennia-long task of <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> the marsh, now the Pontine fields. A brief strip of field separates the large and flourishing city from the village. One Roman gate allows entry into the narrow streets of the village past the Castello Borghese, originally a fortification, purchased along with the village in 1617 by Marcantonio Borghese. The castle and the village were periodically renovated. All that remains of the river that once partly surrounded the village is a small stream, the Fosso di Pratica.|$|E
50|$|Restoration and {{restoration}} ecologists intend to return wetlands to their natural trajectory by aiding {{directly with the}} natural processes of the ecosystem. These direct methods vary {{with respect to the}} degree of physical manipulation of the natural environment and each are associated with different levels of restoration. Restoration is needed after disturbance or perturbation of a wetland. Disturbances include exogenous factors such as flooding or drought. Other external damage may be anthropogenic disturbance caused by clear-cut harvesting of trees, oil and gas extraction, poorly defined infrastructure installation, over grazing of livestock, ill-considered recreational activities, alteration of wetlands including dredging, <b>draining,</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling,</b> and other negative human impacts. Disturbance puts different levels of stress on an environment depending on the type and duration of disturbance. There is no one way to restore a wetland and the level of restoration required will be based on the level of disturbance although, each method of restoration does require preparation and administration.|$|E
5000|$|For a {{short while}} this dam at Hunter's Bar became Endcliffe Bathing Pool. It was closed at the {{outbreak}} of World War II. Some 20 years later it was <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> in.|$|R
25|$|After {{repeated}} collapses, Lapal Tunnel {{was abandoned}} in June 1917 leaving a short stretch navigable between Selly Oak and a brick works at California until 1953, after {{which it was}} <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>filled</b> in.|$|R

5000|$|Saline Wetlands Conservation Partnership (SWCP) is a {{conservation}} program {{devoted to the}} protection and preservation of Nebraska’s Eastern Saline Wetlands. The Eastern Saline Wetlands of Lancaster and Saunders counties Nebraska {{are among the most}} unusual and threatened wetland communities in the state. Limited to the floodplain swales and depressions within the Salt Creek, Little Salt Creek, and Rock Creek drainages, it’s estimated that the Eastern Saline Wetlands once covered an area in excess of 200000 acre. Today, due to extensive degradation, <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> through commercial, residential, and agricultural development, less than 4000 acre remain, and many of these remnants are highly degraded. Now more than ever it’s become increasingly important to preserve what remains of this unique wetland resource. Although several existing programs have been recognized to address saline wetland conservation needs, they alone have not been enough to ensure the long term protection of this endangered resource. Thus, the Saline Wetland Conservation Partnership (SWCP) was created to offer additional protection and management of the state’s diminishing saline wetlands.|$|E
50|$|In February 1863 {{the monitor}} office offered {{contracts}} for twenty {{of the new}} Casco-class monitors, {{in spite of the}} fact that the original architect, Ericsson, had not approved the new design. Winning bidders included prominent firms like Reaney, Son & Archbold in Chester, Pennsylvania, Wilcox & Whitney at Camden, Harlan & Hollingsworth in Wilmington, Delaware and Merrick & Sons of Philadelphia (the latter of whom subcontracted much of the work to William Cramp & Sons). A number of smaller firms were also contracted. The cost was estimated at $395,000 per ship, or approximately $8 million in total. Some shipyards, such as Cramp, were forced to substantially upgrade their ironworking facilities for the production of the new vessels.By the end of 1863, frequent design changes were causing growing problems for the contractors. Stimers and his team of thirty draftsmen at the monitor office continued to submit changes even as the vessels were in the process of production, leading to long delays. One yard in Boston received a total of 83 drawings and 120 letters of explanation from Stimers, and the specification manual for the ships grew to 92 pages of small print. The final design called for a total of thirteen auxiliary engines and pumps per ship, fancy brasswork in place of cast iron, and a complex system of pipes for <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> the water tanks. The added weight to a ship designed with only a 15 in freeboard at the outset raised questions about the ships' eventual seaworthiness.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe venous {{circulation}} {{in the lower}} limb is mainly controlled by the muscular action of the calf. To study the mechanisms governing the venous <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> process in such a situation, an experimental setup, composed by a collapsible tube under external pressure, has been built. A valve preventing back flows is inserted {{at the bottom of}} the tube and allows to model two different configurations: physiological when the fluid flow is uni-directional and pathological when the fluid flows in both directions. Pressure and flow rate measurements are carried out at the inlet and outlet of the tube and an original optical device with three cameras is proposed to measure the instantaneous cross-sectional area. The experimental results (<b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> with physiological or pathological valves) are confronted to a simple one-dimensional numerical model which completes the physical interpretation. One major observation is that the muscular contraction induces a fast emptying phase followed by a slow one controlled by viscous effects, and that a defect of the valve decreases, as expected, the ejected volume...|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{interlocks}} {{are built}} into the controls {{to make sure that}} no component can be moved while another is in an incorrect state—for example, opening the <b>drain</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> the valves of a lock chamber simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|As {{the volume}} of water {{decreased}} from the glacier melting northward, the lake slowly <b>drained</b> <b>and</b> <b>filled.</b> Not being able to cut a channel through the limestone ridge in Momence, the Kankakee Lake became 500000 acre of marshland.|$|R

40|$|A {{panoramic}} lack {{of conservation}} education {{has produced a}} populace largely unaware {{of the value of}} marshland resources or measures for their protection. In a relentless era of ecological abuse, wetlands and salt marshes rank with endangered animal species in the quantitative loss culminating in extinction. Challenged continually by the relentless sea and exploited by unsound attempts at development, management, or even conservation, the efficiency of the marshlands is decreasing with each successive invasion. There is a demonstrated reduction in biological productivity, flood control, and water quality in areas where dredging, <b>draining,</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> of marshes has taken place...|$|E
30|$|Since the 1980 s, China’s land {{reclamation}} efforts have made considerable progress in restoring subsided land with different methods, and the engineering technology system of ecological restoration of mining subsidence land has been implemented. The current technology includes digging deep to fill shallow with hydraulic dredge pumps, {{land reclamation}} technology using towed scraper, land leveling, dredging and <b>draining,</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> reclamation with coal wastes or fly ash or lake sludge, {{and so on}} (Hu et al. 2013; 2008). However, current reclamation methods do not solve {{the conflict between the}} large population and land shortage. The recovery percentage of cultivated land with the technology of digging deep to fill shallow is too low, and the shortage and potential contamination of the materials of filling reclamation method is too serious.|$|E
40|$|Changes in {{wetlands}} in {{the vicinity}} of the Phelps and £ 65 canals operated by Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District in South-central Nebraska were examined using aerial photographs taken on seven occasions from 1938 to 1981. According to previous research, nearly 90 % of the original wetlands within the surrounding Rainwater Basin were destroyed or altered by <b>draining</b> <b>and</b> <b>filling</b> between 1900 and 1980. Within a zone extending 10 kilometers on each side of the Phelps and £ 65 canals, however, we observed an increase in the number and total area of wetlands, which we hypothesize to have been caused by an elevated groundwater table. Of additional importance for wildlife management, there was a notable decrease in wetlands temporarily flooded for 2 months or less, and a notable increase in wetlands seasonally flooded for 3 to 5 months each year. These changes were most conspicuous after 1969...|$|E
50|$|On 30 April 1738 castle {{was heavily}} damaged in an earthquake. It was {{immediately}} rebuilt and redesigned in baroque style, {{and it was}} given its present-day look.
