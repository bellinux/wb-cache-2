While Burns enjoyed the {{educational}} field, she generally found {{the experience to}} be frustrating and wanted to continue her own studies. In 1906, at age twenty-seven, she moved to Germany to resume her studies in language. In Germany, Burns studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin from 1906 to 1909. Burns later moved to the United Kingdom, where she enrolled at Oxford University to study English. Burns was <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a very extensive educational background because her father, Edwards Burns, supported her and financed her international education.|$|E

He founded the Municipal Light and Power Company, and though political opposition kept him from expanding it, the next Progressive mayor, Newton D. Baker, built a new plant that opened in 1914 as the biggest public utility in the U.S. 'Muny Light' (now Cleveland Public Power) brought important savings on the city's own electric bills, and those of residents <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> access to the service, while it forced the private competitor to keep its own rates low.|$|E
25|$|To {{work with}} the PFs, III MAF instituted the {{combined}} action platoon (CAP), consisting of a 13-man Marine rifle squad (if you were <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 13) augmented by a U.S. Navy Corpsman and paired with a 15- to 30-man PF platoon to defend one particular village (The PF was roughly equivalent to the US National Guard, but with less training and poorer equipment). Each element of the team strengthened the other. The Marines contributed firepower, training, and access to American medical evacuation, artillery and air support. CAPs were generally commanded by a Marine sergeant, but were sometimes commanded by corporals. Patrols were often led by lance-corporals. In some cases such as CAP 1-4-1 in 1969 they were commanded by Lance Corporals.|$|E

25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As we all know, Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} trade publications. The Moving Picture World review said.

The Rip of Jefferson and the Rip of Irving are two different versions, though both do substantially the same things. ... It is a good piece of work from every standpoint. The actors have entered into the spirit of the story and have depicted it with close adherence to the facts as they are related in the original. The stage manager understood what was required to make the background appear natural, while the photographer handled the camera with full knowledge of the requirements." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer also agreed and commended the film by stating, [...] "The Thanhouser Company has done very well with this old legend, paying particular attention to details. ...

500|$|The next day, McClellan {{began his}} attack with several {{advances}} by the Union right flank, {{far from the}} position of the 21st. For much of the day, the IX Corps could hear the fighting and awaited orders to take the bridge in their front. The 21st even was <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a mail call that morning, and the men sat down to read letters from home while fighting raged around the Dunker Church two miles (3km) away. Finally, orders came at noon and Ferrero's brigade was moved closer to the bridge. It was a difficult target. On the opposite bank, a wooded bluff rose [...] above the creek. Concealed there was a small force of 400 Confederates who would successfully hold thousands of Union troops at bay for hours. The men of the 21st watched several successive charges on the bridge by brigades of the IX Corps, all of which were repulsed. Finally, Ferrero's brigade was ordered forward. Reaching the bridge at a run, the 21st was ordered to take up a position next to the left abutment, supplying covering fire, while the 51st New York Infantry and the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry finally carried the position. As the Confederates retreated, Ferrero's brigade was soon stationed {{at the top of the}} bluff. Later in the afternoon, around sunset, a Confederate counterattack nearly drove the IX Corps back across Antietam Creek. Ferrero's brigade held the bluff, however, playing a key role in checking the counterattack, and taking severe casualties in the process. The 21st listed 10 killed and 35 wounded, casualties of 30 percent.|$|E
30|$|The {{costs of}} job {{displacement}} have received considerable attention from {{policy makers and}} researchers in previous decades. The recent recession and the resulting dramatic increase in involuntary job losses have increased interest in this issue. Millions of prime-age workers have been displaced, and those <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> find employment <b>have</b> often suffered substantial reductions in earnings. Studies of the U.S. labor force have indicated that displaced workers suffer a large and persistent loss of earnings (for example, Ruhm 1991; Jacobson et al. 1993; Kletzer and Fairlie 2003). Ruhm (1991) found that the weekly earnings of displaced workers were 16  % {{lower than those of}} non-displaced workers 1 year following the displacement. Four years after displacement, their earnings remained 14  % below their former earnings. Given the large and ongoing losses suffered by displaced workers, it is important to determine the factors affecting the magnitude of earnings losses associated with displacement.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the use of}} stochastic models for analysing service-oriented systems. We propose an iterative hybrid approach using system measurements, testbed observations as well as formal models to derive a quantitative model of service-based systems {{that allows us to}} evaluate the effectiveness of the restart method in such systems. In cases where one is <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> as <b>to</b> <b>have</b> access <b>to</b> a real system for measurements the obtained data often is lacking statistical significance or knowledge of the system is not sufficient to explain the data. A testbed may then be preferable as it allows for long experiment series and provides full control of the system's configuration. In order to provide meaningful data the testbed must be equipped with fault-injection using a suitable fault-model and an appropriate load model. We fit phase-type distributions to the data obtained from the testbed in order to represent the observed data in a model that can be used e. g. as a service process in a queueing model of our service-oriented system. The queueing model may be used to analyse different restart policies, buffer size or service disciplines. Results from the model can be fed into the testbed and provide it with better fault and load models thus closing the modelling loop...|$|R
40|$|Postpartum urinary {{retention}} occurs in 10 - 15 % {{of women and}} is likely to be multifactorial in origin. Long labour, epidural analgesia, instrumental delivery, nulliparity, significant vaginal and perineal laceration or a previous history of voiding difficulty are risk factors for altered voiding parameters. Previous literatures have defined two types of {{urinary retention}}, first, overt retention and the other covert variety. Overt variety represents the acute retention while covert variety is of subacute in nature. Being subacute in nature, it damages the detrusors slowly. Sometimes the damage is so much so that it may take substantial time to recover or may not recover at all and the patient may have lifelong detrusor hypotonia with persistent urinary retention, requiring lifelong intermittent self-catheterization. This badly affects her personal as well as social wellbeing and also poses her for recurrent urinary tract infection.

50|$|Following the {{invitation}} of Robert Thornton, in 2001 Bošković moved to the University of the Witwatersrand (Johannesburg, South Africa) on the Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship. There he taught courses on religion, myth, and ethnicity. While in Johannesburg, he was <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> meet (and <b>have</b> opportunity <b>to</b> discuss anthropology with) W.D. Hammond-Tooke (1926-2004), {{the last of the}} great 20th century South African anthropologists. In 2003, Bošković was hired as Senior lecturer at the Department of Anthropology of Rhodes University, a department that Hammond-Tooke helped establish during the 1960s. At Rhodes, Bošković further developed his interests in the history and theory of anthropology. This Department provided a brilliant academic setting, with Chris de Wet, Robin Palmer, Penny Bernard, among others. Furthermore, his interest in history and theory of anthropology resulted in publication of several books. His book Myth, Politics, Ideology was published in late 2006 in Belgrade, and it covered different theoretical aspects of the study of myths, understood (in Raymond Aron's sense) as part of ideology. The book also included several chapters on different aspects of Mesoamerican religions - some in revised versions from their original publications, and some previously unpublished. This also coincided with Bošković's interest in the study of ethnicity and nationalism, and his overall view that multiculturalism is an essential component of all human societies. Some of these aspects were discussed while he was a guest at the University of Oslo in 2007, following {{the invitation}} of a friend and colleague, Thomas Hylland Eriksen.|$|R
60|$|The {{first of}} these {{objections}} {{would go to the}} root of the matter were it well founded; for if no happiness is <b>to</b> be <b>had</b> at all by human beings, the attainment of it cannot be the end of morality, or of any rational conduct. Though, even in that case, something might still be said for the utilitarian theory; since utility includes not solely the pursuit of happiness, but the prevention or mitigation of unhappiness; and if the former aim be chimerical, there will be all the greater scope and more imperative need for the latter, so long at least as mankind think fit to live, and do not take refuge in the simultaneous act of suicide recommended under certain conditions by Novalis. When, however, it is thus positively asserted to be impossible that human life should be happy, the assertion, if not something like a verbal quibble, is at least an exaggeration. If by happiness be meant a continuity of highly pleasurable excitement, it is evident enough that this is impossible. A state of exalted pleasure lasts only moments, or in some cases, and with some intermissions, hours or days, and is the occasional brilliant flash of enjoyment, not its permanent and steady flame. Of this the philosophers who have taught that happiness is the end of life were as fully aware as those who taunt them. The happiness which they meant was not a life of rapture, but moments of such, in an existence made up of few and transitory pains, many and various pleasures, with a decided predominance of the active over the passive, and having as the foundation of the whole, not to expect more from life than it is capable of bestowing. A life thus composed, <b>to</b> those who <b>have</b> been <b>fortunate</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> obtain it, <b>has</b> always appeared worthy of the name of happiness. And such an existence is even now the lot of many, during some considerable portion of their lives. The present wretched education, and wretched social arrangements, are the only real hindrance to its being attainable by almost all.|$|R

Lees took Farran and his men to meet the commander of the local Comando Unico, which was formed of four brigades – three Communist and one Christian Democrat. When they arrived, Farran proposed to the Unico that a new battalion known as the Battaglione Alleato be created, with its core an SAS company; it would be fleshed out by a company of right-wing partisans and another of Russian deserters from the Wehrmacht. Although this was agreed to, Farran was not enamoured with the state of the partisans when he first inspected them, stating that [...] "nearly all of them had some physical defect."
