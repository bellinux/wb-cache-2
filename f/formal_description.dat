Rasmussen noted that the Togian white-eye is distinctive not only in its appearance, but also in its lilting song, which sounds higher pitched and is less varied in frequency than the songs of its close relatives.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{published}} a <b>formal</b> <b>description</b> and {{name for the}} species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not designate a type specimen (a specimen to {{be representative of the}} species) for the species, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), in reference to the shape of its infructescences.|$|E

5|$|The taxon Laevistrombus was {{introduced}} in the literature as a subgenus of Strombus by Tetsuaki Kira (1955) in the third printing of the 1st edition of Coloured Illustrations of the Shells of Japan. It comprised two species, Strombus (Laevistrombus) canarium and Strombus (L.) isabella Lamarck, 1822. No type specimen was designated, and Kira gave no <b>formal</b> <b>description</b> or statement of differentiation, as required by the ICZN code to validate the name. In a later version of the book, Laevistrombus was elevated to genus level, but a description was still lacking. Rüdiger Bieler and Richard Petit (1996) considered it a nomen nudum, and the authorship was transferred to Robert Tucker Abbott (1960), who had provided a proper description and illustrations of Laevistrombus and specified a type species, Strombus canarium L., in the first volume of his monograph Indo-Pacific Mollusca. The currently accepted combination, Laevistrombus canarium, was proposed by Jack John Sepkoski Jr. (2002), who elevated Laevistrombus to genus level based on palaeontological data.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the first}} <b>formal</b> <b>description</b> is {{attributed}} to Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in 1694, by convention, the first valid <b>formal</b> <b>description</b> is by Linnaeus, in his Species Plantarum (1753),. Therefore the botanical authority is given as Tourn. ex L.. Linnaeus identified five known species of Fritillaria, and grouped them in his Hexandria Monogynia (six stamens+one pistil), his system being based on sexual characteristics. These characteristics defined the core group of the Liliaceae family for a long time. Linnaeus' original species were F. imperialis, F. regia (now Eucomis regia), F. persica, F. pyrenaica and F. meleagris. The Liliaceae family was first described by Michel Adanson in 1763, placing Fritillaria in section Lilia of that family, but also considering Imperialis as a separate genus to Fritillaria, together with five other genera. The <b>formal</b> <b>description</b> of the family {{is attributed to}} Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789, who included eight genera, including Imperialis, in his Lilia.|$|E

40|$|Cognitive {{appraisal}} theories (CATs) explain human emotions as {{a result}} of the subjective evaluation of events that occur in the environment. Recently, arguments have been put forward that discuss the need for <b>formal</b> <b>descriptions</b> in order to further advance the field of cognitive appraisal theory. <b>Formal</b> <b>descriptions</b> can provide detailed predictions and help to integrate different CATs by providing clear identification of the differences and similarities between theories. A computational model of emotion that is based on a CAT also needs <b>formal</b> <b>descriptions</b> specifying the theory on which it is based. In this paper we propose a formal notation for the declarative semantics of the structure of appraisal. We claim that this formalism facilitates both integration of appraisal theories as well as the design and evaluation of computational models of emotion based on an appraisal theory. To support these claims we show how our formalism can be used in both ways: first we integrate two appraisal theories; second, we use this formal integrated model as basis for a computational model after identifying what declarative information is missing in the formal model. Finally, we embed the computational model in an emotional agent, and show how the formal specification helps to evaluate the computational model...|$|R
