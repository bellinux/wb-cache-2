40|$|The cutting {{performance}} of <b>indexable</b> <b>insert</b> drill that has non-axisymmetrical geometry for drilling of difficult-to-cut materials is investigated. A twisted drill {{is also used}} to compare the cutting performance. The cutting characteristics are evaluated by tool flank temperature at peripheral corner edge θα, thrust force Ft, chip geometry and surface roughness Ra. The temperature of cutting tool is measured using a two-color pyrometer with an optical fiber. As work materials, the carbon steel, stainless steel, titanium alloy and nickel-base alloy are used. The θα and Ft of <b>indexable</b> <b>insert</b> drill are lower than that of solid drill in cutting of titanium alloy and nickel-base alloy. In the case of titanium alloy, the Ft of <b>indexable</b> <b>insert</b> drill is only 40 % in the case of solid drill. On the other hand, this tendency reversed for stainless steel, and θα and Ft of <b>indexable</b> <b>insert</b> drill become higher than that of solid drill. The chip geometry by <b>indexable</b> <b>insert</b> drill is divided into parts in fragments so that there is chip breaker on the rake face of insert while the chip geometry by solid drill is continuous and long. The difference of surface roughness by the <b>indexable</b> <b>insert</b> drill and solid drill is negligible in the cutting of difficult-to-cut materials...|$|R

50|$|Almost all {{high-performance}} {{cutting tools}} use <b>indexable</b> <b>inserts.</b> There {{are several reasons}} for this. First of all, at the very high cutting speeds and feeds supported by these materials, the cutting tip can reach temperatures high enough to melt the brazing material holding it to the shank. Economics are also important; inserts are made symmetrically {{so that when the}} first cutting edge is dull they can be rotated, presenting a fresh cutting edge. Some inserts are even made {{so that they can be}} flipped over, giving as many as 16 cutting edges per insert. There are many types of inserts: some for roughing, some for finishing. Others are made for specialized jobs like cutting threads or grooves. The industry employs standardized nomenclature to describe inserts by shape, material, coating material, and size.|$|E
