Riina and Bagarella felt betrayed by political allies in Rome, who had promised to help pass laws to ease prison conditions and reduce sentences for its jailed members in exchange for Mafia support at the polls. The SISDE report says they believed that hits on {{either of the two}} embattled members of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, each under separate criminal indictments, would have been less likely to provoke the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> outrage and police crackdown that followed the 1992 murders of the widely admired Sicilian prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.|$|E

In other cases, female trends in one country may be indicators of associated changes in others, {{as in the case of}} a rising number of female Lineage players in Korea having led to increased number of female Lineage players in Taiwan. In Japan the rise of cute culture and its associated marketing has made gaming accessible for girls, and this trend has also carried over to Taiwan and recently China (both countries previously having focused mostly on MMOs and where parents usually place harsher restrictions on daughters than on sons).|$|E

In the June 2010 Republican primary, attorney Matthew Berry narrowly lost to retired U.S. Army Colonel J. Patrick Murray, after a last-minute mailing attacking Berry's homosexuality. Fisher again was on the ballot. During the campaign, Moran was criticized by military advocacy groups and conservatives for saying, at a local Democratic committee meeting, that Murray had not [...] "served or performed any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>public</b> service". Moran responded by commending Murray's military service, while saying that he used the phrase in relation to Murray not having engaged in [...] "local civic engagement" [...] and not having served in local office. In November 2010, Moran was re-elected to an eleventh term with 61% of the vote.|$|E
500|$|According to Chris Cowley, Brady regretted Hindley's {{imprisonment}} and {{the consequences}} of their actions, but not necessarily the crimes themselves.

Twenty years of transcribing classical texts into Braille came to an end when the authorities confiscated his translation machine, for fear it might be used as a weapon. He once offered to donate one of his kidneys to [...] "someone, anyone who needed one", but was blocked from doing so. According to Colin Wilson, [...] "it was because these attempts to express remorse were thrown back at him that he began to contemplate suicide". He might have achieved this in 2006, when a female friend sent him 50paracetamol pills, stored in two Smarties tubes hidden inside a hollowed-out crime novel.

The Special Representative and head of the newly created United Nations Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA), Abou Moussa, said that international interest in Kony was [...] "useful, very important". The White House released a statement of support through Press Secretary Jay Carney, who stated in a news conference, [...] "We congratulate {{the hundreds of thousands of}} Americans who have mobilized to this unique crisis of conscience" [...] and said that the raised awareness from the video is [...] "consistent with the bipartisan legislation passed by our congress in 2010."

2500|$|The {{defeat of}} the Second Spanish Republic in the Spanish Civil War brought ultraconservative {{dictator}} Francisco Franco to power.

[...] Franco's regime banned the use of Catalan in government-run institutions and during public events, and also the Catalan institutions of self-government were abolished.
