5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries their <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, {{there have been}} concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the {{threat to national security}} because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Sherman paid greater {{attention}} to foreign affairs {{during the second half}} of his Senate career, serving as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. In 1868, the Senate had ratified the Burlingame Treaty with China, allowing unrestricted immigration from China. After the Panic of 1873, Chinese immigrants were blamed for depressing wages; in reaction, Congress in 1879 passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, but Hayes vetoed it. Now, three years later, after China had agreed to treaty revisions, Congress tried again to exclude Chinese immigrants: Senator John F. Miller of California introduced another Exclusion Act that denied Chinese immigrants United States citizenship and banned their immigration for a twenty-year period. Sherman opposed both the 1880 treaty revisions and the bill Miller proposed, believing that the Exclusion Act reversed the United States' traditional welcoming of all people and the country's <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> <b>foreign</b> immigration for growth. President Arthur vetoed the bill, and Sherman voted to sustain the veto. A new Exclusion Act passed to conform to Arthur's objections. Sherman voted against this bill, too, but it passed, and Arthur signed it into law. In 1885, Sherman voted in favor of the Alien Contract Labor Law, which barred engaging in a labor contract before immigrating or transporting a person under such a contract to the United States. Sherman saw this Act as a more appropriate solution to depressed wages than Chinese exclusion: the problem, as he saw it, was not the national origin of Chinese immigrants, but their employment under serf-like conditions.|$|E

Our results are threefold. First, FDI convergence is more pronounced compared to the Central region, whereas the dispersion is greater when the Coastal and the Western regions are taken as reference points.

40|$|Declining {{fertility}} and increasing life expectancy {{put pressure on}} the financing of social security in developed countries. Economists and policy makers have considered options to address this financing challenge, most of which contain reforms of the pension system. No pension reform appears unambiguously superior: reforms typically fare good in some dimensions, but not all. Because of trade-offs, evaluation criteria {{play a major role in}} the selection of the preferred policy reform. Typically, analysts consider financial sustainability of the system, evolution of output per capita and minimum income in old age. In this paper we add one criterion, current account imbalances. Using an overlapping-generations model calibrated for Austria with a multi-pillar pension system and an aging population, we compare pension reforms with pay-as-you-go financing and capital-funded financing. In contrast to a number of previous studies, the capital-funded pillar in our model contains both a tax component and insurance against the longevity risk, both realistic. Neglecting current accounts, we find that increases in retirement age with the current pay-as-you-go pension system achieve a good balance between output maintenance, pension finance sustainability and old-age anti-poverty, consistent with previous studies. Such arrangements however increase the <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> net <b>foreign</b> assets, as the need to save for consumption after retirement is reduced. Adding a capital-funded pillar to the pension system helps achieve (and in some cases improve on) the same goals without increasing the <b>dependence</b> <b>on</b> net <b>foreign</b> assets, over the long run. Savings placed in the pension funds are indeed available for domestic investment. As in previous studies, there are however transitional costs...|$|R
