In many species, it appears that although the basic song is the same for all members of the species, young birds learn some details of their songs from their fathers, and these variations build up over generations to form dialects.|$|E

50|$|Many tricks {{done with}} thrown cards are {{designed}} to not only impress with the magician's dexterity, but work on a common theme in stage magic: the illusion of danger. While the illusion of danger {{can be achieved by}} outright deception, another method is to play on people's popular misconceptions. In the case of card throwing, the magician achieves this effect by throwing the card at fragile targets such as newspaper, cigarettes, fruit, hot dogs, foam, or any other substance that the card will easily <b>imbed</b> in or break. While none of these objects act like human tissue in terms of wound ballistics, the magician is counting on most audience members thinking they actually are comparable, and therefore believing he or she has turned a harmless playing card into a deadly projectile.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the challenges of}} prediction and integration of the benign human with control systems, the abilities of the malicious actor (or hacker) to undermine desired control system behavior also create a significant challenge to control system resilience. Application of dynamic probabilistic risk analysis used in human reliability can provide some basis for the benign actor. However, the decidedly malicious intentions of an adversarial individual, organization or nation make the modeling of the human variable in both objectives and motives. However, in defining a control system response to such intentions, the malicious actor looks forward to some level of recognized behavior to gain an advantage and provide a pathway to undermining the system. Whether performed separately in preparation for a cyber attack, or on the system itself, these behaviors can provide opportunity for a successful attack without detection. Therefore, in considering resilient control system architecture, atypical designs that <b>imbed</b> active and passively implemented randomization of attributes, would be suggested to reduce this advantage.|$|E

50|$|For most white Americans, {{the white}} racial frame is deeply held and extensive, with many stored aspects or “bits,” {{including}} stereotyped knowledge, racial understandings, and racial interpretations. In this sense, “bits” are pieces of cultural {{information that is}} collectively derived and passed along from one person and group to the next, and {{from one generation to}} the next. Specific bits of the white racial frame began to develop as early as the 1607 with the introduction of north Europeans, by means of invasion of North America, to Native Americans and, soon, Africans. In everyday practices, there are multiple variations of the frame and it is not always used in the same way by whites. But, by constantly using selected bits of the dominant white racial frame to interpret society, by integrating new items into it, and by applying learned stereotypes, images, and interpretations in discriminatory actions, whites <b>imbed</b> their racialized frame deeply in their minds.

5000|$|Grazing {{also helps}} to promote the growth of native plants and grasses. Often, these {{indigenous}} plants {{are not able to}} compete with the surrounding plants that utilize the majority of water and nutrients. By livestock grazing, the non-native grasses are controlled and the native plants can redevelop. As well as using grazing to increase plant growth, the actual hoof action of the livestock also promotes growth. The trampling helps to <b>imbed</b> the seeds into the soil so that the plants and grasses can continue to germinate.Additionally, management in many parks makes use of grazing to help lower fire hazards by reducing the amount of potential fuel, such as large buildups of forage. When the land is not grazed, dead grasses accumulate. These dead grasses are often a large fire hazard in the summer months. On the other hand, grazing can also allow for [...] "accumulation of litter (horizontal residue)" [...] helping to eliminate soil erosion.

5000|$|One {{critique}} here, is {{that model}} outputs, i.e. line items, often incorporate “unrealistic implicit assumptions” and “internal inconsistencies”.
