25|$|The Ājīvika {{school is}} known for its Niyati ("Fate") {{doctrine}} of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvikas considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an ātman – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of reasons that {{periphery}} countries remain the way they are. One important factor that keeps countries in the periphery is the lack of development of technology. Another way periphery countries come to be is either the lack of a central government or the periphery country is under the control of another country. Periphery countries are known for exporting raw goods to core countries. What tends to <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> the maximum gain a periphery nation could earn is less than needed to maintain an equilibrium between costs and revenues. One thing periphery nations could do is to stop the increase of exports. At the beginning of the 19th century, Asia and Africa were considered periphery and their lack of development enabled the United States and Germany to remain successful core nations.|$|E
25|$|Sue grows {{disillusioned with}} cheerleading, {{and in an}} effort to {{recapture}} her love for it, plans to fire cheerleader Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) from a cannon during the team's next competitive routine. Brittany and her friends Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) ultimately quit the squad, which loses at Regionals after having won the national title for six straight years. Sue is named Loser of the Year in a televised interview with Katie Couric, and has her budget slashed.

Sue is furious when her club loses to New Directions, and punches the announcer in the face.|$|E

When the [...] "usually level-headed" [...] hunter must use a wheelchair in the fifth season, he becomes [...] "frustrated and angry"; instead of being able to join the battles, he is [...] "stuck at home manning the telephones". This feeling of uselessness eventually leads to thoughts of suicide, though he deems himself too much of a coward to go through with it. On the situation, Beaver commented, [...] "Bobby lives in a world where all kinds of strange things are possible. Somewhere along the line, he has a hope that one of these strange, miraculous things might happen to him. I think he is also a realist.

500|$|In college {{football}} and the NFL, a conversion safety {{could also be}} scored by the defense. To accomplish this, the kicking team would have to retreat {{all the way back}} to their own end zone. [...] This is wildly implausible; it has been hypothesized that, perhaps, such a scenario would involve a turnover on a two-point conversion attempt followed by a lost fumble before the defensive player reaches the end zone, with the ball finally being downed by the offense in its own end zone; the other plausible scenario in which this could <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> if the snap on an extra point kick attempt is wildly errant and the kicking team repeatedly bats the ball toward their end zone to avoid the other team recovering and returning it (while not being able to recover it themselves or bat the ball out of bounds). While such a conversion safety has never been scored by the defense, it is the only possible way in which a team could finish with a single point in an American football game.|$|E
500|$|Suzuki {{did not use}} storyboards and disliked pre-planning. He {{preferred}} {{to come up with}} ideas either the night before or on the set as he felt that the only person who should know what is going to <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> the director. He also felt that it was sudden inspiration that made the picture. An example is the addition of the Number Three Killer's rice-sniffing habit. Suzuki explained that he wanted to present a quintessentially [...] "Japanese" [...] killer, [...] "If he were Italian, he'd get turned on by macaroni, right?" [...] Suzuki has commended Shishido on his similar drive to make the action scenes as physical and interesting as possible. In directing his actors, Suzuki let them play their roles as they saw fit and only intervened when they went [...] "off track". For nude scenes the actors wore maebari, or adhesive strips, over their genitals in accordance with censorship practices. The film was edited in one day, a task made easy by Suzuki's method of shooting only the necessary footage. He had picked up the habit during his years working as an assistant director for Shochiku when film stock remained sparse after the war. Post-production was completed on June 14, 1967, the day before the film was released.|$|E

Of Dylan's storyline and involvement in the love triangle, Phelps said: [...] "Dylan does come to town to find Avery but this story has much more complexity than that [...] What {{you think is going to}} <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> not what's going to happen." [...] She noted that Avery was the [...] "great love of his life", though she may not have [...] "the same feelings for him." [...] Avery believed that Dylan died during war; TVLine commented that [...] "such a resurrection" [...] would [...] "surely" [...] derail her romance with Nick. During an interview with MSN, Burton said, [...] "Nick and Dylan will definitely fight for her, but ultimately, it's going to be her choice." [...] Dylan and Avery had an affair while she was still married to her ex-husband, but still had a [...] "great relationship", which was shown through flashbacks. Dylan's primary goal in coming to Genoa City was to make sure she was happy, and if she wanted to get back together. Burton said that Dylan can't get Avery off his mind despite the fact that she had moved on.|$|E
500|$|Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said Chris' {{habit of}} {{pointing}} {{directly into the}} faces of people he meets and repeating their names {{was one of the}} first elements of his character that the writing staff conceived. Chris' desire to live 150 years was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had read an article which stated that scientists believe the first human who will live 150 years has already been born, and felt it applied to the Chris Traeger character. Lowe's first day of filming on the series was his birthday (March 17, 2010), which was the day his kiss scene with Rashida Jones in [...] "The Master Plan" [...] was shot. Lowe said he loved his character's [...] "unrelenting enthusiasm" [...] and the fact that he is not a romantic lead, but rather a [...] "big, fat nerd". Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler said of Chris Traeger: [...] "It's a really fun character to play against because what you’ll see start to <b>happen</b> <b>is</b> Chris doesn’t want to deliver any bad news, but he’s actually like the Bad News Bear." [...] Like much of the rest of the cast, Lowe occasionally improvises lines and actions for his character that are not included in the script. The writers hoped to use Ann Perkins' breakup with Chris, and the drastic changes in her behavior afterward, as a way of tapping into more comedic potential of her character rather than having her fill the role of straight man as she had in the past. Schur said: [...] "Ann is a very intelligent and attractive woman, and it's hard to knock someone like that off balance. And the way to knock that person off balance is to get Rob Lowe in a relationship with you." ...|$|E
