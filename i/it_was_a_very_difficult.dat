500|$|Acknowledging the album's lack of {{commercial}} success, Dixon {{said she would}} always prefer to [...] "take a chance creatively" [...] than release what she perceived to be stultifying records. She commented: [...] "I knew the single 'Drummer Boy' was a risk. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> record and so far removed from anything I'd done before. I get that... I take full responsibility for that, but I'm glad I did it. I'd rather make a unique record like 'Drummer Boy' and have it fail than play it safe and release bland, generic music that doesn't excite me." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{their stay}} in Cleveland during the tour, Gabriel told the band {{he would leave}} at its conclusion. He wrote a {{statement}} regarding his departure to the English press that was published in August 1975 titled [...] "Out, Angels Out", explaining he had become disillusioned with the music industry and wanted to spend extended time with his family. Banks later stated, [...] "Pete was also getting {{too big for the}} group. He was being portrayed as if he was 'the man' and it really wasn't like that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> thing to accommodate.

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Sapochnik was also asked {{about how he}} went about {{creating}} a sense of emotion in the 'King in the North' scene, saying [...] "It wasn't hard. I think as fans we'd been waiting for it for so long. That said, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> scene to shoot. Mainly because it was unusually hot over the two days we shot it, everyone was wearing heavy furs and armor, Kit was actually pretty ill and everyone was crammed into this space full of plates of sheep's tongues and chicken carcasses so it got quite smelly and sticky. It's also quite a long scene and yet Bella did it probably {{more than a hundred}} times, only forgetting a line once in the entire time. When we finished the scene she got a standing ovation from all the cast and crew." ...|$|E
500|$|Franco {{developed}} an aptitude for art—painting in particular—during {{his high school}} years while attending the California State Summer School for the Arts (CSSSA). Franco has said painting was the [...] "outlet" [...] he needed in high school, and he [...] "has actually been painting longer than he has been acting". His paintings were displayed publicly {{for the first time}} at the Glü Gallery in Los Angeles, from January 7, through February 11, 2006. He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin. He enjoys reading on the set of his films. Pineapple Express producer Judd Apatow has said of him: [...] "He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading The Iliad on set. We still haven't read The Iliad. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> book. With him, it was always James Joyce or something".|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one {{there is not much}} you can do. I was lucky to keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E

[...] Green told the crowd [...] "To be honest, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> fight because ... it's hard to explain – some nights you fight some nights you don't. And I'm {{not going to take}} {{anything}} away from Choc. I'm not going to say he did this and that, and I didn't do this. Simple as that: I was beaten on the night by a better man tonight." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{war years}} were {{difficult}} for the couple. After the United States entered the war, Pound and his wife Dorothy became enemy aliens in Italy, an ironic situation in light of Pound's support of Mussolini. Their home in Rapallo was sequestered in 1943 and the couple {{had little choice but}} to move in with Rudge. Thus the ménage à trois for so long a matter of public speculation became a reality. Rudge sent her daughter back to Gais to live with her original peasant guardians, and was forced by necessity to support the Pounds and her daughter by giving language lessons. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> time for the trio: while both women adored Pound, they hated each other. Pound's wife later wrote that [...] "hatred and tension permeated the house".|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Keys {{won three}} NAACP Image Awards, {{including}} Outstanding Female Artist and Outstanding Song for [...] "Unbreakable". She also received the Starlight Award by the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In October 2006, {{she played the}} voice of Mommy Martian in the [...] "Mission to Mars" [...] episode of the children's television series The Backyardigans, in which she sang an original song, [...] "Almost Everything Is Boinga Here". That same year, Keys nearly suffered a mental breakdown. Her grandmother had died and her family was heavily dependent on her. She felt she needed to [...] "escape" [...] and went to Egypt for three weeks. She explained: [...] "That trip was definitely the most crucial thing I've ever done for myself {{in my life to}} date. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> time that I was dealing with, and it just came to the point where I really needed to—basically, I just needed to run away, honestly. And I needed to get as far away as possible." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 September 2008, Quo Vadis {{played a}} concert at The Medley in Montreal, at which Stéphane Paré {{confirmed}} that Yanic and {{him would be}} leaving the band, leaving Bart as the only original member still left in the band. Bart speculated that {{the distance between the}} band and Yanic contributed to his departure; [...] "With regard to Yanic, I know <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>difficult</b> decision to make on his part. People change, priorities change, personal situations change and he's been flying in from Tennessee for all the shows so you can imagine with the recent developments in the US/gas prices/travel {{and the fact that we}} were working remotely on the new record had probably something to do with it. I guess sometimes you have to make difficult decisions and this one was Yanic's. For sure on my end I will miss him on stage and working with him because he's been like a brother to me for 15 years and we've been through so much together." [...] At the same show, Bart's right knee, which had both ligaments torn away in a sports injury, gave in completely and he supported his entire weight on his left knee for the rest of the show. However, this was to no avail as eventually Rob [...] "The Witch" [...] from Necronomicon and Stephane from BCI had to carry Bart around for the rest of the set, eventually having him sit up on a chair for the remainder of the show. Stéphane proposed cutting the show short but Bart refused and played on till the end. In the following months, both his knees had to have surgery.|$|E
