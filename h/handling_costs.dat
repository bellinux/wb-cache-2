40|$|Nowadays, {{manufacturing}} enterprises {{should have}} the abilities to be response quickly to the changes in product variety, mix and volume while minimizing material <b>handling</b> <b>cost.</b> For achieving this, enterprises have to adapt their production system to the new circumstance by adjusting facilities layout.

30|$|Since in the {{sequential}} approach, {{the objective}} function is optimized without components related to makespan and tardiness, {{the model is}} {{able to find the}} optimal value for material <b>handling</b> <b>cost</b> equal to 54.5. However, when the components related to makespan and tardiness are included in the objective function in the concurrent approach, the previous optimal material <b>handling</b> <b>cost</b> increase due to the effect of scheduling parts on machines layout. Switching from sequential approach to concurrent approach reduces the value of makespan from 48.5 to 41.4 and the value of tardiness penalty from 25.5 to 6, which are remarkable improvements for these components. On the other hand, incorporating parts scheduling in the concurrent approach increases the value of material <b>handling</b> <b>cost</b> from 54.5 to 91.5. Totally, OFV is improved about 14  % by switching from sequential approach to concurrent approach. This achievement was expectative since simultaneous decisions making about interrelated decisions machines layout and parts scheduling brings the capability for the model to optimize all components of the objective function as an optimal strategy in designing a CMS.|$|R

30|$|The {{mix product}} {{is defined as}} the set of part types in a factory which can be {{produced}} and each factory looks for the best mix product. The mix product and value of demand for each product in the mix product due to customized products, shorter product life cycles, and unpredictable patterns of demand, are not known exactly at the time of designing the manufacturing cells. The composition of the product mix is determined by demand and is probabilistic in nature. Seifoddini (1990) proposed a stochastic CF model in which for each mix product a probability had been attributed. He calculated the expected intercellular material <b>handling</b> <b>cost</b> for each machine cell arrangement under all possible product mixes. Madhusudanan Pillai and Chandrasekharan (2010) evaluated the CF problem under probabilistic product mix. Each product mix is specified with a scenario and to each scenario has been attributed probability of occurrence. They minimized inter-cell material handling. Jayakumar and Raju (2011) presented a mathematic model for the CF problem in which for each scenario probability of occurrence has been attributed. The objective function of this model is to minimize the total machine constant (investment) cost, the operating cost, the inter-cell material <b>handling</b> <b>cost,</b> and the intra-cell material <b>handling</b> <b>cost</b> for a particular product mix.|$|R

If the next operation (i.e., k + 1) of part p is processed on any machine, but in another cell, then an inter-cell cost is incurred. To decrease {{this section of the}} objective function, it is better to locate two machines having a small quantity of the material flow between each other in different cells rather than those machines having a large quantity of the material flow in order to pay the inter-cell material <b>handling</b> <b>cost</b> (IE p [...]) for a smaller quantity of the material flow of parts between different cells.|$|R
