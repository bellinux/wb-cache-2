Real reservoirs, however, will experience thermal, hydraulic, mechanical, and chemical (THMC) changes that alter the <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> throughout the energy extraction process. In addition to THMC effects, fracture shearing/slipping during heat extraction will also change the <b>aperture</b> <b>field.</b> In general, <b>aperture</b> change due to THMC effects will increase permeability/aperture in the region enclosed by the injection and production well (Taron and Elsworth 2009; Ghassemi and Zhou 2011).

Although our work did not incorporate fracture slippage and THMC effects it, nonetheless, provides a framework through which to understand how spatial aperture fluctuations affect thermal performance. It shows that fracture surface variations are a reservoir characteristic that researchers should consider in modeling discretely fractured geothermal reservoirs and performing techo-economic analysis (Beckers et al. 2014; Held et al. 2014). Our systematic approach for generating spatially varying apertures can be used in conjunction with modeling the effects that THMC and fracture slippage have on reservoir thermal performance, by providing a base <b>aperture</b> <b>field</b> that already has a spatially varying <b>aperture</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R

This device, {{defined by the}} field and source apertures, was proposed in order to eliminate any additional contribution to the genuine molecular beam of surface vaporizations coming from {{the vicinity of the}} effusion orifice as usually detected by the ion source of a mass spectrometer. METHODSThe molecular transmission of the " restricted collimation device" was calculated using a vaporization law under vacuum taking into account the real surface where the molecules are emitted, i. e., the sample evaporation surface in the Knudsen cell or the effusion orifice section, towards the ion source inlet by integration of elementary solid angles. RESULTSAn optimum is observed depending on the pair of selected apertures that define the restricted collimation device, i. e., the field and source apertures. This optimum is different from that previously calculated when taking into account only the solid angle, as defined by the restricted collimation device. CONCLUSIONSThis difference is attributed to the previously approximate assumption that optimizing the restricted collimation solid angle automatically optimizes the sampling of the effused beam included in the restricted collimation angle. Moreover, the location of the evaporating surface for molecules traveling through the collimation device towards the ionization chamber remains an important factor: the distance between the sample evaporation surface and the <b>field</b> <b>aperture</b> is of paramount importance as it changes the molecular...|$|E
