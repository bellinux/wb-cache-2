One aimed across the aircraft's travel gives less risk, partially because the light enters through the side windows, and partially because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> keep the beam aimed exactly at the cockpit area.

25|$|Tigrinya has {{a fairly}} typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That is, {{there is a}} set of ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or uvular ejective fricative, these phonological elements make it easy to distinguish spoken Tigrinya from closely related languages such as Amharic. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> tell from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|E

25|$|Customer horizon {{indicates}} the market orientation {{of a company}} {{in the case of}} netchains. In a chain and network environment it reflects the ability of companies to identify downstream customers and what they need. The phrase and two measurements of customer horizons, breadth and length, were introduced by Storer, Holman and Pedersen in 2010. The importance of market orientation becomes more complicated in a netchain environment, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> identify the customers of a specific unit. Therefore, it is even more important for companies to allocate resources for this purpose in netchains.|$|E

For many people this symbolized that women’s participation in sports did not exactly lead to equality because {{it might be possible}} to change society (the actions), but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> change the more static culture (people’s beliefs).|$|E
500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first {{southern}} club since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 to win the Shield outright. Wenger described the scoreline as [...] "unexpected" [...] and cited the first goal as crucial in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, {{who had been in}} the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had what it took to retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge.
