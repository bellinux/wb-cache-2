Meanwhile, the police had visited Straffen's employer to check on his movements; this resulted in Straffen being dismissed on 31 July. In a later interview with a prison psychiatrist, Straffen said that he knew he was under suspicion and wanted to annoy the police, because he <b>hated</b> <b>them</b> for shadowing him.|$|E

Early on, I felt as though the songs we were making aesthetically didn't want them. This new batch of songs, to me, always want solos. I feel like every song has one." ...|$|E
500|$|The group parted with Heart Management in March 1995 {{because of}} their {{frustration}} with the management company's unwillingness {{to listen to their}} visions and ideas. The girls met with artist manager Simon Fuller, who signed them with 19 Entertainment. The group considered a variety of record labels, and signed a deal with Virgin Records in July. The original mix of [...] "Wannabe" [...] was considered lacklustre by the label's executives. Ashley Newton, {{who was in charge of}} A, sent the song to American producer Dave Way for remixing; the result was not what the group had hoped to achieve. As Halliwell later described it, [...] "the result was bloody awful." [...] She elaborated in her second autobiography, Just for the Record: [...] "Right at the beginning of the Spice Girls, [...] Ashley Newton had tried to turn us into an R group. He sent [...] "Wannabe" [...] over to America to be remixed by some hot R producers. He brought us jungle versions and hip-hop mixes and I <b>hated</b> <b>them</b> all. Although Mel B was a big fan of R, she agreed with me that these versions just didn't work so we exercised our Spice veto!" [...] Fuller gave the song to audio engineer Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent, who thought that it was a [...] "weird pop record." [...] Stent remixed it in six hours, in what he described as [...] "tightening it up" [...] and [...] "getting the vocals sounding really good." ...|$|E

The website End of Show comments that [...] "writer James Moran was so inundated with messages to his Twitter account that he posted a number of impassioned pleas to tone down the vitriol." [...] End of Show writer Kirsty Walker comments that fans on Twitter accused Moran of [...] "deliberately egging on the 'shippers'." [...] Moran noted in his blog that {{of the thousands of}} messages from viewers, the [...] "vast majority" [...] were extremely positive, managing to express that they were [...] "upset, angry and shocked" [...] without making personal attacks. Moran declared the response from other commentators to be unacceptable, describing their conduct as the spewing of insults and [...] "passive aggressive nonsense". He noted that fans had accused him of deliberately trying to [...] "mislead", [...] "lie" [...] and [...] "hurt" [...] them, said that he <b>hated</b> <b>them,</b> was [...] "laughing at them" [...] and [...] "slapping [...] in the face", and claimed that he had [...] "killed the show", had attempted to drive away existing fans to court newer and [...] "cooler" [...] viewers, and had deliberately hurt depressed people [...] "with dark storylines." [...] In a poll conducted by Digital Spy shortly after Ianto's death, 27.4% of voters claimed that they would no longer watch Torchwood. Responding to these results, Gareth David-Lloyd thanked the fans for their dedication to the show and the character but urged them to have faith in the writers. On the show's Facebook groups, fans expressed anger towards creator Russell T Davies and some claimed they would stop watching the show. Walker herself had felt that the end of Jack's relationship with Ianto could [...] "change the show beyond all recognition." ...|$|E

Astonishings first issue was dated February 1940; it was bimonthly, alternating monthly with Super Science Stories. [...] Pohl's budget for an issue was $405: in Pohl's memoirs he recalls Harry Steeger, {{one of the company}} owners, breaking down the budget for him: [...] "Two hundred seventy-five dollars for stories. [...] A hundred dollars for black and white art. Thirty dollars for a cover." [...] Pohl could only offer half a cent per word for fiction, well below the rates offered by the leading magazines. [...] At ten cents, the magazine was cheaper {{than any of the other}} sf magazines of the day, and it sold well, despite Pohl's limited resources. [...] It was certainly assisted by Popular's wide and effective distribution network, and the publisher soon increased Pohl's budget, to pay bonuses for popular stories. [...] Pohl later commented that he {{was uncertain}} whether the additional funds really helped to bring in higher quality submissions, although at the time he assured Steeger it would improve the magazine. [...] Some of the additional money went to long-time writer Ray Cummings, who was sufficiently well known that the young Pohl felt unable to reject his stories, even though he disliked his work. [...] Cummings came to see Pohl in person to submit his work, and refused to sell for less than one cent a word; since the first visit came on a day when Pohl had some extra money available, Pohl was never able to bring himself to tell Cummings that he could not really afford to pay that rate.

Rabbi Tanhuma observed that Joseph's motive was noble, for Joseph reasoned that formerly Jacob had placed Joseph above Judah, who was a king, and above Reuben, who was the firstborn, but after Jacob's death, it would not be right for Joseph to sit above them. The brothers, however, did not understand it that way, but worried that Joseph <b>hated</b> <b>them.</b> Rabbi Isaac said that the brothers feared because he had gone and looked into the pit into which they had thrown him.|$|E

Alexander, who had been held without bail since the time of the shootings, had pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder charges.

2500|$|The French {{arrived at}} on 2 February 1802 at Le Cap with the Haitian {{commander}} Henri Christophe being ordered by Leclerc {{to turn over}} the city to the French. When Christophe refused, the French assaulted Le Cap and the Haitians set the city afire rather than surrender it. Leclerc sent Toussaint letters promising him: [...] "Have no worries about your personal fortune. It will be safeguarded for you, since it has been only too well earned by your own efforts. Do not worry about the liberty of your fellow citizens". When Toussaint still failed to appear at Le Cap, Leclerc issued a proclamation on 17 February 1802: [...] "General Toussaint and General Christophe are outlawed; all citizens are ordered to hunt them down, and treat them as rebels against the French Republic". Captain Marcus Rainsford, a British Army officer who visited St. Domingue observed the training of the Haitian Army, writing: [...] "At a whistle, a whole brigade ran three or four hundred yards, and then, separating, threw themselves flat on the ground, changing to their backs and sides, and all the time keeping up a strong fire until recalled…This movement is executed with such facility and precision as totally to prevent cavalry from charging them in bushy and hilly country". In a letter to Jean-Jacques Dessalines, Toussaint outlined his plans for defeating the French: [...] "Do not forget, while waiting for the rainy reason which will rid us of our foes, that we have no other resource than destruction and fire. Bear in mind that the soil bathed with our sweet must not furnish our enemies with the smallest sustenance. Tear up the roads with shot; throw corpses and horses into all the foundations, burn and annihilate everything in order that those who have come to reduce us to slavery may have before their eyes the image of the hell which they deserve". Dessalines never received the letter as he already taken to the field, evaded a French column sent to capture him and stormed Léogane. The Haitians burned down Leogane and killed all of the French with the Trinidadian historian C. L. R. James writing of Dessalines's actions at Leogane: [...] "Men, women and children, indeed all the whites who came into his hands, he massacred. And forbidding burial, he left stacks of corpses rotting in the sun to strike terror into the French detachments as they toiled behind his flying columns". The French, who been expecting the Haitians to happily go back to being their slaves as they believed it was natural for blacks to be the slaves of whites were stunned to learn how much the Haitians <b>hated</b> <b>them</b> for wanting to reduce them back to a life in chains. A visibly shocked General Pamphile de Lacroix after seeing the ruins of Leogane wrote: [...] "They heaped up bodies" [...] which [...] "still had their attitudes; they were bent over, their hands outstretched and beseeching; the ice of death had not effaced the look on their faces".|$|E
