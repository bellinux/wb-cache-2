50|$|In the FASTA method, {{the user}} defines a value k {{to use as}} the word length with which to search the database. The method is slower but more {{sensitive}} at lower values of k, which are also preferred for searches involving a very short query sequence. The BLAST family of search methods provides a number of algorithms optimized for particular types of queries, such as searching for distantly related sequence matches. BLAST was developed to provide a faster alternative to FASTA without sacrificing much accuracy; like FASTA, BLAST uses a word search of length k, but <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> the most significant word matches, rather than every word match as does FASTA. Most BLAST implementations use a fixed default word length that is optimized for the query and database type, and that is changed only under special circumstances, such as when searching with repetitive or very short query sequences. Implementations can be found via a number of web portals, such as EMBL FASTA and NCBI BLAST. Wani.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Error {{correction}} {{neural networks}} (ECNN) are an appropriate {{framework for the}} modeling of dynamical systems in the presents of noise or missing external in uences. Combining ECNNs {{with the concept of}} variants-invariants separation in form of a bottleneck coordinate transformation, we are able to handle high-dimensional problems. Further on, we propose a new learning rule for the training of neural networks, which <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> speci c gradients for the adaptation of the network weights. By this, we are able to generate time invariant localized structures and thus, support the optimization of the network. Forecasting the German yield curve, an ECNN including the separation of variants-invariants is superior to traditional neural networks. ...|$|E
40|$|Decisions under {{uncertainty}} depend {{not only}} on the degree of uncertainty but also on its source, as illustrated by Daniel Ellsberg's (1961) observation of ambiguity aversion. In this article, the authors propose the comparative ignorance hypothesis, according to which ambiguity aversion is produced by a comparison with less ambiguous events or with more knowledgeable individuals. This hypothesis is supported in a series of studies showing that ambiguity aversion, present in a comparative context in which a person evaluates both clear and vague prospects, seems to disappear in a noncomparative context in which a person <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> one of these prospects in isolation.

Instead of the optimum maximum a posteriori probability detector, which performs brute force search over all possible transmitted symbol vectors, the new scheme <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> the symbol vectors that contribute significantly to the soft output of the detector. The IRTS algorithm is facilitated by carrying out the search on a reconfigurable tree, constructed by computing the reliabilities of symbols based on minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion and reordering the symbols according to their reliabilities. Results from computer simulations are presented, which proves the good performance of IRTS algorithm over a quasistatic Rayleigh channel even for relatively small list sizes.|$|E

30|$|However, to be noted, {{in vitro}} {{autoradiography}} <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> {{the extent of}} membrane-bound receptor in non-viable tissue, whereas change in AT 1 R density can be affected by internalization or turnover of the receptor. Activation of AT 1 R signal transduction systems can occur within seconds through Gαq and IP 3 or within minutes to hours through MAP kinase and JAK/STAT systems [46]. Moreover, AT 1 Rs are endocytosed within 10  min after activation, with ~ 25  % recycled to plasma membrane and the remainder degraded in lysosomes [47]. Consequently, the dynamic nature of AT 1 R is a limitation for the accuracy of in vitro measurements and represents an added value for in vivo PET as an investigative tool to detect total receptor changes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- To solve {{a general}} problem with genetic algorithm, it is {{desirable}} to maintain the population size as large as possible. in some cases, however, the cost to evaluate each individual is relatively high, {{and it is difficult}} to maintain large population. To solve this problein we propose a hybrid CA based on clustering, which considerably reduces evaluation number without any loss of its performance. The algorithm divides the whole population into several clusters, and <b>evaluates</b> <b>only</b> one representative for each cluster. The fitness values of other individuals are estimated from the representative fitness values indirectly, which can maintain large population with less number of evaluations. Several benchmark tests have been conducted and the results show that the proposed CA is very efficient. ...|$|E
