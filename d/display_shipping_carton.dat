40|$|Using a six x six {{latin square}} {{experimental}} design, five box types {{in two different}} markets were evaluated over a six-week period in 1986 to determine if sweetpotato arrival damage could be reduced through use of alternative shipping containers. Findings indicated that skinning, cut and break damage, and bruising could be reduced through use of either a 40 -pound container or the 45 -pound MUM box rather than using the current 50 -pound box.

5000|$|Plus was a German-based {{international}} {{supermarket chain}} founded in 1972. It operated 2,840 stores in Germany with an approximate 27,000 employees and about 1,200 stores {{in several other}} European countries. The retail model was to sell low-cost groceries with no expense incurred for display or marketing of products. Groceries were stored in the <b>shipping</b> <b>cartons</b> they came in, rather than being stacked on shelves. In German advertising, the name [...] "Plus" [...] {{was used as a}} backronym for [...] "Prima leben und sparen" [...] (approximately [...] "top-notch living and saving"), featuring animated [...] "little prices" [...] (also sold as plush puppets) as their mascot.|$|R

5000|$|Within {{months of}} the No Name launch, Loblaw opened a {{prototype}} No Frills store in East York. Also known as a 'box store,' since items were not individually shelved but left in their cardboard <b>shipping</b> <b>cartons,</b> usually with the front cut away, the new store advertised [...] "the lowest overall prices in Toronto." [...] Though customers had to pack their own groceries, bring their own bags or pay 3cent apiece, and contend with a limited selection of only 500 items, shoppers crowded the store on opening day. [...] Customers gave up other standardconveniences, such as full-service meat or dairy departments, sincerefrigeration units had been removed to cut costs. In spite of the limited selection and minimal service, the first No Frills store proved a success and within months the company converted two more Loblaws locations to the new deep discount format.|$|R

25|$|Snails usually prefer juicy {{leaves and}} {{vegetables}} over dry ones. If snails are fed vegetable trimmings, damaged fruit, and cooked potatoes, uneaten food must be promptly removed {{as it will}} quickly spoil. Bran may be supplied that is wet or sprinkled dry over leafy vegetables. The diet may consist of 20% wheat bran while 80% is fruit and vegetable material. Some growers use oats, corn meal, soybean meal, or chicken mash. Laying mash provides calcium, as does crushed oyster shells. Snails also may eat materials such as cardboard (but do not purposely feed it to them); they can eat through <b>shipping</b> <b>cartons</b> and escape. Snails may sometimes eat, within a 24-hour period, food equal to 10%, and occasionally as much as 20%, of their body weight. Active snails deprived of food will lose {{more than one-third of}} their weight before they starve to death—a process that takes 8 to 12 weeks. Estivating snails can survive much longer.|$|R
50|$|He was {{interested}} {{in a range of}} scientific and technical subjects, obtaining some twenty patents relating to telegraphy, chemistry, iron- and brick-making. His principal interest was electricity: he had a standing order with booksellers for books on the subject and amassed a huge collection, subsequently bought by Theodore Newton Vail and presented to Massachusetts Institute of Technology. One of the booksellers that sold to him was David Nutt. He had standing orders for all publications on a number of subjects including electricity but also magnetism, animal magnetism, and aeronautics. Other subjects that entered into his collection {{had to do with the}} occult, witchcraft, demonology, and magic. He accumulated so many books that thousands of volumes were still in unopened <b>shipping</b> <b>cartons</b> when Dering died. He also acquired the Cuthbert aeronautical collection, eventually presented to the Royal Aeronautical Society. A portion of the Cuthbert aeronautical collection was also acquired by Vail for MIT.|$|R

From east to west, the rooms were used for office space and product <b>display,</b> <b>shipping</b> and receiving, and storage. The office room was originally floored with linoleum, although carpet was added later. The room was originally only split into two areas, the office area having a pressed tin ceiling, but a vault was added in the 1920s, and a private office was partitioned off in 1941. A computer room was later built in the southeast corner. The shipping and receiving room contains an elevator {{in the center of the}} room which leads to the upper floors. Loading docks are located on either side of the room. The storage room is empty except for staircases leading to the upper floors.|$|R

This thesis suggests a novel means of solving these problems involving the precise measurement of signals whose wavelengths are comparable {{to the size of a}} building. It is shown that this "mid-field" frequency regime can provide useful propagation characteristics with very little fixed infrastructure. Using a wavelength of 150 m, over 4000 amplitude and differential carrier phase measurements were taken in the Wiesner Building. Least-squares power law fits to that data over paths of up to 30 m yield meter-class position estimates at 1 KHz acquisition rates. The contributions of this thesis include detailed indoor propagation measurements, as well as candidate empirical and theoretical models for that data. (cont.) Additionally, new types of high precision measurement instrumentation and high efficiency RF power amplifiers have been created to enable these measurements. by Matthew Stephen Reynolds. Thesis (Ph.
