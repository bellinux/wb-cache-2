50|$|The Eyes-on-the-Road-Benefit (ERB), {{also known}} as the Head-Up-Display-Advantage, is the term given to the purported {{advantages}} provided to motorists when driving using a Head-Up-Display (HUD). This can also be referred to as a heads-up-device or heads-up design, as compared to traditional dashboard designs, which are referred to as Head-Down-Design (HDD). A HUD is an instrument used to communicate information, such as speed, from a vehicle to the driver or pilot. HUDs can either be built into a vehicle or can be bought aftermarket and installed to a vehicle’s dashboard. The benefit of <b>Eyes-on-the-Road</b> systems stems from increased situational awareness and elimination of the need to look away from the road whilst driving, thereby increasing reaction time to external hazards, such as pedestrians. There is some evidence to suggest that the scope of the ERB is limited to low cognitive load situations in which the driving task is not particularly complex.|$|E

Such in-vehicle systems often require the driver’s visual attention, but visual workload has shown significant less <b>eyes-on-the-road</b> time and affects driving performance. In this paper, we illustrate and compare three different interaction techniques for in-vehicle systems. We refer to them as tactile, touch, and gesture interaction. The focus of the techniques is the effects on drivers while driving cars. We evaluated the interaction techniques with 16 subjects in two settings. Our results showed that gesture interaction has a significant effect on the number of driver eye glances especially eye fixations of more seconds. However, gesture interaction still required rapid eye glances for hand/eye coordination. On the other hand, touch interaction leads to fast and efficient task completion while tactile interaction seemed inferior to the two other interaction techniques.

40|$|Background. Action {{research}} projects (ARP) {{in which students}} operationalise practical approaches to specific health issues are a compulsory element of the Queensland senior Health Education subject. As part of the ARP, the first Author was consulted by the second Author and her students regarding young driver road safety issues, interventions, and intervention evaluation. The “students” then developed a humourous parade presentation and three surveys targeting youth driving distracted. Aims. To overview the humourous peer education project, to {{examine the impact of}} the presentation upon “participants” behaviours; and to reflect upon the difficulties and successes associated with engaging researchers, teachers, and youth (students, participants). Method. Seventy-six Year 11 and 12 participants (61. 8 % female) completed a pre-presentation survey (baseline survey); 267 participants watched the presentation and immediately completed evaluation survey one; 42 of these participants completed evaluation survey two a fortnight later. Results. Baseline survey: 60 % of participants had been a passenger in a car in which the driver was texting. Evaluation survey one: 77 % of participants reported the presentation had made them think about their actions on the road as a driver and/or passenger; 33 % of participants reported the take-home message related to active behaviours such as <b>eyes-on-the-road</b> and phone-in-the-boot. Evaluation survey two: 43 % of participants reported they had been a passenger of a distracted driver during the intervening period. Discussion and Conclusions. Translating research findings into real-world practice and policy is a challenge for all road safety researchers. Engaging with youth can also be challenging, and the school environment provides an ideal context for peer-based intervention.
