30|$|In view of {{the past}} {{reported}} studies, the most utilized material fabric is cotton. In some of the studies, the greigh fabric have been processed through the textile finishing processes for making a finished fabrics. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process. Textile finishing usually involved treatments such as scouring, desizing, bleaching, mercerizing and dyeing process (Hall 1966). None reported the cotton fabric experiencing the finishing process mercerizing process. It is remarkable that the wet preparing of cotton fabrics prompts its shrinkage, expanding the <b>yarn</b> <b>number,</b> mass every unit territory, and fabric thickness (Tarbuk et al. 2014). Mercerised cotton fibre will be round and hollow rather than strip like shapes, and the cross-segments of the filaments change from kidney like to roundabout molded. The primary explanation behind this is the cotton fibre swelling amid the mercerisation process. Amid mercerization, Sodium Hyroxide (NaoH) infiltrated into the lumen of the cotton strands and swelled. Mercerizing process is the act of chemical treatment on cellulosic fibre to improve {{the properties of the}} fibre in term of tensile strength, absorption properties and also greater affinity of dyes and various chemical finishes. Mercerized cotton holds the properties of higher mass per unit area, thickness, breaking force and elongation, luster, with a change of surface charge that ensures further quality improvement and also higher adsorption of anionic auxiliaries.|$|R

40|$|Woven fabrics are {{materials}} of a sophisticated structure. Basic structural parameters, the raw material, linear density of {{warp and weft}} <b>yarn,</b> <b>number</b> of <b>yarn</b> twist, warp and weft density, warp and weft crimp, as well as weave contribute to the obtained properties of the fabric. Certain basic parameters of the fabric can be controlled directly either during the preparatory processes or during the weaving process itself. There are some important structural parameters, however, for which no direct quan¬titative controls exist. Since all structural parameters are closely interdependent, the lack of direct control results in an imperfect control of the fabric structure. The subject of the investigation was how small variations in semi-worsted wool fabric constructional parameters influence the air permeability, and to which extent they can be controlled in the design process and weaving of fabrics. The experiment showed that yarn count, warp and weft density and warp and weft crimp are highly interrelated, leading to small variations in the fixed sett. The sta¬tistical significance of small variations in the groups of fabrics was confirmed by the analysis of variance. The analysis confirmed {{that there were no}} differences in mass, although all other structural parameters differed. Additionally, a post-hoc Bon¬ferroni test showed that the structural parameters of the group of fabrics, which has a practically balanced structure, are always different to those of groups g 2 and g 3. Fabric alternations done on the same warp, in such a manner to achieve the same mass per square meter, showed that the change in weft yarn count and weft density influenced the fabric structure {{as a result of the}} crimp interchange. However, there was not a statistically significant difference among the three groups of fabrics when tested for air permeability. ...|$|R

The major {{purpose of this study}} was to secure some information on the physical properties of lining fabrics to help consumers in the selection of lining fabrics which will give good serviceability. Eight lining fabrics made of one fiber [...] two fabrics each of cotton, rayon, acetate and polyester [...] were examined for their serviceability properties such as resistance to abrasion, breaking load and elongation of yarn and fabric, tearing strength, resistance to yarn slippage, dimensional stability and resistance to wrinkling. They were all white, plain weave, light-weight and commonly-sold lining fabrics. The experimental fabrics were analyzed for their basic characteristics such as fabric count, weight, thickness, twist and <b>yarn</b> <b>number</b> to find out the possible relationship which existed between these characteristics and the serviceability properties. Standard test methods of the American Society for Testing Materials and the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists were conducted under the standard atmospheric conditions. Analysis of variance and correlation coefficients were calculated for data obtained from all tests. Lining fabrics were ranked in terms of fiber content for each fabric performance test. Polyester showed great resistance to abrasion, high yarn and fabric breaking strength and little dimensional change. Rayon showed great resistance to tearing and good yarn and fabric breaking strength. Cotton had good resistance to abrasion and the least yarn slippage at the seams. Acetate consistently ranked the lowest in the majority of serviceability tests. Since linings with different fiber components did not always rank in the same order in all tests, it would be desirable for the consumer to determine what serviceability qualities she desires most...|$|R

Microscopic examination revealed that two brands were core spun and seven were tow spun type threads. Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand breaking load varied significantly only among the tow spun black threads. The loop breaking strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the core spun threads. The core spun black threads were stronger than the core spun white threads in loop breaking strength. The core spun threads had the higher single strand breaking elongation. A significant variation in single strand elongation occurred among the white threads and the black threads of both the tow spun and core spun threads. Variation in loop breaking elongation existed among the brands. Variation in loop breaking elongation also occurred among the white tow spun threads and between the black core spun threads. The core spun threads exhibited more shrinkage than the tow spun threads. Seams sewn with the white tow spun threads were stronger than those sewn with the white core spun thread.

40|$|Science and {{engineering}} of fiber reinforced advanced composite materials (FRC) is an actively broadening research field {{with more and}} more emphasis on their multi-phase and multi-scale characteristics. While emerging manufacturing and characterization techniques provide ability to manipulate the materials at all scales from traditional macro to relatively recent emergence of nano-scale, computational tools provide better understanding of behavior of composite materials. Collective and coherent use of these abilities and tools can make composites better. This thesis is an effort to address how and why engineers can and should associate other characteristic scales with the traditional macro-scale engineering of composites. Three different studies on structural composites which exemplifies the need for multi-scale overlook are reported, each contained in individual chapters. Nano-Macro associated case study: In-house synthesized poly(styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) based nano-fibers manufactured by electro-spinning were implemented to carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composites as interlayers. As a result of several mechanical tests and fracture analysis a significant increase in resistance against mode II delamination (70 %) and transverse matrix cracking (25 %) with literally no weight penalty was observed. This increase was attributed to the chemistry tuned epoxy compatibility of nano-fibrous interlayers. Micro-Macro associated case study: A systematic statistical tool built upon an intensive amount of finite element analyses. Surrogate models on the micromechanics based stress amplification factors for CFRP reinforced epoxy composites are offered. Quadratic models are reported taking longitudinal fiber stiffness (Ef), fiber volume fraction (Vf) and matrix stiffness (Em) as input and calculates each term of the stress amplification matrix that can connect macro-level stresses to micro-level stresses. Meso-Macro associated case study: The fiber bundle width and inter-bundle distance of non-crimp fabric reinforcements (NCF) was considered.

Measuring the number of twists per inch while spinning singles also helps the spinner create a balanced yarn when plying. Yarns that have relatively few twists per inch tend to have a softer hand but are not as strong as yarns with more twists per inch, such as medium twist or hard twist yarns.

A multicolour yarn-dyed fabric is cross-woven by weft and warp yarns with different colours.
