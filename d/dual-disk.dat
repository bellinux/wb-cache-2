50|$|A Brecker Brothers Band Reunion tour of European festivals in {{the summer}} of 2013 {{supported}} Brecker's Brecker Brothers Band Reunion, a <b>dual-disk</b> project which was released on September 25, 2013 on Piloo Records. It features a live DVD recorded at the Blue Note in New York City with a new 11-song studio recording featuring members of the Brecker Brothers bands from throughout the years including David Sanborn, Mike Stern, Bill Lee, and Dave Weckl. George Whitty produced the album, and Brecker's wife Ada Rovatti also played saxophone. The recording was released in North America by Magenta/E-One, in Europe by Moosicus Records in November and in Japan by Victor. It is dedicated to his brother, Michael, and other departed Brecker Brothers Band members.|$|E
50|$|The Mindset was {{released}} on 2 May 1984. The base model with 64K RAM and no floppy disk drive sold for US$1099, a 128K model with single disk was available for $1,798, and a 256K <b>dual-disk</b> version cost $2,398. The disk-less version of the machine was still usable, as the system also included two ROM cartridge ports {{on the front of}} the machine that could be used for the operating system and another program. The canonical cartridge was an extended version of GW-BASIC. The machine was packaged in a unique enclosure designed by GVO of Menlo Park, visually separated into two sections with the ROM slots in the lower half and the optional diskettes on the upper half. It was sold complete with a custom nylon carrying case.|$|E
5000|$|Two new {{disk drives}} were {{introduced}} {{in conjunction with the}} C128: the short-lived single-sided 1570 and the double-sided 1571. A <b>dual-disk</b> 1572 model was announced but never produced. Later on, the 3.5-inch 1581 was introduced. All of these drives are more reliable than the 1541 and promise much better performance via a new [...] "burst mode" [...] feature. The 1581 drive also has more on-board RAM than its predecessors, making it possible to open a larger number of files at one time. BASIC 7.0 includes [...] and [...] commands to support loading and saving to disk without using the [...] or other device number, and also a [...] command that reads a disk's catalog information directly to screen memory without overwriting BASIC memory as in BASIC 2.0. In addition, the C128 introduces auto-booting of disk software, a feature standard on most personal computers, but absent from Commodore machines up to that point. Users no longer have to type [...]|$|E
40|$|Optomechanical {{resonators}} {{suffer from}} the dissipation of mechanical energy through the necessary anchors enabling the suspension of the structure. Here we show that such structural loss in an optomechnaical oscillator can be almost completely eliminated through the destructive interference of elastic waves using <b>dual-disk</b> resonators. We also present both analytical and numerical model that predicts the observed interference of elastic waves. Our experimental data reveal unstressed SiN devices with mechanical Q-factors up to $ 10 ^ 4 $ at mechanical frequencies of $f= 102 $ MHz ($fQ = 10 ^{ 12 }$) at room temperature.

40|$|Burst disks, {{commonly}} used in pressure relief applications, were studied as single-use valves. A dual-burst disk design was chosen for primary investigation for systems involving separation of gases of two significantly different pressures. The two disks are used to seal either end of a piston cavity that has a different cross-sectional area on each side. Different piston surface areas are used to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, P{sub 1 }A{sub 1 } = P{sub 2 }A{sub 2 }. The single-use valve functions when the downstream pressure is reduced to approximately atmospheric pressure, creating a pressure differential that causes the burst disks to fail. Several parameters were studied to determine the optimum design of the burst disk. These parameters include thickness, diameter, area/pressure ratio, scoring, and disk geometry. The disk material was limited to 304 L stainless steel. Factors that were considered essential to the optimization of the design were robustness, manufacturability, and burst pressure variability. The thicknesses of the disks that were studied range from 0. 003 in. to 0. 010 in. A model for predicting burst pressures of the burst disks was derived. The model combines membrane stress theory with force/displacement data to predict the burst pressure of various designs to within {+-} 10 %. This model results from studies that characterize the behavior of individual small and large disks. Welding techniques used to join the <b>dual-disk</b> assembly are discussed. Laser welds are used to join and seal the disks to the bulkhead. These welds were optimized for repeatability and robustness. Resistance upset welding is suggested for joining the <b>dual-disk</b> assembly to the pressure vessel body. Resistance upset weld parameters were developed for this particular design so as to minimize the side effects on the burst-disk performance and to provide high-quality welds...|$|E
40|$|<b>Dual-disk</b> {{electrodes}} {{allow for}} novel electrochemical investigations, particularly {{when used in}} generator-collector mode. However analytical {{understanding of how the}} current response of each individual electrode is affected by the presence of the neighbouring electrode is limited. In this article, we derive an approximate analytical solution for the time-dependent chronoamperometric current response of a pair of electrodes, each subjected to a different initial potential step. The solution is valid when the centre-to-centre distance between the disks is much larger than the disk radii, and for times such that the diffusion layers generated at each electrode have started to interact. It accommodates quasi-reversible reactions and unequal diffusion coefficients of the oxidant and the reductant. The generator-collector system is a specific case, and we deduce simple expressions for the time-dependent current and steady-state collection efficiencies at each electrode. The analytical solution facilitates analysis of shielding and feedback effects, and shows the explicit dependence of the currents on the underlying electrochemical parameters...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{development}} and characteristics of infrared semiconductor lasers as compact and robust light sources for Directed Infrared Countermeasures (DIRCM). The short-wavelength side of the 2 - 5 µm wavelength band of interest can be covered by GaSb-based optically pumped semiconductor disk lasers (OPSDLs), delivering a continuous-wave (cw) or temporally modulated multiple-Watt output with a high beam quality (M 2 < 3). For the 3. 7 - 5 µm wavelength range InP-based quantum cascade (QC) lasers are the best suited semiconductor laser source, delivering several hundreds of mW of average output power in a nearly diffraction limited output beam (M 2 < 2). Further up-scaling of the output power can be achieved for OPSDLs by intra-cavity coupling of several semiconductor chips as gain elements in a multiple-disk cavity arrangement. For a 2. 3 m emitting <b>dual-disk</b> OPSDL, a doubling of the maximum roomtemperature output power {{compared to that of}} a comparable single-chip OPSDL has been demonstrated. For QC lasers power scaling by beam-quality-preserving beam combining has been demonstrated via polarization coupling of the output beams of two individual QC lasers, yielding a coupling efficiency of 82 %...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{broadband}} communication systems and radars require lightweight compact antennas with high gain and wide bandwidth. Dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) offer several advantages such as wide bandwidth, small size, ease of fabrication and high radiation efficiency. However, low gain {{has been a}} drawback of basic DRAs in some applications. Some investigations have been conducted to enhance gain of a DRA by employing offset <b>dual-disk</b> DRs [1], stacking parasitic DRs with an air gap between the driven and parasitic DRs [2], and composite layered high permittivity DRs [3]. These efforts achieved up to 2. 7 dBi higher gain {{than that of the}} single DRA element. A dielectric resonator loaded waveguide antenna with parasitic dielectric detectors has been studied experimentally for gain enhancement by up to 7 dB by Hakkak and Ameri [4]. All of the above gain enhancement techniques have two or more dielectric elements. In this presentation we propose a novel gain enhancement technique of the DRA by using a surface mount quasi-planar horn. The geometry of the proposed antenna is shown in Figure 1. In the proposed structure, the aperture coupled DRA works as a feed to the surface mounted horn antenna. Note that the rectangular DRA is located over the centre of the rectangular slot in the ground and is excited by a 50 -Ω microstrip line feed. We have investigated this structure and optimized the heigh...|$|E
