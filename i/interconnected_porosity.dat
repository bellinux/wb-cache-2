40|$|The Okavango Delta of {{northern}} Botswana {{is one of}} the world's largest inland deltas or megafans. To obtain information on the character of sediments and basement depths, audiomagnetotelluric (AMT), controlled-source audiomagnetotelluric (CSAMT) and central-loop transient electromagnetic (TEM) data were collected on the largest island within the delta. The data were inverted individually and jointly for 1 -D models of electric resistivity. Distortion effects in the AMT and CSAMT data were accounted for by including galvanic distortion tensors as free parameters in the inversions. By employing Marquardt-Levenberg inversion, we found that a 3 -layer model comprising a resistive layer overlying sequentially a conductive layer and a deeper resistive layer was sufficient to explain all of the electromagnetic data. However, the top of the basal resistive layer from electromagnetic-only inversions was much shallower than the well-determined basement depth observed in high-quality seismic reflection images and seismic refraction velocity tomograms. To resolve this discrepancy, we jointly inverted the electromagnetic data for 4 -layer models by including seismic depths to an interface between sedimentary units and to basement as explicit a priori constraints. We have also estimated the interconnected porosities, clay contents and pore-fluid resistivities of the sedimentary units from their electrical resistivities and seismic P-wave velocities using appropriate petrophysical models.

In the field of materials science, the most popular techniques used to characterise the texture of mesoporous supports {{are based on the}} analysis of the properties of a confined fluid:thermoporometry, adsorption technique and mercury intrusion porosimetry. In particular, in the last two techniques the pressure parameter is related to the dimension of the pores. The present study is dedicated to an original analysis of the forced-intrusion of a non-wetting liquid (water) in hydrophobic mesoporous materials presenting different pore topologies. Among these supports, MCM- 41 type materials allowed to point out distinct mechanisms for the intrusion and the extrusion of water. Whereas the intrusion process obeys to the Laplace law of capillarity, the extrusion is found to be preferentially governed by the formation of the vapor phase by a mechanism such as nucleation. Therefore, the conventional interpretation given for the hysteresis observed in mercury porosimetry, based on wetting hysteresis and pore-blocking effects is not directly transposable to the case of water intrusion experiments. Data obtained on other supports such as silica gels and Controlled Pore Glass supports are also reported and discussed taking into account the results obtained in MCM- 41 type materials. Finally, the mechanisms leading to hysteresis in both phenomena (sorption of a wetting fluid and forced intrusion of a non-wetting liquid) are shown to present strong analogies in model materials as well as in disordered and <b>interconnected</b> <b>porosities...</b>|$|R
