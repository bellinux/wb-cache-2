The 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade managed to capture Source Farm and later Vapour Farm at the corps boundary, {{just short of}} the objective line. However, the brigade had difficulty getting through the swampy ground in the Woodland Plantation, resulting in a division in the line. The 58th Division and 63rd (Royal Naval) Division infantry were caught by German artillery fire at their jumping-off line and made only slight progress in deep mud against German machine-gun fire and were unable to reach their rendezvous objectives, leaving the Canadian troops at Source Farm and Vapour Farm in precarious and largely unsupported positions. Two companies later advanced through the Canadian sector to capture Source Trench but were only able to reinforce the Canadian outpost at Source Farm and form a defensive flank to Vapour Farm. In the centre of the assault was the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have reached quite {{different}} conclusions about which variable is the best indicator of the stance of monetary policy. These differences likely reflect varying assumptions about bank and Federal Reserve behavior.

The paper first outlines a general analytical model for studying and evaluating monetary policy procedures. The model is then used to estimate both the Fed's operational policy <b>objectives</b> and its <b>intermediate</b> <b>objectives.</b> The results can be summarized as follows: First, monetary policy shocks {{over the past several}} years have primarily affected the federal funds rate, even during periods when the Fed was reportedly targeting reserves. In addition, the paper finds a statistically-significant liquidity effect in all periods examined, although the effect is quite small. Finally, there is statistical evidence that suggests that the Fed's <b>intermediate</b> <b>objectives</b> have not been stable over time, and these differences appear to be economically important. Taken together, these results indicate that while monetary policy shocks can be uncovered by regressing the funds rate on appropriate variables in the Fed's information set, the reaction function should be estimated over subperiods rather than over the entire 1959 - 1993 period.

Inter-organizational collaborations (IOCs) are a strategy used to address public health concerns and are useful in addressing differences in health status that are due to injustice. This study uses a social determinants of health framework, which describes how factors at the macro, community, interpersonal and individual levels contribute to inequities. Policy change is used to address these social determinants of health inequities. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify factors that are challenges or facilitating factors to IOCsâ€™ effectiveness and to describe how youth engage in policy advocacy initiatives. The study uses a case study design and data collection of interviews, a document review, and observations of events that were conducted in 2011. A grounded theory approach to data analysis was used. Interview transcripts were coded using in vivo coding techniques. Axial codes were developed based upon these codes and researcher memos. Documents and observation notes were then reviewed and memos were generated. This analysis led to the development of a theory that is grounded in the data.
