In anticipation of the storm, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for the island of Hawaii on July 20. Also, small craft advisories were in effect for Maui and Hawaii; wind advisories were issued for summits in those regions. High surf advisories were also put into effect for coastal areas. The Hawaii County Civil Defense prepared for the storm by planning for increases in <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>personnel</b> and opening of evacuation centers. County crews worked to clean out drains and culverts to prevent flooding.|$|E

5|$|Three Australian C-17s were {{deployed}} to Japan {{as part of}} Operation Pacific Assist following the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March. The first aircraft departed Australia {{two days after the}} disaster carrying 75 <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>personnel,</b> most of whom were members of Fire and Rescue NSW. After delivering the personnel to Yokota Air Base, the C-17 remained in Japan to provide additional airlift to the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). In this role, the C-17 moved elements of the Japanese 15th Brigade from Okinawa to Honshu, and also transported supplies from a JSDF base in Hokkaido. On 21/22 March, two other C-17s (including one temporarily brought back from the Middle East) flew a large water cannon system from RAAF Base Pearce in Western Australia to Yokota; owned by the Bechtel corporation, the water cannon formed part of the efforts to bring the badly damaged Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant under control. With the arrival of these aircraft, all three of the available Australian C-17s were in Japan (the fourth was still undergoing maintenance at Amberley). The RAAF maintained a C-17, two flight crews and support personnel in Japan until 25 March. By the end of this deployment the Australian aircraft had conducted 31 sorties and delivered 450 tonnes of cargo. No. 36 Squadron maintained a C-17 in the Middle East over most of this period. Also in March 2011, Smith stated that the Australian Government would probably provide C-17s to transport humanitarian supplies to Libya if the United Nations requested assistance.|$|E

Rescuers, feeling that help was not coming fast enough, lifted the dead and wounded, wrapped them in coats and bundled them into cars {{to get them to}} the nearest hospital. Garda Síochána squad cars escorted surgeons through the crowded streets to attend the wounded. Many people, on finding out what had happened, went straight away to offer blood.|$|E
25|$|The World Trade Center Health Registry was {{established}} in 2002 by ATSDR and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to track the long-term {{physical and mental health}} effects of the September 11 attacks. The registry contains more than 71,000 people who lived, worked, or went to school near the World Trade Center site, as well as <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>personnel</b> who were involved in rescue and recovery efforts. It is the largest post-disaster health registry in the United States. Researchers use the registry to study the health effects of the disaster and to develop public health recommendations for future disasters. A 2009 study based on registry data found that posttraumatic stress disorder and asthma were the two most commonly reported conditions among registry participants 5 to 6 years after the disaster. The study found that 19% of adult participants reported new posttraumatic stress symptoms, and 10% of adult participants reported developing new asthma.|$|E

Although this method of transport supports aquatic and riparian zone habitats, it is vulnerable to chemical contamination from transportation accidents where the river is {{in close proximity to}} highway 101 and Northwestern Pacific Railroad transportation corridors in locations like the canyon between Cloverdale and Hopland. This vulnerability was demonstrated in March 1982 when a tank car of formaldehyde was vandalized in Ukiah. <b>Emergency</b> <b>response</b> <b>personnel</b> were able to clean up approximately half of the [...] spilled, and a fortuitous combination of Lake Mendocino reservoir inventory and late winter storms helped flush the remainder through the river and into the ocean before local water storage inventories were exhausted.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Individuals {{with disabilities}} {{experience}} more negative outcomes due to natural and manmade disasters and emergencies than do people without disabilities. This vulnerability {{appears to be}} {{due in part to}} knowledge gaps among public health and safety <b>emergency</b> planning and <b>response</b> <b>personnel</b> (responders). We assessed the effectiveness of an online program to increase emergency responder knowledge about <b>emergency</b> planning and <b>response</b> for individuals with disabilities. METHODS: Researchers developed an online course designed to teach public health, emergency planning and management, and other first <b>response</b> <b>personnel</b> about appropriate, efficient, and equitable <b>emergency</b> planning, <b>response,</b> interaction, and communication with children and adults with disabilities before, during, and after disasters or emergencies. Course features included an ongoing storyline, exercises embedded in the form of real-life scenarios, and game-like features such as points and timed segments. RESULTS: Evaluation measures indicated significant pre- to post-test gains in learner knowledge and simulated applied skills. CONCLUSION: An online program using scenarios and simulations is an effective way to make disability-related training available {{to a wide variety of}} emergency responders across geographically disparate areas...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the mass}} {{casualty}} potential of an aviation emergency, {{the speed with which}} <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> equipment and <b>personnel</b> arrive {{at the scene of the}} emergency is of paramount importance. Their arrival and initial mission to secure the aircraft against all hazards, particularly fire, increases the survivability of the passengers and crew on board. Airport firefighters have advanced training in the application of firefighting foams, dry chemical and clean agents used to extinguish burning aviation fuel in and around an aircraft in order to maintain a path for evacuating passengers to exit the fire hazard area. Further, should fire either be encountered in the cabin or extend there from an external fire, the ARFF responders must work to control/extinguish these fires as well.|$|R

EMI is fully accredited by the International Association for Continuing Education and Training (IACET) and the American Council on Education (ACE). The instruction is based upon the principles of Emergency Management and instructional systems design, which create a framework within whole communities to reduce vulnerability to hazards and to cope with disasters.
