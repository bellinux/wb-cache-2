5|$|The {{commander}} of the PT boat force in the Southwest Pacific, Commander Morton C. Mumma, opposed building extensive PT boat facilities at Arawe as he had sufficient bases and Japanese barges normally sailed along the north coast of New Britain. Mumma took his concerns to Carpender and Barbey, who eventually agreed {{that he would not}} be required to establish a base there <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it unnecessary. Instead, he assigned six boats stationed at Dreger Harbor in New Guinea and Kiriwina Island to operate along the south coast of New Britain east of Arawe each night, and asked only for emergency refuelling facilities at Arawe.|$|E
5|$|With {{almost four}} years gone in his government's five-year term, in mid-1939 Mackenzie King {{considered}} an election and asked British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in early August <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> anything was likely to happen on the international scene. Chamberlain warned of unsettled conditions on the German—Polish border; Britain had promised to assist Polish independence {{in the event of}} war. Mackenzie King decided to wait to hold an election. On 1 September, Germany invaded Poland. Mackenzie King recalled Parliament into session beginning 7 September, and Canada declared war on Germany. Before adjourning on 13 September, Parliament passed legislation creating a Department of Munitions and Supply.|$|E
25|$|The {{state of}} the {{military}} medical corps before Augustus is unclear. Corpsmen certainly existed {{at least for the}} administration of first aid and were enlisted soldiers rather than civilians. The commander of the legion was held responsible for removing the wounded from the field and insuring that they got sufficient care and time to recover. He could quarter troops in private domiciles <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> necessary. Authors who have written of Roman military activities before Augustus, such as Livy, mention that wounded troops retired to population centers to recover.|$|E

25|$|Grobbelaar was {{retained}} by three of Liverpool's greatest managers; Paisley, Fagan and Dalglish, {{over a period}} of 13 years. His strengths were his gymnastic-like agility, and an unflappable confidence. He was never afraid to be seen to berate his defenders <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> they had given easy opportunities to the opposition, such as in his verbal assault on Jim Beglin in the first all Merseyside FA Cup final against Everton in 1986. Over the course of his Liverpool career he won more medals than any of his contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|Falcone {{was born}} in 1939 to a middle-class family in the Via Castrofilippo near the seaport {{district}} La Kalsa, a neighbourhood of central Palermo that suffered extensive destruction by aerial attacks during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. His father, Arturo Falcone, {{the director of a}} provincial chemical laboratory, was married to Luisa Bentivegna. Giovanni had two older sisters, Anna and Maria. Falcone's parents emphasised the importance of hard work, bravery and patriotism; he later said they 'expected the maximum' from him. At school Falcone would get into fights with larger children <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> his friends were being picked on.|$|E
25|$|He was {{archbishop}} for 42 years, unparalleled in Sweden, {{and during}} his time he was often in conflicts with the monarchs. In 1539 his brother Olaus {{was sentenced to death}} by the King over some arguments, and Laurentius was among those forced to sign the death sentence. It has been disputed whether Laurentius was doing this because of a weak character or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it better to formally obey so that he could continue to spread the reformation ideas. Olaus did eventually get pardoned in 1542, much due to his influential friends, but he was forced to keep a low profile, leaving the role of main reformator solely to Laurentius.|$|E

25|$|One figure {{caught in}} the middle was the Rector, the Rev. Abraham Beach. Beach sympathized with the Patriots aims, but could not support {{rebellion}} as a means to the end. Moreover, as an Anglican cleric, he had taken oaths to support the Crown, and the liturgy included prayers for the King. One morning as he was preparing for service he was threatened with death if he offered such prayers, as a result of which he decided to close the church {{for the duration of the}} war. Being a faithful cleric and a moderate at heart, he continued his ministry even during the war, worshiping in the homes of sympathetic parishioners, and often deleting the prayers for the King <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> such would offend delicate sensibilities.|$|E
25|$|White House {{correspondent}} Seth Kantor — who was {{a passenger}} in the motorcade — testified that after President Kennedy was shot, he had visited Parkland Hospital while the wounded President was receiving care. Kantor said that {{as he entered the}} hospital, at about 1:30 pm, he felt a tug on his coat. He turned around to see Jack Ruby who called him by his first name and shook his hand; {{he said that he had}} become acquainted with Ruby while he was a reporter for the Dallas Times Herald newspaper. According to Kantor, Ruby asked him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that it would be a good idea for him to close his nightclubs for the next three nights because of the tragedy and Kantor responded with thinking that doing so would be a good idea.|$|E
25|$|On December 5, 1947, Einstein and Morgenstern {{accompanied}} Gödel to his U.S. citizenship exam, {{where they}} acted as witnesses. Gödel had confided {{in them that}} he had discovered an inconsistency in the U.S. Constitution that could allow the U.S. to become a dictatorship. Einstein and Morgenstern were concerned that their friend's unpredictable behavior might jeopardize his application. Fortunately, the judge {{turned out to be}} Phillip Forman, who knew Einstein and had administered the oath at Einstein's own citizenship hearing. Everything went smoothly until Forman happened to ask Gödel <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> a dictatorship like the Nazi regime could happen in the U.S. Gödel then started to explain his discovery to Forman. Forman understood what was going on, cut Gödel off, and moved the hearing on to other questions and a routine conclusion.|$|E

25|$|Fangio, unlike later Formula One drivers, {{started his}} racing career at a mature age {{and was the}} oldest driver in many of his races. During his career, drivers raced with almost no {{protective}} equipment on circuits with no safety features, although F1 cars back in the 1950s were a lot slower, less physically demanding to drive and less advanced than F1 cars 4 and more decades later. Fangio had no compunction about leaving a team, even after a successful year or even during a season, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{he would have a}} better chance with a better car. As was then common, several of his race results were shared with teammates after he took over their car during races when his own had technical problems. His rivals included Alberto Ascari, Giuseppe Farina and Stirling Moss. Throughout his career, Fangio was backed by funding from the Argentine government of Juan Perón.|$|E
25|$|Osteen has {{generally}} avoided discussing controversial {{issues such as}} gay marriage, abortion, and politics. However, when asked, Osteen {{said that he is}} opposed to same-sex marriage. Osteen refuses to preach about homosexuality due to his belief that God likes, accepts, and approves of all people. When asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> God approves of homosexuality, Osteen said homosexuality is a sin according to the Scripture, but gay people are welcome in his church. He has said sin is human nature, nobody's perfect, and he is not judging but, God is the judge. Osteen has also stated he believes a person can be freed from a lifestyle of homosexuality; it is a process and God can free anyone of any sin or addiction. Osteen has also stressed he does not approve of homophobia, but his faith is based on his reading of the Scriptures. He has said the church has a tendency to become overly focused on single issues (such as homosexuality) to the point of neglecting others.|$|E
25|$|The {{essential}} {{feature of}} the morality built upon the basis of Hartmann's philosophy is the realization that all is one and that, while every attempt to gain happiness is illusory, yet before deliverance is possible, all forms of the illusion must appear and be tried to the utmost. Even he who recognizes the vanity of life best serves the highest aims by giving himself up to the illusion, and living as eagerly as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> life good. It is only through the constant attempt to gain happiness that people can learn the desirability of nothingness; and when this knowledge has become universal, or at least general, deliverance will come and the world will cease. No better proof of the rational nature {{of the universe is}} needed than that afforded by the different ways in which men have hoped to find happiness and so have been led unconsciously to work for the final goal. The first of these is the hope of good in the present, the confidence in the pleasures of this world, such as was felt by the Greeks. This is followed by the Christian transference of happiness to another and better life, to which in turn succeeds the illusion that looks for happiness in progress, and dreams of a future made worth while by the achievements of science. All alike are empty promises, and known as such in the final stage, which sees all human desires as equally vain and the only good in the peace of Nirvana.|$|E

25|$|Following Stones' River, feuding {{broke out}} between Bragg and his corps and {{division}} commanders over {{who was responsible}} for the Confederate defeat; several officers stated that Bragg had lost the confidence of the army. When he learned of the dispute, Confederate President Jefferson Davis sent Joseph Johnston to inspect the army and take command <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it necessary to relieve Bragg. Johnston however refused to take command of the army. In the summer of 1863, Rosecrans began an offensive, generally known as the Tullahoma Campaign, a name taken from the location of the Confederate headquarters at the time. Due to the low level of the river, Bragg felt compelled to retreat back to his supply center of Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he established his headquarters. When the Union forces halted following the campaign, Bragg took the opportunity to make several command changes in the army. Hardee was transferred to Mississippi in July and replaced by D.H. Hill. Bragg's department was reorganized into the Department of Tennessee, which covered Alabama north of the Tennessee River and Georgia north of Atlanta; the Department of East Tennessee, now commanded by Simon Buckner, was merged with Bragg's department and Buckner's troops were designated the Third Corps. The cavalry was reorganized into two corps commanded by Wheeler and Forrest; a two-division Reserve Corps was also organized under the command of W.H.T. Walker. The Confederate government agreed to transfer James Longstreet's First Corps, Army of Northern Virginia to the army during this time, but due to the loss of Knoxville, Longstreet had to travel by rail through the Carolinas and Atlanta to northern Georgia; the movement started on September 9.|$|E
