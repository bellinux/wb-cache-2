EBAC operates independently from these parent organisations. The ESC is the highest cardiovascular scientific authority in Europe {{and the most important}} provider of Continuing Medical Education (CME) in cardiology. The UEMS officially represents the European medical specialists at the European Union (EU). The UEMS consists of different mono-specialist sections, among which the Cardiology Section.

As a consequence of the establishment of EACCME, the mono-specialist sections of the UEMS together with the different European scientific societies started to create accreditation boards with the aim to assess international CME activities in accordance with the regulations of UEMS and EACCME. EBAC was founded in 2000. EBAC accreditation is complimentary to national CME accreditation.

This followed nearly two decades of efforts {{in a variety of}} programmes supported by international donor agencies, and others that provided experience and field testing of peer review systems for schools of public health in Europe. The Association of Schools of Public Health in the European Region (ASPHER) Public Health Education European Review (PEER) project, devised with the aid of WHO EURO in the early 1990 s and later by the Open Society Institute (OSI) within the framework of a joint ASPHER-OSI Program from 2000 - 2005, helped to develop a cadre of expertise on the process of international peer review and standards that are compatible with a full accreditation process.

Most higher education institutions identify a list of expected graduate attributes or outcomes that are incorporated in their educational programs to be accredited by an accrediting professional body such as Engineers Australia (EA), Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology (ABET) in the United States, and the <b>European</b> <b>Accreditation</b> of Engineering Programs (EUR-ACE) in Europe.

Practical examples, taken directly from the everyday world of environmental laboratories, are presented and explained. However, the approach is very general and should be applicable to most testing laboratories in the chemical field. The handbook covers all steps in the analytical chain from the arrival of the sample in the laboratory until the data has been reported.

IFCC recognises that ISO 15189 : 2007 - Medical laboratories - Particular requirements for quality and competence, encompasses all the assessment criteria specified in the policy statement and as such should form the basis for the accreditation of laboratories.

40|$|AbstractThe European Community {{is based}} on a series of {{treaties}} and legal decisions, which result from preliminary documents prepared long before by different organizations and lobbies. The European union of medical specialists (Union européenne des médecins specialists [UEMS]) came into being in order to address the questions raised by European directives (e. g., free circulation of people and services, reciprocal recognition of diplomas, medical training, quality improvements). The specialty sections of the UEMS contribute actively to this work. The physical and rehabilitation medicine (PRM) section is composed of three committees: the PRM board is devoted to initial and continuing education and has published a harmonized teaching programme and organized a certification procedure, which can be considered as a European seal of quality; the Clinical Affairs Committee is concerned with the quality of PRM care, and it has set up a <b>European</b> <b>accreditation</b> system for PRM programs of care, which will help to describe PRM clinical activity more concretely; and the Professional Practice Committee works on the fields of competence in our specialty.
