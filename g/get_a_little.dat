Let us <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stronger in it and we shall once more continue on our quest. That {{is why we have}} invited Gordon Craig. After wandering about in search of new ways, we shall again return to realism for more strength. I do not doubt that every abstraction on the stage, such as impressionism, for instance, could be attained by way of a more refined and deeper realism. All other ways are false and dead.|$|E

I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E

Chaney and Slezak both wondered about the extra girls in the number, but Lynch simply said, [...] "Nice to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Troubletones action separate from (but still part of) the New Directions". Lynch's grade was a [...] "B", in part because Mercedes's voice [...] "seemed strangely buried".|$|E
500|$|When {{introducing}} the composition to Lennon, McCartney {{assured him that}} he would [...] "fix" [...] the line [...] "the movement you need is on your shoulder", reasoning that [...] "it's a stupid expression; it sounds like a parrot."

500|$|The {{production}} {{on the album}} was mainly handled by Easy Mo Bee and The Hitmen. Cheo H. Coker of Rolling Stone depicted the beats as [...] "heavy bottomed and slick, but B.I.G.'s rhymes are the showstoppers. The tracks only enhance them, whether it's the live bass driving a menacing undercurrent or [...] use of bluesy guitar and wah-wah feedback" [...] and that the production is used to [...] "push the rapper to new heights." [...] The production is mainly sample-based with the samples varying from the percussion of funk tracks to the vocals of hip hop songs.

500|$|Allen's {{publication}} of the images encountered a mixed reception.

[...] Jennie Lightweis-Gof was critical of the [...] "profoundly aestheticized readings" [...] of Laura's body. She argued that writers tried to garner empathy for the Nelsons by focusing on Laura's appearance, producing empathy qua eroticism. Allen, for example, referred to Laura's [...] "indissoluble femininity". Leightweis-Gof offered this {{as an example of}} [...] "the Gaze": [...] "the sense that every function of the female body is sexualized and aestheticized". Wendy Wolters argued that whenever Laura Nelson is viewed as a [...] "fetishized and feminized object", she is violated again.|$|E
500|$|Thrale {{explains}} that her {{book is not}} for [...] "diary-keeping in the strict sense" [...] when she writes: [...] "It is many Years since Doctor Samuel Johnson advised me to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Book, and write in it all the little Anecdotes which might come to my Knowledge, all the Observations I might make or hear; all the Verses never likely to be published, and in fine ev'ry thing which struck me at the Time. Mr Thrale has now treated me with a Repository, - and provided it with the pompous Title of Thraliana; I must endeavour to fill it with Nonsense new and old." [...] These encouraging remarks from Johnson set {{the theme of the}} work as it became a new [...] "Johnsoniana" [...] collection. In particular, she transferred her previous notes and documentations about Johnson's life into the collection.|$|E

The song begins with the phrase, [...] "He is the Dark Knight, he is professional." [...] The piece incorporates audio clips from the incident {{through the use of}} sampling. The chorus {{of the song}} references Bale's use of the word professional in his altercation: [...] "Oh, whoo wow / He is professional / But I think he's lost control". Lyrics include: [...] "Swing Kid with a violent streak", [...] "Step back, stay out of his light / Better not try to put up a fight / Newsies will get you tonight / 'Cause they're professional!", and [...] "Don't look too deep in his eyes/he can't hide what's inside of his mind/and it might <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit ugly/and you might meet an American Psycho".|$|E
