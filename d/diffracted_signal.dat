The requirement for constructive interference in a diffraction experiment means that in momentum or reciprocal space the values of momentum transfer where constructive interference occurs also form a lattice (the reciprocal lattice). For example, the reciprocal lattice of a simple cubic real-space lattice is also a simple cubic structure. Another example, the reciprocal lattice of an FCC crystal real-space lattice is a BCC structure, and vice versa. The aim of the Ewald sphere is to determine which lattice planes (represented by the grid points on the reciprocal lattice) will result in a <b>diffracted</b> <b>signal</b> for a given wavelength, , of incident radiation.|$|E

40|$|Characterisation of the {{acoustic}} {{properties of materials}} for underwater acoustics is often carried out by measuring the transmitted and/or reflected pressure signals after insonification of a test panel by an incident acoustic wave. For this method to be reliable, the incident and transmitted (or reflected) signals arriving at the hydrophone receiver should be well separated in time (enabling windowing techniques to be applied), and the <b>diffracted</b> <b>signals</b> from the panel edge should not contaminate the measured signal. At low kilohertz frequencies, these conditions are difficult to achieve for the size of panel and test tank commonly available. This paper describes a method for discriminating against the <b>diffracted</b> <b>signals</b> by use of a planar array of hydrophones as the receiver. The sound source used for the method is a parametric array to provide some source directivity and to provide short broadband signals for analysis. The method is demonstrated by application to the measurement of reflection loss and transmission loss for test panels at frequencies of 1 kHz to 10 kHz under simulated ocean conditions using a specialised test chamber capable of controlling the water temperature and hydrostatic pressure during measurements. A comparison is shown with results obtained with a single hydrophone, and a discussion is given of the number and position of hydrophones in the array...|$|R

40|$|Texture, {{which is}} {{described}} the specific distribution of grain orientations in materials science, {{is known as}} a characteristic to influence the electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and chemical properties of metallic films [1]. Generally, the texture of thin films is characterized by standard č/ 2 č X-ray Diffraction (XRD) or the XRD pole figure measurement. However, as the thickness of a film reduces to a thinner range such as below than 100 ~ 200 nm, the texture measurement using XRD becomes very time-consuming and usually obtains distorted information, because of the very small amount of <b>diffracting</b> <b>signals</b> [2]. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) is recently another technique to determine the individual grain orientations of polycrystalline materials in a scanning electron microscope.

Moreover, EBSD signals are taken from the backscattere...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to {{the reflection of the}} signal by the floor, ceiling and walls of the indoor environment (reflections from furniture and other objects are not considered), the signal is also scattered by moving human body at, e.g., position A and C (see Figure 1). As the person approaches position B, the signal is subject to both scattering and diffraction from the top and side of the human body. Note that the strength of the scattered and <b>diffracted</b> <b>signals</b> are position dependent and change as the person walks though the propagation environment. Furthermore, the random movement of people create time varying channel conditions. Characterization of the Doppler spectra is thus important for the determination of the time variance of the wireless channel. Other important parameters are the shadowing and inter-shadowing intervals which are needed when simulating the crossing of the LOS path by multiple bodies. In subsequent sections, we discuss each of the aforementioned propagation mechanisms for signal effect by moving human bodies.|$|R
40|$|The {{condition}} of roads and pavements near their surfaces {{is of interest}} to asset management, in particular of the roads and pavement assets, but also of assets buried under the roads or pavements such as cables or pipes. In many cases the decay of the near surface material results in small air or water filled regions within the tarmac/concrete/stone structure. The decay causes little change in the electromagnetic reflection or delay characteristics of these regions as measured by traditional GPR equipment. Signals launched along the surface are diffracted out of the surface by fractures and discontinuities within the surface. The change between a uniform and a fractured surface is seen to be more readily apparent in the direction normal to the surface, particularly at higher frequencies above about 3 GHz for fractures and for voids {{of the order of}} about 2 mm and above.

These effects degrade the Bragg diffraction on femtosecond time scales and gate the ultrafast imaging. This process is intensity and resolution dependent. At high intensities the signal is gated by the ionization affecting low resolution information first.

40|$|It {{is both an}} {{experimental}} and theoretical fact that imaging of scatterers using bandlimited signals results in {{what is known as}} a diffraction-limited image. As a consequence, the best possible resolution obtained from a diffraction-limited system is about half a wavelength of the illuminating wavefield. In the near-field imaging systems used in optics this problem has been overcome by measuring the contribution of evanescent wavefields. However, in case of seismics, the sources and receivers are placed {{more than three times the}} wavelength away from the target and the evanescent wavefields are highly attenuated and thus fall below the noise level. Nevertheless, super-resolution imaging (i. e. imaging beyond the diffraction-limit) is possible by utilizing the time-reversal MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm. The main idea is then to perform a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the Multistatic Response (MSR) matrix to obtain the source and receiver side singular vectors which transforms the active experiment into a purely passive one. These singular vectors contain interaction information about the different scatterers, which is the key to obtain super-resolution. Though this algorithm can provide a super-resolved localization of point targets, it is also highly noise sensitive. In this thesis, we propose a phase-coherent time-reversal MUSIC (PC-MUSIC) algorithm, which utilizes the band of frequencies present in the measured data and exhibits a phase-coherent nature of the time-reversal operator. The noise present in the resulting monochromatic time-reversal MUSIC image can now be minimized by averaging over a smaller band of frequencies. The robustness and super-resolution ability of PC-MUSIC has been demonstrated employing both experimental ultrasonic data and numerical simulations based on the Foldy-Lax interaction model. Both time-reversal MUSIC and its phase-coherent version, PC-MUSIC, are originally designed to localize point like targets. In seismic or Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) signals, the contributions from point like targets are carried by the diffracted wavefield. However, <b>diffracted</b> <b>signals</b> both in seismic and GPR are often much weaker than the specular reflections making it difficult to utilize them for super-resolution imaging. In this thesis, we propose to separate the <b>diffracted</b> <b>signals</b> from the reflected ones using two parameterized diffraction traveltime approximations. The first technique is based on a modified version of the Common Reflection Surface (CRS) technique. The second diffraction traveltime approximation is based on the REplacement Medium (REM) approach derived in this thesis for applications in a laterally smooth velocity field. The actual diffraction enhancement (or separation) is then carried out by stacking the data along the two approximate diffraction traveltime surfaces with optimal parameters determined using a coherency measure. As possible coherency measure candidates we tested both conventional Semblance and higher-resolution coherency measures like MUSIC, Eigen Vector (EV) and Minimum Variance (MV). The higher-resolution coherency measures, originally developed for narrowband Direction Of Arrival (DOA) estimation, were extended to handle the highly correlated and wideband seismic and GPR signals. From this extensive testing, employing both controlled data (Marmousi) as well as field data (both GPR and seismic), we concluded that the MUSIC coherency measure provides the most optimal diffraction traveltime parameters. After separating the diffractions from the reflections by stacking along the optimized diffraction traveltime surfaces, we performed diffraction imaging using both conventional Kirchhoff migration and a new high-resolution MUSIC like imaging algorithm known as Semblance balanced MUSIC (SB-MUSIC). This new algorithm outperformed classical migration when applied to various controlled and field data...|$|R
