40|$|<b>Drugs</b> <b>policy</b> {{is back on}} the {{political}} agenda. The prevailing repressive style of <b>drugs</b> <b>policy</b> has recently been questioned. After analysing European <b>drugs</b> <b>policies,</b> it is shown that there is no clear-cut evidence that different national <b>drugs</b> <b>policy</b> approaches really work in the expected direction. However, there are indications that the market mechanism works: prices for heroin and cocaine are positively affected by the quantity seized by police forces. Higher drug prices moderate death rates of drug addicts. However, repressive <b>drugs</b> <b>policies</b> captured not by prices but by country-specific effects do not have these clear effects. For instance, the liberal Netherlands has the lowest drug prices and a comparatively low number of deaths from drugs.

40|$|AbstractPolicymakers tend {{to focus}} on {{improving}} patented <b>drug</b> <b>policies</b> because they are under pressure from patients, physicians, and manufacturers to increase access to novel therapies. The success of pharmaceutical innovation over the last few decades has led to the availability of many off-patent drugs to treat disease areas with the greatest public health need. Therefore, the success of public health programs in improving the health status of the total population is highly dependent on the efficiency of generic <b>drug</b> <b>policies.</b> The objective of this article was to explore factors influencing the true efficiency of generic prescription <b>drug</b> <b>policies</b> in supporting public health initiatives in the developed world. Health care decision makers often assess the efficiency of generic <b>drug</b> <b>policies</b> by the level of price erosion and market share of generics. Drug quality, bioequivalence, in some cases drug formulations, supply reliability, medical adherence and persistence, health outcomes, and nondrug costs, however, are also attributes of success for generic <b>drug</b> <b>policies.</b> Further methodological research is needed to measure and improve the efficiency of generic <b>drug</b> <b>policies.</b> This also requires extension of the evidence base of the impact of generic drugs, partly based on real-world evidence. Multicriteria decision analysis may assist policymakers and researchers to evaluate the true value of generic drugs...|$|R
