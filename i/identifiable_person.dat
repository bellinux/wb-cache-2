25|$|In {{the first}} years of the next decade, two {{prominent}} foreign citizens were perp-walked by American law enforcement agencies. Viktor Bout, a Russian long wanted by the U.S. and other governments for arms smuggling, was arrested in Thailand and taken past waiting media by federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents upon his extradition in 2010. The next year, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then director of the International Monetary Fund and considered a leading candidate to challenge Nicolas Sarkozy in the 2012 French presidential election, was arrested and charged with the attempted rape of a hotel housekeeper. French journalists covering the incident in New York were stunned into silence when a handcuffed Strauss-Kahn was brought by them. In France, where it is illegal to publish pictures of an <b>identifiable</b> <b>person</b> in handcuffs or police custody unless they have been convicted, the images sparked considerable public outrage.|$|E

40|$|Privacy {{regulations}} and {{laws have been}} introduced to control handling of information about persons. Compliance with these {{regulations and}} laws presents a significant challenge for organizations holding data about <b>identifiable</b> <b>persons.</b> A privacy impact assessment (PIA) is an important instrument for ensuring conformity to regulatory requirements, determining risks, and evaluating privacy protections. This paper scrutinizes recent approaches to PIA and introduces a foundation for such a process. This foundation is used to reformulate basic notions such as definition, handling, and uses of personal identifiable information. As an example case, we apply our methodology to the 2010 US Department of Homeland Security’s guidance on PIA...|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "identifiable victim effect" [...] {{refers to}} the {{tendency}} of individuals to offer greater aid when a specific, <b>identifiable</b> <b>person</b> ("victim") is observed under hardship, as compared to a large, vaguely defined group with the same need.

50|$|In {{criminology}} {{and criminal}} law, {{a victim of}} a crime is an <b>identifiable</b> <b>person</b> who has been harmed individually and directly by the perpetrator, rather than by society as a whole. However, this may not always be the case, as with victims of white collar crime, who may not be clearly identifiable or directly linked to crime against a particular individual. Victims of white collar crime are often denied their status as victims by the social construction of the concept (Croall, 2001). The concept also remains a controversial topic within women's studies.|$|E

40|$|This Article {{proposes that}} any {{individual}} has standing to challenge government action that exposes {{her to an}} increased lifetime risk of 1 in 1 million or greater of death or serious injury. Because most regulation involves statistical probabilities of harm, a plaintiff challenging a government regulatory action or inaction as insufficiently protective cannot demonstrate {{that he or she}} would likely be harmed by the allegedly inadequate regulation, but merely that a different regulation might reduce the probability of future harm. The beneficiaries of a suit seeking better government regulation are, therefore, statistical <b>persons</b> rather than <b>identifiable</b> <b>persons.</b> By contrast, standing law is largely {{based on the assumption that}} only <b>identifiable</b> <b>persons</b> with specific injuries can sue in Article III federal courts, although some decisions have explicitly or implicitly allowed statistical standing based on a probability of future injury. In Natural Res. Def. Council v. EPA (NRDC), the District of Columbia Circuit recognized standing in a case involving probabilistic future risk where there was evidence demonstrating that two to four members of the NRDC 2 ̆ 7 s nearly half a million members would develop skin cancer during their lifetimes as a result of an EPA 2 ̆ 7 s rule. Professor Elliott has recently argued that the NRDC decision has the troubling implication that large public interest organizations have greater standing rights than small organizations or individuals because it is statistically more likely that one of their members would be harmed by a government regulation that is allegedly insufficiently protective of public safety. Under the Article 2 ̆ 7 s proposed 1 in 1 million standard, an individual or a member of a small association would have the same rights as a large organization. The proposed test would reduce the inconsistencies in how different judges or judicial circuits apply today 2 ̆ 7 s vague standing test. Congress could overrule this prudential judge-made standard and impose a different standard in a statute whenever it chose to do so...|$|R

Or subjective poetry and becomes a more tangible puram poetry.

50|$|In modern art-historical usage {{the term}} tronie is {{typically}} restricted to figures {{not intended to}} depict an <b>identifiable</b> <b>person,</b> {{so it is a}} form of genre painting in a portrait format. Typically a painted head or bust only, if concentrating on the facial expression, but often half-length when featured in an exotic costume, tronies might be based on studies from life or use the features of actual sitters. The picture was typically sold on the art market without identification of the sitter, and was not commissioned and retained by the sitter as portraits normally were. Similar unidentified figures treated as history paintings would normally be given a title from the classical world, for example the Rembrandt painting now known as Saskia as Flora.|$|E
50|$|Brouwer {{played an}} {{important}} role in the development of the genre of the 'tronie'. The term tronie typically refers to figure studies not intended to depict an <b>identifiable</b> <b>person,</b> but rather to investigate varieties of expression. As such tronies are a form of genre painting in a portrait format. Adriaen Brouwer contributed to the genre as he had a talent for expressiveness. His work gave a face to lower-class figures by infusing their images with recognizable and vividly expressed human emotions—anger, joy, pain, and pleasure. His Youth Making a Face (c. 1632/1635, National Gallery of Art) shows a young man with a satirical and mocking gesture which humanises him, however uninviting he may appear. Brouwer's vigorous application of paint in this composition, with his characteristically short, unmodulated brushstrokes, increases the dramatic effect.|$|E
