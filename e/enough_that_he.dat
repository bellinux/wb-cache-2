5|$|His {{return to}} {{football}} was successful <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> signed for Chelmsford City in the Southern League for the 1976–77 season.

5|$|In 1996, Favre was {{temporarily}} {{banned by the}} NFL from drinking alcohol after he admitted he was addicted to Vicodin and spent 46 days at a drug rehab clinic {{before the start of}} the season. His condition was serious <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> suffered a potentially deadly seizure.|$|E
5|$|After {{rest and}} recovery, the {{regiment}} {{moved to the}} Fromelles sector of the front in mid-October. Here Kippenberger volunteered for sniper duty despite not being known for his accuracy as a marksman. He served in this capacity until he was badly wounded in the arm by shrapnel on 10 November 1916. Although he eventually recovered from his wound, {{at the time it}} was serious <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was repatriated to New Zealand and discharged from the NZEF in April 1917.|$|E
5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt she was a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E

5|$|Clinton has {{identified}} two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, {{that contributed to}} his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy. The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 I Have a Dream speech on TV, which impressed him <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> later memorized it.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{attended}} Charleston's Episcopal Porter-Gaud School, {{where he}} participated in several school plays {{and contributed to the}} school newspaper but was not highly motivated academically. During his adolescence, he briefly fronted A Shot in the Dark, a Rolling Stones cover band. When he was younger, he had hoped to study marine biology, but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage. The damage was severe <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving. The damage also left him deaf in his right ear.|$|E
5|$|Led by Jim Peplinski, an alumni {{game was}} {{organized}} for Saturday, February 19, at McMahon. The game featured 14 {{members of the}} Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup championship team, including Lanny McDonald, Al MacInnis, Joel Otto, Theoren Fleury and Joe Nieuwendyk. For Nieuwendyk, {{at the time the}} General Manager of the Dallas Stars, the chance to participate in the game was important <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> chose to overlook the chronic pain in his back when he is on skates. Immensely popular forward Craig Conroy, who retired only {{a few weeks before the}} game, also took part for Calgary.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} built for strong showings in the classic cycle races, and {{includes}} the best classics rider from the 2010 season, world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara. Though Cancellara did not win any race that awarded points to the UCI World Tour, he consistently placed highly <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was briefly the world number one rider {{in the midst of}} the classics season. Thanks to Cancellara's performances and the Schleck brothers both finishing on the podium at Liège–Bastogne–Liège, the team was also in the top spot for a time.|$|E
5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, {{and it would}} never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenses <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not risk an attempt to reinstate protections for Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} {{game of the}} 1992 season, Majkowski injured a {{ligament}} in his ankle against the Cincinnati Bengals, an injury severe <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be out for four weeks. Favre replaced Majkowski {{for the remainder of}} the game. Favre fumbled four times during the course of the game, a performance poor enough that the crowd chanted for Favre to be removed in favor of another Packers backup quarterback at the time, Ty Detmer. However, down 23–17 with 1:07 left in the game, the Packers started an offensive series on their own 8-yard line. Favre then completed a 42-yard pass to wide receiver Sterling Sharpe. Three plays later, Favre threw the game–winning touchdown pass to wide receiver Kitrick Taylor with 13 seconds remaining.|$|E

5|$|Inquirer {{journalist}} Uriah Hunt Painter {{was at the}} First Battle of Bull Run in 1861, {{a battle}} which ended in a Confederate victory. Initial reports from the government claimed a Union victory, but The Inquirer went with Painter's firsthand account. Crowds threatened to burn The Inquirers building down because of the report. Another report, this time about General George Meade, angered Meade <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> punished Edward Crapsey, the reporter who wrote it. Crapsey and other war correspondents later decided to attribute any victories of the Army of the Potomac, Meade's command, to Ulysses S. Grant, commander of the entire Union army. Any defeats of the Army of the Potomac would be attributed to Meade.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer {{to feel a little}} sympathy for him, but not <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would lose his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Oryol was {{probably}} hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch shells, and 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although {{the ship had}} many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side, she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch shells and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch shell that struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> later died of his wounds. Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, Dmowski, {{increasingly}} {{convinced of}} Russia's impending defeat, decided that {{to support the}} cause of Polish independence he should go abroad to campaign on behalf of Poland in the capitals of the western Allies. During his lobbying efforts, his friends included such opinion makers as the British journalist Wickham Steed. In particular, Dmowski was very successful in France, where he made a very favorable impression on public opinion. He gave a series of lecture at Cambridge University, which impressed the local faculty <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was given a honorary doctorate. In August 1917, in Paris, he created a new Polish National Committee aimed at rebuilding a Polish state. That year he also published, at his own expense, Problems of Central and Eastern Europe, that he soon distributed among numerous English speaking diplomats. He was a vocal critic of Austro-Hungary, and campaigned {{for the creation of}} a number of Slavic states (including for the Czechs, Hungarians and Romanians) in its place. Within the Polish political community, he opposed those who supported allying themselves with Germany and Austria-Hungary, including supporters of a vague German proposal for a Regency Kingdom of Poland, with undefined borders, that Germany promised to create after World War I (while in secret, actually planning to strip it of up to 30,000 square kilometers for German colonization after the removal of its Polish population).|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the first}} series of Cold Feet began in January 1998. Bullen {{continued}} his method of developing storylines based on his own life; {{he and his wife}} had their first child in the latter half of 1997, so he integrated their experiences into the storyline of characters Pete and Jenny, who have their first child in Cold Feets first episode. Throughout 1998, he retained his job at the BBC, working on three radio shows per week at the same time as writing Cold Feet. During the second series he cut back to one show per week. By the time of the third series in 2000, he felt confident <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have a future in television that he was able to give up radio presenting completely. He moved from his home in London to Cambridge, where he was able to write for two full days a week and at evenings and weekends.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was inspired}} by the multi-character system of Before Crisis, while the naming of magic styles after weapons of war made reference to first-person shooters. The combat was designed to be filled with tension and portray each playable character's personality on the battlefield. The Eidolons were originally not controlled in realtime, but during the development of Ifrit, Tabata did some testing with real-time commands. The results impressed him <b>enough</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> decided to overcome the technical difficulties involved and make the Eidolons controllable. Due to technical restrictions and the presence of the Academy Assist function, the game's artificial intelligence for playable characters needed to be limited to healing, survival and other minor actions. The game's multiplayer was deliberately designed around restricted segments. Its development was still ongoing during the summer of 2011, with a temporary stoppage of PlayStation Network that year negatively affecting its development. Because {{of the size of the}} project, debugging the game took far longer than anticipated. Between the release of the demo and the full game, adjustments were made to gameplay mechanics and the in-game camera. In a post-release interview, Tabata commented that he would have liked to expand the multiplayer functions to include an ad-hoc function and expanded cooperative gameplay, and create a more forgiving learning curve for players.|$|E
