First, the etch-back process on blanket wafers is studied. A slowdown phenomenon of the etch rate with plasma exposure time is observed.

Twenty-eight test-takers’ eye traces on 24 banked <b>gap-fill</b> items (on six tasks) were analysed according to seven on-line eye-tracking measures representing overall, text and task processing. Variation in processing was related to test-takers’ level of performance on the tasks overall. In particular, as hypothesised, lower-scoring students exerted more cognitive effort on local reading and lower-level cognitive processing in contrast to test-takers who attained higher scores. The findings of different cognitive processes associated with variation in scores illuminate the construct measured by banked <b>gap-fill</b> items, and therefore have implications for test design and the validity of score interpretations...|$|R

The LLLWR makes use of Indra-2 technology, namely a similar antenna array, but has roughly half the range and is much smaller and a far more portable unit. The LLLWR can track while scan 100 targets and provide details about their speed, azimuth and range to the operator.

40|$|The <b>gap-fill</b> {{performance}} and process of perhydropolysilazane-based inorganic spin-on dielectric (PSZ-SOD) film in shallow trench isolation (STI) with the ultra-low dispensation amount of PSZ-SOD solution {{have been investigated}} in this study. A PSZ-SOD film process includes liner deposition, PSZ-SOD coating, and furnace curing. For liner deposition, hydrophilic property is required to improve the contact angle and <b>gap-fill</b> capability of PSZ-SOD coating. Prior to PSZ-SOD coating, the additional treatment on liner surface is beneficial for the fluidity of PSZ-SOD solution. The superior film thickness uniformity and <b>gap-fill</b> performance of PSZ-SOD film are achieved due to the improved fluidity of PSZ-SOD solution. Following that up, the low dispensation rate of PSZ-SOD solution leads to more PSZ-SOD filling in the trenches. After PSZ-SOD coating, high thermal curing process efficiently promotes PSZ-SOD film conversion into silicon oxide. Adequate conversion from PSZ-SOD into silicon oxide further increases the etching resistance inside the trenches. Integrating the above sequence of optimized factors, void-free <b>gap-fill</b> and well-controlled STI recess uniformity are achieved even when the PSZ-SOD solution dispensation volume is reduced 3 to 6 times compared with conventional condition for the 28 [*]nm node NAND flash and beyond...|$|R

Dep-etch-dep approach would help to extend the gap fill application of HARP process. But in FinFET STI or PMD with RMG integration where “V ” shape profile is difficult to be realized due to their unique integration flows, a FCVD process is needed to fulfill the <b>gap-fill</b> requirement.

40|$|In {{this work}} a new <b>gap-fill</b> {{technique}} entitled projection transformation {{has been developed}} and used for filling missed parts of remotely sensed imagery. In general techniques for filling missed area of an image are broken down into three main categories: multi-source techniques that take the advantages of other data sources (e. g. using cloud free images to reconstruct the cloudy areas of other images); the second ones fabricate the gap areas using non-gapped parts of an image itself, this group of techniques {{are referred to as}} single-source <b>gap-fill</b> procedures; and third group contains methods that make up a combination of both mentioned techniques, therefore they are called hybrid <b>gap-fill</b> procedures. Here a new developed multi-source methodology called projection transformation for filling a simulated gapped area in the Landsat 7 /ETM+ imagery is introduced. The auxiliary imagery to filling the gaps is an earlier obtained L 7 /ETM+ imagery. Ability of the technique was evaluated from three points of view: statistical accuracy measuring, visual comparison, and post classification accuracy assessment. These evaluation indicators are compared to the results obtained from a commonly used technique by the USGS as Local Linear Histogram Matching (LLHM) [1].

40|$|Cu <b>gap-fill</b> is {{enhanced}} by replacing the conventional Ta liner with a Co liner in a 22 nm width interconnect structure. The improvement with Co liner seen at the line-end area is attributed to a better resputtered Cu seed profile, which is thicker and exhibits no agglomeration compared to that on Ta liner. The mechanism of Co offering better Cu seed coverage than Ta was further studied and determined {{to be associated with}} its better wetting and higher sticking coefficient with Cu during the resputtering process. Similar <b>gap-fill</b> performance was also demonstrated with a reflow Cu seed process. The initial highly conformal Cu seed coverage profile on Co helps ensure a uniform Cu reflow process within the interconnect structure, therefore providing better top-open dimension for electrochemical plating process compared to reflow Cu seed on Ta...|$|R
40|$|Automatically {{generating}} challenging dis-tractors for multiple-choice <b>gap-fill</b> items {{is still}} an unsolved problem. We propose to employ context-sensitive lexical infer-ence rules in order to generate distractors that are semantically similar to the gap tar-get word in some sense, {{but not in the}} par-ticular sense induced by the <b>gap-fill</b> con-text.

In our test set of 20 items, our proposed method de-creases the number of invalid distractors in 90 % of the cases, and fully eliminates all of them in 65 %. Further analysis on that dataset does not support our hypothesis re-garding item difficulty as measured by av-erage error rate of language learners.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} RevUP {{which deals}} with automatically generating <b>gap-fill</b> questions. RevUP consists of 3 parts: Sentence Selection, Gap Selection & Multiple Choice Distractor Selection. To select topicallyimportant sentences from texts, we propose a novel sentence ranking method based on topic distributions obtained from topic models. To select gap-phrases from each selected sentence, we collected human annotations, using the Amazon Mechanical Turk, on the relative relevance of candidate gaps. This data is used to train a discriminative classifier to predict the relevance of gaps, achieving an accuracy of 81. 0 %. Finally, we propose a novel method to choose distractors that are semantically similar to the gap-phrase and have contextual fit to the <b>gap-fill</b> question. By crowdsourcing the evaluation of our method through the Amazon Mechanical Turk, we found that 94 % of the distractors selected were good. RevUP fills the semantic gap left open by previous work in this area, and represents a significant step towards automatically generating quality tests for teachers and self-motivated learners...|$|R
40|$|Common {{open-source}} suppressors {{used for}} copper filling of damascene interconnects include polyalkyl glycols, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), and copolymer {{structures of the}} two. Differences in the configuration and structure of these suppressors generate variations in polarization strength, surface adsorption rate, and SPS displacement rate. These properties were measured by electrochemical transient analysis and coupled {{with the results of}} time-evolved partial fill plating experiments to determine the effect of electrochemical property variations on the <b>gap-fill</b> characteristics. Examples of such data can be seen in Fig. 1 and 2. The high polarization strength of PPG, along with its greater dependence on concentration was found to greatly increase the bottom-up growth rate during copper filling, while the improved resistance to accelerator displacement of PEG resulted in better sidewall protection. Both these <b>gap-fill</b> characteristics were evident when PEG and PPG were combined together as a mixture of separate homopolymers or in copolymer structures, although the overall influence was dependent on the size and configuration of the copolymer. These data sets provide a more fundamental understanding of PEG, PPG and their different configurations role in the metallization of damascene interconnects.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for the {{development}} of at least some academic vocabulary in students of EFL (studying English for teaching and non-teaching purposes), if one of the main aims of EFL study is to produce competent users of English. Students are expected to read and understand advanced professional texts, not simply to successfully complete their degrees but {{to become a part of}} educated society, and to be able to meet the demands placed upon their knowledge in a prefessional environment. The reading and understanding of professional texts can be a highly demanding activity because of the number of academic and professional terms such texts include. This paper exemplifies the usefulness of a <b>gap-fill</b> exercise, as one among a range of options for developing and testing academic vocabulary in a professional context. The exercise was compiled with AWL gapmaker based on a professional review text, which includes academic items of vocabulary. The <b>gap-fill</b> exercise was used with two groups of EFL students in the same year of study and installed at two difficulty levels for two reasons: to test students’ existing knowledge of academic vocabulary, and to enrich it through the analysis of words in context/co-text relation using a concordancing program. The paper compares the answers of both groups to determine the most problematic entries (incorrect answers), and to provide the possible reasons for them. Further, contextual clues are taken into consideration as a helpful source for determining correct entries, and tested with the concordancing program. Besides the emphasis on the usefulness of such <b>gap-fill</b> exercises combined with corpus for the development and enrichment of academic vocabulary, the paper also emphasizes the importance of guiding students in how to search for different grammatical and other contextual clues to make correct inferences, and how to use concordances to support or reject the claims...|$|R
