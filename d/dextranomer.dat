50|$|These {{procedures}} aim {{to inject}} bio-compatible material {{into the walls}} of the anal canal, aiming to bulk out these tissues. This may bring {{the walls of the}} anal canal into tighter contact, raising the resting pressure, creating more of a barrier to the loss of stool, and reducing FI. Originally, this technique was described for urinary incontinence, but has since been used for FI, especially passive soiling due to IAS dysfunction. This measure has many advantages over more invasive surgery, since there are rarely any serious complications and the procedure can be carried out under local anesthetic on an out patient basis. Many different materials have been used as perianal injectable bulking agents, including: autologous fat (fat tissue transferred from elsewhere in the body), Teflon, bovine glutaraldehyde cross-linked collagen (collagen from cows), carbon-coated zirconium beads, polydimethylsiloxane elastomer, dextranomer/non-animal stabilised hyaluronic acid, hydrogel cross-linked with polyacrylamide, porcine dermal collagen (collagen from pig skin), and synthetic calcium hydroxylapatite ceramic microspheres. <b>Dextranomer</b> in stabilised hyaluronic acid improves continence for a little over half of patients in the short term. However, future trials are required. <b>Dextranomer</b> is marketed as Solesta, bio-compatible Silicone is also referred to as a PTQ implant and carbon coated beads as Durasphere. The bulking material can be introduced as either intersphincteric (into the space between the IAS and the EAS) or submucosal (under the mucosal layer) injections.Ultrasonound guidance may be used during the injections, which may be more effective than the surgeon simply palpating (feeling) where to inject. A Cochrane systematic review of the efficacy of this type of treatment for FI reported that PTQ implants were the most widely used material, but that there was currently insufficient evidence to be considered to assess the effectiveness of injectable bulking agents. A randomized trial by Dehli et al. compared perianal injectable bulking agents to sphincter training and biofeedback, and found the former to be superior. Both methods lead to an improvement of FI, but comparisons of St Mark's scores between the groups showed no difference between treatments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is a {{frequent}} pathology, with an incidence of 29 / 50 % in children studied for urinary tract infection (UTI) and 20 % of newborns with the diagnosis of prenatal hydronephrosis. Over the years, the treatment {{has been the subject}} of many meetings, many research studies, and continues being a topic under discussion. The number of candidates for surgical treatment increased with the development of minimally invasive endoscopic techniques by subureteral injection of bulking agents. We present the results of the surgical treatment of VUR between 2001 and 2006. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of the endoscopic treatment of VUR by subureteral injection of <b>Dextranomer</b> and hyaluronic acid copolymer (Copol-Dx/AH). All children undergoing treatment between July 1 st 2001 and December 30 th 2006 were included in this study. Treatment was performed in children with VUR grade II or greater. All patients presenting no reflux or grade I VUR on control VCUG were considered cured; stopping antibiotic prophylaxis was proposed in these cases. RESULTS: 661 children underwent treatment, 607 endoscopic and 54 with the Cohen technique. Among children treated endoscopically, 437 where females and 170 males. VUR was bilateral in 37. 7 % of the cases, with grade II being the most frequent (40 % in males and 57 % in females). Overall success rate was 70 % after first treatment, 75 % after second treatment and increased to 78 % after the third. CONCLUSIONS: Subureteral injection of <b>dextranomer</b> and hyaluronic acid copolymer is on effective treatment in children with VUR, independently of the grade. It is a simple, safe, well tolerated procedure with low associated morbidity. Currently, it is the surgical treatment of choice in most patients with VUR...|$|E

40|$|Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) affects around 1 % of all children. It {{carries an}} {{increased}} risk of febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) and is associated with impaired renal function. Endoscopic treatment with NASHA/Dx gel (<b>dextranomer</b> microspheres in a stabilized hyaluronic acid-based gel of nonanimal origin) is minimally invasive, well tolerated and provides cure rates approaching those of open surgery: ~ 90 % in several studies.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical results of patients with vesicoureteral reflux, which were treated with subureteral injection of small-size (80 – 120 [*]μm) dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA). Data of 75 children (105 renal units) who underwent STING procedure with small-size Dx/HA for the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in our clinic between 2008 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed.

40|$|Abstract: Fecal {{incontinence}} (FI) is a {{multifactorial disorder}} that imposes considerable {{social and economic}} burdens. The aim {{of this article is}} to provide an overview of current and emerging treatment options for FI. A MEDLINE search was conducted for English-language articles related to FI prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment published from January 1, 1990 through June 1, 2013. The search was extended to unpublished trials on Clinical-Trials. gov and relevant publications cited in included articles. Conservative approaches, including dietary modifications, medi-cations, muscle-strengthening exercises, and biofeedback, have been shown to provide short-term benefits. Transcutaneous elec-trical stimulation was considered ineffective in a randomized clin-ical trial. Unlike initial studies, sacral nerve stimulation has shown reasonable short-term effectiveness and some complications. Dynamic graciloplasty and artificial sphincter and bowel devices lack randomized controlled trials and have shown inconsistent results and high rates of explantation. Of injectable bulking agents, <b>dextranomer</b> microspheres in non-animal stabilized hyaluronic acid (NASHA Dx) has shown significant improvement in incontinence scores and frequency of incontinence episodes, with generally mild adverse effects. For the treatment of FI, conservative measures and biofeedback therapy are modestly effective. When conservative therapies are ineffective, invasive procedures, including sacral nerve stimulation, may be considered, but they are associated with com-plications and lack randomized, controlled trials. Bulking agents may be an appropriate alternative therapy to consider before more aggressive therapies in patients who fail conservative therapies...|$|E

Prolonged intubation (2 – 4  weeks) had occurred after the first and second surgeries due to difficult extubation. Respiratory failure after tracheal extubation occurred several times, without clear reasons. The reason why the difficult extubation had happened was not clear. The anesthetic record showed that tracheal intubation was difficult due to micrognathia and bifid epiglottis. The largest uncuffed endotracheal tube that could be inserted into the trachea when the patient was 11  years old was a 4.0 -mm ID. The patient had undergone a gastrostomy due to chronic aspiration. She was also taking medications for hypopituitarism and seizures. She had multiple allergies including egg, latex, and aminophylline. Pre-anesthetic examination of the patient showed that she had micrognathia. Stridor was heard over the trachea. We judged that {{it would be difficult to}} obtain the patient’s cooperation with regional anesthesia, as she had mild mental retardation and hearing difficulty. Hence, we selected general anesthesia for the surgery.

40|$|Loss of bowel control, {{also known}} as faecal {{incontinence}}, can be a devastating problem. It affects {{men and women of}} all ages in up to 15 % of the adult population. Faecal incontinence can radically affect everyday life as many people become almost house bound, being unable to undertake simple tasks, such as shopping, because they are worried about faecal leakage. Faecal incontinence may be due to a problem with the two muscles around the anus (back passage). These muscles can be damaged or become weak due to injury during child birth or operations to treat anal conditions such as haemorrhoids (piles) and fistulas (abnormal channels between the skin and back passage). The anal muscles then become unable to hold back the stools until the person reaches the toilet. The inner ring or internal anal sphincter muscle normally keeps the anus closed at all times except when opening the bowel, preventing passive leakage of stool. A treatment has been developed to treat faecal incontinence, which involves injecting a substance into or near this muscle to make it bulkier so that the anus closes better. It has been advocated as a simple and safe option. In this review, one large trial demonstrated that injection of <b>dextranomer</b> stabilised in hyaluronic acid improves the symptoms of incontinence in the short term in little over half of those who received the treatment. The other four trials reviewed were of limited value because they were generally poor in methodological quality and small in size. There are no reported long term results for this treatment...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: A {{prospective}} {{study was conducted}} to assess the efficacy of <b>dextranomer</b> based implants as a new bulking agent for endoscopic treatment of pediatric structural incontinence. Materials and Methods: A total of 33 children and adolescents 5 to 18 years old with severe incontinence due to sphincteric incompetence (exstrophy-epispadias in 13, neuropathic bladder in 16, bilateral ectopic ureters in 4) were enrolled in the study. All but 1 patient wore diapers. Preoperative evaluation consisted of medical history, pad test, urine culture, urinary tract ultrasound and videourodynamics. This evaluation was repeated 6 months and 1 year after treatment and then on a yearly basis. Of the patients 14 had 2 and 1 had 3 treatment sessions to achieve a definitive result. At each evaluation the patient was considered cured—dryness interval of 4 hours confirmed by pad test, significantly improved—minimal incontinence requir-ing no more than 1 pad a day with less than 10 gm. leakage during pad test; and no further treatment required, and treatment failure—no significant improvement. Videourodynamics were mainly useful to study the evolution of the bladder capacity, activity and compliance. Followup after the last injection ranged from 6 to 36 months (mean 18). Results: The mean injected volume was 3. 9 ml. (range 1. 6 to 12) and the procedure lasted a mean of 30 minutes (10 to 60).

40|$|AIM: Randomized, {{controlled}} {{trials have}} demonstrated the efficacy and safety of injectable bulking agents {{for the treatment of}} faecal incontinence (FI), although the long-term outcome has not been assessed. NASHA/Dx gel, a biocompatible, nonallergenic bulking agent consisting of nonanimal stabilized hyaluronic acid and <b>dextranomer</b> microspheres, has demonstrated efficacy and safety for up to 12 months after treatment. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of NASHA/Dx, assessed 24 months after treatment. METHOD: This study was a 24 -month follow-up assessment of patients treated with NASHA/Dx under open-label conditions. Data on FI episodes and quality of life measures were collected from diaries over the 28 -day period immediately preceding the 24 -month assessment. Adverse events were collected. RESULTS: Eighty-three of 115 patients completed the 24 -month follow-up assessment. At 24 months, 62. 7 % of patients were considered responders and experienced a ≥ 50 % reduction in the total number of FI episodes. The median number of FI episodes declined by 68. 8 % (P < 0. 001). Episodes of both solid and liquid stool incontinence decreased. The mean number of incontinence-free days increased from 14. 6 at baseline to 21. 7 at 24 months (P < 0. 001). Incontinence scores and FI quality of life scores also showed significant improvements. The most common adverse events (AEs) were proctalgia (13. 3 %) and pyrexia (9. 6 %). The majority of AEs were mild to moderate, self-limited and resolved within 1 month of the injection. CONCLUSION: NASHA/Dx is safe, effective and durable over a 24 -month period with a majority of patients experiencing significant improvement in multiple symptoms associated with FI...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study objectively {{characterized}} the microenvironment of indolent, chronic wounds {{by developing a}} method by which minute quantities of cytokines could be extracted from chronic wounds and separately identified. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Recombinant DNA technology {{and the ability to}} clone compounds such as cytokines allow new management schemes for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds. Before treatment with an exogenous cytokine is started, {{it would be helpful to}} know the endogenous level of that cytokine in the wound. Although various methods of extracting cytokines from acute wounds have been reported, no techniques have existed to reliably measure endogenous levels of cytokines in chronic wounds. METHODS: Porous, inert hydrophilic <b>dextranomer</b> beads were tested for their ability to absorb or adsorb protein and cytokines in vitro with either albumin or albumin laced with various known amounts of cytokines, and then from chronic human pressure ulcers. The Bradford protein assay was used to determine protein levels. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques were used to determine levels of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -AB, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-beta) extracted by the beads. RESULTS: Between 88 % and 98 % of known amounts of albumin could be recovered. Similarly, more than 90 % of the laced cytokines could be recovered. In 20 grade III/IV pressure ulcers, although protein concentrations were remarkably similar, endogenous levels of cytokine growth factors varied tremendously. Platelet-derived growth factor-AB ranged from 49 to 867 pg/mL; bFGF from 47 to 697 pg/mL; and EGF from nondetectable to 247. 5 pg/mL. TGF-B was not detected in 17 of the 20 pressure ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: This new technique appears useful for measuring endogenous levels of cytokines. Levels of cytokines found in these chronic wounds are much lower than those reported from acute wounds. The marked variation found among the 20 wounds may help to explain the differences reported in recent wound healing trials with exogenous cytokines...|$|E
40|$|Faecal {{incontinence}} (FI) {{is defined}} as the inability to control bowel movements. The causes of FI are many and diverse. One of the more uncommon reasons for FI is Anorectal Malformations (ARMs). An ARM is a congenital anomaly that affects somewhere between 1 / 2500 and 1 / 5000 live born babies. Many ARM patients have persistent FI. Several different procedures have been utilised to address this issue. This thesis aims to evaluate (1) the long-term outcome in adulthood of ARMs in relation to the modern Krickenbeck classification, and (2) scope for treating FI with transanal injection with <b>dextranomer</b> in non-animal stabilised hyaluronic acid (NASHA/Dx), in patients both with and without ARMs. All patients treated for ARMs in Uppsala up to 1993 were invited to participate in a questionnaire study of quality of life and function. The study included 136 patients and compared them with 136 age- and sex-matched controls. The Krickenbeck classification was found to predict functional outcome, and ARM patients had more problems with incontinence and obstipation, as well as inferior Quality of Life (QoL), compared with controls.   Thirty-six patients with FI, owing to causes other than ARMs, were treated with transanal submucous injection of NASHA/Dx. The patients were monitored for two years after treatment. Significant reductions in both their incontinence score and the number of their incontinence episodes were achieved.   A significant improvement in QoL was observed in patients who had at least a 75 % reduction in incontinence episodes. No serious complications occurred. A prospective study of transanal injection of NASHA/Dx was conducted on seven patients with persistent FI after ARMs. After six months a significant {{reduction in the number of}} incontinence episodes was obtained. A significant improvement in QoL was also found. No serious complications occurred. In conclusion, adult patients with ARMs have inferior outcome of anorectal function and QoL compared with controls. NASHA/Dx is effective and appears to be safe in treating FI in general. This effect seems to be the same in selected patients with persistent FI after ARMs...|$|E
40|$|Background Pressure ulcers, {{also known}} as bedsores, decubitus ulcers and {{pressure}} injuries, are localised areas of injury to the skin or the underlying tissue, or both. Dressings are widely used to treat pressure ulcers {{and there are many}} different dressing options including hydrogel dressings. A clear and current overview of the current evidence is required to facilitate decision-making regarding dressing use for the treatment of pressure ulcers. Objectives To assess the effects of hydrogel dressings on the healing of pressure ulcers in any care setting. Search methods We searched the following databases: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 19 June 2014); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to June Week 2 2014); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, 23 June 2014); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 20 June 2014); and EBSCO CINAHL (1982 to 18 June 2014). There were no restrictions based on language or date of publication. Selection criteria Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of hydrogel dressings with alternative wound dressings or no dressing in the treatment of pressure ulcers (stage II or above). Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. Main results We included eleven studies (523 participants) in this review. Ten studies had two arms and one had three arms that were all relevant to this review. Three studies compared a hydrogel dressing with a basic wound contact dressing; three studies compared a hydrogel dressing with a hydrocolloid dressing; three studies compared a hydrogel dressing with another hydrogel dressing; one study compared a hydrogel dressing with a foam dressing; one study compared a hydrogel dressing with a <b>dextranomer</b> paste dressing and one study compared a hydrogel dressing with a topical treatment (collagenase). Limited data were available for analyses in this review: we conducted no meta-analyses. Where data were available {{there was no evidence of}} a difference between hydrogel and alternative treatments in terms of complete wound healing or adverse events. One small study reported that using hydrogel dressings was, on average, less costly than hydrocolloid dressings, but this estimate was imprecise and its methodology was not clear. All included studies were small, had short follow-up times and were at unclear risk of bias. Authors' conclusions It is not clear if hydrogel dressings are more or less effective than other treatments in healing pressure ulcers or if different hydrogels have different effects, Most trials in this field are very small and poorly reported so that risk of bias is unclear...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundTwo new therapies for fecal {{incontinence}} (FI) are now available: non–animal stabilized hyaluronic acid and <b>dextranomer</b> copolymer (NASHA/Dx) and sacral nerve stimulation (SNS). PurposeThis study aimed {{to determine the}} cost-effectiveness of NASHA/Dx compared with SNS and conservative therapy (CT) {{for the treatment of}} FI after CT failure. MethodsDecision tree models with Markov subbranches were developed to compare all direct costs and outcomes during a 3 -year period from the viewpoint of the US third-party payer. Costs (in 2013 US dollars) of devices, medical and surgical care, and hospitalization were included. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incontinence-free days (IFDs). Both costs and outcomes were discounted {{at an annual rate of}} 3 %. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for each outcome. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of results and model stability. A budget impact analysis was also undertaken to estimate the potential cost and savings of NASHA/Dx for a payer with 1, 000, 000 covered lives. ResultsFor the 3 -year cost-effectiveness models, the expected cost was $ 9053 for CT, $ 14, 962 for NASHA/Dx, and $ 33, 201 for SNS. The numbers of QALYs were 1. 769, 1. 929, and 2. 004, respectively. The numbers of IFDs were 128. 8, 267. 6, and 514. 8, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per additional IFD gained were $ 42. 60 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $ 73. 76 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $ 62. 55 for SNS vs CT. The incremental costs per QALY gained were $ 37, 036 for NASHA/Dx vs CT, $ 244, 509 for SNS vs NASHA/Dx, and $ 103, 066 for SNS vs CT. The budget impact analysis evaluated the financial effect on the health care system of the use of NASHA/Dx and SNS. For the scenarios evaluated, when all of the patients receive NASHA/Dx, the net annual effect to the health care payer budget ranged from $ 571, 455 to $ 2, 857, 275. When all of the patients receive SNS, the net annual effect to the health care payer budget ranged from $ 1, 959, 323 to $ 9, 796, 613. ConclusionBoth NASHA/Dx and SNS have produced significant improvements in FI symptoms for affected patients. NASHA/Dx is a cost-effective and more efficient use of resources for the treatment of FI when compared with SNS. The budget impact analysis suggests that although reimbursement for NASHA/Dx treatment initially adds costs to the health care system, it is significantly less expensive than SNS for patients who are candidates for either treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{clinical}} practice update expert review is to describe the key principles {{in the use of}} surgical interventions and device-aided therapy for managing fecal incontinence (FI) and defecatory disorders. The best practices outlined in this review are based on relevant publications, including systematic reviews and expert opinion (when applicable). Best Practice Advice 1 : A stepwise approach should be followed for management of FI. Conservative therapies (diet, fluids, techniques to improve evacuation, a bowel training program, management of diarrhea and constipation with diet and medications if necessary) will benefit approximately 25 % of patients and should be tried first. Best Practice Advice 2 : Pelvic floor retraining with biofeedback therapy is recommended for patients with FI who do not respond to the conservative measures indicated above. Best Practice Advice 3 : Perianal bulking agents such as intra-anal injection of <b>dextranomer</b> may be considered when conservative measures and biofeedback therapy fail. Best Practice Advice 4 : Sacral nerve stimulation should be considered for patients with moderate or severe FI in whom symptoms have not responded after a 3 -month or longer trial of conservative measures and biofeedback therapy and who do not have contraindications to these procedures. Best Practice Advice 5 : Until further evidence is available, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation should not be used for managing FI in clinical practice. Best Practice Advice 6 : Barrier devices should be offered to patients who have failed conservative or surgical therapy, or in those who have failed conservative therapy who do not want or are not eligible for more invasive interventions. Best Practice Advice 7 : Anal sphincter repair (sphincteroplasty) should be considered in postpartum women with FI and in patients with recent sphincter injuries. In patients who present later with symptoms of FI unresponsive to conservative and biofeedback therapy and evidence of sphincter damage, sphincteroplasty may be considered when perianal bulking injection and sacral nerve stimulation are not available or have proven unsuccessful. Best Practice Advice 8 : The artificial anal sphincter, dynamic graciloplasty, may be considered for patients with medically refractory severe FI who have failed treatment or are not candidates for barrier devices, sacral nerve stimulation, perianal bulking injection, sphincteroplasty and a colostomy. Best Practice Advice 9 : Major anatomic defects (eg, rectovaginal fistula, full-thickness rectal prolapse, fistula in ano, or cloaca-like deformity) should be rectified with surgery. Best Practice Advice 10 : A colostomy should be considered in patients with severe FI who have failed conservative treatment and have failed or are not candidates for barrier devices, minimally invasive surgical interventions, and sphincteroplasty. Best Practice Advice 11 : A magnetic anal sphincter device may be considered for patients with medically refractory severe FI who have failed or are not candidates for barrier devices, perianal bulking injection, sacral nerve stimulation, sphincteroplasty, or a colostomy. Data regarding efficacy are limited and 40 % of patients had moderate or severe complications. Best Practice Advice 12 : For defecatory disorders, biofeedback therapy is the treatment of choice. Best Practice Advice 13 : Based on limited evidence, sacral nerve stimulation should not be used for managing defecatory disorders in clinical practice. Best Practice Advice 14 : Anterograde colonic enemas are not effective in the long term for management of defecatory disorders. Best Practice Advice 15 : The stapled transanal rectal resection and related procedures should not be routinely performed for correction of structural abnormalities in patients with defecatory disorders...|$|E
40|$|Background Small {{children}} with dilated vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) run risk of recurrent uri¬nary tract infections (UTI) and to acquire renal damage. To protect them, antibiotic prophylaxis and surgery to eliminate VUR have been used. Endoscopic injection of bulking agent at the ure-teral orifice has evolved as alternative surgical method but with insufficient scientific support of long term effect on VUR {{and rate of}} renal damage and UTI recurrence. Regarding prophylaxis, there is increasing concern of bacterial resistance and reports of low protective effect. Aim The aim of the trial was to evaluate three management strategies for {{children with}} dilating VUR, prophylaxis, endoscopic injection and surveillance only. Specific aims were to describe VUR outcome at two year follow-up, pattern and rate of recurrent UTI and how this differs be¬tween the three treatment strategies, and to investigate if prophylaxis or endoscopic injection can reduce rate of progression of established renal defects or new damage. Patients and methods From 23 centers, 203 children, 128 girls and 75 boys, aged 1 to less than 2 years, with dilating VUR grade III or IV were randomized to antibiotic prophylaxis (n= 69), endoscopic injection (n= 66) or surveillance (n= 68) and followed for 2 years by regular visits and telephone contacts with special attention to febrile UTIs. Voiding cystourethrography (VCU) and dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal scintigraphy were performed before randomization and after 2 years. Endoscopic injection with <b>dextranomer</b> hyaluronic acid copolymer was fol¬lowed by postoperative control with ultrasound and VCU. All calculations were done according to the intent to treat principle. Results Resolution or downgrading to nondilating VUR was seen in 71 % in the endoscopic group, more frequent than in the prophylaxis or surveillance groups, 39 % and 47 % respectively (p= 0. 0002 and 0. 0030). In 13 children (20 % {{of those in the}} endoscopy group) with no or non¬dilating VUR after 1 - 2 injections, dilating VUR reappeared at 2 -year follow-up. There were 67 febrile UTIs in 42 girls, significantly more than the 8 infections in 7 boys (p= 0. 0001). In girls febrile recurrence rate was 8 of 43 (19 %) on prophylaxis, 10 of 43 (23 %) with endoscopic treat¬ment and 24 of 42 (57 %) on surveillance (p= 0. 0002). The recurrence rate was associated with persistent VUR after 2 years (p= 0. 0095). In boys recurrence rate was not associated with treat¬ment group or VUR status at entry or follow-up. Renal uptake defect at entry was seen in 124 of 203 children (61 %), in 69 of 128 girls (54 %) and 55 of 75 boys (73 %), being generalized in 30 girls (23 %) and in 44 boys (59 %) (p< 0. 0001). The 2 -year DMSA scan was performed in 201 children. New renal damage in previously unscarred areas was seen in 13 girls and 2 boys. Of the girls, 8 were on surveillance, 5 in the endoscopic group and none on prophylaxis (p= 0. 0155). New dam¬age was more common in children with febrile recurrence than without (11 of 49 (22 %) vs 4 of 152 (3 %), p< 0. 0001). Conclusion In small children with VUR grade III-IV, endoscopic injection enhanced the down¬grading or resolution of VUR compared to antibiotic prophylaxis or surveillance only. In boys older than 1 year, new renal damage was rare and febrile UTI recurrence rate low with no differ¬ence between treatment groups. In girls the rates of new renal damage and UTI recurrence was higher, especially in the control group on surveillance. UTI recurrence was reduced by prophy¬laxis and endocopic injection. New renal damage was strongly associated with UTI recurrence and was reduced by prophylaxis...|$|E
