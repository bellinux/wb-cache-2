50|$|Typically, the double-tees are {{hung over}} a {{supporting}} structure. This {{is done by}} having <b>dapped</b> ends at the webs of the double tee (pictured). The <b>dapped</b> ends are sensitive to cracking at the supporting area. A recommendation to prevent cracking is to include reinforcing steel in the double-tee design to transfer the loads from the bearing area (the reduced-depth section) to the full-depth section of the web. In case that the cracks are developed after the parking structure is already in use, other methods to provide external support to the double-tees are needed. One of such alternatives is to use externally bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) to provide reinforcement.|$|E

The goal of the project was to investigate the shear capacity of <b>dapped</b> ended steel plate girders. <b>Dapped</b> girders with no intermediate transverse-stiffeners between the bearing stiffener and the first interior diaphragm were the focus of this project. The motivation for minimizing the number of stiffeners is to reduce cost and fatigue sensitivity of the girder. The finite element method was used to estimate the ultimate shear capacity. A linear eigenvalue analysis was used to estimate the buckling capacity and to find the buckled mode shape. The mode shape was used to generate a mesh with an imperfection used to run a nonlinear Riks analysis. The Riks analysis resulted in estimated capacities that accounted for material properties and large deformations. Buckling capacities were found for three particular cases. However, several computer codes are presented that allow for the analysis to be completed {{for a wide variety of}} <b>dapped</b> girders. Three main conclusions were drawn from this study. First, it is conservative to assume a full height panel for design purposes. Second, <b>dapped</b> girders without intermediate stiffeners can generate substantial shear capacities.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>dapped</b> {{ends with}} high-performance concrete and headed bars, {{together with the}} effects of fibres added to the concrete was investigated.

The beams had a design concrete compressive strength of 60 MPa. Strut-and-tie models were used to predict the capacity of the <b>dapped</b> end beams. Headed bars were used as the horizontal tension ties, and closed stirrups provided the vertical tension ties. From the comparisons between the testing results and the strut-and-tie model predictions, and the comparisons of the behaviour between the end regions with and without fibres, it was concluded that: the strut-and-tie models can be used as practical tools to predict the capacities of members with disturbed regions; the presence of fibres significantly increased the shear capacity and improved the ductility and crack control; the headed bars provided excellent anchorage and confinement of the nodal zones...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of prefabricated and usually prestressed concrete elements has increased since mid- 20 th century. These elements {{are at the}} point of reaching the end of their life span, are subjected to damages or a change in functionality. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate their structural safety. In many cases, existing structures do not meet the minimum level of structural safety according to the current building codes. If it is possible to improve the verification of the minimum level of structural safety of existing structures, {{it is not necessary to}} take expensive measures like reconstruction or strengthening these structures. For concrete beam elements the structural safety appeared to be in most cases governed by shear resistance. This study specifically investigates the shear resistance of vertically prestressed <b>dapped</b> end beams. An analytical study is performed in order to evaluate the influence of vertically prestressing on the failure mechanism and the shear resistance of vertically prestressed <b>dapped</b> end beams. Next, an analytical calculation procedure based on the equilibrium of the “torn-off” section is used to determine the bearing reaction of several prestressed <b>dapped</b> end beams. Additionally, a Case Study is performed to verify if the results of a nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) using a highly simplified model are in accordance with the results described in CUR-report 40. In this report the results are described of a full size test on a prestressed <b>dapped</b> end beam. Determining the design shear resistance of vertically prestressed <b>dapped</b> end beams using the equilibrium calculation procedure will give very conservative results. This is caused by the unknown locations of reinforcements and possibly by omitting the concrete contribution to the shear resistance caused by the compressive zone, aggregate interlock and dowel action. Furthermore, in case of correct detailing of reinforcement, the equilibrium calculation procedure will in all cases lead to a safe, lower limit of the shear resistance. It should be noted, that in the experiments in case of a limited amount of reinforcement the concrete contributes to the shear resistance significantly. It is of great importance that proper detailing of reinforcement is carried out to prevent sudden failure of <b>dapped</b> ends by shear. In case of improper detailing the failure mechanism assumed to be governing can mostly not develop. In accordance with the results described in the experiments, this will probably cause early failure. The finite element model (FEM) used is highly simplified. Only the prestressing cables and Dywidag bars are included in the model and loads are not distributed over multiple nodes. Overall it can be concluded that initiation as well as the direction of crack propagation are simulated quite well. However, it is not possible to make realistic statements about crack propagation, crack width and realistic crack strains at different load steps. More important, the calculated bearing reaction is a safe lower limit of the shear resistance. During the NLFEA it became clear that obtaining a realistic model of a prestressed <b>dapped</b> end beam is strongly depended on the input parameters used. It is expected that modelling of all reinforcement bars will result in a less conservative shear resistance. Further research is required to verify the statement above.

40|$|AbstractThe {{ordinary}} beams theory {{based on}} Bernoulli's theorem is not applicable to non linear and non prismatic members, in RC structures like deep beams, pile caps, <b>dapped</b> ended beams and corbels etc. Such structures normally fail due to shear failure rather than flexural failure and cannot be analyzed and designed with the flexural analysis or beam theory.

In this research four pile caps, six corbels, three deep beams, and three <b>dapped</b> ended beams, designed {{on the basis of}} assumed Strut and Tie Model were tested in the laboratory under monotonic loads.

The main goal of this thesis is to establish and define the necessary procedures for a proposed method of analytical simulation for complex structural systems. In order to illustrate the required steps of the simulation procedure, a detailed example or case study was performed on <b>dapped</b> ended highway bridge girders. The physical properties and dimensions of the <b>dapped</b> ended girders, provided by existing construction documents, were used as an input to the simulation. Additionally, statistical traffic distributions of realistic traffic flows were identified to obtain accurate wheel load values. Once the geometry and loading conditions of the bridge were specified, finite element analysis was used to obtain localized load effects. This included, but was not limited to, stress and strain tensors in regions of fatigue susceptibility. This simulation was quasi-static in that each traffic configuration from the load history corresponded to a particular point in the stress history. The stress histories obtained from the simulation were used to define the parameters of an experimental program established to examine the behavior of <b>dapped</b> ended specimens under static and fatigue loading. Strain gauges and calibrated load cells were used to collect data, which were compared to the simulation predictions. Three main conclusions were drawn from this study. The first result of the detailed analysis was to highlight the ability of the simulation to provide multi-axial, and therefore, more realistic stress states in the girder. Simplified analysis of the girders would neglect several components of the stress tensor. Secondly, traffic histories with less frequent heavy truck loads produce a greater fatigue inclination for highway bridge girders. Finally, finite element analysis is most accurate at predicting experimental strains in regions of low stress concentration...|$|E

40|$|During the bending of {{flange plate}} used for <b>dapped</b> girders some highway bridge fabricators are {{experiencing}} cracking of the flange plate particularly when heat {{is used in}} assisting the bending process. Due to the extreme strains experienced during the fabrication process, investigating this problem {{requires the use of}} a finite element analysis. The fabrication process was broken down into two parts, first the heating of the plate through the use of either a furnace or an acetylene torch (thermal), and the second was the bending process (structural). The five different temperatures collected during the thermal analysis were a uniform temperature of 75 oF, a 1100 oF uniform temperature as a result of furnace heating, both five and ten minutes of air-cooling after the plate had reached a uniform temperature of 1100 oF, and the temperature gradient after heating the flange plate to a surface temperature of 1200 oF though the use of an acetylene torch. After the thermal analysis was completed, the resulting temperatures were imported into the structural model. The plate thicknesses analyzed were one, one and a half, and two inches, assuming both 50 and 70 ksi yield strengths. To achieve a 90 degree six-inch radius bend the plate was bent in five separate locations. The result of this analysis showed that with the introduction of temperature gradients into thefabrication process, the strains along the plate??s extreme fibers increased. The model further showed that for both a one and a half and two-inch thick plate the extreme fiber strains exceeded ten percent, which further adds to the increased risk of the flange plate cracking during fabrication. The highest residual stresses through the plate??s thickness occurred during cold bending. The residual stresses through the plate??s thickness decreased when the fabrication process was carried out at elevated temperatures. When steel exceeds a strain of 10 to 16 percent during the fabrication process, the plate becomes susceptible to cracking. This strain limit was exceeded for plate thicknesses of one and a half and two inches...|$|E
40|$|The amounts, {{hydrogen}} ion concentrations, viscosity, specific gravity and ptyalin {{levels of the}} saliva collected for thirty minutes after stimulating the parotid glands were measured in 129 normal persons (129 normal parotids) and 118 patients (129 morbid parotids), {{and the results were}} interpreted {{on the basis of the}} theory of statistical inference. Stimulus was applied by dripping 1 cc of the aqueous solution of 1 / 4 mol tartaric acid on the tongue at ten minutes 2 ̆ 7 intervals. A study on the relation between the results of the above experiments and sialographic appearances of the parotids was also performed. 1) There was no significant change in the saliva secretion by a parotid gland attributable to the difference in seasons-i. e. between the period from May to October and the period from November to April. 2) Both the amounts and {{hydrogen ion}} concentrations were larger in persons younger than 19 years of age than in any other age groups, while they showed no essential difference between persons in their 20 s and 30 s than those over 40 years of age, 3) There was a close relation between the amounts of saliva secretion and the following 5 types of sialographic shadows of the parotid glands as classified by Prof. Kitamura-homogeneous shadow (type I), lobulated shadow (type II), dappled shadow with small spots (type II[), <b>dapped</b> shadow with large spots (type IV) and shadowless (type V). The secretion increased in amounts in the order as indicated above. 4) In cases of acute inflammation, there were a decrease in amounts, a fall in ptyalin levels and an increase in specific gravity. 5) In cases of sialoangiectasis, there were a decrease in amounts, a fall in ptyalin levels and an increase in hydrogen ion concentrations. 6) In cases of tumors of the parotid gland, there were decreases in amounts and hydrogen ion concentrations. 7) In cases where a parotid gland of one side had been removed, there was no increase in the amounts of saliva secretion by the residual gland; on the contrary, there were decreases in amounts and hydrogen ion concentrations and a rise in ptyalin levels; and many of them demonstrated shadows of types I and II which are assumed to indicate normal parotids. 8) There was no change in the functioning of the parotid gland on the same side as the ear which had had its inner and middle ears radically operated on. 9) In cases of xerostomia, there were decreases in amounts and hydrogen ion concentrations and arise in ptyalin levels; many of those cases that showed objected symptoms demonstrated shadows of types III and IV which are assumed to indicate morbid parotids. 10) In cases of atrophic rhinitis, there was no change in the nature of saliva secreted by the parotids. 11) The viscosity of the saliva secreted by the parotid gland has been of no significance...|$|E

40|$|Death-associated protein 1 (<b>DAP</b> 1) is {{a member}} of the <b>DAP</b> family and has been implicated in the {{regulation}} of cell growth and death including that of cancer cells. However, the roles of <b>DAP</b> 1 in clinical cancer and in the regulation of colorectal cancer cells are largely unknown. The present study investigated the expression profile of <b>DAP</b> 1 in human colorectal cancer and the impact of <b>DAP</b> 1 on apoptosis and the cellular response to 5 -FU. Human colorectal cancer specimens (n= 94) and human colorectal cancer cell lines HRT 18 and HT 115 were used. <b>DAP</b> 1 transcript and protein were evaluated using quantitative transcript analysis and immunohistochemistry. <b>DAP</b> 1 -knockdown cells were generated using anti-DAP 1 transgene. The results revealed that human colorectal cancer tissues had lower levels of <b>DAP</b> 1 when compared with the normal tissues. The reduced levels were associated with higher Dukes' stage and lymph node metastasis. Patients with low <b>DAP</b> 1 expression had a markedly reduced survival. Loss of <b>DAP</b> 1 in colorectal cancer cells resulted in a gain in cellular migration and loss of their sensitivity of apoptosis to chemotherapeutic agent, 5 -FU. <b>DAP</b> 1 was found to be correlated with disease progression and long-term survival of the colorectal patients. <b>DAP</b> 1 is also a pivotal regulator of the growth and apoptosis and cellular response to chemotherapy agents...|$|R
40|$|<b>DAP</b> 12 is an ITAM-containing adaptor {{molecule}} conveying activating {{properties to}} surface receptors on many cell types. We show here that <b>DAP</b> 12 paradoxically down-modulates plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) cytokine production in vivo during murine CMV (MCMV) infection. Higher levels of IFN-alphabeta and IL- 12 were detected upon MCMV infection or CpG treatment in <b>DAP</b> 12 -deficient (<b>DAP</b> 12 (o)) mice {{as compared with}} wild-type (WT) mice. This resulted from altered homeostasis and enhanced responsiveness of pDCs in <b>DAP</b> 12 (o) animals. Increased numbers of pDCs were observed in the periphery of both naive and MCMV-infected <b>DAP</b> 12 (o) mice. A higher proportion of pDCs was activated in infected <b>DAP</b> 12 (o) mice, as demonstrated by intracellular staining using an optimized protocol for simultaneous detection of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. The homeostasis of WT and <b>DAP</b> 12 (o) pDCs {{did not differ in}} mixed bone marrow chimeric mice. In addition, a similar efficiency of pDC differentiation was observed in vitro in Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 ligand cultures of WT and <b>DAP</b> 12 (o) bone marrow cells. This suggests that <b>DAP</b> 12 signaling effects on pDC homeostasis are indirect. In contrast, in response to CpG, <b>DAP</b> 12 -mediated effects on both IL- 12 and IFN-alphabeta production were intrinsic to the pDCs. However, in response to MCMV, only IL- 12 but not IFN-alphabeta production was affected by pDC-intrinsic <b>DAP</b> 12 signaling. Thus, <b>DAP</b> 12 signaling in pDCs can mediate different regulatory effects on their functions, depending on the mechanisms of pDC activation. The potential implications of the regulation of pDC functions by <b>DAP</b> 12 for promoting health over disease are discussed...|$|R
