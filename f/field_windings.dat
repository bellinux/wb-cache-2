25|$|The {{magnetic}} flux {{created by the}} <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> follows {{the path of least}} magnetic reluctance, meaning the flux will flow through poles of the rotor that are closest to the energized poles of the stator, thereby magnetizing those poles of the rotor and creating torque.

25|$|In its {{simplest}} (and {{most commonly}} used) form, the railgun differs {{from a traditional}} electric motor in that no use is made of additional <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> (or permanent magnets). This basic configuration is formed by a single loop of current and thus requires high currents (e.g., of order one million amperes) to produce sufficient accelerations (and muzzle velocities). A relatively common variant of this configuration is the augmented railgun in which the driving current is channelled through additional pairs of parallel conductors, arranged to increase ("augment") the magnetic field experienced by the moving armature. These arrangements reduce the current required for a given acceleration. In electric motor terminology, augmented railguns are usually series-wound configurations.|$|E
50|$|A {{compound}} DC motor {{connects the}} armature and <b>fields</b> <b>windings</b> in a shunt {{and a series}} combination to give it characteristics of both a shunt and a series DC motor. This motor is used when both a high starting torque and good speed regulation is needed. The motor can be connected in two arrangements: cumulatively or differentially. Cumulative compound motors connect the series field to aid the shunt field, which provides higher starting torque but less speed regulation. Differential compound DC motors have good speed regulation and are typically operated at constant speed.|$|R

2500|$|A PM motor {{does not}} have a field winding on the stator frame, instead relying on PMs to provide the {{magnetic}} field against which the rotor field interacts to produce torque. Compensating windings in series with the armature may be used on large motors to improve commutation under load. Because this field is fixed, it cannot be adjusted for speed control. PM fields (stators) are convenient in miniature motors to eliminate the power consumption of the field winding. Most larger DC motors are of the [...] "dynamo" [...] type, which have stator windings. Historically, PMs could not be made to retain high flux if they were disassembled; <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> were more practical to obtain the needed amount of flux. However, large PMs are costly, as well as dangerous and difficult to assemble; this favors wound fields for large machines.|$|E

2500|$|Stepper motors are a type {{of motor}} {{frequently}} used when precise rotations are required. In a stepper motor an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled {{by a set of}} external magnets that are switched electronically. A stepper motor may also {{be thought of as a}} cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the stepper motor may not rotate continuously; instead, it [...] "steps"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> are energized and de-energized in sequence.

50|$|One useful {{property}} {{of having the}} <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> in series with the armature winding is that as the speed increases the counter EMF naturally reduces the voltage across, and current through the <b>field</b> <b>windings,</b> giving field weakening at high speeds. This means that the motor has no theoretical maximum speed for any particular applied voltage. Universal motors can be and are generally run at high speeds, 4000-16000 rpm, and can go over 20,000 rpm. By way of contrast, AC synchronous and squirrel cage induction motors cannot turn a shaft faster than allowed by the power line frequency. In countries with 60 Hz(cycle/Sec) AC supply, this speed is limited to 3600 RPM.|$|E
5000|$|The DC motor was the {{mainstay}} of electric traction drives on both electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the motor case. The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and {{is connected to the}} <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> through [...] "brushes" [...] which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the armature called the commutator. The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as [...] "series-wound". A series-wound DC motor has a low resistance field and armature circuit. Because of this, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to Ohm's law. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high torque (turning force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, resistors were used to limit the initial current.|$|E
50|$|There is a weak {{residual}} {{magnetic field}} that persists {{in the metal}} frame of the device {{when it is not}} operating, which has been imprinted onto the metal by the <b>field</b> <b>windings.</b> The dynamo begins rotating while not connected to an external load. The residual magnetic field induces a very small electrical current into the rotor windings as they begin to rotate. Without an external load attached, this small current is then fully supplied to the <b>field</b> <b>windings,</b> which in combination with the residual field, cause the rotor to produce more current. In this manner the self-exciting dynamo builds up its internal magnetic fields until it reaches its normal operating voltage. When it is able to produce sufficient current to sustain both its internal fields and an external load, it is ready to be used.|$|E
50|$|The term back {{electromotive}} force, or just back-EMF, is also {{commonly used}} to refer to the voltage that occurs in electric motors where there is relative motion between the armature and the magnetic field from the motor's <b>field</b> magnets, or <b>windings,</b> thus also acting as a generator while running as a motor.

5000|$|Current in the <b>field</b> <b>windings</b> of a shunt-wound {{generator}} is (approximately) {{independent of}} the load current, because currents in parallel branches are independent of each other.
