50|$|The scintillating {{glass fibers}} work by {{incorporating}} 6Li and Ce3+ {{into the glass}} bulk composition. The 6Li has a high cross-section for thermal neutron absorption through the 6Li(n,Î±) reaction. Neutron absorption produces a tritium ion, an alpha particle, and kinetic energy. The alpha particle and triton interact with the glass matrix to produce ionization, which transfers energy to Ce3+ ions and results in the emission of photons with wavelength 390 nm - 600 nm as the excited state Ce3+ ions return to the ground state. The event results {{in a flash of}} light of several thousand photons for each neutron absorbed. A portion of the scintillation light propagates through the glass fiber, which acts as a waveguide. The fibers ends are optically coupled to a pair of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect photon bursts. The detectors can be used to detect both neutrons and gamma rays, which are typically distinguished using pulse-height discrimination. Substantial effort and progress in reducing fiber detector sensitivity to gamma radiation has been made. Original detectors suffered from <b>false</b> <b>neutrons</b> in a 0.02 mR gamma field. Design, process, and algorithm improvements now enable operation in gamma fields up to 20 mR/h (60Co).|$|E
40|$|With {{the global}} supply of He- 3 {{in short supply}} and an {{increased}} need for neutron detectors, Cdbased detectors provide an attractive alternative. I have done research on various possible designs using Monte Carlo methods to optimize detectors for efficient neutron capture. By examining Cdbased detectors with the highest neutron capture rate will {{be better able to}} distinguish neutrons and gamma rays in order decrease the possibility of <b>false</b> <b>neutron</b> detection...|$|R
40|$|A Monte Carlo {{simulation}} of a large-area neutron time-of-flight detector, {{built on the}} Geant 4 framework, has been compared with an experimental measurement of the View the MathML source decay produced from a 55 MeV/u 17 C beam. The ability of the Monte Carlo simulation to reproduce the intermediate-energy neutron interactions within the detector has been explored using both the stock Geant 4 physics processes and a custom neutron interaction model, menate_r. The stock Geant 4 physics processes were unable to reproduce the experimental observables, while excellent agreement was obtained through {{the inclusion of the}} menate_r model within Geant 4. The differences between the two approaches are shown {{to be related to the}} modeling of the neutron-carbon inelastic reactions. Additionally, the use of menate_r provided accurate reproduction of experimental signals associated with neutron scattering within the detector. These results provide validation of the Monte Carlo simulation for modeling measurements of multiple neutrons where the identification and removal of <b>false</b> <b>neutron</b> signals, due to multiple neutron scattering, are required...|$|R
40|$|At the Paul Scherrer Institute a {{personal}} neutron dosimetry {{system based on}} chemically etched CR- 39 detectors and automatic track counting is in routine use {{since the beginning of}} 1998. The quality of the CR- 39 detectors has always been a crucial aspect to maintain a trustable personal neutron dosimetry system. This paper summarises the 7 y experience in routine use. The effect of detector material defects which could lead to <b>false</b> positive <b>neutron</b> doses is described. The potentiality of improving the background statistics by extending the pre-etch time is investigated and involves as a drawback a quite lower sensitivity to thermal neutrons. Furthermore, the impact of small changes in the production process of the detectors on the response to fast and thermal neutrons is shown. For the personal dosimetry at CERN, a new dosimetry concept was launched by combining a CR- 39 neutron dosemeter with a Direct-Ion Storage (DIS) dosemeter for photon and beta radiation. The usage period of the CR- 39 dosemeters is prolonged now from 3 months up to 12 months. In this context, the long-term behaviour over 1 y of the background track density and the response to Am-Be are describe...|$|R
40|$|Potential {{diversion}} of nuclear materials {{is a major}} international concern. Fissile (e. g., U, Pu) and other nuclear materials (e. g., D, Be) can be detected using 6 - 7 MeV gamma rays produced in the {sup 19 }F(p,{alpha}{gamma}) {sup 16 }O reaction. These gamma rays will induce neutron emission via the photoneutron and photofission processes in nuclear materials. However, they are not energetic enough to generate significant numbers of neutrons from most common benign materials, thereby reducing the <b>false</b> alarm rate. <b>Neutrons</b> are counted using an array of BF 3 counters in a polyethylene moderator. Experiments have shown a strong increase in neutron count rates for depleted uranium, Be, D{sub 2 }O, and {sup 6 }Li, and little or no increase for other materials (e. g., H{sub 2 }O, SS, Cu, Al, C, {sup 7 }Li). Gamma source measurements using solid targets of CaF{sub 2 } and MgF{sub 2 } and a SF{sub 6 } gas target show that proton accelerator of 3 MeV and 10 - 100 microampere average current could lead to acceptable detection sensitivity...|$|R
