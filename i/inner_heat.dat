One-dimensional enthalpy equation was solved using control volume-based implicit finite-difference scheme. Time lag ([phi]), decrement factor (f) and phase transition keeping time ([psi]) of inner surface were applied to analyze the effects of PCM thermo-physical properties, <b>inner</b> surface convective <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient and thickness of SSPCM wallboard. The results showed that for SSPCM, there exist two flat segments within one wave length period of <b>inner</b> surface <b>heat</b> flux lines and it has larger time lag and lower decrement factor than those three ordinary building materials. It was found that melting temperature and thermal conductivity of SSPCM have little effects on [phi], f and [psi], which {{is different from the}} case of temperature waves; for a certain outside heat flux wave, there exist critical values of latent heat of fusion and thickness of SSPCM above which the heat flux wave amplitude can be diminished to zero; <b>inner</b> surface convective <b>heat</b> transfer coefficient is one important factor which significantly influences the decrement factor; and the phase transition zone leads to small fluctuations of the original flat segments of <b>inner</b> surface <b>heat</b> flux line.

The drying properties of dryer can be predicted based on the correlation equations. The drying of paste CaCO 3 materials was industrial-mode experimentally carried out in a fluidized bed with inert particles and immersed heating tubes. The paste material was spray droplet in sizes range of 200 ~ 400 µm with pressure nozzles or air-blast nozzles, and spray {{to the surface of}} inert particles, and the feasible drying conditions were researched. The feasible drying parameters, operation parameters and equipment parameters were researched. The results show that this drying technology can be enhanced the heat transfer and the paste materials of high viscosity can be effectively distributed into the fluidized bed, well distributed temperature in beds, large elasticity of operation, the low energy consumption. The new drying equipment has high drying capacity, small equipment size.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a new homogenization-based {{finite element}} model to compute masonry {{structures}} with compressible joints is proposed. It {{is an extension of}} the model proposed by De Felice et al. (Int. J. Numer. Anal. Meth. Geomech. 2010; 34 (3) : 221 - 247) for dry block structures where strain hardening was neglected. The proposed strain hardening incremental elasto-plastic model is obtained by means of a new step-by-step homogenization method for a running bond masonry structure made of elastic bricks jointed by an elasto-plastic ram. The numerical implicit integration of the model is carried out following an iterative implicit procedure in which the elastic trial stress state is corrected through a return mapping algorithm. The procedure has been implemented in the ABAQUS finite element software and applied to the computation of thermal stresses for the hearths made of small carbon refractory bricks surrounded by very compressible joints. Indeed, during its working, the hearth of the blast furnace is submitted to a high thermal gradient in the radial direction because of the <b>inner</b> <b>heating</b> and the outer cooling imposed to the wall.

40|$|A {{coupling}} {{between a}} polydisperse population balance method (Multiple Size Group Model – MUSIG) and the RPI wall boiling model for nucleate subcooled boiling has been implemented in ANSYS CFX. It allows more accurate prediction of the interfacial area density for mass, momentum and energy transfer between phases {{in comparison to}} the usual local-monodisperse bubble size assumption and underlying bulk bubble diameter correlations as they are commonly used in boiling flow applications like e. g. the prediction of subcooled nucleate boiling in rod bundles and fuel assemblies of PWR. The paper outlines the methodology of the coupled CFD model, which automatically avoids possible inconsistencies in the model formulation for the heated wall, when the generated steam bubbles on the heater surface are injected exactly in the bubble size class corresponding to the predicted bubble departure diameter. The coupling of the RPI wall boiling model and the MUSIG model has been implemented for both homogenous/inhomogeneous variants of the MUSIG model.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{reports the}} {{preliminary}} experimental {{results of an}} hybridization between a classic ventilated facade and photo-voltaic panels powering a Peltier cells system to improve the inner summer comfort with an environmental friendly approach. The outer layer of the facade is made of photovoltaic panels while a pair of light alloy heat exchanger, coupled on the {{opposite sides of the}} Peltier cells, are fitted between the internal space and the air chimney of the facade. The Peltier cells are electrically wired directly with the solar cells: the more the sun affects the front, the more the solar cells produce power to feed the Peltier cells that work as a static heat pump, cooled by the air flowing through the interspace of the ventilated facade. This will result in an inside cooling effect and this effect shall be summed with the well-known passive good performance of the ventilated facade in summer sunny days. During the winter, a simple switch of the power polarity would result in a free <b>inner</b> <b>heating</b> effect, partially using the solar energy incident on the front: the risk of icing on the cold exchanger in the chimney would be reduced because of the heat transmitted by the rear side of the photo-voltaic cells.
