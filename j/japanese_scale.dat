The entire Solar Ark chassis is supported by four “G-Columns” which are custom built pillars by Kubota and in total, these pillars weigh approximately 5,000 tonnes. These high-quality pillars are homogeneous, the result of the seamless method of construction that utilizes centrifugal force. Due to the Solar Ark's sturdy building materials, the Ark is able to resist winds of up to 34 meters/second and level 7 earthquakes on the <b>Japanese</b> <b>scale.</b>|$|E

To develop a <b>Japanese</b> <b>scale</b> to measure patient safety climate and to evaluate its psychometric properties. Methods. Cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted with respect to 9 non-academic general hospitals in Japan. A total of 1878 health care professionals (nurses, therapists, technicians, pharmacists and physicians) were included in a study. Results. The eight dimensions measuring worker attitudes (free communication flow, continuous improvement, reporting/ rules compliance and patient/family involvement) and organizational factors (supervisors ’ safety leadership, allied pro-fessionals ’ safety leadership, patient safety committee leadership and rules/equipment availability) were extracted by factor analysis. The internal consistency (measured by Cronbach’s alpha) and repeatability (measured by intraclass correlation) were more than 0. 70 for all subscales. In addition, the mean score, the within-group interrater reliability statistic (rwg) and the corre-lation coefficients of the mean score were confirmed at the workplace level. Conclusions. The scale showed acceptable dimensionality, reliability and validity. It also provided workplace team-evaluation and a tool for assessing the patient safety climate at the level of the workplace...|$|E
30|$|The 11 March 2011 giant {{earthquake}} with Mw 9.0 occurred off the Pacific {{coast of}} Tohoku {{and is the}} largest historical earthquake to strike in or near Japan.

The huge tsunami generated by this earthquake struck the east-coast along Tohoku, resulting in more than 23, 000 people being killed or missing.

30|$|Figure  5 b {{shows the}} number of occurrences of large {{earthquakes}} of a seismic intensity scale from the earthquake database of the Japan Meteorological Agency (2017) greater than two during each period at the nearest seismic observational point (Choja, Misaki-machi, Ishumi-shi, 35 ° 18 ′ N, 140 ° 23 ′ E, 3.1  km southwest of the study site). The Japanese Seismic Scale cannot be converted to the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale because {{of the difference in}} the calculation method. Observational records were obtained from the earthquake database of the JMA (2017). During the period of June 24, 2014, to June 17, 2016, the maximum intensity was four (May 30, 2015). The number of occurrences was a maximum of four times during period III and a minimum of zero times during period V. When compared to the temporal change in the eroded volumes (Fig.  5 c), a correspondence between these values was unclear. For example, although a maximum erosion volume (178.5  m 3) was recorded during period IV, {{the number of}} occurrences of an earthquake with a seismic intensity greater than two on the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Scale</b> was relatively few (two times). In conclusion, it is suggested that sea waves have a greater impact than earthquakes in regard to triggering rockfalls.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Child Abuse Blame Scale – Physical Abuse (CABS-PA) was {{translated}} into Japanese and its subscale items modified by the authors according to the Japanese cultural context. The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate the appropriateness, reliability, and clinical applicability of the CABS-PA Japanese version (CABS-PA-J). Modifications were made to enable the determination of child abuse recognition in a Japanese cultural setting and early clinical intervention in child abuse cases. Methods The CABS-PA text {{was translated}} into Japanese, then back translated. The appropriateness of scale item translations was verified based on e-mail discussions with the original CABS-PA author. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to examine the validity of CABS-PA-J responses and to confirm the validity of factor structure. Criterion-related validity was also confirmed. The <b>Japanese</b> <b>scale</b> was used to examine the characteristic differences between mothers of premature infants (Results Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses found the factor structure to be similar between the original scale and the translated CABS-PA-J, suggesting adequate factor validity. There was a statistically significant correlation between social support from a spouse or third party and the abuse score on a subscale, partially demonstrating criterion-referenced validity. Similarities and differences were found in the stress reactions of the mothers of premature infants (Conclusion CABS-PA-J was shown to be appropriate and reliable. It is an effective tool for determining the recognition of child abuse among Japanese mothers. </p...|$|E
30|$|Using {{repeated}} UAV-SfM and TLS {{measurements for}} 2  years from June 24, 2014, to June 18, 2016, multitemporal 3 D {{models of the}} sea cliffs were constructed, and the topographic changes of high spatial resolution were clarified. Erosional rates were not constant but varied up to approximately 15 times depending on the period, from 2.5 to 36.5  cm/year, although seasonal variances between the summer and winter seasons were unclear. As the potential main triggers of rockfall and slope failure, we examined the occurrences of high sea waves and significant earthquakes. The average wave height was approximately 2.0  m and the wave height maximum value was 5.9  m. The number of occurrences of a wave height greater than 3.0  m showed relatively good correspondence with the time series of eroded volume. On the other hand, the number of occurrences of an earthquake of a seismic intensity greater than two on the <b>Japanese</b> <b>Scale</b> did not show a clear correspondence with the eroded volume. In conclusion, {{it is suggested that}} sea waves have a greater impact than earthquakes in terms of triggering sea-cliff erosion. However, this result is based on a comparison during {{a relatively short period of}} time of 2  years. Further observational data for longer time periods should lead to a more concrete discussion. In addition, not only the external triggering factors but also conditional factors such as weakening bedrock strength due to weathering, lithological weakness, and structural weakness depending on the 3 D shape of the island should be further considered from the viewpoint of immunity to mass movement.|$|E
