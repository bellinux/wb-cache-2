5|$|After {{graduating from}} Cornell, O'Neill {{accepted}} {{a position as}} an instructor at Princeton University. There he started his research into high-energy particle physics. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a particle accelerator could be stored {{for a few seconds}} in a storage ring. The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a <b>fixed</b> <b>target.</b> His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.|$|E

25|$|Some {{particle}} accelerators {{have been used}} to make neutrino beams. The technique is to collide protons with a <b>fixed</b> <b>target,</b> producing charged pions or kaons. These unstable particles are then magnetically focused into a long tunnel where they decay while in flight. Because of the relativistic boost of the decaying particle, the neutrinos are produced as a beam rather than isotropically. Efforts to construct an accelerator facility where neutrinos are produced through muon decays are ongoing. Such a setup is generally known as a neutrino factory.|$|E

500|$|The panhandle of {{southern}} North Vietnam, however, remained {{the primary focus}} of operations and total sorties flown there rose from 3,600 in April to 4,000 in May. Slowly moving away from the destruction of <b>fixed</b> <b>targets,</b> [...] "armed reconnaissance" [...] missions, in which small formations of aircraft patrolled highways, railroads, and rivers, searching for targets of opportunity, were authorized. These missions increased from two to 200 sorties per week by the end of 1965. Eventually, armed reconnaissance missions constituted 75 percent of the total bombing effort, in part because the system through which <b>fixed</b> <b>targets</b> were requested, selected, and authorized was so complicated and unwieldy.|$|R
25|$|The {{absence of}} Y2K-related {{problems}} occurring before 1 January 2000, {{even though the}} 2000 financial year commenced in 1999 in many jurisdictions, and {{a wide range of}} forward-looking calculations involved dates in 2000 and later years. Estimates undertaken in the leadup to 2000 suggested that around 25% of all problems should have occurred before 2000. Critics of large-scale remediation argued during 1999 that the absence of significant reported problems in non-compliant small firms was evidence that there had been, and would be, no serious problems needing to be fixed in any firm, and that the scale of the problem had therefore been severely overestimated. However, this can be countered with the observation that large companies had significant problems requiring action, that Y2K programmers were fully aware of the variable timescale, and that they were working to a series of earlier target dates, rather than a single <b>fixed</b> <b>target</b> of 31 December 1999.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Plant {{camouflage}} {{is conducted}} {{by use of}} planting and collecting plant and changing color of plant to conceal targets. It {{can be used to}} camouflage relatively big permanent <b>fixed</b> <b>targets</b> in peace time and also to camouflage relatively big permanent <b>fixed</b> <b>targets</b> in peace time and also to camouflage relatively small <b>fixed</b> or moving <b>targets.</b> However, in recent years, with the natural disasters occurring alternately, plant camouflage can be destroyed easily, {{and it is difficult to}} rebuild in a short time. To improve the effect of plant camouflage, more fertilizers are required, which may become an environmental hazard, unless adequate technical and socioeconomic impacts are addressed. A multifunctional slow-release nitrogen fertilizer has been developed to improve fertilizer use efficiency and reduce environmental pollution. In this paper, a series of slow-release formulations of nitrogen fertilizer were developed on the basis of natural attapulgite clay, ethylcellulose film, and sodium carboxymethylcellulose/hydroxylethylcellulose hydrogel. The structural of the product were examined. The slow-release profiles of ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, and urea as nitrogen fertilizer substrates were determined in soil...|$|R

40|$|SAT solvers are {{increasingly}} being used for cryptanalysis of hash functions and symmetric encryption schemes. Inspired by this trend, we present MapleCrypt which is a SAT solver-based cryptanalysis tool for inverting hash functions. We reduce the hash function inversion problem for <b>fixed</b> <b>targets</b> into the satisfiability problem for Boolean logic, and use MapleCrypt to construct preimages for these targets. MapleCrypt has two key features, namely, a multi-armed bandit based adaptive restart (MABR) policy and a counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) technique. The MABR technique uses reinforcement learning to adaptively choose between different restart policies during {{the run of the}} solver. The CEGAR technique abstracts away certain steps of the input hash function, replacing them with the identity function, and verifies whether the solution constructed by MapleCrypt indeed hashes to the previously <b>fixed</b> <b>targets.</b> If it is determined that the solution produced is spurious, the abstraction is refined until a correct inversion to the input hash target is produced. We show that the resultant system is faster for inverting the SHA- 1 hash function than state-of-the-art inversion tools...|$|R
