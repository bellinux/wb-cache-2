5|$|Zahorchak {{announced}} he would resign as <b>education</b> <b>secretary</b> on May 7, 2010. His decision to leave was spurred by the pending end of the Rendell administration, with the governor leaving the office by January 2011. At {{the time of his}} departure, there were no public school districts in the state with more than half of their students testing below basic levels in state standardized tests, although 14 districts fit that criterion before Zahorchak took the job.|$|E
5|$|Bridgwater was {{selected}} as the first town in the South West, outside Bristol, to be selected for the UK government's Building Schools for the Future (BSF) initiative, which aimed to rebuild and renew nearly every secondary school in England. Within Bridgwater, BSF was to redevelop all of the four secondary schools and two special provision schools at an expected cost of around £100 million. This included the complete relocation and rebuilding of a new school combining the both Haygrove and Penrose School. In July 2010, several components of the Bridgwater BSF programme were cancelled and others were singled out for further review.

He launched his campaign during a speech given at a Fabian Society conference and was nominated by 62 fellow Labour MPs.

5|$|Thatcher {{supported}} Lord Rothschild's 1971 {{proposal for}} market forces to affect government funding of research. Although many scientists opposed the proposal, her research background probably made her sceptical of their claim that outsiders should {{not interfere with}} funding. The department evaluated proposals for more local education authorities to close grammar schools and to adopt comprehensive secondary education. Although Thatcher was committed to a tiered secondary modern-grammar school system of education and attempted to preserve grammar schools, during her tenure as <b>Education</b> <b>Secretary</b> she turned down only 326 of 3,612proposals for schools to become comprehensives; the proportion of pupils attending comprehensive schools consequently rose from 32percent to 62percent.|$|E
5|$|On 28 October, MSP and Shadow Local Government Minister Sarah Boyack {{became the}} first person to {{announce}} her candidacy for party leader.

Kezia Dugdale, an MSP for Lothian and Labour's Shadow <b>Education</b> <b>Secretary</b> at Holyrood, announced on 2 November that she would also be a deputy leadership candidate. Each candidate was required to secure ten nominations from among the 80 Scottish Labour members of the House of Commons, Scottish Parliament, and European Parliament. Of those standing in the contest, Murphy received the support of 43 parliamentarians, and Findlay and Boyack secured 12 and 10 nominations, respectively. Dugdale was backed by 51 of her colleagues and Clark had 11 nominations.|$|E

5|$|On June29, {{authorities}} began evacuations {{of residents}} of coastal {{areas in the}} Tamaulipas municipalities of Soto la Marina, Matamoros and San Fernando municipalities. On June30, the state's civil defense agency and <b>education</b> <b>secretary</b> announced that schools would be closed throughout the state during the storm. Thirteen shelters were opened in Reynosa, twenty-two in Matamoros, and ten in San Fernando; a total of 3,000 people sought protection from the storm in the three municipalities. Throughout the state, 20,000 people were asked to evacuate to safer areas. Nuevo León schools were also ordered to be closed for at least 24 hours; the Universidad Regiomontana, Universidad de Monterrey and Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León followed suit. In Monterrey, mandatory evacuations alongside the Santa Catarina River were ordered, {{as well as the}} evacuation of 5,000 families in the highlands of the city. Throughout the state, a total of 90 shelters were opened. Coahuila did not close its schools, expecting Alex to reach the state as a tropical depression or weaker, but asked its schools to not take attendance.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 general {{election}} brought a Conservative government {{to power and}} allowed the Council to shift its focus towards retaining Grammar Schools where they still existed and improving schools where work had been put on hold during the comprehensive debate; despite 90% of English councils adopting comprehensive education, Lincolnshire had retained its grammar schools. Although the County Council began discussing the abolition of them again in 1985, opposition from parents at a public consultation in 1987 resulted in the plans being dropped. With the question of its future resolved, Carre's applied for grant-maintained status in 1989; the <b>Education</b> <b>Secretary</b> approved the proposals and formally granted the status in September 1990. When grant-maintained status was abolished in 1999, Carre's became a Foundation School. Following a successful bid to the DfES, submitted in October 2002, the school was granted specialist Sports College status in 2003. An all-weather pitch was laid out in 2007, and a new technology building with a fitness suite opened in 2011. In 2009, Carre's became a specialist Science College and a lead school for gifted and talented students. The school converted to Academy status in August 2011. In 2014, the governors announced their intention to bid for conversion to a multi-Academy trust and become a coeducational, selective school on a new site; in February 2015, Kesteven and Sleaford High School announced its intention to join the proposed trust, a moved welcomed by Carre's. Carre's officially {{became part of the}} Robert Carre Multi-Academy Trust on 1 September 2015; the schools continue to operate on their sites, sharing staff and facilities.|$|E

50|$|The meeting did {{not endorse}} such a step. However, Meacham and his most active {{regional}} AFSC Peace <b>Education</b> <b>Secretaries,</b> especially Robert Gilmore of New York City and Russell Johnson of Cambridge, Massachusetts, realized that even by gathering {{a few dozen}} prominent academics and writers, and bringing into the group leading non-communist pacifist thinkers like Rev. A. J. Muste, they were moving the discussion of nuclear disarmament farther into the national mainstream than it had ever been. So Meacham and Robert Gilmore called another meeting for March 1960, at the Bear Mountain Lodge above the Hudson River near West Point.|$|R
