5|$|A Fresh Start is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film {{is the story of}} Jim, a chauffeur, who is fired from his job for drunkenness. Jim becomes a tramp, but decides to reform after a little girl orders her butler to give him food. He encounters her again at the zoo and notices that two men are following the girl and her parents. Jim uncovers a plot to kidnap her and takes the place of their chauffeur. Jim then drives the kidnappers to the police station and secures a new position as the family's chauffeur. According to a trade review, the actual kidnapping scene and where Jim overpowers the villain's chauffeur is not actually depicted. The reviewer also stated the strength of the production <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the plot, but in the staging and photography. The film was released on September 2, 1910, and it likely had a wide national release. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v.

If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E

25|$|Non-equilibrium {{thermodynamics}} is {{a branch}} of thermodynamics that deals with systems that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found <b>in</b> nature <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> thermodynamic equilibrium because they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> stationary states, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain {{beyond the scope of}} currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.|$|R
5|$|A neutron {{spectrometer}} {{on board the}} Lunar Prospector spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to {{the northern and southern}} lunar poles, including the crater Shackleton. At the end of this mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth-based telescopes an impact-generated plume containing water vapor. The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor, and this may be an indication that the hydrogen <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> the form of hydrated minerals, or that the impact site did not contain any ice. Alternatively, {{it is possible that the}} crash did not excavate deeply enough into the regolith to liberate significant quantities of water vapor.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
