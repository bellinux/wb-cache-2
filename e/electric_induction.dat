The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{identify}} the parameters influence of the electric motor, the power circuits elements of the converters, built on resistor-thyristor modules, the static torque and the moment of inertia of the mechanism on the vibrational components of the induction motor’s electromagnetic moment. Methodology. The methodological basis for the solution of the task is an integrated approach. The application of the generalized control circuit for an <b>induction</b> <b>electric</b> motor and its mathematical description made it possible to analyze various power circuits of parametric control of an <b>induction</b> <b>electric</b> motor. To create a common control algorithm, effectively use the computer for calculations.

The conducted researches allowed to reveal the peculiarities of the effect of the parameters of the elements of various types of power circuits of the parametric control converters on the vibrational components of the electromagnetic torque of an <b>induction</b> <b>electric</b> motor. Calculations and physical modeling have been performed, it has been possible to establish the conditions for the occurrence of electromagnetic pulsations and to determine the ways of their elimination. It was found that the magnitude of pulsations of the electromagnetic moment of an <b>induction</b> <b>electric</b> motor in quasi-permanent modes depends on the selected power circuit of the converter's stator and rotor commutators, the composition of the elements included in them, and the connection circuits. Comparison of calculated and experimental waveform when starting <b>induction</b> <b>electric</b> motors indicates that the pulsation of the electromagnetic torque is affected by: the size of the opening angle of the valves, their control methods, the rotor speed, the parameters of the electric motor and the mechanism are static and inertial moments. At the same time, it was revealed that the use of resistor-thyristor modules in the power circuits of the stator and rotary commutators reduces the magnitude of the pulsation of the electromagnetic torque of the <b>induction</b> <b>electric</b> motor.

Another ever-present {{question}} {{on my mind}} has been, whether electricity has an actual and independent existence as a fluid or fluids, or was a mere power of matter, like what we conceive of the attraction of gravitation. If determined either way {{it would be an}} enormous advance in our knowledge; and as having the most direct and influential bearing on my notions, I have always sought for experiments which would in any way tend to elucidate that great inquiry. It was in attempts to prove the existence of electricity separate from matter, by giving an independent charge of either positive or negative power only, to some one substance, and the utter failure of all such attempts, whatever substance was used or whatever means of exciting or evolving electricity were employed, that first drove me to look upon induction as an action of the particles of matter, each having both forces developed in it in exactly equal amount.

40|$|International audienceElectro-magneto-optical {{effects in}} {{stationary}} materials are observed when {{the materials are}} placed in strong, static electric or magnetic fields and an electromagnetic wave (light) traverses the medium. The Faraday effect {{is an example of}} the class of phenomena we have in mind. Clearly, the existence of electromagneto- optical effects in material media is direct evidence that the equations for the electromagnetic field in a material medium, unlike the equations for it in vacuum, are non-linear since the sum of two solutions generally fails to be a solution. An analysis of electro-magneto-optical effects, though based on nonlinear equations for which all but the simplest exact solutions are difficult to exhibit, may be simplified and made tractable by assuming that the dynamical part of the solution (the light wave) has such weak intensity that the vectors which describe it may be treated as infinitesimals. Accordingly, in this paper we assume that the electric displacement and magnetic intensity fields are functions of the static <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>induction</b> fields and linear functionals of the small dynamical <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>induction</b> fields. This starting point is derived, in the Appendix, from the assumption that for a more general class of fields, not necessarily representable as the superposition of small dynamic fields on large static fields, the electric displacement and magnetic intensity fields are non-linear functionals of the <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>induction</b> fields. From our initial assumption regarding the variables which enter into the constitutive equations, we derive the limitations which are imposed on them by the assumption that the material is isotropic. The isotropic constitutive equations are then applied to the study of the manner in which a plane electromagnetic wave is propagated in an isotropic material to which static <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>induction</b> fields are simultaneously applied. From these results we consider in greater detail the cases when the applied electric field is zero, leading to the magneto-optical effects, and that when the applied magnetic induction field is zero, leading to the electro-optical effects. The case when both the static <b>electric</b> and magnetic <b>induction</b> fields are nonzero will be given more detailed consideration in a later paper...|$|R
