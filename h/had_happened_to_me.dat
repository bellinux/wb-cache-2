500|$|In early February {{the marquis}} arrived back unannounced {{at his house}} in Rio de Janeiro, much to the {{surprise}} of his wife. The Viscount of Inhaúma also returned home shortly afterwards, but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later. Upon learning of Inhaúma's death, Caxias said: [...] "and the same would have <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> had I not resolved {{to get out of that}} hell." [...] PedroII was greatly disappointed in Caxias, but he was also very aware that the marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war, accomplishments that had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery. The Emperor called the marquis to the Imperial Palace, the Paço de São Cristóvão, on 21 February 1869 for a reconciliation.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{told them}} of the things which <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{during the last few}} hours.|$|E
6000|$|... "Neither did I," [...] I remarked grimly, [...] "until last night." [...] And then I {{told him}} what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He listened eagerly to my story.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> Without doubt I too once wanted {{what those}} ...|$|R
30|$|I suppose {{maybe you}} think {{something}} might <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> or something.|$|R
60|$|LIEUTENANT (confidently). You'll {{change your}} tone, General, {{when you hear}} what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{should have}} left it so, too," [...] said Hernshaw. [...] "That always gives it a chance to explain itself. If such a thing <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I should give {{it all the time}} it wanted." ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not sleep}} well during {{that night on}} board the Spitfire. The place was strange to me, and, besides, my mind was busy with the many things that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> since I had left my uncle's home.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{she never}} got my letter?" [...] he cried, [...] "and knew not what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It is that wife of mine, that cruel wild-cat! I sent the letter to my house, thinking, of course, it would find my {{daughter}} there. For where else should she be?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Some of {{the craziest}} things <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> - uhhh... I mean to people I know." [...] Liz Lachman ...|$|R
30|$|Because I did not study. If I {{had studied}} well, this thing won’t <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I <b>have</b> only myself to blame.|$|R
3000|$|... (a) I suppose {{maybe you}} think {{something}} might <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> or something. * The {{reason why you}} think something might <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> is P.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] Dominey continued, [...] "if I seem to ask {{unnecessary}} questions. Remember that I {{spent the}} first portion of my exile in Africa in a very determined effort to blot out the memory of everything that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> earlier in life. So that is the popular belief?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought so! I {{could follow}} every instant of it; I could {{see just how}} it was. If such a thing <b>had</b> <b>{{happened}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I would have died before I spoke of it {{at such a time}} as this. Oh, why do you suppose it happened to you?" [...] the girl grieved.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't tell you, Quatermain. I don't {{look like}} a criminal, do I? Well, I entered those trees feeling a fairly honest man, and I came out of them feeling like a murderer. It was as though {{something}} terrible <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> there; {{it was as though}} I had killed someone there. Ugh!" [...] and he shivered and took another pull at the Hollands.|$|E
60|$|GLORIA (with quiet scorn). What {{is the use}} {{of being}} weak? You see what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> with this gentleman here, mother. The same thing <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{had better}} {{understand}} each other first," [...] he said. [...] "You have heard what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and will not find me a profitable customer to-day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you think, ladies?" [...] {{and she sat}} herself down, filling an arm-chair {{with her}} goodly person. [...] "What do you think <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> to-day?" ...|$|R
60|$|She now {{wanted me}} to tell her where I had really been and what <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and I gave her a sketch of my adventures. Of course I could not enter deeply into particulars, for that would make too long a story, but I told her where I had stopped, and my {{accounts}} of the bear and the horse were deeply interesting.|$|E
6000|$|... "True, boy," [...] {{replied the}} harpooner, {{in a tone}} of evidently genuine sympathy; [...] "I feel for ye. I knows how I should ha' taken on if it <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But cheer up, lad; you know the old proverb, `There's as good fish in the sea as ever came out o't.' You'll be the death o' many sich yet, I'll bet my best iron." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Cliff smiled. [...] "Nothing has {{happened}} to me," [...] she said. [...] "I have had no set-backs, and I am just as rich to-day,--I should say a great deal richer, than I was on the day when Captain Horn made {{the division of the}} treasure. But I know very well why you thought something <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> You did not expect to find me living in this little house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{you think}} would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Gracie, if I had lost belief when your mother died? I have never lost belief. Pray God I never shall!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In my case," [...] he replied, [...] "I do {{not think}} that exaggeration is possible. Everything <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that could {{possibly}} <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> any one in my unfortunate position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must get}} home now," [...] said he {{in a rather}} faint voice. [...] "Mrs. Peter will be sure that {{something}} <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> and will be worried almost to death." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The storm {{drove him}} ashore {{on our side}} of the bay," [...] said she, [...] "and the next mornin' he came up to our house, and I told him all that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> And when he took our boat and went home and told that story to his wife, she just packed up and went out West, and got {{divorced}} from him. And it served him right, too." ...|$|E
60|$|Half-stunned as I {{was with}} all that <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I rose to my feet, {{thinking}} as I did so of what had befallen the ten young men, and watching the horse which was soaring into the clouds. I left the terrace and wandered on till I came to a hall, which I knew {{to have been the}} one from which the roc had taken me, by the ten blue sofas against the wall.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{it was a}} most {{agreeable}} dinner so far as I was concerned, for I sat {{between my}} hostess and Mrs. Scroope and the rest were too far off for conversation. Moreover as Archibald developed an unexpected quantity of small talk, and Scroope {{on the other side}} amused himself by filling pink-bow Miss Smith's innocent mind with preposterous stories about Africa, as <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> once before at this table, Lady Ragnall and I were practically left undisturbed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Some lifetimes," [...] said Mr. Chalk, gloomily. [...] "I’m fifty-one next year, and {{the only}} thing I ever <b>had</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was seeing a man stop a runaway horse and cart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's one for each, and {{a letter}} to tell which is whose. Grandma and Hannah made them, and I tremble to think what would <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> if I <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} to leave them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Peter, do {{you care}} so much as that? If--if I could be sure that I were doing it for you! If in spite--of all that <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I could be doing {{something}} for you--!" ...|$|R
60|$|Three {{nights later}} we set sail {{with a fair}} wind, and on the {{following}} morning at daybreak {{all that was left}} in sight of the land of Anahuac was the snowy crest of the volcan Orizaba. Presently that vanished into the clouds, and thus did I bid farewell to the far country where so many things <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and which according to my reckoning I had first sighted on this very day eighteen years before.|$|E
60|$|I, too, {{went away}} {{somewhat}} bewildered, for much <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that morning which I {{found it hard}} to understand. Why had the Augusta kissed me? I took it that this was some kind of imperial jest. It was known that I kept aloof from women, and she may have desired to see what I should do when an Augusta kissed me, and then to make a mock of me. I had heard that she had done as much with others.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{is there}} to be ashamed of? I think it's glorious. It's {{one of the most}} romantic things I ever heard of. He simply couldn't help it, and it proves {{everything}} I've said. Of course that was the reason he couldn't see me all along. Why, if such a thing <b>had</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I should go round shouting it from the house-tops. I don't suppose {{he knew what he was}} doing, or else he didn't care; perfectly desperate. What fun!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It will be {{interesting}} <b>to</b> know what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the world. [...] . This green vapor--queer stuff. But I know what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> It's Conversion. I've always known. [...] . But this is being a fool. Talk! I'm going to stop it." ...|$|R
60|$|This being knocked {{cold and}} {{motionless}} {{was perhaps the}} best thing that could <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> My violent struggles had only accelerated my already dangerously accelerated heart, and increased the need for oxygen in my suffocating lungs.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to annoy you," [...] he said, [...] "but I must insist that <b>to</b> <b>me</b> the {{situation}} {{does not appear to}} be without some encouraging features. Let me tell you what <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> since we parted." ...|$|R
