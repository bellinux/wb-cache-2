40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{computationally}} economical stochastic dynamics framework {{to estimate the}} peak inelastic response of yielding structures modelled as nonlinear multi degreeof-freedom (DOF) systems subject to a given linear response spectrum defined for different damping ratios. This is accomplished without undertaking nonlinear response history analyses (RHA) or, to this effect, constructing an ensemble of spectrally matched seismic accelerograms. The proposed approach relies on statistical linearization and enforces pertinent statistical conditions to decompose the inelastic d-DOF system into d linear single DOF oscillators with effective linear properties (ELPs) : natural frequency and damping ratio. Each such oscillator is subject to a different stationary random process compatible with the <b>excitation</b> <b>response</b> spectrum with damping ratio equal to the oscillator effective critical damping ratio. This equality is achieved through {{a small number of}} iterations to a pre-specified tolerance, while peak inelastic response estimates for all DOFs of interest are obtained by utilization of the <b>excitation</b> <b>response</b> spectrum in conjunction with the ELPs. The applicability of the proposed framework is numerically illustrated using a 3 -storey Bouc-Wen hysteretic frame structure exposed to the Eurocode 8 elastic response spectrum. Nonlinear RHA involving a large ensemble of non-stationary Eurocode 8 spectrum compatible accelerograms is conducted to assess the accuracy of the proposed approach in a Monte Carlo-based context. It is found that the novel feature of iterative matching between the <b>excitation</b> <b>response</b> spectrum damping ratio and the ELP damping ratio reduces drastically the error of the estimates (i. e., by an order of magnitude) obtained by non-iterative application of the framework...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a signal averaging algorithm for recovering <b>excitation</b> <b>responses</b> contaminated by overwhelming amount of various types of interference in skin admittance measurements. The algorithm is designed to eliminate Gaussian-distributed noise by use of a recursive approach. The process of recovering low magnitude voltage responses from highly noise-contaminated waveforms is a CPU-intensive task. In real-time measurements, iterative reconstruction algorithm is inefficient and time consuming when slow varying input waveforms are present. To increase the quality of the reconstruction a considerably large number of recursions is required. Increasing the number of recursions is appropriate for batch processing of measurement data. However, the algorithm considers measurements in real-time, whereas required quality of signal reconstruction should be kept independent from the number of recursions...|$|R

40|$|Structural dynamic {{testing is}} {{concerned}} with estimation of system properties, including frequency response functions and modal characteristics. These properties are derived from tests {{on the structure of}} interest, during which <b>excitations</b> and <b>responses</b> are measured and Fourier techniques are used to reduce the data. The inputs used in a test are frequently radom and excite random responses in the structure of interest. When these random inputs and responses are analyzed they yield estimates of system properties that are random variable and random process realizations. Of course, such estimates of system properties vary randomly from one test to another, but even when deterministic inputs are used to excite a structure, the estimated properties vary from test to test. When test <b>excitations</b> and <b>responses</b> are normally distributed, classical techniques permit us to statistically analyze inputs, responses, and system parameters. However, when the input excitations are non-normal, the system is nonlinear, and/or the property of interest is anything but the simplest, the classical analyses break down. The bootstrap is a technique for the statistical analysis of data that are not necessarily normally distributed. It can be used to statistically analyze any measure of input <b>excitation</b> on <b>response,</b> or any system property, when data are available to make an estimate. It is designed to estimate the standard error, bias, and confidence intervals of parameter estimates.

We focus on the momentum distribution of the excitations, n_ k, and observe that larger k modes will equilibrate faster, as has been claimed in recent experimental work. We identify three time regimes. At short times n_ k exhibits oscillations; these are damped out at intermediate times where the system {{appears to be in}} a false-equilibrium. Finally, at longer times, full equilibration occurs. This false-equilibrium is associated with the necessarily slower relaxation of the condensate which sufficiently high k-states (of the <b>excitation</b> <b>response)</b> will then quasi-adiabatically follow. Our work bears on the recent literature focus on interaction quench experiments.

40|$|Chemotaxis of enteric {{bacteria}} in spatial gradients toward {{a source of}} chemoattractant is accomplished by increases in the length of swimming runs up the gradient. Biochemical components of the intracellular signal pathway have been identified, but mechanisms for achieving the high response sensitivity remain unknown. Binding of attractant ligand to its receptor inactivates a receptor-associated histidine kinase, CheA, which phosphorylates the signal protein CheY. The reduction in phospho-CheY, CheY-P, levels prolongs swimming runs. Here, the stimulus–response relation has been determined by measurement of <b>excitation</b> <b>responses</b> mediated by the Tar receptor to defined concentration jumps of the attractant, aspartate, administered within milliseconds by photolysis of a photolabile precursor. The bacteria responded to < 1 % changes in Tar occupancy when adapted to aspartate over concentrations spanning three orders of magnitude. Response amplitudes increased approximately logarithmically with stimulus strength, extending responsiveness over a greater stimulus range. The extent and form of this relation indicates that, in contrast to mechanisms for adaptive recovery, excitation signal generation involves amplification based on cooperative interactions.
