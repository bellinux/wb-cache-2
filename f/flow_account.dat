They will have an embouchure which places an even pressure across the reed by carefully controlling their lip muscles. The air flow will also be carefully controlled by using the strong stomach muscles (as opposed to the weaker and erratic chest muscles) and they will use the diaphragm to oppose the stomach muscles to achieve a tone softer than a forte, rather than weakening the stomach muscle tension to lower air pressure. Their vocal tract will be shaped to resonate at frequencies associated with the tone being produced.|$|E

This dissertation contributes to developing the methodology used to measure how individuals rely on different forms of assets to support consumption throughout their lifecycle. Saving rates are simulated {{in order to measure}} how change in age structure influences saving in the economy. There is controversial and important empirical issue on how much change in age structure can account for a significant change in saving rates. Several empirical studies find that saving rates change substantially as population age structure changes. Some studies find that change in population age structure has modest effects on aggregate saving rates. This dissertation replicates the methodology used by Deaton and Paxson (2000) to simulate saving rates in Thailand. Deaton and Paxson method does not explicitly include intergenerational transfers. This dissertation contributes to taking into account intergenerational transfers, using the NT <b>Flow</b> <b>Account</b> methodology, to simulate saving rates.

The main finding, based on both methods, shows that change in age structure influences saving rates in Thailand before 1985. However, after 1985 change in saving rates are not due to change in age structure but some other secular trend. This dissertation is empirical research on how age structure affects economic flows across ages.

40|$|It is {{recognized}} that understanding {{the flow of}} materials {{into and out of}} the socio-economy is essential for reducing the stress to the environment, improving resource productivity and achieving sustainable development. Efforts are being made in the developed countries to develop the account of material flows, and OECD is preparing guidance manual on the material flow accounting to help countries with little experiences. Objective of this project is, based on the OECD guidance, to construct pilot material <b>flow</b> <b>account,</b> to analyze the progress toward sustainable development using indicators derived from the material flow accounting in comparison with EU countries and to make recommendations for further development of material flow accounting and related policies in Korea. The compiled national economy-wide material <b>flow</b> <b>account</b> by this project reveal the trend of total material input and consumption during the past 15 years in Korea. Total volume of material input and output increased by roughly 78 % (0. 72 billion tons) and 82 % respectively during 1991 - 2005 period. Material use efficiency that means material input per GDP improved by 30 % to 943 tons per million USD, but is still low when compared with average of EU countries. Material consumption per capita rose to 13. 2 tons/year per person, which is close to EU average level. Overall, findings show the trend of relative dematerialization in which the rate of economic growth is bigger than that of material use, and the need of introducing vigorous decoupling policies that can reduce the material use while maintaining economic development. Accomplishments in this project will contribute to the future implementation of material flow accounting in Korea under the OECD guidance, with identified weaknesses in the current statistics system, areas of concern and related recommendations...|$|E

The method of classification tree generation belongs to the group of the ihdata mininglt methods that permit to find out, basing on large data sets, the relationships and links among data. Variables used to classify the firms were financial and assets indices, indices of the firms' position in the capital market, as well as values from financial statements (balance sheet, profit and loss account, cash <b>flow</b> <b>account).</b> Different algorithms were used to generate the classification trees: Chaid, Exhaustion Chaid, C&RT, Quest.

In a crisis context this mechanism, based on asymmetric {{information in the}} credit market, describes how a currency depreciation affects domestic firms' investment. This paper proposes an empirical validation of this theoretical prediction. To this end, we study the investment behaviour of 477 Korean manufacturing firms, particularly during the 1997 Asian crisis. However, contrary to many studies in which cash <b>flow</b> <b>account</b> variable is used as proxy for entrepreneurs'' net worth, our analysis focuses on a more relevant variable, the cash stock, to measure these internal funds. The preliminary results stipulate that firms'' balance sheets {{in the aftermath of}} the Asian crisis, are more robust in explaining investment than before the crisis. It is further shown that this relationship is more relevant for small firms. ...|$|E

The distance from the critical point, the shear rate, {{and the frequency of}} oscillation are systematically varied. Unexpected shear-induced distortions of critical microstructural order is observed in directions perpendicular to the flow direction, more so on closer approach of the gas-liquid critical point. The measured distortion of long-ranged order can be quantitatively understood on the basis of an approximate solution of the Smoluchowski equation, provided that a nonanalytical distortion of short-ranged microstructural order is assumed. These short-ranged microstructural changes, induced by the <b>flow,</b> <b>account</b> for the observed distortion perpendicular to the flow direction, and are responsible for the shear-induced shift of the location of the gas-liquid critical point. The importance of short-ranged correlations renders the behavior of critical systems under shear flow nonuniversal. The origin of the nonanalytic dependence of short-ranged distortions on the shear rate remains unclear. Including these short-ranged microstructural distortions, we find a good agreement between theory and experiment for both stationary and oscillatory shear flow...|$|E

The concepts of gross and net linkages are introduced and the analysis is extended to both current (flow) and capital (stock) accounts. On the gross linkage criterion, only a handful of sectors emerge as key sectors with three or more linkages. These sectors are from within the manufacturing and services categories. This is also the case with sectors having two strong linkages. Agricultural sectors do not feature at all. A transition from gross to net linkages changes the rankings quite significantly. Most agricultural sectors show two strong linkages in the <b>flow</b> <b>account.</b> The findings suggest that Bangladeshi export sector, is typically undiversified in that it relies heavily on agriculture and related industries, with jute and jute textiles accounting for over 70 percent of net export earnings. Not surprisingly, most sectors in the industrial complex are net importers and the domestic production of industrial goods is highly import-intensive. ...|$|E

Following {{the dissolution of}} the Soviet Union, both these processes were reversed, giving modern-day Ukraine the image of untapped agricultural potential. Alongside the country’s proximity to the European Union and its access to the Black Sea, this has made Ukraine a key candidate as a global supplier of feedstock for biofuel. Demand for the latter is rising noticeably, especially in the wake of current European and international blending targets for liquid biofuels. Ukraine has responded with a number of initiatives to further biofuel feedstock production. We have compiled a material <b>flow</b> <b>account</b> for Ukraine, focusing especially {{on the development of the}} agricultural sector since the early 1990 s. By complementing this physical account with an in-depth analysis of political and economic developments, we are able to trace the impact of rising demand for biofuel feedstock on Ukraine.

For that purpose, we address the trajectories generated by unimodal maps {{close to an}} inverse tangent bifurcation and construct their associatedHVgraphs. We showhowthe alternation of laminar episodes and chaotic bursts imprints a fingerprint in the resulting graph structure. Accordingly, we derive a phenomenological theory that predicts quantitative values for several network parameters. In particular, we predict that the characteristic power-law scaling of the mean length of laminar trend sizes is fully inherited by the variance of the graph degree distribution, in good agreement with the numerics. We also report numerical evidence on how the characteristic power-law scaling of the Lyapunov exponent {{as a function of}} the distance to the tangent bifurcation is inherited in the graph by an analogous scaling of block entropy functionals defined on the graph. Furthermore, we are able to recast the full set of HV graphs generated by intermittent dynamics into a renormalization-group framework, where the fixed points of its graph-theoretical renormalization-group <b>flow</b> <b>account</b> for the different types of dynamics.

Quick Scatterometer ocean vector winds and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) precipitation indicate that periods of anomalous surface westerly flow over the east Pacific warm pool during a summertime intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) life cycle are generally associated with an enhancement of convection {{to the east of}} 120 °W. An exception is a narrow band of suppressed precipitation along 8 °N that is associated with negative column-integrated precipitable water anomalies and anticyclonic vorticity anomalies. Periods of surface easterly anomalies are generally associ-ated with suppressed convection to the east of 120 °W. Summertime wind jets in the Gulfs of Tehuantepec and Papagayo exhibit heightened activity during periods of ISO easterly anomalies and suppressed con-vection. Strong variations in east Pacific warm pool wind speed occur in association with the summertime ISO.

The proposed methodology is designed to be clearly more physically based than the existing vulnerability-mapping techniques. It takes the specificity of the karstic environments into account without necessarily excluding the applicability to other geological conditions.

However it also analyzes each indicator used in the practical part. Firstly, horizontal and vertical analysis of the financial records are introduced, also differential and ratio indicators are explained, specifically current ratio, quick ratio, cash ratio, profitability of total property and ordinary capital, rentability of sales. Subsequently the thesis describes the rate of indebtedness of the company and indicators of the activity - turnover of the individual components of the assets side.
