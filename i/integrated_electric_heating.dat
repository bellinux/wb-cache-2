40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effect of passive insulation versus external heating during recovery following a sprint specific warm up on thigh muscle temperature and subsequent maximal sprint performance. METHODS: On three separate occasions, 11 male cyclists (age 24. 7 ± 4. 2 years, height 1. 82 ± 0. 72 m, body mass 77. 9 ± 9. 8 kg; mean ± S. D.) completed a standardized 15 min intermittent warm up on a cycle ergometer, followed by a 30 min passive recovery period before completing a 30 sec maximal sprint test. Muscle temperature was measured in the vastus lateralis at 1, 2 and 3 cm depth prior to and following the warm up and immediately before the sprint test. Absolute and relative peak power output was determined and blood lactate concentration was measured immediately post-exercise. During the recovery period participants wore a tracksuit top and either i) standard tracksuit pants (CONT); ii) insulated athletic pants (INS) or; iii) insulated athletic pants with <b>integrated</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> elements (HEAT). RESULTS: Warm up increased Tm by approximately 2. 5 °C at all depths, with no differences between conditions.

RESULTS: Warm up increased Tm by approximately 2. 5 °C at all depths, with no differences between conditions. During recovery, Tm remained elevated in HEAT compared to INS and CONT at all depths (p< 0. 001). Both peak and relative power output were elevated by 9. 6 % and 9. 1 % respectively in HEAT compared to CONT (both p< 0. 05). The increase in blood lactate concentration was greater (p< 0. 05) post sprint in HEAT (6. 3 ± 1. 8 mmol/L) but not INS (4. 0 ± 1. 8 mmol/L) vs. CONT (4. 1 ± 1. 9 mmol/L). CONCLUSION: Passive heating of the thighs between warm up completion and performance execution using pants incorporating electrically heated pads can attenuate the decline in Tm and improve sprint cycling performance...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part P: Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology. The definitive version is available at: [URL] {{aim of this study}} was to determine the effects of using an electrical heating garment during a 30 -minute recovery period after a standardized swimming warm-up on subsequent swimming performance and upper-body power output. On two occasions, eight male and four female elite competitive swimmers completed a standardized swimming warm-up, followed by a 30 -minute passive recovery period before completing maximal plyometric press-ups and a 50 m Freestyle swim. Plyometric press-ups determined starting strength (SS), peak force (PF) and peak concentric power (PCP). During the recovery period, participants wore tracksuit bottoms and (i) a standard tracksuit top (CON) or (ii) jacket with <b>integrated</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> elements (HEAT). The overall results demonstrated a trend of a relevant (> 0. 4 %) improvement in the 50 m Freestyle performance of 0. 83 % (P = 0. 06) in HEAT vs. CON. In male participants, performance in the 50 m Freestyle significantly improved by 1. 01 % (CON 25. 18 ± 0. 5 s vs. HEAT 24. 93 ± 0. 4 s; P < 0. 05), whereas female participants only showed a trend for an improvement of 0. 38 % (29. 18 ± 0. 5 s vs. 29. 03 ± 1. 0 s; P = 0. 09), in HEAT compared with CON, though statistical power for the latter test was low. Male participants’ starting strength, peak force and peak concentric power were 16. 5 ± 13 %, 18. 1 ± 21 % and 16. 2 ± 21 % greater, respectively, in HEAT compared with CON (all P< 0. 01). In conclusion, external heating of the upper body between completion of the warm-up and performance through the utilization of an electrically heated jacket improves plyometric press-up power output and force production, as well as sprint swimming performance in males. This provides justification for future enhancement opportunities in sporting performance through the utilization of external heating systems. Optimization of the heating system for specific sports is required...|$|E

40|$|Achieving nearly {{zero carbon}} heating {{continues}} to be identified by UK government analysis as an important feature of any lowest cost pathway to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Heat currently accounts for 48 % of UK energy consumption and approximately one third of UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. Heat Networks are being promoted by UK investment policies as one means of supporting hybrid heat pump based solutions. To this effect the RISE (Renewable <b>Integrated</b> and Sustainable <b>Electric)</b> <b>heating</b> system project is investigating how an all-electric heating sourceshybrid configuration could {{play a key role}} in long-term decarbonisation of heat. For the purposes of this study, hybrid systems are defined as systems combining the technologies of an electric driven air source <b>heat</b> pump, <b>electric</b> powered thermal storage, a thermal vessel and micro-heat network as an integrated system. This hybrid strategy allows for the system to store up energy during periods of low electricity demand from the national grid, turning it into a dynamic supply of low cost heat which is utilized only when required. Currently a prototype of such a system is being tested in a modern house integrated with advanced controls and sensors. This paper presents the virtual performance analysis of the system and its design for a micro heat network with multiple dwelling units. The results show that the RISE system is controllable and can reduce carbon emissions whilst being competitive in running costs with a conventional gas boiler heating system...|$|R

40|$|The intermittency {{of power}} {{generation}} by wind and photovoltaic results in volatile spot {{prices at the}} power exchanges. As a consequence amendments in the operational strategies of power plants are required. For {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) units in district heating (DH) networks this means that production is particularly profitable in periods with high spot prices. In situations with low spot prices, in turn, it can be more cost-efficient to operate available peak load boilers instead of the CHP to supply the required heat. These circumstances can make solar district heating economically attractive. Additional flexibility in DH systems based on CHP is achieved by <b>integrating</b> <b>electric</b> boilers and <b>heat</b> pumps into the operational strategy. In this paper concepts for technically and economically optimized “smart” DH systems including solar are presented. The interaction of heat producers in different configurations of DH systems is simulated with a dynamic simulation tool (TRNSYS 17). To investigate the profitability of solar district heating, heat costs of different configurations of DH systems with and without solar are computed. The simulations reveal that in smart DH systems solar heat can displace expensive heat from peak load boilers. It is further shown that solar collectors do not only reduce operating costs of DH systems but are even profitable from a full cost perspective. Sensitivity tests point out that increasing prices of fossil fuels as well as higher shares of PV in power generation prove advantageous to solar district heating...|$|R
