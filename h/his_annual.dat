5|$|The novelist Vladimir Nabokov {{was the son}} of a {{professional}} lepidopterist, and was interested in butterflies himself. He wrote his novel Lolita while travelling on <b>his</b> <b>annual</b> butterfly-collection trips in the western United States. He eventually became a leading lepidopterist.

5|$|Although Riley was wealthy {{from his}} books, {{he was able}} to triple <b>his</b> <b>annual</b> income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in {{managing}} his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours. Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books, and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.|$|E

5|$|His {{enthusiasm for}} {{teaching}} at the university ebbed in his final years there.

Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced <b>his</b> <b>annual</b> salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, he convinced the university to reinstate his original salary.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, for {{the first}} time in many years, Robey {{appeared}} in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in Sinbad the Sailor; Fred Emney Sr played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were as popular as <b>his</b> <b>annual</b> performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.|$|E

In 1832, she sent it to Alaric Alexander Watts for consideration in <b>his</b> <b>annual</b> Literary Souvenir, however in her letter she suggested that the drama may be more appropriate for the juvenile publications edited by his wife, Priscilla Maden Watts. The drama {{was first published in}} 1922 by literary scholar A. Koszul.|$|E

Within days, White requested that his resignation be withdrawn and he be reinstated, and Mayor Moscone initially agreed. However, further consideration—and intervention by other supervisors—convinced Moscone to appoint someone more in line with the growing ethnic diversity of White's district and the liberal leanings of the Board of Supervisors.|$|E

It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, {{in part because of}} their animus from the Stanton affair. In <b>his</b> <b>annual</b> message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{reasons for}} the Second Settlement were as follows. First, after Augustus relinquished the annual consulship, {{he was no longer}} in an {{official}} position to rule the state, yet his dominant position remained unchanged over his Roman, 'imperial' provinces where he was still a proconsul. When he annually held the office of consul, he had the power to intervene with the affairs of the other provincial proconsuls appointed by the Senate throughout the empire, when he deemed necessary. When he relinquished <b>his</b> <b>annual</b> consulship, he legally lost this power because his proconsular powers applied only to his imperial provinces. Augustus wanted to keep this power.|$|E
