5|$|Most {{traditional}} {{or historical}} first-aid treatments for redback spider bites are either useless or dangerous. These include making incisions and promoting bleeding, using ligatures, applying alkaline solutions, providing warmth, and sucking the venom out. In modern first aid, <b>incising,</b> sucking, applying bandages and tourniqueting are strongly discouraged. In 1893, the Camperdown Chronicle {{reported that a}} doctor noticed that a severely ill benumbed victim got much better overnight following treatment using injections of strychnine and cocaine; strychnine had been popular as a snake bite antidote, {{but it was not}} effective. As of 2011, administration of magnesium sulphate was reported to have had some benefit though evidence of effectiveness is weak.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of <b>incising</b> banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} context of <b>incised</b> stones in the Great Basin. <b>Incised</b> stones are small tabular shaped stones, that are easily portable, and have designs <b>incised</b> on the surface. The Great Basin is located in western North America and encompasses a roximately California, Idaho, Nevada, and Utah. The landscape was used by prehistoric hunter-gatherers for over 10, 000 years. The <b>incised</b> stones were left at caves, rock-shelters and open-air sites. This research focused on five sites that are either caves or rock shelters: Camels Back Cave, Gatecliff Shelter, Hogup Cave, Ruby Cave and Swallow Shelter. Context {{was used as a}} fundamental theoretical lens to approach <b>incised</b> stones. A contextual analysis was achieved by employing three analytical methods: chronology, spatial analysis, and design grammar. The chronology of <b>incised</b> stones was discussed in terms of how climate trends affect the number of <b>incised</b> stones left at sites. The spatial analysis examined the <b>incised</b> stones through a chronology at the unit or trench level. The design grammar classifies the imagery of the <b>incised</b> stones. The design grammars were contextualised into the spatial placement of the designs and analysed. The results of this doctoral thesis will highlight how <b>incised</b> stones were connected with specific activities. Interpretations of the <b>incised</b> stones are inferred from this research...|$|R

30|$|Different {{superimposition}} {{patterns of}} complex channels lead to different architectures inside the channel system. Inside restricted channel systems, deeply <b>incised</b> indented and swing complex channels {{are the major}} part and barely develop large natural levees. With weakly restricted channel system, there are deeply <b>incised</b> indented and swing complex channels combined with weakly <b>incised</b> horizontal migration patterns, with deposit overflow along <b>incised</b> valleys, developing large natural levees on both sides. Non-restricted channel system features weakly <b>incised</b> indented and swing channels, along with horizontal migration patterns. There are occasional deeply <b>incised</b> channels {{at the bottom of}} non-restricted channel systems, with no evident natural levee development. Especially in the late stage of channel system development, it is difficult to distinguish between fine-particle-filled channel deposits and natural levee deposits. To sum up, the spatial patterns of channel system vary significantly due to deposition patterns of complex channels.|$|R
25|$|Pottery in Metepec and {{the rest}} of the Toluca Valley began in the pre Hispanic period during which both {{utilitarian}} and decorative/ritual items were made. Pottery in the Valley of Toluca shows strong Nahua influence, especially Aztec. This is especially true for urns, braziers, cups and plates. Another important influence was from the Cholula area of Puebla in the use of polychrome decoration. Decorative techniques included stamping, painting, <b>incising,</b> scraping and raised relief.|$|E
25|$|Engraving is the {{practice}} of <b>incising</b> a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called engravings.

25|$|The SIEA flap {{design is}} more or less similar to the DIEAP flap design, however, it is perfused by {{different}} blood vessels. The superficial epigastric vessels branch off the common femoral vessels in the groin area and vascularise the ipsilateral lower hemi-abdomen. Unlike the DIEAP flap the SIEA flap is not a perforator flap, because the vessels do not perforate the abdominal wall musculature. Therefore, the flap can be raised without <b>incising</b> the anterior rectus sheath and dissecting within the rectus muscles and thus further reducing the chance of donor site morbidity.|$|E

25|$|Many Mississippian {{ceramics}} {{are decorated}} by <b>incising</b> or engraving. Implements such as sticks, reeds, or bone fragments, were dragged through wet clay to incise it, {{or they were}} scratched into {{the surface of the}} dried but as yet unfired pieces to engrave. Sharpened reeds or fingernails were also used to punch small marks. Ornate designs and motifs are common decorative elements, which archaeologists use to track the spread of influences from one culture onto another culture. Many of the designs have symbolic meanings, usually associated with aspects of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ephemeral streams). When an area around such a stream is urbanized, the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round streamflow that hurts the vegetation, wildlife and stream bed of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as meanders and sandbars, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely <b>incising</b> the stream bed upstream. As an example, on many Southern California beaches {{at the mouth of}} a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.|$|E
25|$|Black-figure vase {{painting}} in Euboea was {{also influenced by}} Corinth and especially by Attica. It {{is not always easy}} to distinguish these works from Attic vases. Scholars assume that most of the pottery was produced in Eretria. Primarily amphoras, lekythos, hydria and plates were painted. Large-format amphoras were usually decorated with mythological scenes, such as the adventures of Herakles or the Judgment of Paris. The large amphoras, derived from 7th century shapes, have tapering lips and usually scenes relating to weddings. They are apparently funerary vases produced for children who died before they could marry. Restrained employment of <b>incising</b> and regular use of opaque white for the floral ornaments were typical features of black-figure pottery from Eretria. In addition to scenes reflecting Attic models, there were also wilder scenes like the rape of a deer by a satyr or Heracles with centaurs and demons. The vases of the Dolphin Class were previously regarded as being Attic, but are now considered to be Euboic. However, their clay does not match any known Eretrian sources. Perhaps the pieces were produced in Chalcis.|$|E

30|$|The {{channel system}} (canyon or large <b>incised</b> waterway) is {{regarded}} as a large-scale unit, superimposed by various complex channels (Xie et al. 2012; Yu et al. 2012). Affected by erosive power, the reservoir architecture models of the same deepwater turbidity channel system differ greatly in different deposit locations. Spatial structure characteristics can be represented by the seismic information. Researchers categorize channel systems into restricted (with <b>incised</b> valley), weakly restricted (with <b>incised</b> valley) and non-restricted (without <b>incised</b> valley) according to geomorphic features (Hubbard et al. 2009; Zhao et al. 2012 a, b; Lin et al. 2013; Clark and Pickering 1996; Deptuck et al. 2003; Sun et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2015).|$|R
30|$|In this paper, <b>incised</b> valley filling deposits, which {{formed an}} {{important}} pathway system for long-distance hydrocarbon migration, {{are discussed in}} detail based on core and logging data. The sequence SQy 23 of the Cretaceous Yaojia Formation is the main hydrocarbon-bearing layer in the Fulaerji Oilfield. The hydrocarbon source of the oilfield is the Qijia-Gulong Sag which is about 80 km away from the Fulaerji Oilfield. The transport layer of long-distance hydrocarbon migration is the overlapped sandstone complex which fills the <b>incised</b> valley. The <b>incised</b> valley developed during the depositional period from the late Qingshankou Formation to the early Yaojia Formation of Cretaceous (SQqn 4 -SQy 1) was about 70 km long and 20 km wide, and extended in the NW-SE direction. The overlapped filling of the <b>incised</b> valley mainly occurred in the expanding system tract of the third-order sequence SQy 23 (ESTy 23). Towards the basin, <b>incised</b> valley filling deposits overlapped on the delta developed in the early period, and towards the basin margin, <b>incised</b> valley filling deposits were covered by the shore-shallow lacustrine sandy beach bar developed in the maximum flooding period. All of the delta, the <b>incised</b> valley filling and the shore-shallow sandy beach bar are sandstone-rich, and have high porosity and permeability, and can form an effective hydrocarbon migration and accumulation system. Deltaic sand bodies collected and pumped hydrocarbon from the active source, <b>incised</b> valley filling depositional system completed the long-distance hydrocarbon migration, and lithological traps of shore-shallow lacustrine sandy beach bar accumulated hydrocarbon. The <b>incised</b> valley filling sequences are multi-cycle: an integrated shortterm filling cycle was developed on the erosion surface, and the sequences upward were mud-gravel stone, medium-fine sandstone containing terrigenous gravels and muddy pebbles with cross bedding, silty mudstone with ripple bedding, and mudstone. The <b>incised</b> valley filling deposits are characterized by a strong heterogeneity and the main hydrocarbon migration pathway is the medium-fine sandstone interval.|$|R
25|$|Stone {{sculpture}} is {{an ancient}} activity where pieces of rough natural stone are shaped by the controlled removal of stone. Owing to the permanence of the material, evidence can be found that even the earliest societies indulged {{in some form of}} stone work, though not all areas of the world have such abundance of good stone for carving as Egypt, Greece, India and most of Europe. Petroglyphs (also called rock engravings) are perhaps the earliest form: images created by removing part of a rock surface which remains in situ, by <b>incising,</b> pecking, carving, and abrading. Monumental sculpture covers large works, and architectural sculpture, which is attached to buildings. Hardstone carving is the carving for artistic purposes of semi-precious stones such as jade, agate, onyx, rock crystal, sard or carnelian, and a general term for an object made in this way. Alabaster or mineral gypsum is a soft mineral that is easy to carve for smaller works and still relatively durable. Engraved gems are small carved gems, including cameos, originally used as seal rings.|$|E

The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold or steel are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper, which are called engravings. Engraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper, both in artistic printmaking, and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by photography in its commercial applications and, {{partly because of the}} difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by etching and other techniques. Other terms often used for engravings are copper-plate engraving and Line engraving. These should all mean exactly the same, but especially in the past were often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching.|$|E
25|$|Most pottery {{found at}} the Nodena Site is of the kind known as Mississippian Bell Plain. It was buff colored, {{contains}} large fragments of ground mussel shell as a tempering agent, and isn't as smooth and polished as other varieties. Other kinds found there are much finer, with a finer ground shell as a temper, some instances being so finely ground as to look untempered. The Nodena Phase people put a bowl and a bottle into a grave with the bodies, usually of the finer variety of pottery. Shapes and decoration were varied in the mortuary pottery, from brighly colored abstract spiral designs, to elaborate effigy vessels depicting human heads, animals, and hunters and their prey. Pottery made by the Nodena people was built up from strips of clay, and then smoothed out by the potter, much like other pottery in the Eastern America area where the potters wheel was unknown. Slips using galena for white, hematite for red, and sometimes graphite for black were used to paint the pottery, with a red on white swastika design being particularly popular. Sometimes <b>incising</b> was used (an example is the incised raptor image on the effigy head pot pictured), although it is rare in Nodena pottery.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of topical treatment with zinc oxide (2. 5 %, 10 %, 25 % and 50 %) and intraperitoneal treatment with diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC) (50 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg and 1, 000 mg/kg) on the mitotic index of epidermal basal cells in <b>incised</b> and non-incised mouse skin. The present results showed that topical application of zinc oxide (25 % and 50 %) increased the mitotic index of epidermal basal cells in <b>incised</b> skin and non-incised skin. Conversely, intraperitoneal administration of DEDTC (500 mg/kg and 1, 000 mg/kg) decreased the mitotic index, but only in the <b>incised</b> skin. These results suggest that mitosis of epidermal basal cells may be stimulated by the topical application of zinc oxide both in <b>incised</b> and non-incised mouse skin, and that it also may be inhibited by the intraperitoneal administration of DEDTC in <b>incised</b> mouse skin. </p...|$|R
