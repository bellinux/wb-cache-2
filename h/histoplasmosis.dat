5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases {{of humans and}} animals. Pathogenic bacteria cause diseases such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax. Protozoa cause diseases including malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis. Microscopic fungi cause diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis and <b>histoplasmosis.</b> Pathogenic viruses cause diseases such as influenza, yellow fever and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Starlings' {{droppings}} {{can contain}} the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, {{the cause of}} <b>histoplasmosis</b> in humans. At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings. There {{are a number of}} other infectious diseases that can potentially be transmitted by common starlings to humans, although the potential for the birds to spread infections may have been exaggerated.|$|E
5|$|Fungal {{pneumonia}} is uncommon, but occurs {{more commonly}} in individuals with weakened immune systems due to AIDS, immunosuppressive drugs, or other medical problems. It {{is most often}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, blastomyces, Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jiroveci (pneumocystis pneumonia), and Coccidioides immitis. <b>Histoplasmosis</b> is most common in the Mississippi River basin, and coccidioidomycosis is most common in the Southwestern United States. The number of cases has been increasing in the later half of the 20th century due to increasing travel and rates of immunosuppression in the population.|$|E
5|$|Lung cancer often {{appears as}} a solitary {{pulmonary}} nodule on a chest radiograph. However, the differential diagnosis is wide. Many other diseases can also give this appearance, including metastatic cancer, hamartomas, and infectious granulomas such as tuberculosis, <b>histoplasmosis</b> and coccidioidomycosis. Lung cancer can also be an incidental finding, as a solitary pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph or CT scan done for an unrelated reason. The definitive diagnosis of lung cancer is based on histological examination of the suspicious tissue {{in the context of}} the clinical and radiological features.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms are the causative agents (pathogens) in many {{infectious}} diseases. The organisms involved include pathogenic bacteria, causing {{diseases such}} as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax; protozoa, causing {{diseases such as}} malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis; and also fungi causing diseases such as ringworm, candidiasis or <b>histoplasmosis.</b> However, other diseases such as influenza, yellow fever or AIDS are caused by pathogenic viruses, which are not usually classified as living organisms and are not, therefore, microorganisms by the strict definition. No clear examples of archaean pathogens are known, although a relationship has been proposed between the presence of some archaean methanogens and human periodontal disease.|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include aspergillosis, candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, <b>histoplasmosis,</b> mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, <b>histoplasmosis</b> both directly and in guano, Nipah Hendra viruses, and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|E
25|$|LDH {{is often}} {{measured}} in HIV patients as a non-specific marker for pneumonia due to Pneumocystis jirovecii (PCP). Elevated LDH {{in the setting}} of upper respiratory symptoms in an HIV patient suggests, but is not diagnostic for, PCP. However, in HIV-positive patients with respiratory symptoms, a very high LDH level (>600 IU/L) indicated <b>histoplasmosis</b> (9.33 more likely) in a study of 120 PCP and 30 <b>histoplasmosis</b> patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} {{differential diagnosis}} is extensive and requires consideration {{of many other}} infectious diseases such as typhoid fever, shigellosis, rickettsial diseases, cholera, sepsis, borreliosis, EHEC enteritis, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, plague, Q fever, candidiasis, <b>histoplasmosis,</b> trypanosomiasis, visceral leishmaniasis, measles, and viral hepatitis among others.|$|E
25|$|St Clair Cave, one of Jamaica's {{more famous}} caves, {{is found in}} the parish. This large, complex cave {{contains}} one of the most notable bat roosts on the island, {{and is one of the}} few known historical sites for the possibly extinct bat, Phyllonycteris aphylla. Because of the biological importance of the system, and the inherent dangers involved in exploring it (i.e. noxious gases, <b>histoplasmosis,</b> Cutaneous larva migrans, difficult footing), casual visitation is discouraged.|$|E
25|$|During {{the next}} several decades {{it became clear that}} the {{etiological}} agent of the disease that was at first called Coccidioides infection and later coccidioidomycosis was a fungal pathogen, and coccidioidomycosis was also distinguished from <b>Histoplasmosis</b> and Blastomycosis. Further, C. immitis was identified as the culprit of respiratory disorders previously called San Joaquin Valley fever, desert fever, and Valley fever, and a serum precipitin test was developed by Charles E. Smith that was able to detect an acute form of the infection. In retrospect, Smith played a major role in both medical research and raising awareness about coccidioidomycosis, especially when he became dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley in 1951.|$|E

500|$|With a {{collection}} of songs reportedly written while snowed in on his Minnesota ranch, Dylan booked recording time with Daniel Lanois at Miami's Criteria Studios in January 1997. The subsequent recording sessions were, by some accounts, fraught with musical tension. Before the album's release Dylan was hospitalized with a life-threatening heart infection, pericarditis, brought on by <b>histoplasmosis.</b> His scheduled European tour was cancelled, but Dylan made a speedy recovery and left the hospital saying, [...] "I really thought I'd be seeing Elvis soon." [...] He {{was back on the}} road by mid-year, and performed before Pope John Paul II at the World Eucharistic Conference in Bologna, Italy. The Pope treated the audience of 200,000 people to a homily based on Dylan's lyric [...] "Blowin' in the Wind".|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after {{completing}} the album, Dylan became seriously ill with near-fatal <b>histoplasmosis.</b> His forthcoming tour was canceled, and {{he spent most of}} June 1997 in excruciating pain. A potentially serious condition (caused by the fungal infection histoplasma capsulatum), it makes breathing very difficult. [...] "It was something called <b>histoplasmosis</b> that came from just accidentally inhaling a bunch of stuff that was out on one of the rivers by where I live," [...] said Dylan. [...] "Maybe one month, or two to three days out of the year, the banks around the river get all mucky, and then the wind blows and a bunch of swirling mess is in the air. I happened to inhale a bunch of that. That's what made me sick. It went into my heart area, but it wasn't anything really attacking my heart," [...] Dylan told Guitar World magazine.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Histoplasmosis,</b> {{caused by}} Histoplasma capsulatum, {{is a disease}} with a {{worldwide}} distribution. [...] In the United States it is mainly found in the Mississippi and Ohio River areas, most commonly in bird and bat feces. [...] Signs include weight loss, cough, fever, enlarged lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal symptoms. [...] Coccidioidomycosis, caused by Coccidioides immitis, is found in arid and semi-arid regions of Central and South America, Mexico, and southwestern United States. [...] Signs include weight loss, fever, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, and lameness.|$|E
2500|$|Edwards {{spent a year}} in {{intensive}} study of early Church history, then began to seek out anyone who had known Watchman Nee and his church planting ministry in China. [...] He first sought the company of Beta Sheirich, a former co-worker of Nee's who had returned from China to a fellowship in Louisville, Kentucky. [...] While meeting in a conference with this group, he contracted disseminated <b>histoplasmosis,</b> which nearly took his life and confined him to bed for the next year. [...] Pain and illness from this disease would haunt Edwards for the remainder of his life. [...] In August 1965, he moved his family from Texas, to the Los Angeles area, where he soon began teaching high school (a profession he would remain in for the next 10 years).|$|E
50|$|Granulomas {{are seen}} in most forms of <b>histoplasmosis</b> (acute <b>histoplasmosis,</b> histoplasmoma, chronic <b>histoplasmosis).</b> Histoplasma organisms can {{sometimes}} be demonstrated within the granulomas by biopsy or microbiological cultures.|$|E
50|$|If {{symptoms}} of <b>histoplasmosis</b> infection occur, they will start within 3 to 17 days after exposure; {{the average is}} 12-14 days. Most affected individuals have clinically silent manifestations and show no apparent ill effects. The acute phase of <b>histoplasmosis</b> is characterized by non-specific respiratory symptoms, often cough or flu-like. Chest X-ray findings are normal in 40-70% of cases. Chronic <b>histoplasmosis</b> cases can resemble tuberculosis; disseminated <b>histoplasmosis</b> affects multiple organ systems and is fatal unless treated.|$|E
50|$|Progressive disseminated <b>histoplasmosis</b> is an {{infection}} caused by Histoplasma capsulatum, {{and most people}} who develop this severe form of <b>histoplasmosis</b> are immunocompromised or taking systemic corticosteroids. Skin lesions are present in approximately 6% of patients with dissemination.|$|E
50|$|African <b>histoplasmosis</b> is an {{infection}} caused by Histoplasma duboisii. Disease {{has been most}} often reported in Uganda, Nigeria, Zaire and Senegal. In human disease it manifests differently than <b>histoplasmosis</b> (caused by Histoplasma capsulatum), most often involving the skin and bones and rarely involving the lungs.|$|E
50|$|In the {{majority}} of immunocompetent individuals, <b>histoplasmosis</b> resolves without any treatment. Antifungal medications are used to treat severe cases of acute <b>histoplasmosis</b> and all cases of chronic and disseminated disease. Typical treatment of severe disease first involves treatment with amphotericin B, followed by oral itraconazole.|$|E

50|$|Presumed ocular <b>histoplasmosis</b> {{syndrome}} (POHS) causes chorioretinitis, {{where the}} choroid and retina {{of the eyes}} are scarred, resulting {{in a loss of}} vision not unlike macular degeneration. Despite its name, the relationship to Histoplasma is controversial. Distinct from POHS, acute ocular <b>histoplasmosis</b> may rarely occur in immunodeficiency.|$|E
50|$|<b>Histoplasmosis,</b> like blastomycosis, may {{disseminate}} haematogenously {{to infect}} internal organs and tissues, {{but it does}} so in a very low proportion of cases, and half {{or more of these}} dissemination cases involve immunocompromise. Unlike blastomycosis, <b>histoplasmosis</b> is a recognized AIDS-defining illness in people with HIV infection; disseminated <b>histoplasmosis</b> affects approximately 5% of AIDS patients with CD4+ cell counts <150 cells/µL in highly endemic areas. The incidence of this condition dropped significantly after introduction of current anti-HIV therapies. Other conditions very uncommonly associated with H. capsulatum include endocarditis and peritonitis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Histoplasmosis</b> (also {{known as}} [...] "Cave disease," [...] "Darling's disease," [...] "Ohio valley disease," [...] "reticuloendotheliosis," [...] "spelunker's lung" [...] and [...] "caver's disease") {{is a disease}} caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum. Symptoms of this {{infection}} vary greatly, but the disease affects primarily the lungs. Occasionally, other organs are affected; this is called disseminated <b>histoplasmosis,</b> {{and it can be}} fatal if left untreated.|$|E
50|$|Inhalation {{of dusty}} bat manure {{may result in}} <b>histoplasmosis,</b> which will present as a mild {{respiratory}} infection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Histoplasmosis</b> {{is usually}} a {{subclinical}} infection that does {{not come to the}} attention of the person involved. The organism tends to remain alive in the scattered pulmonary calcifications; therefore, some cases are detected by emergence of serious infection when a patient becomes immunocompromised, perhaps decades later. Frank cases are most often seen as acute pulmonary <b>histoplasmosis,</b> a disease that resembles acute pneumonia but is usually self-limited. It is most often seen in children newly exposed to H. capsulatum or in heavily exposed individuals. Erythematous skin conditions arising from antigen reactions may complicate the disease, as may myalgias, arthralgias, and rarely, arthritic conditions. Emphysema sufferers may contract chronic cavitary pulmonary <b>histoplasmosis</b> as a disease complication; eventually the cavity formed may be occupied by an Aspergillus fungus ball (aspergilloma), potentially leading to massive hemoptysis. Another uncommon form of <b>histoplasmosis</b> is a slowly progressing condition known as granulomatous mediastinitis, in which the lymph nodes in the mediastinal cavity between the lungs become inflamed and ultimately necrotic; the swollen nodes or draining fluid may ultimately affect the bronchi, the superior vena cava, the esophagus or the pericardium. A particularly dangerous condition is mediastinal fibrosis, in which a subset of individuals with granulomatous mediastinitis develop an uncontrolled fibrotic reaction that may press on the lungs or the bronchi, or may cause right heart failure. There are a number of other rare pulmonary manifestations of <b>histoplasmosis.</b>|$|E
