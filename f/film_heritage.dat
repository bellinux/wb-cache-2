500|$|The NFPB {{adds to the}} NFR up to 25"culturally, historically, or aesthetically {{significant}} films" [...] each year, showcasing {{the range}} and diversity of American <b>film</b> <b>heritage</b> to increase awareness for its preservation. To be eligible for inclusion, a film {{must be at least}} tenyears old. For the first selection in 1989, the public nominated almost 1,000films for consideration. Members of the NFPB then developed individual ballots of possible films for inclusion. The ballots were tabulated into a list of 25films which was then modified by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington and his staff at the Library for the final selection. Since 1997, members of the public have been able to nominate up to 50films a year for the NFPB and Librarian to consider.|$|E

40|$|This {{collection}} of original essays {{will be the}} first to examine the place of the 'woman's picture' within British cinema history. Traditionally, discussion of the woman's picture has tended to focus on Hollywood, with substantial critical attention paid to 30 s and 40 s films such as "Stella Dallas" and "Now Voyager". Although there has been some work on the female-centred films made by Gainsborough studios, there has been a tendency for British films that might otherwise be categorised as women's pictures to be siphoned off into other groupings: such as war <b>films,</b> <b>heritage</b> <b>films</b> etc. This collection will redress the balance by reassessing key British films and cycles of film-making through the critical lens of the woman's picture, taking a fresh look at the female and the feminine realm in British film culture from the 40 s melodrama to the contemporary 'chick flick'...|$|R

500|$|Although 20th Century Fox {{officials}} at the time remarked that [...] "only old films" [...] were destroyed, the 1937 Fox vault fire is now understood as a significant loss of American <b>film</b> <b>heritage.</b> Film historian Anthony Slide called {{the destruction of the}} Fox Film Corporation vault [...] "the most tragic" [...] American nitrate fire. The highest-quality examples of every Fox film produced prior to 1932 were destroyed. Although copies located elsewhere allowed some of these films to survive, mostly as lower-quality prints or mere fragments of film, more than 75% of Fox's feature films from before 1930 are completely lost. Total or near total losses occurred for many Fox performers including Theda Bara, Valeska Suratt, William Farnum, George Walsh and notorious celebutante performer Evelyn Nesbit, who made roughly a dozen films for the studio. As he had moved to Fox in 1918, much Tom Mix material was also lost. The Little Ferry vaults also held works by other film studios which had contracted with Fox for distribution. Educational Pictures had more than 2,000 negatives and prints destroyed, including the negatives of Buster Keaton's silent films with the company. Also present was the original negative of D. W. Griffith's Way Down East (which Fox had purchased with the intent of remaking), the negative for the controversial Christie Productions sponsored film The Birth of a Baby, and films by smaller studios such as Atherton Productions, Peck's Bad Boy Corporation, Principal Pictures, and Serial Producing. Archival material intended for the Museum of Modern Art's Film Library was lost as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{debate around}} <b>heritage</b> <b>film</b> {{has been going}} on since the model was created in the 1990 s, however {{acknowledging}} that it is a genre; however changing and developing; can help us to understand the way in which Britain presents itself {{to the rest of the}} world as well as ourselves. This dissertation will look at the representation of the British Monarchy in British cinema between 2006 and 2010, focusing on the films, The Queen (Frears 2006), Elizabeth the Golden Age (Kapur 2007), The Duchess (Dibb 2008), The Young Victoria (Vallee 2009) and The Kings Speech (Hooper 2010). Using the <b>heritage</b> <b>film</b> models created by Andrew Higson it will be discussed how this affects the way we view the representation of the monarchy in popular culture. By analysing the films as part of the heritage genre through historical backgrounds (both the era the films are set and the context in which they are made) as well as looking at aesthetic choices and the depiction of gender throughout these films it will be discussed how the heritage model helps us to define representations of the monarchy in recent British feature <b>films.</b> The <b>heritage</b> <b>film</b> model does shape the representation of the monarchy into a positive and nostalgic entity through the above-mentioned aspects. Looking at these films as a group rather than individual emphasises this...|$|R
