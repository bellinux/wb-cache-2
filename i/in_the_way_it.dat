5|$|After the Nika Revolt {{destroyed}} much of {{the city}} of Constantinople in 532, including the churches of Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") and Hagia Irene ("Holy Peace"), Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild. Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas, although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt on a much grander scale. Built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537, the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world. It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs. The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from the current one and, according to contemporary accounts, much bolder.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{violence}} in Chile {{is a serious}} issue affecting {{a large percentage of}} the population, especially among lower income demographics. The Intrafamily Violence Law passed in 1994 was the first political measure to address {{violence in}} the home, but because the law would not pass without being accepted by both sides, the law was weak <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> addressed victim protection and punishment for abusers. The law was later reformed in 2005. A 2004 SERNAM study reported that 50 percent of married women in Chile had suffered spousal abuse, 34 percent reported having suffered physical violence, and 16 percent reported psychological abuse. According to another study from 2004, 90 percent of low-income women in Chile experience some type of domestic violence. Due to the high prevalence of domestic violence, many Chilean women accept it as normal. The legalization of divorce in 2004 won the approval of women throughout the country, especially those concerned about domestic violence, as women were previously unable to escape abusive relationships due to the divorce laws.|$|E

40|$|One way {{in which}} law protects dignity is by {{enforcing}} human rights provisions that explictly or implicitly involve the protection of dignity or the prevention of degradation. But law 2 ̆ 7 s connection with dignity is also much deeper and more pervasive than this. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>it</b> operates, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>it</b> presents its requirements, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> law expects its requirements to be taken on baord and observed by those to whom the requirements are primarily addressed, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> procedural <b>way</b> that <b>it</b> organizes hearings, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>it</b> sponsors argumentation, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that <b>it</b> arranages for coercion [...] in all these ways, law treats humans as dignified agents, capable of self-control, {{with a sense of}} themsleves and their interests, and with the ability to respond intelligently and thoughtfully to its demands.

40|$|A central {{debate about}} the {{transformation}} of post-communists countries is how the process of institution building impacts firm restructuring and creation. This debate has largely been dominated by approaches that emphasize either the depoliticization of institutional designs or the determining impact of pre-existing social structures. These views, however, have serious problems explaining {{one of the key}} comparative developments in East-Central Europe – the strong economic growth <b>in</b> Poland and <b>the</b> demise of <b>the</b> Czech Republic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990 s. This paper explains these differences by offering an alternative, embedded politics approach that views firm and institutional creation as intertwined experiments. Czech attempts to implant a depoliticized model of reform impeded the necessary reorganization of socio-political networks, in which firms are embedded. Poland facilitated institutional experiments not only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> promoted negotiated solutions to restructuring, but also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> <b>it</b> empowered sub-national governments.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of East-Central Europe deepens {{the debate about}} firm creation in a unique way: how do approaches to institutional creation impact the creation of firms? This paper theoretically and empirically explores this question by offering an alternative, embedded politics approach to explain <b>the</b> sharp contrasts <b>in</b> policy and SME manufacturing growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic (CR) and Poland. Whereas Polish policies of gradual privatization and state intervention into restructuring led to significant growth in new firms, Czech policies of rapid, mass privatization produced stagnation. I argue that institutional experiments based on public actors becoming financial partners and conflict mediators enhance the ability of network actors to learn and monitor one another, and thus experiment with new forms of organization.
