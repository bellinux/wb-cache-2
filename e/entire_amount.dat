5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the rate of}} the state sales tax from 6% to 7% took effect on July 15, 2006, and also increased the sales tax rate in the state's Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZs) from 3% to 3.5%. A significant change was made in the payment of sales taxes by businesses operating in the UEZs in that they would be required to pay the <b>entire</b> <b>amount</b> of the full tax rate to the state on all appropriate purchases, and wait for the state to rebate them the difference.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that the <b>entire</b> <b>amount</b> of the purchase money was not paid, and that such fact is {{in the way of}} supporting the claim to the Indian title, is not sustained. We are not called upon to consider the effect of default in payment of any portion of the purchase money. The treaty recites the payment of it, and as no such question seems ever before to have been raised, or full payment questioned, either by government or the Indians, it must at this late day be assumed, until the contrary is quite clearly made to appear, that the contract in that respect was performed.|$|E
5|$|The {{enormous}} amount of public revenue created by the pipeline provoked debates {{about what to do}} with the windfall. The record $900 million created by the Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale took place at a time when the entire state budget was less than $118 million, yet the <b>entire</b> <b>amount</b> created by the sale was used up by 1975. Taxes on the pipeline and oil carried by it promised to bring even more money into state coffers. To ensure that oil revenue wasn't spent as it came in, the Alaska Legislature and governor Jay Hammond proposed the creation of an Alaska Permanent Fund—a long-term savings account for the state. This measure required a constitutional amendment, which was duly passed in November 1976. The amendment requires at least 25 percent of mineral extraction revenue to be deposited in the Permanent Fund. On February 28, 1977, the first deposit—$734,000—was put into the Permanent Fund. That deposit and subsequent ones were invested entirely in bonds, but debates quickly arose about the style of investments and what they should be used for.|$|E

25|$|Tax exempt {{events to}} raise money for long serving players are also used in some other sports such as football, {{although}} they tend to be called testimonials in that case and are usually a single match rather than a season of events. The tax free status of benefits and testimonials rests on a single early 20th century legal ruling, and great care has to be taken by every benefit committee not to breach the rules in some small way which might lead to the player receiving a demand for tax on the <b>entire</b> <b>amount,</b> or to provoke the Inland Revenue into challenging the exemption on an overall basis. However, testimonials for prominent professional footballers have in modern times increasingly become charity fundraisers in which the player donates either a large part or all of the proceeds to one or more organisations.|$|E
25|$|That spring, while Gourly and Vanneau were at Bastia, ten English captains and a boy, all former {{prisoners of}} the French, arrived {{there in a}} cartel, utterly destitute.

Gourly immediately went to the British commissary-general, the Honourable John Erskine, and asked Erskine to cash his bill for that amount. Erskine refused, saying that he would simply lend Gourly the money, but asked what it was for. On being told the story, Erskine immediately stated that as he could better afford the loss than Gourly, should the captains fail to repay, he would lend them the money directly. A few days later Vanneau took the men to Leghorn, where {{they were able to}} write bills and remit to Erskine the <b>entire</b> <b>amount</b> they owed.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} of gas chromatography(GC), for measurments of {{chloroform}} or methylene chloride in whole blood which {{allowed us to}} introduce {{as much as a}} 5 ml volume of headspace vapor without any loss, is presented with use of a low oven temperature (- 30 ℃). After heating a blood sample containing the two drugs (internal standard, vice versa) in a 7. 0 ml vial at 55 ℃ for 20 min, 5 ml of the headspace vapor was drawn into a glass syringe. All vapor was introduced through an injection port in the splittless mode into an RtxVolatiles middle-bore capillary column at - 30 ℃ of oven temperature for trapping <b>entire</b> <b>amounts</b> of compounds to be analyzed and the oven temperature was programmed up to 280 ℃ for detection of the compounds. The present conditions gave sharp peaks for both compounds and very low background noises for whole blood samples. The calibration curves showed linearity in the range of 0. 01 - 5. 0 ug/ 0. 5 ml whole blood. The detection limit was about 2 ng / 0. 5 ug whole blood. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|R

25|$|Although Kyrgyzstan has {{abundant}} {{water running}} through it, its water supply {{is determined by}} a post-Soviet sharing agreement among the five Central Asian republics. As in the Soviet era, Kyrgyzstan {{has the right to}} 25% of the water that originates in its territory, but the new agreement allows Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan unlimited use of the water that flows into them from Kyrgyzstan, with no compensation for the nation at the source. Kyrgyzstan uses the <b>entire</b> <b>amount</b> to which the agreement entitles it, but utilization is skewed heavily in favor of agricultural irrigation. During the Soviet era, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan shared their abundant water resources with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan during summer, and these three nations shared oil and gas with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in winter. According to the International Crisis Group, the skewed system that is currently in place could cause irreversible regional destabilization, and needs to be dealt with by international actors to avoid a crisis in Central Asia. In 1994 agriculture accounted for about 88% of total water consumption, compared with 8% by industry and 4% by municipal water distribution systems. According to World Bank experts, Kyrgyzstan has an adequate supply of high-quality water for future use, provided the resource is prudently managed.|$|E
