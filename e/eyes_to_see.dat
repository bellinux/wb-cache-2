This {{is where the}} Malayan princes once sailed and this is where the bullock carts plodded their way up and down each bank as the river found its way to the former rocky river mouth. This is also where an early civilisation was conquered by the Javanese Majapahit Empire, in the year 1376.|$|E
25|$|Grand Master Oogway, an old {{tortoise}} and Shifu's mentor, has {{a vision}} that Shifu's former student, the evil snow leopard Tai Lung, will escape from prison {{and return to the}} Valley of Peace to take revenge for being denied the Dragon Scroll, which is said to hold the secret to limitless power. Shifu is alarmed and sends his messenger, the goose Zeng, with a request for the prison to heighten security in order to prevent Tai Lung's escape. He then holds a kung fu tournament for the Furious Five so that Oogway may identify the Dragon Warrior, the one kung fu master worthy of receiving the Dragon Scroll and capable of defeating Tai Lung. Forced to take a cumbersome noodle cart to the tournament, Po arrives as the arena doors close and is unable to enter. Desperate to see the Dragon Warrior chosen, Po straps himself to a set of fireworks, rockets into the sky, and crashes {{into the middle of the}} arena and opens his <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Oogway pointing his finger at him. To the shock of everyone present, Oogway proclaims Po as the Dragon Warrior.|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} Boston College, Paul {{worked as a}} case worker at an inner city school in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston, working with {{children}} with behavioral problems and also worked {{as a social worker}} in Boston with clients who were drug dealers, rapists, and other kinds of criminal offenders. [...] His work experiences opened his <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world in a broader, more open-minded way and provided material for the songs he was beginning to write. [...] Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write about the things he knew well. In her review of Ellis Paul Live for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, [...] "His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels. [...] His is a poet's heart, and a romantic's soul. [...] He is an optimist who believes in people and possibilities." ...|$|E
500|$|Charles suspected, {{probably}} correctly, {{that some}} members of the English Parliament had colluded with the invading Scots. On 3 January 1642, Charles directed Parliament to give up five members of the Commons – Pym, John Hampden, Denzil Holles, William Strode and Sir Arthur Haselrig – and one peer – Lord Mandeville – on the grounds of high treason. When Parliament refused, it was possibly Henrietta Maria who persuaded Charles to arrest the five members by force, which Charles intended to carry out personally. However, news of the warrant reached Parliament ahead of him, and the wanted men slipped away by boat shortly before Charles entered the House of Commons with an armed guard on 4 January. Having displaced the Speaker, William Lenthall, from his chair, the king asked him where the MPs had fled. Lenthall, on his knees, famously replied, [...] "May it please your Majesty, I have neither <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here." [...] Charles abjectly declared [...] "all my birds have flown", and was forced to retire, empty-handed.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{new laws}} were typical of {{censorship}} laws in many {{other countries in the}} 1920s and 1930s, they were implemented with an eagerness which gradually alienated and embittered many Irish writers. It caused some writers to leave the country. The author Mervyn Wall explains that during the 1930s there was 'a general intolerant attitude to writing, painting and sculpture. These were thought dangerous, likely to corrupt faith and morals...One encountered frequently among ordinary people bitter hostility to writers...Obscurantism had settled on the country like a fog, so of course anyone who had <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> and the heart to feel, was rebellious.' The Academy of Letters established by William Butler Yeats attempted to fight censorship with solidarity among writers, but it achieved little in this field. The fight against literary censorship was fought mainly by isolated figures. Seán Ó Faoláin, perhaps the most vociferous critic of the censorship laws, wrote: 'Our Censorship...tries to keep the mind in a state of perpetual adolescence {{in the midst of all}} the influences that must, in spite of it, pour in from the adult world.' ...|$|E

2500|$|By tradition, the British Sovereign {{does not}} enter the Chamber of the House of Commons. The last monarch to do so was King CharlesI, in 1642. The King sought to arrest five Members of Parliament on charges of high treason, but when he asked the Speaker, William Lenthall, {{if he had any}} {{knowledge}} of the whereabouts of these individuals, Lenthall famously replied: [...] "May it please your Majesty, I have neither <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here." [...] Since then, in the State Opening of Parliament, when Black Rod representing the monarch approaches the doors to the chamber of the House of Commons to make the summons, they are pointedly slammed in his or her face. Black Rod has to strike the door three times with a staff, to be admitted and issue the summons from the monarch to the MPs to attend. When repairs after the World War II bombing were completed, the rebuilt chamber was opened by King George VI on 26 October 1950 who was invited to an [...] "unofficial" [...] tour of the new structure by Commons leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Kocher {{notes that}} Tolkien's {{literary}} techniques {{require us to}} increasingly view hobbits as like us, especially when placed under moral pressure to survive a war that threatens to devastate their land. Frodo becomes {{in some ways the}} symbolic representation of the conscience of hobbits, a point made explicitly in the story [...] "Leaf by Niggle" [...] which Tolkien wrote {{at the same time as}} the first nine chapters of The Lord of the Rings. Niggle is a painter struggling against the summons of death to complete his one great canvas, a picture of a tree with a background of forest and distant mountains. He dies with the work incomplete, undone by his imperfectly generous heart: [...] "it made him uncomfortable more often than it made him do anything". After discipline in Purgatory, however, Niggle finds himself in the very landscape depicted by his painting which he is now able to finish with the assistance of a neighbour who obstructed him during life. The picture complete, Niggle is free to journey to the distant mountains which represent the highest stage of his spiritual development. Thus, upon recovery from the wound inflicted by Angmar on Weathertop, Gandalf speculates that the hobbit Frodo [...] "may become like a glass filled with a clear light for <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that can". Similarly, as Frodo nears Mount Doom he casts aside weapons and refuses to fight others with physical force: [...] "For him struggles for the right must hereafter be waged only on the moral plane." ...|$|E
