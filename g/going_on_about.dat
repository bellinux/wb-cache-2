5|$|Debate {{has been}} <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> whether the tail spikes {{were used for}} display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was {{likely to have been}} much more {{flexible}} than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of Stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an Allosaurus into which a tail spike fits perfectly.|$|E

25|$|Like other ecclesiastical {{lawyers and}} civil {{servants}} {{of the day}} Chichele was paid with ecclesiastical preferments. On 13 April 1396, he obtained ratification of the parsonage of St Stephen's, Walbrook, presented on 30 March by the abbot of Colchester, no doubt through his brother Robert, who restored the church and increased its endowment. In 1397 he was made archdeacon of Dorset by Richard Mitford, bishop of Salisbury, but litigation was still <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> it in the papal court until 27 June 1399, when the pope extinguished the suit, imposing perpetual silence on Nicholas Bubwith, master of the rolls, his opponent. In {{the first year of}} Henry IV Chicheley was parson of Sherston, Wiltshire, and prebendary of Nantgwyly in the college of Abergwilly, Wales; on 23 February 1401/2, now called doctor of laws, he was pardoned for bringing in, and allowed to use, a bull of the pope providing to him the chancellorship of Salisbury Cathedral, and canonries in the nuns' churches of Shaftesbury and Wilton in that diocese; and on 9 January 1402/3 he was archdeacon of Salisbury.|$|E

500|$|During the Iraq War Jackson {{admitted}} {{that the war was}} putting the service under strain, but called the claim that the Army was [...] "at breaking point", [...] "nonsense". Jackson was dismissive of claims that the Army was under-equipped, recalling his conversation with a soldier: [...] "There's a bit of a fuss <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> boots and bog rolls and whatnot. Are you all right for boots?" [...] He later conceded that this could be seen as [...] "cavalier", and that he [...] "had no intention of belittling the gravity of the situation", but that he [...] "didn't want {{to send a message to}} the enemy that we were in any way not ready". Known for speaking his mind, Jackson attracted media attention towards the end of his tenure as CGS in 2006, when he criticised Norman Kember for Kember's apparent lack of gratitude to the soldiers who freed him from Iraqi kidnappers.|$|E

Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: [...] "There was something about him– he was incredibly enigmatic and he would walk into a room with real presence and you'd go, [...] "My God". It {{had nothing to do with}} those bloody eyes that everyone's <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> all the time." [...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E

2500|$|He {{was writing}} about the inner being {{in all of these}} books and his goal was to get the single {{individual}} away from all the speculation that was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>about</b> God and Christ. Speculation creates quantities of ways to find God and his Goods but finding faith in Christ and putting the understanding to use stops all speculation because then one begins to actually exist as a Christian or in an ethical/religious way. He was against an individual waiting until certain of God's love and salvation before beginning to try to become a Christian. He defined this as a [...] "special type of religious conflict the Germans call Anfechtung" [...] (contesting or disputing). In Kierkegaard's view the Church should not try to prove Christianity or even defend it. It should help the single individual to make a leap of faith, the faith that God is love and has a task for that very same single individual. He wrote the following about fear and trembling and love as early as 1839, [...] "Fear and trembling is not the primus motor in the Christian life, for it is love; but it is what the oscillating balance wheel is to the clock-it is the oscillating balance wheel of the Christian life.|$|E

I thought 'Thank you, I'll take that'!" [...] "Revolution from me bed" [...] most likely refers to Lennon's notorious bed-ins in 1969. The piano in {{the introduction of the}} song strongly resembles Lennon's [...] "Imagine", as well as [...] "Watching the Wheels". As Oasis are often criticised for borrowing parts of other artists' songs for their own, Noel Gallagher commented on the intro's similarity to [...] "Imagine" [...] saying, [...] "In the case of Don't Look Back in Anger – I mean, the opening piano riff's Imagine. 50% of it's put in there to wind people up, and the other 50% is saying 'look, this is how songs like Don't Look Back in Anger come about – because they're inspired by songs like Imagine'. And no matter what people might think, there will be some 13 year old kid out there who'll read an interview and think 'Imagine? I've never heard that song' and he might go and buy the album, you know what I mean?"
