50|$|Metal Foil Deep Etching is a {{plastograph}} {{print in}} which aluminium foil {{is used to}} draw the engraved images. The thin foil is cut and placed on an engraved plate and then the embossed sheet is removed, turned over and filled with resin to stabilise the relief. The resin filled foil is then laminated on plywood or no any other surface. Onobrakpeya first started experimenting with foils and from the experiments transformed the <b>foils</b> into a <b>print</b> medium in the 1980s. He used already printed plates to try out the technique. Metal <b>Foil</b> Relief <b>Print</b> is a three-dimensional metal <b>foil</b> <b>print</b> drawn on a plastocast plate. A fairly thick foil is cut and placed over a plate and hand pressed to transfer {{the shape of the}} picture on the plate. The foil is then removed and filled from behind. It is then laminated onto a plywood and coloured {{in the same way as}} the metal <b>foil</b> deep etching <b>print</b> process already discussed above. Note that while the metal <b>foil</b> deep etching <b>print</b> is drawn from plastograph plates, the metal <b>foil</b> relief <b>print</b> is hand embossed on a plastograph plate.|$|R
