50|$|A {{progressive}} miller, John Sidney imported three {{barrels of}} Red Fife wheat from Canada; the Archibalds developed the seed into the No. 1 hard spring wheat that revolutionized farming in Minnesota. Before 1860, the wheat {{grown in the}} United States was soft winter wheat, but spring wheat was better suited to the soil. What initially prevented spring wheat from wide adoption was its characteristic flinty quality and high middlings content. Under the low grinding process used before 1870, the wheat's hardness caused the mash to heat and its thin brittle bran filled the flour with specks that discolored the flour. To fix this issue, millstones in their mills were run at a lower speed and were set higher so as to simply crack the kernel at the first grinding. It was then put through several grindings. The purpose was to make middlings the most valuable part of the product, as gluten {{was found in the}} middlings and provided nutrition and gave bread its rising quality. The Archibalds' mills would later be among the first to adopt the middlings purifier, developed in Minneapolis, which allowed for large scale production of the higher <b>gluten</b> <b>flour.</b>|$|E

Biopsy of the small intestine and blood tests are essential diagnostics. Duhring's disease, which manifests itself on the skin {{is a form of}} celiac sprue. For allergy to gluten is also a disease caused by gluten, but in comparison with celiac disease responds immediately from its ingestion. Treatment can only be adherence to a gluten-free diet. From the beginning the need to avoid all products containing wheat, barley and rye. Legumes, naturally gluten-free cereals, meat, fruit and vegetables are among the most suitable raw materials in the gluten-free diet. Gluten cereals (wheat, barley, rye) are important in many ways. It belongs to the main source of fiber, B vitamins, minerals, energy, phytochemicals. Not to be used only for the human diet, but especially as feed grain. In contrast, naturally gluten-free grains include current demand due to the very popular. The main significance lies in the diet for celiac and allergic to gluten.

The rheological and fracture properties of gluten-water doughs were determined in uniaxial and biaxial extension at large deformations and small angle sinusoidal oscillation tests and {{compared with the}} mechanical properties of the parental flour doughs. At 25 °C the linear region {{was in the same}} range as that of flour dough, while at a higher temperature (45 °C) the linear region was more than an order of magnitude higher. At 45 °C the storage modulus and tan were lower than at 25 °C. Variation in moduli between cultivars was much more pronounced for <b>gluten</b> than for <b>flour</b> doughs. Similarly to flour dough in both uniaxial and biaxial extension the stress () increased more than proportionally with the strain, a phenomenon called strain hardening. The stress at a set strain and strain hardening depended much more strongly on the type of deformation for <b>gluten</b> than for <b>flour</b> dough: was higher in biaxial extension for <b>gluten</b> than for <b>flour</b> dough, but was much higher in uniaxial extension. This indicates that orientational effects in elongational flow are of even larger importance for the mechanical properties of <b>gluten</b> than of <b>flour</b> dough. It is likely that it is the glutenin fraction that, because of its large size, confers these direction dependent properties to <b>gluten</b> and <b>flour</b> doughs. Fracture stresses were much higher for <b>gluten</b> than for <b>flour</b> dough, while fracture strains were in the same range or higher. For gluten dough fracture strains increased less strongly with increasing strain rate than for <b>flour</b> dough. <b>Glutens</b> exhibiting a higher stress at a certain strain had a smaller fracture strain.

40|$|Cereals contain {{naturally}} occurring biopolymers (for example proteins and starches) {{that can be}} used as renewable raw materials in a variety of speciality chemical applications. The separation of protein and starch biopolymers from wheat is well established and relies on a group of proteins called glutens that have a unique network-forming functionality. Oat and other cereals do not naturally contain these gluten proteins and typically rely on chemical-based separation techniques which alter the chemical and physical structures and damage the inherent natural functionality of the biopolymers. This research study investigated the separation of the protein and starch fractions from cereals using the Al-Hakkak Process, a new aqueous process. This process involves adding water and wheat gluten protein to cereals that do not contain gluten. The wheat gluten interacts with the cereal proteins, facilitating the separation of the starch and protein fractions whilst retaining their inherent natural functionality. The aim of this research project was to investigate and optimise the pilot scale separation performance of the Al-Hakkak Process using oat flour. As very little prior research had been carried out, the focus was to characterise the oat starch and protein separation performance and gain an understanding of the mechanisms involved. A variety of techniques were employed. Large scale deformation rheology was used to gain an understanding of the oat-gluten dough rheology and establish the relationship between the rheology and the separation performance. Confocal scanning laser microscopy was used to investigate the structure of the oat-gluten protein network. The molecular interactions between the oat and gluten proteins were studied using gel electrophoresis. The network-forming functionality of the new oat-gluten protein was explored. The influence of various processing parameters on the pilot scale separation performance was investigated and the results compared with other data collected through the study to identify key processing parameters. This research programme has resulted in interesting, encouraging and some unexpected outcomes and these are discussed in detail in the thesis. It was concluded that an insoluble protein network formed in the oat-gluten dough and both kneading and extraction processes were found to contribute to the formation of this. A key conclusion was that the changes {{that took place in the}} oat-gluten dough were similar to, but not identical to, the changes that occur in wheat dough. It was proposed that the mechanism for the development of a protein network in oat-gluten dough differed from wheat dough for two main reasons: a) the presence of the oat flour disrupted the normal wheat gluten behaviour, and b) components in the oat flour altered the activity of the gluten proteins. The research identified key processing parameters for the Al-Hakkak Process including kneading time, gluten content, and sodium chloride content of the oat-gluten dough as well as sodium chloride concentration, pH, and temperature of the extract liquor. An important discovery was that the oat and gluten proteins interacted at a molecular level through reducible, covalent, bonding (most likely disulphide linkages) to form the insoluble protein network in the oat-gluten dough. It was concluded that these reducible bonds coupled the individual protein subunits to form new hybrid oat-gluten protein molecules (a combination of oat proteins and gluten proteins). Both insoluble and soluble proteins in the oat and <b>gluten</b> <b>flour</b> were involved in the formation of the insoluble protein network in the oat-gluten dough. This outcome has applications beyond the Al-Hakkak Process, as this new knowledge can be applied to the wider dough processing industry. It was concluded that the wheat gluten was the source of the protein network-forming functionality of the hybrid oat-gluten protein and that the oat proteins had a diluting effect. It was proposed that oat-gluten protein flour from the Al-Hakkak Process could be reused to replace the commercial wheat <b>gluten</b> <b>flour</b> in subsequent production batches. During spray drying of the starch stream, the soluble biopolymers in the extract liquor were found to act as an adhesive and glued individual starch granules together to form spherical agglomerates. Acidification of the extract liquor was found to enhance this agglomeration. It was proposed the acidified starch granules were sticker during spray drying due to the partial acid hydrolysis of the starch granule suface which enhanced the agglomeration...|$|E

Analyses of grain hectoliter mass and ash content, as well as <b>flour</b> <b>gluten</b> content, <b>flour</b> color, alveography and farinography were performed at 0, 60, 120 and 180 days of storage. The experiment was carried out in a totally randomized design. The grain ash content and intensity of color component L* of wheat flour increase proportionally to the application of increasing doses of diatomaceous earth and longer storage periods. The grain hectoliter mass and values of +b* chromaticity coordinate, wet gluten content and gluten content in wheat flour diminish with the application of increasing doses of diatomaceous earth and longer storage periods. The gluten strength and dough stability of flour obtained from wheat grains without addition of diatomaceous earth increase with the storage period; this behavior was not observed in treatments with the application of 2. 0 and 4. 0 g kg- 1 diatomaceous earth. The application of increasing doses of diatomaceous earth changes the physical and chemical characteristics of wheat grains stored, with consequent reduction of the flour technological quality...|$|R
50|$|Gliadin (a type of prolamin) is a {{class of}} {{proteins}} present in wheat and several other cereals within the grass genus Triticum. Gliadins, which are a component of gluten, are essential for giving bread the ability to rise properly during baking. Gliadins and glutenins are the two main components of the gluten fraction of the wheat seed. This gluten is found in products such as wheat <b>flour.</b> <b>Gluten</b> is split about evenly between the gliadins and glutenins, although there are variations found in different sources.|$|R
