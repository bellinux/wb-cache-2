The Spitting <b>Image</b> <b>version,</b> [...] "Da Do Run Ron," [...] was a spoof election campaign song for Ronald Reagan, featuring Nancy Reagan listing reasons why he should be re-elected. The cover featured the puppet versions of the Reagans that appeared on the show and later starred in the 1986 video for [...] "Land of Confusion" [...] by British band Genesis. Chris Barrie, who voiced Reagan on Spitting Image, also did so on Frankie Goes to Hollywood's [...] "Two Tribes". The song follows Reagan's career to an imagined future in which Jesus Christ can only return after a nuclear apocalypse, and Barrie, as Reagan, quotes Don Mclean's [...] "American Pie" [...] and parts of an Adolf Hitler speech.|$|E

5000|$|Originally the Kuwahara filter was {{proposed}} {{for use in}} processing RI-angiocardiographic images of the cardiovascular system. The fact that any edges are preserved when smoothing makes it especially useful for feature extraction and segmentation and explains why it is used in medical imaging. [...] The Kuwahara filter however also finds many applications in artistic imaging and fine-art photography due to its ability to remove textures and sharpen the edges of photographs. The level of abstraction helps create a desirable painting-like effect in artistic photographs {{especially in the case}} of the colored <b>image</b> <b>version</b> of the filter. These applications have known great success and have encouraged similar research in the field of image processing for the arts.|$|E

50|$|Only a few {{significant}} {{changes were made}} to the original Kine Exakta (version 1) during its production run until it was replaced by the model II in 1948: Within a few months the circular focusing loupe, visible on top of the collapsed finder hood, was substituted for a rectangular one covering about 50% of the ground glass <b>image</b> (<b>version</b> 2). This version also appeared on the North American market as Exacta, spelled with a c (version 3). About a year later, a threaded hole was added at the right-hand front above the flashbulb synchronising contacts for securing the flashgun to the camera (version 4). After the 1939 to 1945 hostilities production of the Exacta version slowly resumed, but with several minor changes to the camera body, among these are: The Ihagee logo no longer appear in relief on the rectangular back door leather patch. The carrying strap eyelets {{on either side of the}} top edge of the camera are inserted between two small protrusions and riveted in place. The right-hand shutter dial is milled without a groove along the middle of the edge.|$|E
50|$|From the 1950s, {{the claim}} {{that there was a}} single {{continuing}} German Reich, and that in some sense the Federal Republic and the Federal Republic alone could represent that Reich, was adopted both by the Federal Government itself and by the Federal Constitutional Court. Initially, the 1949 constitution of the German Democratic Republic adopted a mirror <b>image</b> <b>version</b> of this claim; in being framed in anticipation of a future all-German constitution on its own political terms; but all references to a wider national German nation were removed in constitutional amendments in 1968 and 1974, and from that date the GDR maintained that from 1949 there had existed two entirely separate sovereign German states. The Federal Republic's Cold-war Allies supported its claims in part, as they acknowledged the Federal Republic as the sole legitimate democratically organised state within former German territory (the GDR being held to be a Soviet puppet state); but they did not accept the associated arguments for the Reich's continuing 'metaphysical' existence de jure within the organs of the Federal Republic alone. Subsequently, under the Ostpolitik, the Federal Republic in the early 1970s sought to end hostile relations with the countries of the Eastern Bloc, in the course of which it negotiated in 1972 a Basic Treaty with the GDR, recognising it as one of two German states within one German nation, and relinquishing any claim to de jure sovereign jurisdiction over East Germany. The Treaty was challenged in the Federal Constitutional court, as apparently contradicting the overriding aspirations of the Basic Law for a unified German state; but the Treaty's legality was upheld by the Court, heavily qualified by a reassertion of {{the claim that}} the German Reich continued to exist as an 'overall state' such that the duty to strive for future German unity could not be abandoned while East and West Germany remained disunited, albeit that without any institutional organs of itself the 'overall' Reich was currently not capable of action.|$|E
