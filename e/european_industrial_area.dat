40|$|Abstract. Aerosol optical depths (AOD) and Angström {{coefficients}} over Europe were retrieved {{using data}} from the ATSR- 2 radiometer on board the ESA satellite ERS- 2, for August 1997. Taking advantage of the nadir and forward view of the ATSR- 2, the dual view algorithm was used over land to eliminate the influence of the surface reflection. Over sea the AOD was retrieved using only the forward observations. Retrieved aerosol optical properties are in good agreement with those from ground-based sunphotometers. The AOD and Angström coefficients together yield information on the column integrated effective aerosol distribution. Observed regional variations of the AOD and Angström coefficient are related to anthropogenic emissions of aerosol precursors such as SO 2 and NOx in the major <b>European</b> <b>industrial</b> and urban <b>areas,</b> and their subsequent transformation into the aerosol phase. The influence of anthropogenic aerosols such as ammonium sulphate and ammonium nitrate on the total AOD is estimated using a regional chemistry transport model. Sulphate is estimated to contribute from 15 % in very clean areas to 70 % in polluted areas, the contribution of nitrate is between 5 % and 25 % over most of Europe. This paper shows the great importance of nitrate in summer over The Netherlands. ...|$|R

The successful case, Shanghai EXPO Urban Best Practices Area is chosen {{to find out how to}} seek for the balance between preservation and reconstruction into humanized public areas. Then the article establishes a relatively complete framework for planning and design, and demonstrates the framework through the design proposal of Shanghai Yangpu Auxiliary Equipment factory. This research serves as a practical model for preservation and reconstruction from old <b>industrial</b> <b>area</b> to the humanized public space. In addition, it also discussed and rethinks deeply over the problems of reusing old <b>industrial</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
