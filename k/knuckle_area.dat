In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak, and these would later result in further fighting. Perhaps in retailiation, Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions along the border, firing 13 rounds, while a further 25 rounds were fired at 11:00am. There were no casualties.|$|R
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the previous successful Australian ambushes along the Sungei Koemba river in May and June, the Indonesians planned to increase their activity with H BTP and J BTP moving against the Gumbang, Tringgus and Bukit <b>Knuckle</b> <b>areas,</b> while additional forces from BTP 2 were also subsequently redeployed against Serian. In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak, and these would later result in further fighting. One such patrol by 2 Platoon, A Company ascertained that the Indonesians had recently increased their use of an east-west track crossing the border south-west of the company base at Stass and consequently the Australians decided to conduct a further Claret operation in order {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity provided.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of action-oriented games, {{there may be some}} areas in the game that are only {{reachable}} using a character with certain abilities. For example, see the Sega game Sonic & Knuckles. The character <b>Knuckles</b> can explore <b>areas</b> in Sonic the Hedgehog 2 that the previous characters couldn't.|$|R
40|$|A {{program for}} the {{representation}} of ship-hull geometry by means of B-spline curves and surfaces has been developed. Lines on the hull surface running {{along the length of}} the ship and sections with transverse planes are interpolated by B-splines. The vectors tangent to longitudinal ship lines on their intersections with transverse sections are also interpolated by B-splines. B-spline surface patches are generated between consecutive transverse sections. Tangent-vector continuity is preserved across the patches. Bias functions applied to tangent vectors enhance design flexibility. Special features, such as <b>knuckles</b> and plane <b>areas,</b> are easily incorporated. Interaction with the program is accomplished through a suitable user interface. © 1992...|$|R
40|$|Austroeupatorium inulifolium {{has become}} a ferocious invader {{over the years in}} many {{ecosystems}} in the wet zone of Sri Lanka, including the grasslands of the <b>Knuckles</b> Conservation <b>Area</b> (KCA). Two field studies were conducted to assess the impacts of Austroeupatorium invasion on the diversity and composition of the plant communities. In the first study, three habitat categories were identified: less-invaded grassland (LIG), highly-invaded grassland (HIG) and the forest-grassland edge (FGE) adjacent to HIG. In the second study, two transects were selected that run across the FGE bordered by less or highly invaded grasslands (FGE-LIG and FGE-HIG). At each community, 5 linear quadrats (12 m x 3 m) were laid parallel to the FGE at different distances away from the edge to the forest interior and the open grassland. Each quadrat was further sub-divided into 3 quadrats. Three such transects were studied for each community. In both studies, the vegetation less than 2 m in height was enumerated. The stem density and abundance of Austroeupatorium were significantly higher in HIG and FGE compared to LIG. However, the plant community at FGE was less diverse than that of HIG and LIG. Tree saplings were observed only in the HIG, suggesting its favourable conditions for their establishment. The abundance of Austroeupatorium was markedly reduced towards the forest interior, suggesting that the FGE acts as a barrier against invasion towards the forest. Th...|$|R
2500|$|The {{rheumatoid}} nodule, {{which is}} {{sometimes in the}} skin, {{is the most common}} non-joint feature and occurs in 30% of people who have RA. It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a [...] "necrotizing granuloma". The initial pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the synovitis, since similar structural features occur in both. The nodule has a central area of fibrinoid necrosis that may be fissured and which corresponds to the fibrin-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space. Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading macrophages and fibroblasts, corresponding to the intimal layer in synovium and a cuff of connective tissue containing clusters of lymphocytes and plasma cells, corresponding to the subintimal zone in synovitis. The typical rheumatoid nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences, such as the elbow, the heel, the <b>knuckles,</b> or other <b>areas</b> that sustain repeated mechanical stress. Nodules are associated with a positive RF (rheumatoid factor) titer, ACPA, and severe erosive arthritis. Rarely, these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body.|$|R
40|$|The {{tension between}} {{conservation}} objectives and local people’s need for visible livelihoods {{is complex and}} often difficult to resolve.   In 2000, the <b>Knuckles</b> Conservation <b>Area</b> was established to include a protected area and a buffer zone {{to be used for}} management and restoration.   Prior to this decree, small tracts of land in the buffer zone were used for vegetable cultivation by villagers to supplement production from their titled agricultural plots.   An ethnographic approach was used in seven villages to explore how households have adapted their livelihoods in response to the change in land, and to examine the factors that may help understand the differences in the livelihood activities chosen.   The fundamental needs of the local people in their use of natural resources were not addressed when cultivation in the buffer zones was banned in 1990, creating shortfalls in production for some households, but stimulating others to diversify and invest in higher value crops in their own plots.   Physical, financial, human, and natural assets other than land were important to households as they responded to and coped with change.   Long-term livelihood strategies are dependent on more than just access to assets; the variability of farm and non-farm livelihood activities observed between households is explained by social and cultural factors.   Power relations within the community, personal characteristics of actors such as motivation and risk taking, and local laws and modes of governance all influence, to varying degrees and in complex and multiple ways, how households transform and utilise their assets.   The ability to transform assets is also dependent on the dynamics of the household: age and gender, status, social standing, and caste.   When conservation initiatives are implemented, programmes need to cater for variability among households in terms of their capacity to adapt to reductions in access to land, and in terms of their aspirations for diversifying their livelihood.

2500|$|Sonic Adventure is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} the player controls six different characters: the titular Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big, and E-102 Gamma. They must stop Doctor Eggman from stealing the seven Chaos Emeralds and feeding them to Chaos, a monster known as [...] "the God of Destruction", and defeat them both. The first main game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series to feature free-roaming 3D gameplay, Sonic Adventure features two game modes: Adventure and Trial. There are different goals for each character in the game: Sonic involves high-speed gameplay, while Tails must {{reach the end of}} the level before Sonic does, and <b>Knuckles</b> searches the <b>area</b> for shards of the Master Emerald. The three characters retain many of their trademark moves from previous Sonic games, such as Tails being able to fly for short periods of time, and Knuckles being able to glide through the air, though they can use updated techniques as well. The rest of the playable cast is rounded out by Amy, who must use her hammer to escape from Eggman's E-100 Zero robot chasing after her, Gamma, who must use its laser beam to shoot through levels to reach a target, and Big, who fishes in efforts to find his friend, Froggy. [...] The player is given five lives, which are lost when any character is hit by an enemy or obstacle with no rings in their possession, falls into a bottomless pit, or drowns. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, with more lives earned by finding extra life items.|$|R
