50|$|The annual Festival of Lights {{takes place}} at Riverside Park and is {{entitled}} Sparkles in The Park. The event typically takes place beginning {{in the middle of}} December and {{is open to the public}} nightly from 5:30 PM. Sparkles in the Park begins with an opening celebration that includes a visit from Santa Claus and culminates with a large fireworks display on New Year's Eve that always draws a crowd. The Rotary Club of Guelph puts on the event as support to their numerous charities. There is a vast Christmas light <b>display</b> <b>set-up</b> throughout the park for the visitors to view and enjoy.|$|E

40|$|An {{exogenous}} {{electromagnetic field}} {{can be thought}} of as inducing a perturbation on membrane potential, thus acting as an input of neuronal encoding process. To investigate possible field-induced effects over neuronal response, a double compartment model is <b>set-up,</b> <b>displaying</b> a variety of firing and bursting patterns related to the coupling between fast and slow dynamics ionic channels. Channel noise, which has been shown to play a significant role in neuronal processing, is accurately modeled in both fast and slow compartments, thus resulting in a good qualitative agreement with experimental data in both temporal responses and in firing and bursting statistics. In such conditions, the effects of a field-induced electromagnetic perturbation are studied on neuronal output patterns and statistical feature...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report {{the first example}} of hybrid {{materials}} based on poly(methlymethacrylate) (PMMA) matrices covalently reinforced by MyOx(OH) w(O(O) CR) z oxoclusters (M = Zr or Hf), used as heterogeneous catalytic systems for hydrogen peroxide activation. The resulting hybrids were used to catalyze the oxidation of dibenzothiophene (DBT) to the corresponding sulfoxide (DBTO) and sulfone (DBTO 2), in order to demonstrate their potential application for the oxydesulfurization (ODS) of a fuel. Thanks to catalyst confinement and to the higher affinity of the polymeric matrix towards polar substrates, the heterogeneous <b>set-up</b> <b>displays</b> improved performances {{with respect to the}} corresponding homogeneous systems. At 65 Â°C, a DBT conversion higher than 84 % was obtained in 24 h, with a > 94 % selectivity for DBTO 2. The stability of the hybrid materials under catalytic conditions was successfully assessed by a combined spectroscopic approach, based on FT-IR, resonance Raman, Solid State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, X-ray Absorption and Small Angle X-ray scattering measurements...|$|R
