5|$|After {{a time of}} {{not seeing}} Tigerstar, Sasha returns to her den one evening, only to find Tigerstar already waiting for her. Asking him where he was, he {{comments}} on <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> her den was, and then stops and asks when she will be seeing her humans again, after seeing her collar hanging around a protruding branch on the logs. Sasha asks him why he was snooping around in her den, and he tells her that he cannot see her any more if she has the collar. She refuses to destroy it, and quarrels with Tigerstar about housecats {{and how they are}} not independent. Sad, she reminisces about her perfect life with Jean and Ken.|$|E
25|$|I {{have often}} {{sat back and}} thought just <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> {{it would be if}} you could relive your life based on the {{experience}} gained. For myself, I would never again try to achieve the impossible by trying to change things. On the two occasions I have tried to do this , I have failed, not because I lack followers, or because of the opposition of opposing bodies, but because of the activities of anarchists and those who are envious of your success and popularity.|$|E
25|$|Even with {{cooperation}} of the human element of the equation, reconciliation ecology can not help every species. Some animals, such as several species of waterfowl, show strong avoidance behaviors toward humans and any form of human disturbance. No matter <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> an urban park is built, the proximity of humans will scare away some birds. Other species must maintain large territories, and barriers that abound in human habitats, such as roads, will stop them from coexisting with humans. These animals will require undisturbed land set aside for them.|$|E

25|$|The Web of Caves, {{which is}} in black and white, sees Walliams and Putner as aliens (somewhat similar in {{appearance}} to Movellans) trying to persuade the Doctor (Gatiss) to defeat their schemes. The Walliams alien appears alone at first and outlines his scheme to hollow out {{the core of the}} Earth {{and replace it with a}} motor; the Doctor dismisses this plan, in a rather bored fashion, as having been done, and the alien suggests he will come back the next day with a new plan. The next day he returns, accompanied by the Putner alien, and proposes to drain the world's oceans into its core thus boiling them away; again the Doctor points out that it has been done, but decides he has to stop them. The two aliens and the Doctor agree on a time for their battle and the Doctor leaves in the TARDIS, only to have it rematerialise in the same spot, leaving the Doctor visibly annoyed. He disappears back into the TARDIS, only to have the Walliams alien obliviously comment on <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> the Doctor is.|$|E
500|$|Her {{frequent}} European {{tours in}} the 1990s maintained her visibility {{in the eyes}} of the fans and granted her enough income to survive the bleak period. She became so popular in Spain that she was voted for 13 times Best International Singer by the readers of the music magazine Heavy Rock in their annual polls. She often declared to live and tour for the fans and said that she [...] "would never cancel a tour and everybody knows that about me". Lemmy, in a 2003 interview, testified <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> and professional Doro is.|$|E
500|$|The 1991film My Own Private Idaho {{ironically}} {{ends with}} the parting phrase [...] "have a nice day", which {{for the fourth time}} invokes the smiley face. Smiley faces represent optimism and appear to ask the characters, who are characterized as [...] "marginal figures", <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> their days are. While traveling to Idaho, the protagonists' motorcycle breaks down, and one of the characters, Mike, gazes at the sun on the horizon and links it with the motto [...] "have a nice day". He says, [...] "I've been on this road before. Looks like a fucked-up face. Like it's saying 'have a nice day' or something." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Never Learn Not to Love" [...] was {{released}} as the B-side to [...] "Bluebirds over the Mountain" [...] on December 2, 1968. The A-side reached number 61 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was later {{featured on the}} Beach Boys' album 20/20 on February 10, 1969. When Manson discovered he was uncredited on the single, he was furious and threatened Dennis Wilson with murder. Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks recalled [...] "One day, Charles Manson brought a bullet out {{and showed it to}} Dennis, who asked, 'What's this?' And Manson replied, 'It's a bullet. Every time you look at it, I want you to think <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> it is your kids are still safe'". Wilson confronted Manson about the incident, realizing Manson's growing erratic behavior, and ended their friendship soon after.|$|E
500|$|Following {{its home}} video release, [...] "I'm with Cupid" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Elton John's performance {{as one of}} the thirty-three funniest cameos {{in the history of the}} show. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode is [...] "funny" [...] because [...] "it has a plot we recognize from our own lives," [...] and Jake McNeill of Digital Entertainment News considered it to be one of the season's best episodes. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide gave the episode a positive review as well, calling it [...] "Very, very clever and funny," [...] and wrote [...] "it's executed stylishly and Homer wins in the end; entirely by default of course, but maybe that's his reward for not falling off the skywriting plane until the last minute!" [...] However, they also criticized the episode for being [...] "a little tacky," [...] writing [...] "After all, <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> are these people who want to ruin Apu and Manjula's day just because they're scared of looking bad?" ...|$|E
500|$|Swift was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, [...] "How beautiful she was, <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> and smart and perfect she was. And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm so happy for you.'" [...] Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.|$|E

500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "Itâ€™s a tight fit. The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and wonâ€™t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E
500|$|When Thom and Dev stop at Gray's Papaya for hot dogs, a {{confused}} Caroline escapes from Thom's van. Nick and Norah {{meet up with}} Thom and Dev {{to try to find}} her. A confusing phone call leads them to look for her at a club that [...] "Where's Fluffy?" [...] is rumored to be playing, but with no success. Tris, eager to win back Nick, catches up with them when she gets a phone call from Caroline, who is now able to tell Norah that she has [...] "found Jesus" [...] and [...] "an altar boy without pants." [...] They find a drunk Caroline on stage at a gay cabaret dressed as a Christmas tree. When they arrive at Nick's car, Tris is sitting on the hood waiting for him. Norah tells him <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> it was to meet him, but he leaves to talk with Tris without giving Norah a response. An upset Norah meets up at a club with her , Tal (Jay Baruchel), but soon realizes that he has an ulterior motive and hopes to get a deal for his band with Norah's father, a record producer (...) [...] She agrees to pay for Tal and his friends' drinks, but she tells the waitress to increase the tab because there was a miscalculation, and she leaves him to pay. Nick, meanwhile, decides to confront Tris, but she tells him she wants to be together again and asks for a ride home. Tris asks Nick to stop by the river, where she tries to seduce him. Whilst she seductively dances in front of the car, Nick reminisces fondly about Norah and the night's events and drives away, leaving Tris behind.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} after Salk's discovery, many supporters, in {{particular}} the National Foundation, [...] "helped him build his dream of a research complex for the investigation of biological phenomena 'from cell to society'." [...] Called the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, it opened in 1963 in the San Diego neighborhood of La Jolla. Salk believed that the institution would help new and upcoming scientists along in their careers, as he said himself, [...] "I thought <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> {{it would be if}} a place like this existed and I was invited to work there." [...] This was something that Salk was deprived of early in his life, but due to his achievements, was able to provide for future scientists.|$|E

2500|$|Ireland's {{campaign}} in the 200910 ICC Intercontinental Cup, in pursuit of their fourth consecutive title in the competition, began in July 2009. Connell played in their first match, which was against Kenya; opening the bowling, he returned match figures of 2/97. Phil Simmons, Ireland's coach, was dissatisfied with Connell's performance and he was dropped for Ireland's next Intercontinental Cup match, which was against Scotland. Simmons cited [...] "a drop in attitude" [...] for Connell's lack of success and subsequent drop, adding [...] "I need to see that he's back {{to where he was}} at towards the beginning of last year. I want people to realise just <b>how</b> <b>nice</b> it is to be involved with this squad and not take it for granted."
