50|$|During {{the winter}} of 1847-1848 the leather flap valve that sealed the {{traction}} pipe slot began to give trouble. During the cold days of winter the leather froze hard in frost after saturation in rain. This resulted in its failing to seat properly {{after the passage of}} a train, allowing air into the pipe and reducing the effectiveness of pumping. In the following spring and summer there was hot and dry weather and the leather valve dried out, with pretty much the same outcome. Brunel had the leather treated with whale oil in an attempt to maintain flexibility. There was said to be a chemical reaction between the tannin in the leather and iron oxide on the pipe. There were also difficulties with the leather <b>cup</b> <b>seal</b> on the pistons.|$|R

40|$|Background {{and purpose}} Adequate depth of cement {{penetration}} and cement mantle thickness {{is important for}} the durability of cemented cups. A flanged cup, as opposed to unflanged, has been suggested to give a more uniform cement mantle and superior cement pressurization, thus improving the depth of cement penetration. This hypothesis was tested experimentally. Materials and methods The same cup design with and without flange (both without cement spacers) was investigated regarding intraacetabular pressure, cement mantle thickness, and depth of cement penetration. With machine control, the cups were inserted into open-pore ceramic acetabular models (10 flanged, 10 unflanged) and into paired cadaver acetabuli (10 flanged, 10 unflanged) with prior pressurization of the cement. Results No differences in intraacetabular pressures during cup insertion were found, but unflanged cups tended to migrate more towards the acetabular pole. Flanged cups resulted in thicker cement mantles because of less bottoming out, whereas no differences in cement penetration into the bone were observed. Interpretation Flanged cups do not generate higher cementation pressure or better cement penetration than unflanged cups. A possible advantage of the flange, however, may be to protect the cup from bottoming out, and there is possibly better closure of the periphery around the <b>cup,</b> <b>sealing</b> off the cement-bone interface...|$|R
40|$|A sample return {{container}} {{is being}} developed by Honeybee Robotics to receive samples from a derivative of the Champollion/ST 4 Sample Acquisition and Transfer Mechanism or other samplers and then hermetically seal samples for a sample return mission. The container is enclosed in a phase change material (PCM) chamber to prevent phase change during return and re-entry to earth. This container is designed to operate passively with no motors and actuators. Using the sampler's featured drill tip for interfacing, transfer-ring and sealing samples, the container consumes no electrical power and therefore minimizes sample temperature change. The circular container houses a few isolated canisters, which will be sealed individually for samples acquired from different sites or depths. The drill based sampler indexes each canister to the sample transfer position, below the index interface for sample transfer. After sample transfer is completed, the sampler indexes a seal carrier, which lines up seals with the openings of the canisters. The sampler moves to the sealing interface and seals the sample canisters one by one. The sealing interface can be designed to work with C-seals, knife edge <b>seals</b> and <b>cup</b> <b>seals.</b> Again, the sampler provides all sealing actuation. This sample return container and co-engineered sample acquisition system are being developed by Honeybee Robotics {{in collaboration with the}} JPL Exploration Technology program...|$|R
30|$|Plastic {{containers}} of 180  ml capacity were filled by 20  g of sterilized air-dried sand.

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of closed cup testers: non-equilibrial, such as Pensky-Martens, where the vapours above the liquid are not in {{temperature}} equilibrium with the liquid, and equilibrial, such as Small Scale (commonly known as Setaflash), where the vapours are deemed to be in temperature equilibrium with the liquid. In both these types, the <b>cups</b> are <b>sealed</b> with a lid through which the ignition source can be introduced. Closed cup testers normally give lower values for the flash point than open cup (typically [...] lower) and are a better approximation to the temperature at which the vapour pressure reaches the lower flammable limit.|$|R

50|$|Compressed gas {{enters the}} valve of the Phantom, {{pressing}} the <b>cup</b> <b>seal</b> assembly against the retainer with the aide of the valve spring. This gas forces the valve to stay sealed {{and allows the}} gun to be cocked which prepares the hammer of the paintball marker for firing. Without {{the pressure of the}} gas in the valve the gun cannot be cocked. As indicated by the term pump action the first step in firing the marker is the pump stroke which uses the rod connecting the pump handle and bolt to cock the marker. The pump stroke consists of two parts; the backward pump stroke and the forward pump stroke. On the backward pump stroke the bolt moves back, compressing the main spring until the bolt and hammer are connected by the sear. At this time a single ball drops into the breech. Next, during the forward pump stroke, both the bolt and hammer move forward, chambering the paintball sealing the breech. Next, as the trigger is pulled, the sear pivots and releases the hammer from the bolt. The compressed main spring forces the hammer back until it reaches the rear of the power tube and provides enough energy to force the power tube back. As the power tube is pushed back the valve opens and compressed gas flows through the power tube and the tuned port compensator (TPC), projecting the paintball out of the barrel.|$|R

5000|$|When an {{employer}} requests {{a drug test}} from an employee, or a physician requests a drug test from a patient, the employee or patient is typically instructed {{to go to a}} collection site or their home. The urine sample goes through a specified 'chain of custody' to ensure that it is not tampered with or invalidated through lab or employee error. The patient or employee’s urine is collected at a remote location in a specially designed secure <b>cup,</b> <b>sealed</b> with tamper-resistant tape, and sent to a testing laboratory to be screened for drugs (typically the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 5 panel). The first step at the testing site is to split the urine into two [...] One aliquot is first screened for drugs using an analyzer that performs immunoassay as the initial screen. To ensure the specimen integrity and detecting possible adulterant, some other parameters such as, urine creatinine, pH, and specific gravity are tested along in this initial test. If the urine screen is positive then another aliquot of the sample is used to confirm the findings by gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry methodology. If requested by the physician or employer, certain drugs are screened for individually; these are generally drugs part of a chemical class that are, for one of many reasons, considered more abuse-prone or of concern. For instance, oxycodone and diamorphine may be tested, both sedative analgesics. If such a test is not requested specifically, the more general test (in the preceding case, the test for opiates) will detect the drugs, but the employer or physician will not have the benefit of the identity of the drug.|$|R
