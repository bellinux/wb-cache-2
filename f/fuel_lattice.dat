50|$|Maria is a pool type reactor with a {{power of}} 20 to 30 MW (thermal). Despite it being a pool reactor, it {{contains}} channels (aluminum tubes) individually connected to the primary coolant. The water pool provides cooling for elements (e.g., fuel elements) that are not otherwise cooled, and also acts as radiation shielding. Maria uses enriched uranium as fuel (80% enrichment in 235U till year 1999; 36% since). The fuel elements and channels are vertical but arranged conically. Water and beryllium blocks serve as the moderator (70% and 30% of the moderation, respectively). Elements of boron carbide sheathed in aluminum are utilized for control, compensation, and safety. The use of beryllium blocks results in a comparatively large <b>fuel</b> <b>lattice</b> pitch, and consequently large volume for payload targets. There is also a graphite reflector (aluminum sheathed). Maria supplies a neutron flux of 4x1014 n/cm2s (thermal neutrons) and 2x1014 n/cm2s (fast neutrons). There are six horizontal channels for controlled use of neutron beams. There is also a window of lead-containing glass through which the core can be viewed. The reactor is housed in a sealed containment.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} potential of thorium based fuel to minimise Pu and MA production in Pressurised Water Reactors (PWRs). The assessment was carried out by examining destruction rates and residual amounts of Pu and MA in the fuel used for transmutation. In particular, sensitivity of these two parameters to the <b>fuel</b> <b>lattice</b> Hydrogen to Heavy Metal (H/HM) ratio and to the fuel composition was systematically investigated. All burn-up calculations were performed using CASMO 4 – the fuel assembly burn-up code. The results indicate that up to 1 000 kg of reactor grade Pu can potentially be burned in thorium based fuel assemblies per GWeYear. Up to 75 % of initial Pu can be destroyed per path. Addition of MA to the fuel mixture degrades the burning efficiency. The theoretically achievable limit for total TRU destruction per path is 50 %. Efficient MA and Pu destruction in thorium based fuel generally requires a higher degree of neutron moderation and, therefore, higher <b>fuel</b> <b>lattice</b> H/HM ratio than typically used in the current generation of PWRs.

The bubble size dependence may explain the large bubble size distribution found in some uranium carbide and nitride fuels.

All results hold equally for uranium dioxide as well as hydride fuel since the design limits imposed, critical heat flux, maximum flow velocity and pressure drop constrain only pin array geometry and diameter. It is shown that applicable uranium oxide and hydride fuel limits are both met within the constraints imposed by these three limits which were applied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{fine-mesh}} solver aimed at resolving in a coupled manner and at the pin cell level the neutronic and thermal-hydraulic fields. Presently, the tool considers Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) conditions. The methods and implementation strategy are such that the coupled neutronic and thermal-hydraulic problem is formulated in a fully three-dimensional (3 D) and fine mesh manner, and for steady-state situations. The solver is built on finite volume discretization schemes, matrix solvers and capabilities for parallel computing that {{are available in the}} open source C++ library foam-extend- 3. 0. The angular neutron flux is determined with a multigroup discrete ordinates method (SN), solved by a sweeping algorithm. The thermal-hydraulics is based on Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models for the moderator/coolant mass, momentum, and energy equations, together with the fuel pin energy equation. The multiphysics coupling is solved by making use of an iterative algorithm, and convergence is ensured for both the separate equations and the coupled scheme. Since all the equations are implemented in the same software, all fields can be directly accessed in such a manner that external transfer and external mapping are avoided. The parallelization relies on a domain decomposition which is shared between the neutronics and the thermal-hydraulics. The latter allows to exchange the coupled data locally on each CPU, thus minimizing the data transfer. The code is tested on a quarter of a 15 × 15 PWR <b>fuel</b> <b>lattice.</b> The results show that convergence is successfully reached, and correct physical behaviors of all fields can be achieved with a reasonable computational effort...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{research}} {{has been carried out}} for the design of an optimal core configuration for a TRISO fueled compact sized PWR core. This is a light water cooled and moderated reactor that employs TRISO fuel particles in zirconium-sheathed fuel rods. The combination of PWR technology and TRISO fuel has been preferred for research to get the benefits of TRISO fuel in terms of enhanced integrity against the release of fission fragments and high negative temperature coefficient of reactivity in well proven PWR technology. This PWR design possesses additional safety features associated with the default design of TRISO fuel particle, which makes its use suitable even in a densely populated area. The designed core can be utilized for heating and desalination purposes or at any remotely located research facility. The current research study has been focused on the core configuration, instead of selecting one of the standard fuel lattices which are mostly being used in nuclear power plants; an inventive <b>fuel</b> <b>lattice</b> has been suggested for the optimal design. The TRISO fuel particle size and fuel pitch have also been optimized to achieve a compact size core. Neutronic transport theory lattice code WIMS-D/ 4 was used for the calculation of group constants (D, Σa and vΣf) and infinite multiplication factor (k ∞). This calculated data were used in diffusion theory code CITATION for the purpose of achieving effective multiplication factor (k eff) and estimated life of the core. The detailed and thorough analyses revealed that core configuration plays a dominant role in determination of compactness and excess reactivity of the core. The amount of excess reactivity has been increased and core size has been condensed by designing an optimal core...|$|E
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{the physics of}} reactor cores that can be operated for 10 to 15 years without refueling — inspired by the objective of enhanced nuclear fuel cycle performance with regard to economics and resistance to weapon proliferation. Proliferation resistance is a primary consideration in this design. The long life operation reduces the routine access to the internals of the reactor vessel, therefore reducing the possibility for clandestine production of nuclear weapons. Additionally, reduction of reactor shutdown time can result in improved safety and economics. As a first step, the most promising <b>fuel</b> <b>lattice</b> characteristics to achieve long life from a physics point of view are studied. These studies also define the design tradeoffs involved in conceptualizing such cores. Moderation effects on UO[subscript 2] fueled lattices are analyzed systematically using state-of-the-art computer codes (CASMO- 4 and MOCUP). The standard 4 -loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR) is taken as our reference core and single unit cell analysis is employed. To change the moderator-to-fuel ratio, which {{is characterized by the}} hydrogen-to-heavy-metal (H/HM) atom number ratio, various methods are adapted including varying water density, fuel density, fuel rod diameter, and fuel rod pitch. Higher burnup potential as well as longer core endurance (burnup times heavy metal mass) would be desirable. For a given initial enrichment, the results show that higher reactivity-limited burnup is achievable by either a more wet lattice or much drier lattice than normal. However, epithermal lattices are distinctly inferior performers. In terms of longer endurance, current PWR lattice parameters are about the optimum. Higher burnup and endurance can be achieved with higher initial enrichment. Characteristics of the spent fuel from high burnup UO[subscript 2] fueled lattices have been examined. The variation of isotopic mix and quantity of plutonium with moderator-to-fuel ratio for UO[subscript 2] fueled lattices has been studied to clarify the impact on its proliferation resistance. And Np production as a function of H/HM has been computed as a measure of long-term radiological hazard for high level waste disposal. It is shown that Np is mildly affected by the H/HM ratio and the current PWR lattice is close to optimum configuration. However, high burnup is significantly beneficial as a way to make the plutonium isotopic mix less attractive as a weapon material. Idaho National Laborator...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{supercritical}} {{temperature and}} pressure light water as the coolant in a direct-cycle nuclear reactor offers potential for considerable plant simplification and consequent capital and O&M cost reduction compared with current light water reactor (LWR) designs. Also, given the thermodynamic {{conditions of the}} coolant at the core outlet (i. e. temperature and pressure beyond the water critical point), very high thermal efficiencies of the power conversion cycle are possible (i. e. up to 46 %). Because no change of phase occurs in the core, the need for steam separators and dryers {{as well as for}} BWR-type recirculation pumps is eliminated, which, for a given reactor power, results in a substantially shorter reactor vessel than the current BWRs. Furthermore, in a direct cycle the steam generators are not needed. If a tight <b>fuel</b> rod <b>lattice</b> is adopted, it is possible to significantly reduce the neutron moderation and attain fast neutron energy spectrum conditions. In this project a supercritical water reactor concept with a simple, blanket-free, pancake-shaped core will be developed. This type of core can make use of either fertile or fertile-free fuel and retain the hard spectrum to effectively burn plutonium and minor actinides from LWR spent fuel while efficiently generating electricity...|$|R
40|$|The current {{neutronics}} {{design methodology}} of CANDU-PHWRs {{based on the}} two-step calculations requires determining not only homogenized two-group constants for ordinary <b>fuel</b> bundle <b>lattice</b> cells by the WIMS-AECL lattice cell code but also incremental two-group constants arising from the penetration of control devices into the fuel bundle cells by a supercell analysis code like MULTICELL or DRAGON. As an alternative way to generate the two-group constants necessary for the CANDU-PHWR core analysis, this paper proposes utilizing a B 1 theory augmented Monte Carlo (MC) few-group constant generation method (B 1 MC method) which has been devised for the PWR fuel assembly analysis method. To examine {{the applicability of the}} B 1 MC method for the CANDU 6 core analysis, the fuel bundle cell and supercell calculations are performed using it to obtain the two-group constants. By showing that the two-group constants from the B 1 MC method agree well with those from WIMS-AECL and that core neutronics calculations for hypothetical CANDU 6 cores by a deterministic diffusion theory code SCAN with B 1 MC method generated two-group constants also agree well with whole core MC analyses, it is concluded that the B 1 MC method is well qualified for both fuel bundle cell and supercell analyses...|$|R
40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe research presented here focuses on spent nuclear fuel assembly inspection using neutron computed tomography. Experimental measurements involving neutron beam transmission through a spent nuclear fuel assembly serve as benchmark measurements for an MCNP simulation model. Comparison of measured results to simulation results shows good agreement. Generation of tomography images from MCNP tally results was accomplished using adapted versions of built in MATLAB algorithms. Multiple fuel assembly models were examined to provide a broad set of conclusions. Tomography images revealing assembly geometric information including the <b>fuel</b> element <b>lattice</b> structure and missing elements can be obtained using high energy neutrons. A projection difference technique was developed which reveals the substitution of unirradiated fuel elements for irradiated fuel elements, using high energy neutrons. More subtle material differences such as altering the burnup of individual elements can be identified with lower energy neutrons provided the scattered neutron contribution to the image is limited. The research results show that neutron computed tomography {{can be used to}} inspect spent nuclear fuel assemblies for the purpose of identifying anomalies such as missing elements or substituted elements. The ability to identify anomalies in spent fuel assemblies can be used to deter diversion of material by increasing the risk of early detection as well as improve reprocessing facility operations by confirming the spent fuel configuration is as expected or allowing segregation if anomalies are detected...|$|R
