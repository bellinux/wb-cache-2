40|$|The rate of {{selecting}} different {{options in the}} decisions-from-feedback paradigm is commonly used to measure preferences resulting from experiential learning. While convergence to a single option increases with experience, some variance in choice remains even when options are static and offer fixed rewards. Employing a decisions-from-feedback paradigm followed by a policy-setting task, we examined whether the observed variance in choice is driven by factors related to the paradigm itself: Continued exploration (e. g., believing options are non-stationary) or exploitation of perceived outcome patterns (i. e., a belief that sequential choices are not independent). Across two studies, participants showed variance in their choices, which was related (i. e., proportional) to the policies they set. In addition, in Study 2, participants' reported under-confidence {{was associated with the}} amount of choice variance in later choices and policies. These results suggest that variance in choice is better explained by participants lacking confidence in knowing which option is better, rather than methodological artifacts (i. e., exploration or <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> outcome independence).

By 1993 following the Battle of Mogadishu (1993), portrayed in the book and movie black hawk down, the mission in Somalia was considered a failure. The Clinton administration was criticised for the operation's outcome, primarily due to the decision to abandon the region before completing the operation's humanitarian and security objectives, and for their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> the threat Al-Qaida elements posed in Somalia as well as to U.S. security interests at home.|$|E

For this purpose, the current JRC must be restructured to include all countries in the Ganges Basin (Faisal 2002; Iyer 1999). Lebel et al. (2005) focus on scaling of water governance in the Mekong Region based on political process, development discourse and institutional system. This governance approach requires community inclusion for incorporating multilevel interests by developing spatial, temporal and jurisdictional scales. This multilateral institution can mediate asymmetric power and develop equitable water access for the basin countries (Bhattarai 2009; Elhance 1999) to achieve sustainable water management (Bandyopadhyay and Ghosh 2009). The new institution needs to gather base-line data related to hydrology, ecology, basin communities, water stagnation, and salinity. This integrated perspective can reduce ecological system failures and the displacement of local people (Brunee and Toope 1997).

25|$|Usage {{of illicit}} drugs of {{unexpected}} purity, in large quantities, or {{after a period}} of drug abstinence can also induce overdose. Cocaine users who inject intravenously can easily overdose accidentally, as the margin between a pleasurable drug sensation and an overdose is small. Unintentional misuse can include errors in dosage caused by failure to read or understand product labels. Accidental overdoses may also be the result of over-prescription, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> a drug's active ingredient, or unwitting ingestion by children. A common unintentional overdose in young children involves multi-vitamins containing iron. Iron is a component of the hemoglobin molecule in blood, used to transport oxygen to living cells. When taken in small amounts, iron allows the body to replenish hemoglobin, but in large amounts it causes severe pH imbalances in the body. If this overdose is not treated with chelation therapy, it can lead to death or permanent coma. The term 'overdose' is often misused as a descriptor for adverse drug reactions or negative drug interactions due to mixing multiple drugs simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The defense {{strategy}} was to impeach {{the testimony of the}} key prosecution witnesses: Lloyd and Weichmann. It also wished to show that she was loyal to the Union, her trips to Surrattsville were of an innocent nature, and she had not been aware of Booth's plans. There were 31 witnesses who testified for the defense. George H. Calvert testified that he had pressed Surratt to pay a debt, Bennett Gwynn said Surratt had sought payment from John Nothey to satisfy the Calvert debt, and Nothey agreed that he had received a letter from Surratt for him to appear at the tavern on April 11 to pay what was owed. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14) and implied that he could not have remembered that day clearly. (However, Lloyd had testified that he repaired a broken spring on Surratt's wagon, which rebutted the claims.) Augustus Howell, a Confederate agent, testified that Surratt's eyesight was poor and that Weichmann was an untrustworthy witness, as he had sought to become a Confederate spy himself. (The prosecution had attempted to show that Howell was a Confederate spy and should not be trusted.) Anna Surratt testified that it was Weichmann who had brought Atzerodt into the boarding house, that the photograph of Booth was hers (given to her by her father in 1862), and that she owned photographs of Union political and military leaders. Anna denied ever overhearing any discussions of disloyal activities or ideas in the boarding house, and she said that while Booth visited the house many times, his stays were always short. Anna explained her mother's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> Powell by asserting she could not see well. Honora Fitzpatrick was called back to the stand and testified to Mary's poor eysight as well. A former servant and a former slave both said her eyesight was failing and that she had given Union soldiers food. Numerous witnesses were called {{at the end of the}} defense's case to testify to her loyalty to the Union, her deep Christian faith, and her kindness. A number of Catholic priests were called to the stand to testify about Surratt's faith, good character, and incorruptibility. Portraying Surratt as a good Christian woman incapable of committing the crimes for which she was accused was a large part of the {{defense strategy}}. During the prosecution's rebuttal, government lawyers called four witnesses (P.T. Ransford, John Ryan, Frank Stith, and James Young) to the stand, who testified as to Weichmann's unimpeachable character.|$|E

Yet, in the history of economics, sociology or the study of the diplomacy or of national defense, philosophical inquiry about “cognitive issues in policy making” has been very poor. More specifically, on one hand, epistemologists have hesitated to go into this kind of inquiry, since policy making always embraces questions of values or other subjective judgments, and hence, objectivity is not assured. On the other hand, the attention of the economist, sociologist, or analysts on diplomacy and national defense has focused on the analysis of relationships among the economic, social, diplomatic or defense factors, while neglecting the cognitive issues in policy making itself.

For a successful outcome, early recognition of stroke, transportation {{to the hospital}} emergency department immediately after stroke, timely imaging, proper diagnosis, and thrombolysis within 4. 5 h is of paramount importance. Aim: To analyze the obstacles for thrombolysis in acute stroke patients. Materials and Methods: The {{study was conducted in}} a tertiary care center in South India. A total of hundred consecutive patients of acute ischemic stroke who were not thrombolysed, but otherwise fulfilled the criteria for thrombolysis were evaluated prospectively for various factors that prevented thrombolysis. The constraints to thrombolysis were categorized into: i) <b>Failure</b> of patient <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> stroke symptoms, ii) patient′s awareness of thrombolysis as a treatment modality for stroke, iii) failure of patient′s relative <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> stroke, iv) <b>failure</b> of primary care physician <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> stroke, v) transport delays, vi) lack of neuroimaging and thrombolysis facility, and vii) nonaffordability. Results: The biggest hurdle for early hospital presentation is <b>failure</b> of patients <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> stroke (73 %), followed by lack of neuroimaging facility (58 %), nonaffordability (56 %), failure of patient′s relative <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> stroke (38 %), failure of the primary care physician <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> stroke (21 %), and transport problems (13 %).

But survive and recover they do, and with an appetite for life that leads them towards self-knowledge and the possibility for self-discovery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Programme for the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans {{has been}} criticized for several of its evaluations, and also the {{approach}} used to perform these evaluations. Some critics have claimed that IARC Working Groups' <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> study weaknesses and biases of Working Group members have led to inappropriate classification of a number of agents as carcinogenic to humans. OBJECTIVES: The authors of this paper are scientists from various disciplines relevant to the identification and hazard evaluation of human carcinogens. We have examined here criticisms of the IARC classification process to determine the validity of these concerns. We review the history of IARC evaluations and describe how the IARC evaluations are performed. DISCUSSION: We conclude that these recent criticisms are unconvincing. The procedures employed by IARC to assemble Working Groups of scientists from the various discipline and the techniques followed to review the literature and perform hazard assessment of various agents provide a balanced evaluation and an appropriate indication of the weight of the evidence. Some disagreement by individual scientists to some evaluations is not evidence of process failure. The review process has been modified over time and will undoubtedly be altered in the future to improve the process. Any process can in theory be improved, and we would support continued review and improvement of the IARC processes. This does not mean, however, that the current procedures are flawed. CONCLUSIONS: The IARC Monographs have made, and continue to make, major contributions to the scientific underpinning for societal actions to improve the public's health...|$|R
