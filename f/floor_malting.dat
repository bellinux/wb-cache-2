40|$|Malt (dried, sprouted cereal grain) is {{the major}} {{ingredient}} in most beers and in certain hot and cold beverages. It is also a useful ingredient in some cereal food products such as bread and infant porridges. In terms of nutrients, malt contains mainly complex carbohydrates (starch and dietary fiber), but also protein of reasonable quality and availability, B vitamins and minerals. Malt {{is a source of}} hydrolytic enzymes, especially amylases. In brewing, the malt amylases produce the sugars which the yeast ferments to alcohol and carbon dioxide The amylases also increase the sweetness and improve the texture of food products such as bread and porridges. <b>Floor</b> <b>malting</b> of sorghum and millet is a traditional craft that has been carried out throughout Africa for hundreds of years. The modern factory manufacture of barley malt and sorghum malt is in principle identical to traditional malting. This guide shows how traditional <b>floor</b> <b>malting</b> can be scaled-up into a small commercial-scale operation, through the application of simple, sound food manufacturing practices. Note: The guide is an introduction to the technology of sorghum and millet <b>floor</b> <b>malting.</b> It is not intended to provide complete instructions on how to floor malt sorghum and millets. If the reader wishes to undertake sorghum and millet malting and has had no previous experience, it is strongly recommended that he/she contacts INTSORMIL to be put in touch with an expert in sorghum and millet malting...|$|E
40|$|In many African countries, {{including}} South Africa, sorghum is malted for the brewing {{of traditional}} beer. In South Africa, most sorghum malting is by traditional outdoor <b>floor</b> <b>malting,</b> whereby the sorghum grain is steeped for about 8 hours, left outdoors to germinate in an uncontrolled environment. These malting conditions (wet grain and {{more or less}} ambient temperature) encourage microbial proliferation. Microorganisms may themselves negatively impact on {{the safety of the}} malts. Of more concern is the proliferation of fungi which can potentially produce highly poisonous mycotoxins in the sorghum malt. Microbial proliferation can also affect the quality of malt, and thereby resulting in undesirable malts. Therefore {{there is a need for}} efficient and safe ways to control microbial growth during sorghum malting. The aim of this research was to determine processes to produce sorghum malt that is free of unwanted yeasts, coliforms, moulds and mycotoxins. The first process investigated involved turning the grains during germination. The second process involved the addition of dilute sodium hydroxide (NaOH) / caustic soda and calcium hydroxide [(Ca(OH) 2]/lime during steeping and the third process was by the use of biological control methods which involved inoculation with microbial starter cultures. The effect of the three processes on the levels of moulds, coliforms, mycotoxins (aflatoxins, fumonisins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone), cytotoxicity, expressed in terms of their IC 50 (Inhibitory concentration resulting in 50 % inhibition of the cleavage activity) and quality in terms of diastatic power (DP) of sorghum malt were investigated. Turning the sorghum grains during germination did not affect the microbial load of the malt. The total bacterial counts were at high levels of 107 - 109 cfu/g, fungi at 104 - 106 cfu/g and coliforms at 103 - 105 cfu/g. Turned and unturned grains produced malt which showed contamination by about 8 different mould species. Some of these moulds (Fusarium verticillioides, Phoma sorghina. Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata and Penicillium spp.) are known to produce mycotoxins. Malt samples contained fumonisins, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone at levels of 500 mg/kg). Turning had the negative effect of decreasing the DP of the sorghum malt. The reason that turning did not reduce the microbial load is probably due to the fact that the blending of malt as a result of turning ensured that bacteria and moulds were evenly distributed throughout the malt bed. Steeping sorghum grains in 0. 2 % NaOH reduced the level of microbial contamination in the malt. Coliforms and moulds were reduced from 104 and 105 cfu/g respectively, to levels of 102 cfu/g in the malt that do not pose health hazards. The high pH (10 - 13) that resulted from the addition of NaOH probably caused the inhibition of coliforms and moulds by distorting their cell membranes, destroying the proton gradient of the bacterium cell and thus leading to their death. Steeping in 0. 2 % NaOH resulted in malts with no detectable amounts of mycotoxins and no indication of cytotoxicity in the sorghum malt. A further advantage was that the DP of the 0. 2 % NaOH steeped malts was doubled. The addition of about 107 - 108 cfu/ml of Saccharomyces spp. and Pediococcus. pentosaceus cultures to steep water reduced moulds in the malt from 104 cfu/g to 102 cfu/g and coliforms from 104 cfu/g to 102 and < 101 cfu/g, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of the Saccharomyces spp. appears to be mainly due to the competition with the other microorganisms. The antimicrobial activity of P. pentosaceus is mainly attributed to the low pH. In addition to the low pH, production of CO 2, competition for nutrients and the production of antimicrobial activity could have been responsible for the overall antimicrobial activity of P. pentosaceus. Steeping with microbial cultures resulted in malts that contained no traces of mycotoxins and cytotoxicity. The DPs of the sorghum malts were not affected by steeping with microbial cultures. Turning of grains during germination is not a good method to control microbial load during sorghum malting. The addition of dilute NaOH in steeping water is proposed as a chemical method for the control of bacterial and fungal contamination during sorghum malting whereas the use of the Saccharomyces spp. and P. pentosaceus cultures offers a potential alternative as natural, biocontrol agents. However, dilute alkaline steeping is a more favoured method because it is an easier and practical method to put into operation. Thesis (PhD (Food Sciences)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

5000|$|Burukutu {{production}} involves five basic stages, which includes: steeping, malting, mashing, fermentation and maturation. The production {{begins by}} malting, which involves {{the conversion of}} the Guinea corn or millet grains into malt and this takes place on a <b>malting</b> <b>floor.</b> This process is followed by steeping, which involves the soaking of the grains in water for at least three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to begin to sprout.

2500|$|Malting is {{the process}} of {{converting}} barley or other cereal grains into malt, for use in brewing, distilling, or in foods and takes place in a maltings, sometimes called a malthouse, or a <b>malting</b> <b>floor.</b> The cereal is spread out on the <b>malting</b> <b>floor</b> in a layer of 8 to 12cm (3 to 5 inch) depth. The malting process starts with drying the grains to a moisture content below 14%, and then storing for around six weeks to overcome seed dormancy. When ready, the grain is immersed or steeped in water two or three times over two or three days to allow the grain to absorb moisture and to start to sprout. When the grain has a moisture content of around 46%, it is transferred to the <b>malting</b> or germination <b>floor,</b> where it is constantly turned over for around five days while it is air-dried [...] The grain at this point is called [...] "green malt". The green malt is then dried and pre-toasted in an oven (or kiln) to the desired colour and specification.

The additions costing £6,999 were designed and supervised by Toowoomba architect Harry Marks of James Marks and Son. They comprised the erection of a new malthouse and kilns which were linked to the 1899 malthouse and the conversion of the existing brewery tower to a high water storage reservoir. The new malthouse included steeping tanks, a large polished cement germinating <b>floor,</b> two kilns, <b>malt</b> dressing rooms, and a number of pine storage bins. Elevators and a conveyor belt, which traversed the length of the building, transported the grain in its various stages. The malt storage chamber was fitted with 38 Marks patented reversible casement windows and a number of Marks's roof ventilators. Special kiln top ventilators were also designed by Marks, who was described as being gifted with inventive genius. The new complex, described as the biggest in the Commonwealth, was opened on 1 June 1907. The contractor was Montague Ivory with the plastering (including the cement germinating floor) by WJ Waldron, ironwork by the Toowoomba Foundry, and plumbing by Partridge and Co.|$|R
5000|$|In 1826, James C. Allman {{established}} a distillery {{in a converted}} 18th Century mill, following {{the failure of the}} family's cotton manufacturing business. A report at the time, showed that production between October 1826 and October 1827 totalled some 63,023 gallons. Thereafter, the distillery grew in capacity over time, reaching a capacity of 200,000 per annum by 1836, and by the mid-1800s the distillery had become the largest rural distillery in Ireland, with a capacity in excess of 500,000 gallons per annum. When Alfred Barnard, a British historian visited the distillery in the late 1800s, it had become a significant enterprise. Boasting its own private railway line, and with the largest <b>malting</b> <b>floors</b> in the United Kingdom aside from those at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, which were marginally larger, Allmans and was said to be [...] "the most dominant landmark in rural Co. Cork". According to Barnard, Allman's whiskey was of [...] "superior quality", and although it enjoyed a large trade in Ireland, was chiefly exported to [...] "England, Scotland and the Colonies". [...] In 1878, a fire broke out in the mill room of the distillery, destroying the mill, malthouse and 400 barrels of grain. The nearby bonded warehouses were saved by cutting down a timber bridge which connected them to the burning building. The damage, estimated to have amounted to £6,000, was covered by insurance. The fire cost the life of one employee, a man who fell from a height of 12 ft while trying to extinguish the flames.|$|R
50|$|Barley is {{soaked in}} {{water from the}} source {{for two to three}} days then spread over the <b>floor</b> of the <b>malting</b> house. The green malt is then dried in a kiln over peat smoke. The malt is then milled into grist, which is like a coarse flour. Grist is then mixed with hot water in the mash tun at about 70 °C for about an hour. This is drained off and the second water, which is hotter, is added and allowed to run {{straight}} through. The third water is even hotter and is used as the first water for the next batch. The sugary wort is collected, cooled and then fermented in large pine vessels called wash backs. Yeast is added and after 48 hours of fermentation the wash is made. The wash is then pre-heated in a wash-charger and from there goes to the wash still. This is a traditional pot still made of copper and is of a shape unchanged in the history of Scotch whisky making. The wash is heated in the pot still so the alcohol vapour rises up and cools and condenses in the low wines receiver. The low wines then passes through to the spirit still where it is distilled again. The spirit running through the pot and spirit stills is subject to Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise Duty and so is kept under lock and key. It can be sampled and tested by the stillman via the spirit sample safe. The spirit from the spirit still is divided in three parts, but only the middle cut or “Heart of the Run” is suitable to be made into malt whisky. The other two parts are fed back into the low wines receiver to be re-distilled. The middle cut then goes to an oak spirit receiver and from there to the filling vats in the spirit store.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} useful sources of {{information}} {{for the history of}} the Guildhall are the ink-wash drawings of Samuel Hieronymous Grimm a Swiss artist who was extensively employed by the Dean of Lincoln, Sir Richard Kaye mainly to record architectural subjects. Many of these drawings are in the British Library but there are some of his drawings in the Usher Gallery. There are four drawings of the St Mary Guildhall, done about 1784. These include a view looking up the High Street with the Saxon Church of St Peter at Gowts in the foreground on the right and the St Mary’s Guildhall to the left. The stone house closest to the church with the chimney, together with the bay with the porch next to the Guildhall were demolished in 1896 to make way for Sibthorp Street. There is another view in the Usher Gallery which is looking at the Guildhall from the opposite direction and provides more information about the houses to the south which were demolished. Although these demolished houses contain Romanesque windows it is likely that they were rebuilt in the 17th century making use of earlier building material. Grimm also provides a detailed drawing of the main entrance showing the orders of the arch studded with flowers and dogtooth ornament and two heads on the door jamb, one of which is a bishop. Above this is a running frieze with two heads above. The survey work on the west front has shown that originally the Guildhall had a first floor hall that was lit with five Romanesque windows, similar to those on the St Andrews Hall on the opposite sied of the street. The frontage also had two tall chimney stacks. Grimm also drew the Norman House which stands {{on the north side of}} the courtyard behind the Guildhall. Although this building has two romanesque windows and a massive pilaster on the front, it is in all probability an early 17th rebuild from the time that the Christ’s Hospital Bluecoat School occupied the premises. The Romanesque windows appear to be very similar to those on the buildings that were demolished in 1896, and possibly would have come from the source. The Norman House and adjacent building were used in the later 18th and 19th century as a <b>malting</b> <b>floor</b> and barley store.|$|R
