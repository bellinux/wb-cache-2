40|$|The {{possibility}} of using terrestrial <b>ionospheric</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>to</b> improve the directivity of electric dipoles on space missions {{has been investigated}} by comparing simultaneous observations of a solar radio storm by the ISIS 1 and ISIS 2 spacecraft, in near earth orbit, and the ISEE 3 spacecraft located beyond the magnetosphere. To this end, a three-dimensional ray tracing in a spherically stratified ionosphere {{has been carried out}} for conditions appropriate to the observations by the ISIS spacecraft of a solar radio storm in September 1983. The procedure allows Poynting flux spectral densities measured on ISIS to be converted to spectral densities well outside the ionosphere where they can be compared directly with simultaneous observations on ISEE 3. The results demonstrate good agreement over their common observing frequency range (1 - 2 MHz) ...|$|R
5000|$|Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader {{praised the}} {{adaptation}} by Kazan and the [...] "down-to-earth" [...] performances of James Dean and Richard Davalos. Bosley Crowther, writing for The New York Times, described {{the film as}} having [...] "energy and intensity but little clarity and emotion"; he notes: In one respect, it is brilliant. The use that Mr. Kazan has made of CinemaScope and color in capturing expanse and mood in his California settings is almost beyond compare. His views of verdant farmlands in the famous Salinas [...] "salad bowl," [...] sharply <b>focused</b> <b>to</b> the <b>horizon</b> in the sunshine, are fairly fragrant with atmosphere. The strain of troubled people against such backgrounds has a clear and enhanced irony.For the stubborn {{fact is that the}} people who move about in this film are not sufficiently well established to give point to the anguish through which they go, and the demonstrations of their torment are perceptibly stylized and grotesque.|$|R
40|$|Ionospheric {{modification}} by {{high power}} radio waves and by chemical releases are combined in a theoretical study of <b>ionospheric</b> <b>focused</b> heating. The release of materials which promote electron-ion recombination creates {{a hole in}} the bottomside ionosphere. The <b>ionospheric</b> hole <b>focuses</b> high power radio waves from a ground-based transmitter to give a 20 dB or greater enhancement in power density. The intense radio beam excites atomic oxygen by collisions with accelerated electrons. Airglow from the excited oxygen provides a visible trace of the focused beam. The large increase in the intensity of the radio beam stimulates new wave-plasma interactions. Numerical simulations show that the threshold for the two-plasmon decay instability is exceeded. The interaction of the pump electromagnetic wave with the backward plasmon produces a scattered electromagnetic wave at 3 / 2 the pump frequency. The scattered wave provides a unique signature of the two-plasmon decay process for ground-based detection...|$|R

40|$|About 22 {{hours after}} its closest {{approach}} to Jupiter, Voyager 2 passed behind the planet as {{viewed from the}} earth. Although the spacecraft was geometrically occulted for nearly two hours, the radio links {{between it and the}} earth were maintained almost continuously because of the refraction of the signals in Jupiter's south polar atmosphere. A figure shows the plane-of-the-sky geometry of this grazing occultation and preliminary data on the intensity of the spacecraft radio signals as received by the tracking station at Goldstone, California. The intensity data indicate a classic atmospheric occultation profile and the effects of turbulence and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>focusing</b> and defocusing. Analysis of the dispersive ionospheric refraction data yields preliminary profiles for the topside ionosphere at 66. 7 deg S (entry in the evening) and 50. 1 deg S (exit in the morning) that are reversed with respect to corresponding Voyager 1 profiles in terms of plasma concentration at a fixed altitude.
