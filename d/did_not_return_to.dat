40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} the {{following}} problem: is <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> wrong conjectures necessary to achieve full power of algorithmic learning? <b>Returning</b> <b>to</b> wrong conjectures complements the paradigm of U-shaped learning when a learner <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> old correct conjectures. We explore our problem for classical models of learning in the limit from positive data: explanatory learning (when a learner stabilizes in the limit on a correct grammar) and behaviourally correct learning (when a learner stabilizes in the limit on a sequence of correct grammars representing the target concept). In both cases we show that <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> wrong conjectures is necessary to achieve full learning power. In contrast, one can modify learners (without losing learning power) such that they never show inverted U-shaped learning behaviour, that is, never <b>return</b> <b>to</b> old wrong conjecture with a correct conjecture in-between. Furthermore, one can also modify a learner (without losing learning power) such that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> old “overinclusive” conjectures containing non-elements of the target language. We also consider our problem {{in the context of}} vacillatory learning (when a learner stabilizes on a finite number of correct grammars) and show that each of the following four constraints is restrictive (that is, reduces learning power) : the learner <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> old wrong conjectures; the learner is not inverted U-shaped; the learner <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> old overinclusive conjectures; the learner <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> old overgeneralizing conjectures. We also show that learners that are consistent with the input seen so far can be made decisive: on any text, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> any old conjectures—wrong or right...|$|R

5|$|By July 1943, it {{was decided}} to send a group of 6,000 long serving {{veterans}} of the NZEF to New Zealand for three months leave. Kippenberger was the ranking officer of the group, and with a high public profile due to his exploits in Crete and North Africa, he spent much of his leave in extensive speaking engagements. He became very rundown and was seriously ill in September, when he was originally expected to return to Egypt.

Anatoly <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the family following the Second World War, instead choosing to settle alone in Kiev; Sofia therefore raised her son on her own, working at the Fraser Cutting Instruments Factory to support Eduard and herself. As a result, Streltsov had a modest upbringing, the highlights of which were playing football and following his favoured team, Spartak Moscow.|$|E

He also missed the two MCC tours that winter to New Zealand and West Indies, neither of which involved a full-strength team.|$|E
