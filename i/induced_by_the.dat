5|$|Iridium {{is used in}} {{particle}} physics {{for the production of}} antiprotons, a form of antimatter. Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> temperature rise due to the incident beam.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale mining {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. They include acid drainage <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities.|$|E

5|$|After initial cutting, {{the diamond}} is shaped in {{numerous}} stages of polishing. Unlike cutting, {{which is a}} responsible but quick operation, polishing removes material by gradual erosion and is extremely time consuming. The associated technique is well developed; it is considered as a routine and can be performed by technicians. After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry. Remaining non-diamond inclusions are removed through laser drilling and filling of the voids produced.|$|E

5|$|Electroporation is {{the rapid}} {{increase}} in bilayer permeability <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> application of a large artificial electric field across the membrane. Experimentally, electroporation is used to introduce hydrophilic molecules into cells. It is a particularly useful technique for large highly charged molecules such as DNA, which would never passively diffuse across the hydrophobic bilayer core. Because of this, electroporation {{is one of the}} key methods of transfection as well as bacterial transformation. It has even been proposed that electroporation resulting from lightning strikes could be a mechanism of natural horizontal gene transfer.|$|E

5|$|Mining {{oil shale}} {{involves}} {{a number of}} environmental impacts, more pronounced in surface mining than in underground mining. These include acid drainage <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sudden rapid exposure and subsequent oxidation of formerly buried materials, the introduction of metals including mercury into surface-water and groundwater, increased erosion, sulfur-gas emissions, and air pollution caused by the production of particulates during processing, transport, and support activities. In 2002, about 97% of air pollution, 86% of total waste and 23% of water pollution in Estonia came from the power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E

5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> varying {{part of the}} Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater.|$|E
5|$|The season {{chosen for}} leaving Pannonia was unusually early; the Germanic peoples {{generally}} waited until autumn before beginning a migration, giving themselves {{time to do}} the harvesting and replenish their granaries for the march. The reason behind the spring departure could be the anxiety <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> neighboring Avars, despite the friendship treaty. Nomadic peoples like the Avars also waited for autumn to begin their military campaigns, as they needed enough forage for their horses. A sign of this anxiety can also be seen in the decision taken by Alboin to ravage Pannonia, which created a safety zone between the Lombards and the Avars.|$|E
5|$|The self-damage <b>induced</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium is {{so strong}} that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice, and the energy release during this process, 1000 watts per gram of 253Es, induces a visible glow. These processes may contribute to the relatively low density and melting point of einsteinium. Further, owing to the small size of the available samples, the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope. Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value.|$|E
