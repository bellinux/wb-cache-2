5|$|The actual {{separation}} of technetium-99 from {{spent nuclear fuel}} is a long process. During <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing,</b> it comes out {{as a component of}} the highly radioactive waste liquid. After sitting for several years, the radioactivity reduces to a level where extraction of the long-lived isotopes, including technetium-99, becomes feasible. A series of chemical processes yields technetium-99 metal of high purity.|$|E
25|$|On April 25, 2009, the North Korean {{government}} announced the country's nuclear facilities had been reactivated, and that spent <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> for arms-grade plutonium has been restored.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{plants in}} Europe are <b>reprocessing</b> spent <b>fuel</b> from {{utilities}} in Europe and Japan. Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel is currently not permitted in the United States {{due to the}} perceived danger of nuclear proliferation. However the recently announced Global Nuclear Energy Partnership would see the U.S. form an international partnership to see spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessed</b> {{in a way that}} renders the plutonium in it usable for nuclear fuel but not for nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|The {{plant is}} {{expected}} to be <b>fueled</b> by <b>reprocessed</b> pine kernel shells, to generate 49 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 50,000 homes.|$|R
25|$|Because it {{is almost}} uniquely {{produced}} by nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing,</b> technetium-99 is an important element {{as part of the}} OSPAR Convention since it provides a good tracer for discharges into the sea.|$|E
25|$|Chemists often exploit {{differences}} in solubilities to separate and purify compounds from reaction mixtures, using {{the technique of}} liquid-liquid extraction. This applies in vast areas of chemistry from drug synthesis to spent nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Technetium-99 is a {{radioactive}} element which {{is produced by}} nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing,</b> and also as a by-product of medical facilities (for example Ireland {{is responsible for the}} discharge of approximately 11 grams or 6.78 gigabecquerels of technetium-99 each year despite not having a nuclear industry).|$|E

5000|$|The main design {{objectives}} of the third generation EPR design are increased safety while providing enhanced economic competitiveness through improvements to previous PWR designs scaled up to an electrical power output of around 1650 MW (net) with thermal power 4500 MW. The reactor can use 5% enriched uranium oxide <b>fuel,</b> <b>reprocessed</b> uranium <b>fuel</b> and 100% mixed uranium plutonium oxide fuel. The EPR is the evolutionary descendant of the Framatome N4 and Siemens Power Generation Division [...] "Konvoi" [...] reactors. Siemens ceased its nuclear activities in 2011.|$|R
25|$|The same year, the PAEC entered another {{agreement}} with General Electric of Canada {{to build a}} 137MW Nuclear power plant at Karachi. In 1967, Abdus Salam urged Field Marshal Ayub Khan to acquire a nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> facility from the United States, but Ayub Khan and his Finance minister, Muhammad Shoaib, had denied Salam's request.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s {{plans to build}} a nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> plant in the Bavarian town of Wackersdorf lead to major protests. In 1986, West German police were confronted by demonstrators armed with slingshots, {{crowbars}} and Molotov cocktails at the site of a nuclear reprocessing plant in Wackersdorf. The plans for the plant were abandoned in 1988. It still isn't clear whether protests or plant economics led to the decision.|$|E
40|$|Accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) are {{investigated}} for long-lived fission product transmutation and fuel regeneration. The {{aim of this}} paper is to investigate the nuclear fuel evolution and the neutronic parameters of a lead-cooled accelerator-driven system used for fuel breeding. The fuel used in some fuel rods was T 232 hO 2 for U 233 production. In the other fuel rods was used a mixture based upon Pu-MA, removed from PWR-spent <b>fuel,</b> <b>reprocessed</b> by GANEX, and finally spiked with thorium or depleted uranium. The use of <b>reprocessed</b> <b>fuel</b> ensured the use of T 232 hO 2 without the initial requirement of U 233 enrichment. In this paper was used the Monte Carlo code MCNPX 2. 6. 0 that presents the depletion/burnup capability, combining an ADS source and kcode-mode (for criticality calculations). The multiplication factor (keff) evolution, the neutron energy spectra in the core at BOL, and the nuclear fuel evolution during the burnup were evaluated. The results indicated that the combined use of T 232 hO 2 and <b>reprocessed</b> <b>fuel</b> allowed U 233 production without the initial requirement of U 233 enrichment...|$|R

25|$|The work of PERG {{played a}} role in {{limiting}} the development of nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> and the 'plutonium economy', particularly in Germany, cleaning up discharges to the Irish Sea, altering perceptions of the risks of ionising radiation and the consequences of reactor meltdowns. The group also produced the first study in renewable energy strategies in a report for the European Parliament in 1980; the first comparative study of organic and conventional agriculture, and the first UK study of forestry as carbon sequestration.|$|E
25|$|In Ireland, {{a nuclear}} power plant was first {{proposed}} in 1968. It was to be built during the 1970s at Carnsore Point in County Wexford. The plan called for first one, then ultimately four plants to be built at the site, but it was dropped after strong opposition from environmental groups, and Ireland has remained without nuclear power since. Despite opposing nuclear power (and nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> at Sellafield), Ireland is to open an interconnector to the mainland UK to buy electricity, which is, in some part, the product of nuclear power.|$|E
25|$|Intermediate-level waste (ILW) {{contains}} higher {{amounts of}} radioactivity {{and in general}} require shielding, but not cooling. Intermediate-level wastes includes resins, chemical sludge and metal nuclear fuel cladding, as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It may be solidified in concrete or bitumen for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing)</b> is deposited in geological repository. U.S. regulations do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present work {{describes}} the mathematical {{basis of a}} computer code {{for the analysis of}} PUREX flowsheet. The model equations have been developed {{on the basis of the}} idealized model for mixer settlers. The distribution coefficients relations for U(VI), U(IV), Pu(IV), Pu(III), Ru & Zr and the redox reactions rates of the species involved in U/Pu partitioning are incorporated. The validity of the model equations is tested by carrying out experiments in an ejector mixer-settler with simulated solutions. The stage-wise experimental concentration profiles compare well with the theoretical predictions. An optimum flowsheet for FBR <b>fuels</b> <b>reprocessing</b> has been proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of radionuclides {{in the surface}} layer of four soils of contrasting types from west Cumbria, UK, have been studied in detail. All the soils contain enhanced levels of artificial radionuclides derived from low-level discharges both to sea and to atmosphere from the British Nuclear <b>Fuels</b> <b>reprocessing</b> plant at Sellafield. The bulk of the activity is held in the top 15 cm of soil profiles, suggesting that radionuclide mobility is limited. Sequential extraction experiments have identified major associations of plutonium with organic matter and of caesium with silicates {{but there is no}} preferential association of ruthenium with any single soil component...|$|R
25|$|The {{necessary}} <b>fuel</b> salt <b>reprocessing</b> {{technology has}} been demonstrated, but only at laboratory scale. A prerequisite to full-scale commercial reactor design is the RD& to engineer an economically competitive fuel salt cleaning system.|$|R
25|$|Sellafield is {{a nuclear}} <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> and nuclear {{decommissioning}} site, {{close to the}} village of Seascale on the coast of the Irish Sea in Cumbria, England. The site is served by Sellafield railway station. Sellafield incorporates the original nuclear reactor site at Windscale, which is currently undergoing decommissioning and dismantling, and Calder Hall, a neighbour of Windscale, which is also undergoing decommissioning and dismantling of its four nuclear power generating reactors. It is the site of the world's first commercial nuclear power station to generate electricity on an industrial scale.|$|E
25|$|The deal caused lively {{international}} reactions. One of {{the main}} reasons for the frenzy was {{due to the fact that}} West Germany, an NPT signatory, made a commitment to transfer nuclear technology to Brazil, headed by a military dictatorship that was not party to the NPT. In the years that followed the announcement, Brazil and West Germany were under strong pressure coming from not just the U.S., but also the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and the Soviet Unionâcountries which supported a restrictive position on nuclear sales and strongly opposed the export of advanced nuclear technology such as <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> plants.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, the International Court of Justice, {{prompted}} {{especially by}} New Zealand, has declared {{the deployment of}} nuclear weapons to be illegal. This justifies taking an even stronger stance on where they may be carried. The numbers of those weapons, and the States holding them, have increased, despite {{the end of the}} cold war. Uncertainties around the intentions of nuclear states and the location and safety of weapons have made disarmament an even more urgent priority now than it was in the 1980s. Secondly, nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> has gone global, with shipments of highly hazardous plutonium mixed-oxide fuel and high-level waste passing regularly between Japan and Europe, sometimes through the Tasman Sea.|$|E
5000|$|The {{back end}} of the nuclear <b>fuel</b> cycle (nuclear <b>reprocessing</b> and {{management}} of radioactive waste) ...|$|R
50|$|Similarly, in fuel cycles {{with nuclear}} reprocessing, {{the amount of}} {{high-level}} waste for a given amount of energy generated is not closely related to burnup. High-burnup fuel generates a smaller volume of <b>fuel</b> for <b>reprocessing,</b> but with a higher specific activity.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear waste has {{contaminated}} Cattaraugus Creek {{and other}} areas around West Valley, New York. Although {{almost all of the}} high-level nuclear waste has been removed, according to the Department of Energy (DOE), nuclear and hazardous wastes are still buried in unlined trenches on two sites at a former privately operated nuclear <b>fuels</b> <b>reprocessing</b> facility alongside Cattaraugus Creek north of the village of West Valley in Cattaraugus County. The DOE's Demonstration Project at the site transferred high-level nuclear waste into glass canisters. Reprocessing of spent fuel rods from military and civilian nuclear power plants between 1966 and 1972 resulted in burial of low-level radioactive waste (LLNW) on 22 acre and burial of high-level radioactive waste on another 7 acre there.|$|R
25|$|The pebble-bed reactor, a {{high-temperature}} gas-cooled reactor (HTGCR), {{is designed}} so high temperatures reduce power output by Doppler broadening of the fuel's neutron cross-section. It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium {{is not subject}} to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel-balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one-by-one as they age. The design of the fuel makes <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> expensive.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{reprocessing}} {{technology was}} developed to chemically separate and recover fissionable plutonium from irradiated nuclear <b>fuel.</b> <b>Reprocessing</b> serves multiple purposes, whose relative importance has changed over time. Originally reprocessing was used solely to extract plutonium for producing nuclear weapons. With the commercialization of nuclear power, the reprocessed plutonium was recycled back into MOX nuclear fuel for thermal reactors. The reprocessed uranium, which constitutes {{the bulk of the}} spent fuel material, can in principle also be re-used as fuel, but that is only economic when uranium prices are high or disposal is expensive. Finally, the breeder reactor can employ not only the recycled plutonium and uranium in spent fuel, but all the actinides, closing the nuclear fuel cycle and potentially multiplying the energy extracted from natural uranium by more than 60 times.|$|E
25|$|Salam {{knew the}} {{importance}} of nuclear technology in Pakistan, for civilian and peaceful purposes. But, according to his biographers, Salam played an ambiguous role in Pakistan's own integrated atomic bomb project. As late as the 1960s, Salam made an unsuccessful attempt for a proposal {{for the establishment of}} nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>reprocessing</b> plant, but it was deferred the matter on economic grounds by Ayub Khan. According to Rehman, Salam's influence in nuclear development was lessened and diminished as late as 1974, and he became critical of Bhutto's control over science. But Salam personally did not terminate his connection with the scientists working in the theoretical physics division at PAEC. As early as 1972â73, he had been a great advocate for the atomic bomb project, but subsequently took a stance against it after he fell out with Bhutto over the issue of the Ahmaddiya denomination as non-Islamic.|$|E
50|$|A typical large 1000 MWe {{nuclear reactor}} {{produces}} 25-30 tons of spent fuel per year. If the <b>fuel</b> were <b>reprocessed</b> and vitrified, the waste volume {{would be only}} about three cubic meters per year, but the decay heat would be almost the same.|$|R
