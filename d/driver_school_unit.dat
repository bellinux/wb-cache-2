40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{degradation of}} the environment along with high demands for energy consumption in buildings has prompted many countries to use other energy sources such as natural gas and geothermal energy instead of oil. This study refers to the use of natural gas in <b>school</b> <b>units</b> in Greece. More specifically, it focuses on <b>school</b> <b>units</b> that are connected to the natural gas network and on the economic and environmental benefits arising from this. In this context, the advantages and disadvantages in using natural gas are compared with those resulting from the use of geothermal energy. In areas which have a significant geothermal potential, the choice of geothermal heating and cooling of large <b>school</b> <b>units</b> is the best solution, but this however does not apply to all areas. Clearly, the development of geothermal energy in <b>school</b> <b>units</b> is still in pilot stage. However, the use of natural gas in <b>school</b> <b>units</b> has been rising over the last decade and it has already contributed to some extent towards the reduction of carbon dioxide and towards saving natural resources. Thus, the survey shows clear advantages in using natural gas and in plans to extend its use to other <b>school</b> <b>units.</b> © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} our study is the {{interpersonal}} relations between principal and teachers and their contribution to the effective operation of the <b>school</b> <b>unit.</b> The subject is approached theoretically and empirically. The basic {{purpose of the study}} is to reveal the importance of interpersonal relations in education, and specifically in the <b>school</b> <b>unit.</b> 299 <b>school</b> <b>units</b> and 2062 teachers participated in the survey. About the same number of teachers and principals from elementary and secondary education participated. The majority of the participants works for many years and are female. The study investigates the prevailing situation in the <b>school</b> <b>units,</b> the perceptions of principals and teachers about the interpersonal relations that are developed in their <b>school</b> <b>unit</b> and their importance in the effective operation of <b>school</b> <b>unit,</b> and their opinions on the factors that encourage or impende the growth of interpersonal relations. It was found that the relations between principal and teachers are official and formal in most schools, even if meetings of collaboration on various subjects often take place. Although the opinions of the subjects of the research on interpersonal relations differ depending on the sex, the grade they teach and whether they completed postgraduate studies, most of them consider that the collaboration between principal and teachers, the good behavior, the qualifications and the personality of both influence positively the interpersonal relations and the effective operation of the <b>school</b> <b>unit.</b> From the theoretical and the empirical part {{of our study}}, it is inferred that Greek and foreign educators support the importance and the contribution of interpersonal relations in the upgrade of education quality. The interpersonal relations constitute a basic factor for effective operation of the school unit; good interpersonal relations create a friendly school climate, affect positively students’ achievement, and give to the teachers and the principal the feeling of satisfaction from their work. ...|$|R
