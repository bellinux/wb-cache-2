5|$|Bonass {{came into}} the team at outside-right for the fifth game of the new season, before {{reverting}} to outside-left against Sheffield Wednesday on 17 September, which coincided with Chesterfield's first win. Two weeks later, he scored the only goal of the game at home to West Ham United direct from a corner kick. He kept his place {{to the end of}} the year, but then played only three times before the end of February when he submitted a transfer request. The Derbyshire Times reported no disharmony between club and player, who <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> different surroundings might help a return to form. He moved on to London club Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in June, and played in all three of their matches before the 1939–40 Football League season was abandoned when war broke out.|$|E
500|$|Several titles were {{considered}} before the band {{settled on the}} eponymous name. Kretz explained, [...] "We've always tried {{to come up with}} very witty and interesting names for our records and we <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> it was time, 18 years into the Stone Temple Pilots career, to put out a self-titled album." [...] Robert agreed that the new title was a testament to the [...] "new chapter" [...] in the band's career. Weiland also felt the band was starting over and thought the music expressed this on its own. [...] "We don't need {{to come up with some}} major conceptual title. The image on the cover and the music speak for themselves." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the subject}} of {{returning}} for the sequel, Larter was chosen by New Line Cinema over her co-star Devon Sawa, who played as Alex Browning in the first film. [...] "We’ve brought back Clear in an interesting way and we <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> to bring both of them back would make you wonder too much just what the hell they’d {{been doing for the}} past few months," [...] producer Craig Perry conveyed on developing the cliffhanger of Final Destination. Perry said that bringing back Clear over Alex was due to narrative reasons, stating that there were no financial problems that prevented Sawa from returning. He also observed that Clear is more knowledgeable in terms of mentoring the new protagonist and that she was utilized as the main link to the original film. Larter was delighted when New Line reinstated her and found it [...] "terrific" [...] that she had some input into the script. As a result, Sawa's character was killed off-screen in Final Destination 2, as divulged by Clear to Kimberly during their first meeting.|$|E

500|$|What Love Is Made Of" [...] was premiered during Irish DJ Annie Mac's eponymous {{program on}} BBC Radio 1, on 10 May 2013, though its digital {{download}} only occurred on 5 July 2013. It was serviced as an extended play, {{where it was}} bundled with three remixes, by MK (Mark Kinchen), Felix da Housecat and Brackles. The song was ultimately excluded from Katy's second studio album, entitled Little Red. During an interview with Clash, Katy was asked about why she had not included the song in the album's track listing. To that question, she responded: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I wanted to put some music out there, really. Like, 'Aaliyah' from Danger EP is on the album, but I loved collaborating with Jessie Ware. But [...] {{means a lot to}} me , so I wanted to get it out there, regardless of whether it was on the album." [...] Having a length of three minutes and fifty-five seconds (3:55), [...] "What Love Is Made Of" [...] is an uptempo dance and house track that has been described as [...] "rave-y" [...] and [...] "trance-y". Its instrumentation contains the sounds of pianos and synthesizers. Jordan Sargent of Spin observed that it continued the musical style first introduced in Katy's 2012 extended play (EP), Danger EP, which was [...] "straight-forward house". Idolator's Sam Lansky compared her performance in the song to recording artist Siobhán Donaghy.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{made several}} other changes going from season one to season two, {{including}} making the scripts more focused around the entire cast {{rather than just}} Leslie. They also tried to make Leslie appear more intelligent in the second season after receiving audience feedback that she appeared [...] "ditzy", which Michael Schur said was never their intention. Schur said, [...] "In the end, we <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> Amy is an enormously likable presence on screen, so as the season went on we just tried to create situations where that would shine through." [...] During the episode [...] "Kaboom", a major subplot was resolved when the large construction pit that Leslie had long sought {{to turn into a}} park was filled with dirt and turned into a lot. The pit was first established in the premiere episode and had been a focal point of the series since the show began. Schur said while the pit project was originally conceived as a device to bring all the characters together working toward a common goal, and it was expected to only become a park during the series finale. However, Schur said he felt the early episodes were too focused on the pit and had led viewers to believe the entire show was about filling the pit, which was not the writers' intention, so they accelerated the resolution of that story arc. The idea of Ben and Chris, two state auditors who come in from outside Pawnee to help the town deal with budget problems, was conceived from news reports at the time of a number of states considering shutting down schools, parks and other services due to the global recession.|$|E
2500|$|Shanahan {{became a}} free agent {{following}} the 2005–06 season and subsequently signed a one-year, $4 million deal with the New York Rangers. After completing a successful nine-year stay in Detroit, he {{expressed a desire to}} move on in his NHL career, stating, [...] "It really came down to an instinct I had. Detroit has a great past and a great future ahead of them as well, but I guess I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> maybe I was identified with the past {{a little bit more than}} the future." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michener was {{immediately}} recalled from India {{and it was}} on March 29, 1967, that Queen Elizabeth II had, by commission under the royal sign-manual and Great Seal of Canada, appointed Pearson's choice of Michener to succeed Georges Vanier as the Queen's representative. Despite being a Conservative, Liberal members of parliament and cabinet ministers welcomed the selection of Michener; Paul Martin Sr. said [...] "I don’t think there was anybody inside or outside the public service who could qualify better than Michener... People <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> this was a good appointment." [...] Michener was subsequently sworn-in during a ceremony in the Senate chamber on April 17 that year, leaving one of the shortest periods where an individual has been governor general-designate.|$|E
2500|$|Hunter was not {{implicated in}} the Duke Cunningham/Brent R. Wilkes congressional bribery scandal. In December 2005, Hunter {{directed}} that the contributions his campaign received from Wilkes and Wade {{be given to the}} Injured Marine Semper Fi Fund. [...] "We had options," [...] said Bruce Young, treasurer for Hunter's re-election campaign. [...] "We could keep the money, send it back, send it to the government or send it to a charity. We <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> because of the situation, we would rather not have the money." [...] More than 100 members of the House and Senate – Republicans and Democrats – accepted money from Wilkes, former MZM Inc. president Mitchell Wade, their relatives, employees or political action committees, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign watchdog group.|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{songwriter}}s on {{the album}} include Australian singer-songwriter Sia Furler, American singer-songwriters Christina Perri and Bonnie McKee, and Academy Award-nominated songwriter Anne Preven. Furler penned four of the tracks that feature {{on the album}}, including [...] "Cannonball" [...] and [...] "If You Say So", the latter of which was co-written with Michele. Most of the songs on the album are of the pop, dance-pop, and pop rock genres, mixed with some traditional pop ballads including [...] "If You Say So" [...] and [...] "Battlefield". Before {{the release of the}} lead single [...] "Cannonball", Michele stated, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Cannonball" [...] was the perfect first song for people to hear from this record. It just really explains where I am right now and it's been such an inspirational song for me." [...] The second single, [...] "On My Way", was released on May 4, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|Series creator Alan Ball had {{previously}} {{worked with the}} cable channel HBO on Six Feet Under, which ran for five seasons. In October 2005, after Six Feet Under wrapped, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. True Blood became the first project under the deal, after Ball became acquainted with Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery books. One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a Barnes & Noble bookshop and came across Dead Until Dark (2001), the first installment in Harris' series. He read the entries that followed and became interested in [...] "bringing [...] vision to television". However, Harris already had two other adaptation options for the books. She said she chose to work with him, though, because [...] " [...] really 'got' me. That's how he convinced {{me to go with}} him. I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he understood what I was doing with the books." ...|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{was often}} seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and {{imposing}} figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. [...] "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," [...] biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were {{and used it to}} his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, [...] "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." [...] At [...] tall, Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as [...] "The Johnson Treatment". A contemporary writes, [...] "It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on you, all of a sudden, you <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The single [...] "Cannonball" [...] {{was written}} by Sia Furler. Originally, this song wasn't meant for Michele; it was {{introduced}} to her a month after her boyfriend's death and she had an instant connection with its lyrics because they encapsulated her feelings in that moment. Michele has stated, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Cannonball" [...] was the perfect first song for people to hear from this record. It just really explains where I am right now and it's been such an inspirational song for me. The minute I heard the song, I had a physical reaction to it. For me, it's been my strength. I listen to it every day. I know it was brought into my life for a reason. It's really been so helpful for me and I hope it's the same for other people as it's been for me." [...] Because of this, Furler gave the song to her. Furler also wrote the song [...] "Battlefield" [...] especially for Michele, and co-wrote [...] "If You Say So" [...] with her. [...] "If You Say So" [...] was confirmed to be dedicated to Cory Monteith, Michele's Glee co-star and late boyfriend, who died in July 2013.|$|E

He later died of a heroin overdose in 1999. Turner has expressed regret at not having known his father and considers his music career to be a tribute to his father's memory. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> sad <b>that</b> I never really {{got the chance to}} know him. And because he didn't die in the nicest way. He died in a tragic way." [...] "I've done all of this to honour his memory, because he didn't get the chance {{to make it in the}} music industry." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1965, Wilson met Tony Asher at a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles. Asher {{was at the time}} a 26-year-old lyricist and copywriter working in jingles for an advertising agency. The two exchanged ideas for songs, and soon after, Wilson heard of Asher's writing abilities from mutual friends. In December 1965, he contacted Asher about a possible lyric collaboration, wanting to do something [...] "completely different" [...] with someone he had never written with before. Asher accepted the offer, and within ten days, they were writing together. Wilson played some of the music he had recently recorded and gave a cassette to Asher containing the backing track to a piece called [...] "In My Childhood". The result of Asher's tryout was eventually retitled [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and the success of the piece convinced Wilson that Asher was the wordsmith he had been looking for. When Wilson was asked why he felt Asher was the right collaborator: [...] "Oh, a lot of reasons. One, I thought he was a cool person. Two, anybody that hung out with [...] Loren Schwartz was a very brainy guy, a real verbal type person. I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> there was something there that had to be, you know, that really had to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Bauhaus {{released}} {{their first}} new studio album since 1983, Go Away White (Cooking Vinyl). It marked the band's {{end and the}} album had no promotional tour. In late 2007, Kevin Haskins said [...] "We were getting along really well, {{but there was an}} incident that occurred", and added that as a result, [...] "Some of us <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> we didn't want to carry on as a working unit". In early 2008, Murphy claimed that he [...] "was most satisfied with the bonding on an emotional level. It was good to be working together and to put the past behind us and it was very positive. The result was coming out really fast, so it was exciting and it was very enjoyable", but in the end, [...] "that rocky character worked and I think it was a bit right to finish it, really". The same year, David J commented on the breakup: [...] "You have a test tube, and you pour in one chemical, and you pour in another chemical, and something happens. It starts to bubble. Pour in another chemical, and it starts to bubble a bit more. You pour in a fourth chemical, and it bubbles really violently, and then explodes. That's my answer".|$|E
2500|$|The {{season was}} not without confrontation, as O'Neal in one team meeting said, [...] "I have {{something}} to say. I think Kobe is playing too selfishly for us to win." [...] O'Neal felt pressure to be leader of the team and was upset with Bryant's shot selection. Teammate Ron Harper helped mediate the differences between O'Neal and Bryant. According to Jackson, [...] "Kobe didn't have a selfish agenda; he <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{the way he had}} been playing was the best way he could contribute. Gradually, he's seen there is a different way to contribute that incorporates more of the team." [...] Upon arriving to the Lakers that season, Winter said he was stunned to discover the level of hatred O'Neal expressed toward Bryant. [...] "There was a lot of hatred in [...] heart ... Kobe just took it and kept going." [...] O'Neal regularly expressed to management that he did not believe the team could win a championship with Bryant. Winter observed that O'Neal influenced the entire team against Bryant. Winter thought that Bryant {{made it a point to}} get the ball to O'Neal that year, but O'Neal did not appreciate what Bryant was doing to help him. During that season's All-Star Game, Bryant did not participate in the Slam Dunk Contest and a matchup against Vince Carter, following Jackson's request to pass on individual accomplishments to keep the focus on the team. During All-Star warm-ups, O'Neal mimicked Bryant's crossover dribble but threw the ball into the stands to accentuate Bryant's turnovers. O'Neal said it was an inside joke between Kobe and him. Jackson and Winter relied on the triangle offense to heal the relationship between O'Neal and Bryant. The coaches believed that the offense was so structured that the relationship between the two players would be smoother on the court. The coaches would also tell the team they did not see the selfishness in Bryant that the players saw. Winter even put together a video for O'Neal to show that Bryant was playing his role correctly.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{themes were}} {{composed}} by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, but Howard {{did not return}} to the series to score this film and was not credited as a composer. Regarding his departure from the franchise, Howard said, [...] "I <b>just</b> really <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I had made what I felt like I could contribute to that series, and I always felt that…Hans...was the mastermind of those scores. I mean, they really sounded the way they sounded because of him. His conception of the scores was really brilliant. It’s not that I didn’t add a lot, I did, but I don’t think I added the aspects of the music that really defined the character of those movies." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "Last week, I was pretty miffed about Once Upon A Time and its {{treatment}} of Regina (Lana Parrilla). While I ultimately liked the episode, {{it felt like the}} show was continuing to use her as a punching bag to move the plot forward. Need something bad to happen to one of our characters? Just take it out on Regina! Granted, it’s a formula that has served Once Upon A Time in the past, but at this point, it <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> repetitive. <b>That’s</b> why “Only You” and “An Untold Story” provided such a fresh change of pace for a season finale that not only sets up the next phase of the story, but also promises to put Regina in a more central role." ...|$|R
500|$|Magma {{was officially}} {{released}} through Roadrunner Records to a generally favorable critical reception, scoring a 79 on Metacritic. The album marked {{a change in}} style for the band, with Joe Duplantier experimenting with clean vocals, and with Mario commenting that [...] "this time, we <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> all together <b>that</b> we wanted something straight to the point more. We wanted to change the dynamic." [...] The band will tour North America with Tesseract from mid-July through October 2016 {{in support of the}} album. In 2016, the band will tour the United Kingdom with Alter Bridge, Volbeat, and Like a Storm.|$|R
2500|$|Denisof complimented {{the season}} three Angel episode [...] "Billy", in which Wesley tries to murder Fred after {{becoming}} supernaturally misogynous, [...] "because {{it was the}} first real dark change in Wesley to experiment with". Discussing Wesley's betrayal of his friends to protect Angel's baby, Denisof explains, It isn't that he's purely bad or purely good, we're discovering a deeper and more complicated area of the character where good and bad aren't as clear, where Wesley does something motivated, he thinks, for the good of all [...] i.e. saving Connor and relieving Angel of the responsibility of murdering his son [...] and in doing so creates the situation in which the baby could be kidnapped, Angel loses his son and Wesley has his throat slit for the trouble. So it's grey rather than black or white. Science fiction magazine Starburst said that [...] "somber, subdued, bearded Wesley is worlds away from the foolish, pompous Wesley". Denisof says of the period, [...] "It was a great opportunity to explore some of the character's darker layers. You couldn't have predicted it when he arrived in Sunnydale. This was an important element to introduce and explore, to be consistent with the show and to continue the organic exploration of all the characters." [...] Whilst the character spent less time with his old friends, Denisof was [...] "more or less isolated from the , barring one or two scenes of mild confrontation when they would come to visit me and we'd chew each other out. There's definitely a cold war going on with Wesley versus the world." [...] Wesley's dark attitude is alleviated somewhat when the gang decide to take over Wolfram & Hart. The tension between Wesley and his co-workers did not go away because of the mind-wipe but because [...] "we decided we were better off as a team than as separate entities. And we had to put our differences behind us and build our trust again as a group." [...] Discussing the way Wesley's English accent softens over the course of Angel, Denisof says, [...] just sits on him better. As an actor, it <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> organically the way he was changing, and it also seemed to be accurate when you consider the amount of time he's spent in L.A. that the accent could have softened. And since he isn't surrounded by upper-crust academics as he was as a young Watcher in the Academy in England, it's understandable that he is changing the way he speaks and changing his voice, his delivery, {{as a result of his}} environment.|$|E
