5|$|Flooding {{caused by}} Connie {{generally}} did not attract much media attention; however, the floods were important <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> conditions for later significant flooding across the northeastern United States. Just {{five days after}} Connie struck North Carolina, Hurricane Diane affected the same area, but instead of continuing to the northwest it turned to the northeast. Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie. Damage from Diane totaled at least $700million, and six states were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes' impact; this allowed federal assistance for the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Jack Grayburn led {{an attempt}} to secure the {{southern}} end of the bridge but was unsuccessful, and a later attempt using a flame thrower only succeeded <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> freshly painted girders of the bridge alight. However, the British were able to make good their position and quickly repulsed the 10th SS Reconnaissance Battalion and other German units when they arrived to secure the bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{editors of}} the Anderson Democrat {{discovered}} Riley's poems in the Indianapolis Journal and offered him {{a job as a}} reporter in February 1877. Riley accepted. He worked as a normal reporter gathering local news, writing articles, and assisting <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> typecast on the printing press. He continued to write poems regularly for the newspaper and to sell other poems to larger newspapers. During the year Riley spent working in Anderson, he met and began to court Edora Mysers. The couple became engaged, but terminated the relationship after they decided against marriage in August.|$|E

5|$|The {{governor}} {{also can}} influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Justices of the peace and superior courts judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> makeup of the judiciary.|$|E
5|$|The project's {{finalization}} {{lasted for}} two years due to {{the intention of the}} team behind it to improve it as much as possible. According to Gočeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> right musical direction with the recording of Makedonsko Devojče 2. Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of Macedonian traditional music, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary {{at the time of the}} release of the album, thus intertwining pop and jazz elements. The lyrics cover emotional states of sadness, happiness, love and longing experienced by a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Gočeva, taking into account her wide vocal range and musical versatility; all of them are sang without using any backing vocals.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the United Nations created Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 5 {{to improve}} {{maternal}} health. Target 5A sought to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters from 1990 to 2015, using two indicators, 5.1 the MMR and 5.2 {{the proportion of}} deliveries attended by skilled health personnel (physician, nurse or midwife). Early reports indicated MDG 5 had made the least progress of all MDGs. By the target date of 2015 the MMR had only declined by 45%, from 380 to 210, most of which occurred after 2000. However this improvement occurred across all regions, but the highest MMRs were still in Africa and Asia, although South Asia witnessed the largest fall, from 530 to 190 (64%). The smallest decline {{was seen in the}} developed countries, from 26 to 16 (37%). In terms of assisted births, this proportion had risen globally from 59 to 71%. Although the numbers were similar for both developed and developing regions, there were wide variations in the latter from 52% in South Asia to 100% in East Asia. The risks of dying in pregnancy in developing countries remains fourteen times higher than in developed countries, but in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the MMR is highest, the risk is 175 times higher. <b>In</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> MDG targets, skilled assisted birth was considered a key strategy, but also an indicator of access to care and closely reflect mortality rates. There are also marked differences within regions with a 31% lower rate in rural areas of developing countries (56 vs. 87%), yet there is no difference in East Asia but a 52% difference in Central Africa (32 vs. 84%). With the completion of the MDG campaign in 2015, new targets are being set for 2030 under the Sustainable Development Goals campaign. Maternal health is placed under Goal 3, Health, with the target being to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70. Amongst tools being developed to meet these targets is the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist.|$|E

25|$|The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was a {{predisposing factor}} <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> stage for {{homelessness}} in the United States. Long term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into SROs and {{supposed to be}} sent to community mental health centers for treatment and follow-up.

25|$|Traditionally, {{errors are}} {{attributed}} to mistakes made by individuals who may be penalized for these mistakes. The usual approach to correct the errors is to create new rules with additional checking steps in the system, aiming to prevent further errors. As an example, an error of free flow IV administration of heparin is approached by teaching staff {{how to use the}} IV systems and to use special care <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> IV pump. While overall errors become less likely, the checks add to workload and may in themselves be a cause of additional errors.|$|E
25|$|What {{is crucial}} <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> level of {{formality}} in any legal document is assessing {{the needs and}} expectations of the audience. For example, an appellate brief to the highest court in a jurisdiction calls for a formal style—this shows proper respect for the court and for the legal matter at issue. An interoffice legal memorandum to a supervisor can probably be less formal—though not colloquial—because it is an in-house decision-making tool, not a court document. And an email message to a friend and client, updating {{the status of a}} legal matter, is appropriately informal.|$|E

25|$|The {{inquiry report}} was {{published}} on 21 January 1949.

The report also discusses the standard setting for altimeters (known as the regional QFF) that had been introduced in May 1948 for aircraft above 1,500feet within control zones, and that any error <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> barometric pressure of one millibar gave an error of 28feet.|$|E
25|$|On 6 October 2011 a {{government}} panel proposed {{to ease the}} legal restrictions for exposure to radiation in the contaminated areas with radioactive fallout, because in their opinion it would be extremely difficult to limit exposure below the legal limit of 1 millisievert per year.

Targets should be lowered in steps as decontamination proceeded. Targets might differ by region and residents should have a voice <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> targets.|$|E
25|$|Although {{paintings}} {{produced at}} the end of the 16th century belong to general Northern Mannerist and Late Renaissance approaches that were common throughout Europe, artists such as Otto van Veen, Adam van Noort, Marten de Vos, and the Francken family were particularly instrumental <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> stage for the local Baroque. Between 1585 and the early 17th century they made many new altarpieces to replace those destroyed during the iconoclastic outbreaks of 1566. Also during this time Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder became important for their small cabinet paintings, often depicting mythological and history subjects.|$|E

25|$|Some rods {{are joined}} through a metal bus. These add mass to the rod which helps <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> hook and help {{activating}} the rod from tip to butt when casting, {{resulting in a}} better casting experience. Some anglers experience this kind of fitting as superior to a one piece rod. They are found on specialised hand-built rods. Apart from adding the correct mass, depending {{on the kind of}} rod, this fitting also is the strongest known fitting, but also the most expensive one. For that reason they are almost never to be found on commercial fishing rods.|$|E
25|$|The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was a pre-disposing factor <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> {{stage for}} {{homelessness}} in the United States.

In the United States, during the late 1970s, the deinstitutionalization of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor which seeded population people that are homeless, especially in urban areas such as New York City.|$|E
25|$|As already mentioned, the Spanish {{version of}} the Halakot Gedolot, {{probably}} made about 1000, adopted these four sections as a complete treatise; hence one would not be far wrong <b>in</b> <b>setting</b> <b>the</b> 9th century as the date of composition.
