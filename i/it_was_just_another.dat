25|$|Heinkel, {{having had}} the He 112 {{rejected}} {{in the design}} competition of 1936, designed and built the He 100. On 6 June 1938, the He 100 V3, flown by Ernst Udet, captured the record with a speed of 634.7km/h (394.4mph). On 30 March 1939, test pilot Hans Dieterle surpassed that record, reaching 746.61km/h (463.92mph) with the He 100 V8. Messerschmitt, however, soon regained the lead when, on 26 April 1939, Flugkapitän Fritz Wendel, flying the Me 209 V1, set a new record of 755.14km/h (469.22mph). For propaganda purposes, the machine was called the Me 109R, suggesting <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> variant of the standard fighter, {{but in fact it}} was a racing aircraft having little in common with the Bf 109. It was powered by the DB 601ARJ, producing 1,156kW (1,550hp), but capable of reaching 1,715kW (2,300hp). This world record for a piston-engined aircraft was to stand until 1969, when Darryl Greenamyer's modified Grumman F8F Bearcat, Conquest I, broke it with a 777km/h (483mph) record speed.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{popular music}} was used {{throughout}} the production to evoke {{the feel of the}} year in which each episode was set. The BBC's existing agreements with various music publishers and record labels meant that the production team was easily able to obtain the rights to use most of the desired songs. A particular piece of synchronicity occurred in the final episode, 1995, which Cellan Jones had decided to close with the song [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] by Oasis. While the serial was in production, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> track from their (What's the Story) Morning Glory? album.

500|$|The episode {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B+, praising Moresco's script for its subtlety. VanDerWerff noted the premise's similarity to the Susan Smith case, {{and felt that}} the episode [...] "actually gains strength from a certain distance from when it originally aired. Back then, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> ripped-from-the-headlines tale of a murderous mother. Now, it’s a crafty mystery that doesn’t reveal its cards until late". Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 4 out of 5, noting that the episode [...] "broke clichés and trampled all over formulas". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "Covenant" [...] four-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it [...] "Millennium's version of Twelve Angry Men". Shearman praised Morseco's writing, noting that the episode was [...] "tightly plotted and boast extremely good dialogue". Shearman felt that Koskoff's acting showed a [...] "naivety that isn't as subtle as the script demands", but overall felt that the episode was [...] "fresh and exciting".|$|E

40|$|The {{empirical}} {{results from}} recent randomised controlled studies on remote, intercessory prayer remain mixed.

This assumption is challenged by (1) discussing problems posed by the need to obtain the informed consent of patients participating in the studies; (2) pointing out that if the intercessors are indeed conscientious religious believers, they should subvert the studies by praying for patients randomised to the control groups; and (3) showing that the studies in question are characterised by an internal philosophical tension because the intercessors and the scientists must take incompatible views of what is going on: the intercessors must take a causation‐first view, whereas the scientists must take a correlation‐first view.

500|$|TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars, writing [...] "Simpsons Season 26 starts {{off with a}} bang, with plenty of laughs {{and even a few}} sentimental moments". Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 4 stars out of 5, commenting 'Clown in the Dumps' may not be {{considered}} a classic episode now, but after a few years when we watch it again on syndication, probably next year on FXX, it will grow in stature. It is a heartfelt episode that does bring on the laughs. The sadness of the episode to me was Jackie Mason's voice, which sounds very tired. Paste gave the episode a rating of 7.1, concluding These days, The Simpsons can be hit or miss, and there was nothing to guarantee success from 'Clown in the Dumps'. However, even if the character death was perfunctory, and Rabbi Krustofski has made only a handful of appearances in over 550 episodes, it was still a funny, solid half hour of television. Nothing special—really, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> Krusty episode, and not the best Krusty episode. Nevertheless, the 26th season of The Simpsons has started out on somewhat of a high note. The good times keep on rolling for Matt Groening's deathless creation.|$|E
500|$|Upon the {{announcement}} of the first four male finalists, there were viewers of the show who had negative reactions regarding its format. They were shocked, disappointed, and were left complaining as two of the contestants that were favored by the judges based on their performances failed to make the cut. Instead, two others who had rather bad reviews from the jurors took the spots. Viewers critical to the program concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>another</b> [...] "popularity contest" [...] rather than a singing competition. [...] Cayabyab mentioned that people should not be complacent regarding the contestants' status on the show, and advised them to keep on voting for their favorites because of the show's uncertainty. This criticism was also reflected during the Women's Semi-finals, as talent critics believed two contenders that failed to make the cut should have become finalists. Critics also noted that viewers did not take heed to the judges' remarks about performance. [...] Torre stated in his article that the results of Philippine Idol Semi-finals revealed that viewers were not yet knowledgeable or objective enough to pick the first Idol, and pointed to the compromised voting based on [...] "subjective campaigns" [...] from some of the semi-finalists' backers. He later commented that the show did not affirm a contestant's popularity but [...] "the determination and deep pockets of his supporters." [...] This was supported on a report published by the Manila Bulletin about contestants who [...] "buy their way to the top". Cayabyab divulged that he did not expect the way people voted and would see if that trend would continue in the coming weeks. However, he admitted that such campaigns were part of the game.|$|E
