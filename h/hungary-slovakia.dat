(born 1983) is {{an ethnic}} Hungarian woman from Horné Mýto (...) , Slovakia, whose {{situation}} gained publicity in 2006 for claiming {{that she was}} physically assaulted allegedly in a hate crime incident.

50|$|Declaring the Hungarian head {{of state}} an unwelcome person (essentially persona non grata, {{although}} this term was not used) created additional diplomatic conflict in already tense <b>Hungary-Slovakia</b> relations.|$|E
50|$|The M15 {{motorway}} (M15-ös autópálya) is a Hungarian motorway {{connects the}} M1 motorway to Bratislava, {{the capital of}} Slovakia. The <b>Hungary-Slovakia</b> border crossing is at Rajka (Hungary) and Čunovo (Slovakia).|$|E
50|$|After {{the first}} {{break-up}} of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, Hungary {{was the first}} state which officially recognized the independent Slovakia. Subsequently, Hungary and Slovakia established embassies in Bratislava and Budapest and kept diplomatic relations during the World War Two. Despite a formal alliance inside the Berlin pact (1940) and a common war against the Anti-Hitler coalition, Slovak-Hungarian political relations maintained {{on the brink of}} war due to the frontier dispute and the oppression of Slovak minority in Hungary and Hungarian minority in Slovakia. The restoration of Czechoslovakia and the liquidation of the independent Slovakia in 1945 led {{to the end of the}} first period of <b>Hungary-Slovakia's</b> relations.|$|R
50|$|Balázs {{became the}} Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs in April 2009, serving until May 2010. Balázs, when {{addressing}} {{the topic of}} <b>Hungary-Slovakia</b> relations compared {{the creation of the}} language law of Slovakia to the politics of the Ceauşescu regime on the use of language. He was succeeded by János Martonyi.|$|E

50|$|The 2009 {{amendment}} {{has been}} severely criticized by Hungarians in Slovakia, {{as well as}} the government, civil organizations and general public of neighboring Hungary, for being discriminatory toward Hungarians and their rights to use their Hungarian language. The controversy about the law {{is one of the key}} points in <b>Hungary-Slovakia</b> relations, brought to their lowest point for many years.|$|E
5000|$|In 2009, Sólyom was refused {{entry to}} Slovakia {{to attend the}} {{dedication}} of a statue of King Saint Stephen in the border town of Komárno on 21 August, an incident reported in Hungary as tantamount to a declaration of persona non grata which further worsened already tense <b>Hungary-Slovakia</b> relations. Sólyom said that [...] "this is a situation unheard of, inexcusable and unexplainable in the relationship of two allied countries." [...] Slovakia's government, containing the ultranationalist SNS party, claimed that the Hungarian President's presence is a [...] "threat to national security". Sólyom came back to visit the same statue a year later in August 2010, after Slovak voters ousted the previous government; the ceremony at the statue took place without incident.|$|E
40|$|The article explores how {{the notion}} of European {{integration}} {{at the local level}} can be conceptualized and measured. Based on a process-oriented inclusive understanding of integration and using relational datasets that maps both domestic and cross-border communication ties among political representatives in four Euroregions along the borders of <b>Hungary–Slovakia</b> and Sweden–Norway, we begin by applying and theoretically dissecting network-analytical metrics based on frequency of ties. Despite finding that such measures capture analytically relevant properties of political cross-border networks, we argue that they are less than ideal for capturing {{the notion of}} political integration. Instead, with inspiration from the blockmodeling tradition in network analysis, we propose two novel metrics—cross-border connectivity and integrational overfitting. These metrics not only enrich our understanding of political integration in cross-border settings but also can serve as useful mapping tools for policy-makers. A software client enabling the analysis of these measures supplements this article...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of grape must into wine involves {{the development and}} succession of yeast populations differing in species composition. The initial population is formed by vineyard strains which are washed into the must from the crushed grapes and then completed with yeasts coming from the cellar environment. As the origin and natural habitat of the vineyard yeasts are not fully understood, this study addresses the possibility that grape yeasts can be preserved in berries left behind on vines at harvest until the spring of the next year. These berries become mummified during the winter on the vines. To investigate whether yeasts can survive in these overwintering grapes, mummified berries were collected in 16 localities in the Tokaj wine region (<b>Hungary-Slovakia)</b> in early March. The collected berries were rehydrated to recover viable yeasts by plating samples onto agar plates. For the detection of minority species which would not be detected by direct plating, an enrichment step repressing the propagation of alcohol-sensitive yeasts was {{also included in the}} process. The morphological, physiological and molecular analysis identified 13 basidiomycetous and 23 ascomycetous species including fermentative yeasts of wine-making relevance among the 3879 isolates. The presence of viable strains of these species demonstrates that the grapes mummified on the vine can serve as a safe reservoir of yeasts, and may contribute to the maintenance of grape-colonizing yeast populations in the vineyard over years, parallel with other vectors and habitats. All basidiomycetous species were known phylloplane yeasts. Three Hanseniaspora species and pigmented Metschnikowia strains were the most frequent ascomycetes. Other fermentative yeasts of wine-making relevance were detected only in the enrichment cultures. Saccharomyces (S. paradoxus, S. cerevisiae and S. uvarum) were recovered from 13 % of the samples. No Candida zemplinina was found. The isolates with Aureobasidium morphology turned out to belong to A. subglaciale, Kabatiella microsticta or Columnosphaeria fagi. The ascomyceteous isolates grew at high concentrations of sugars with Wickerhamomyces anomalus being the most tolerant species. Complex interactions including antagonism (growth inhibition, contact inhibition, competition for nutrients) and synergism (crossfeeding) among the isolates and with Botrytis cinerea shape the composition of the overwintering communities...|$|E
