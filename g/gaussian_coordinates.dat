Moreover, the integration of the pseudotensor in this gauge yields the Komar angular momentum integral in a foliation adapted to the axisymmetry of the spacetime.

40|$|The Wheeler-DeWitt {{equation}} of vacuum geometrodynamics is {{turned into a}} Schrödinger equation by imposing the normal Gaussian coordinate conditions with Lagrange multipliers and then restoring the coordinate invariance of the action by parametrization. This procedure corresponds to coupling the gravitational field to a reference fluid. The source appearing in the Einstein law of gravitation has {{the structure of a}} heat-conducting dust. When one imposes only the Gaussian time condition but not the Gaussian frame conditions, the heat flow vanishes and the dust becomes incoherent. The canonical description of the fluid uses the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>coordinates</b> and their conjugate momenta as the fluid variables. The energy density and the momentum density of the fluid turn out to be homogeneous linear functions of such momenta. This feature guarantees that the Dirac constraint quantization of the gravitational field coupled to the Gaussian reference fluid leads to a functional Schrödinger equation in Gaussian time. Such an equation possesses the standard positive-definite conserved norm. For a heat-conducting fluid, the states depend on the metric induced on a given hypersurface; for an incoherent dust, they depend only on geometry. It seems natural to interpret the integrand of the norm integral as the probability density for the metric (or the geometry) to have a definite value on a hypersurface specified by the Gaussian clock. Such an interpretation fails because the reference fluid is realistic only if its energy-momentum tensor satisfies the familiar energy conditions. In the canonical theory, the energy conditions become additional constraints on the induced metric and its conjugate momentum. For a heat-conducting dust, the total system of constraints is not first class and cannot be implemented in quantum theory. As a result, the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>coordinates</b> are not determined by physical properties of a realistic material system and the probability density for the metric loses thereby its operational significance. For an incoherent dust, the energy conditions and the dynamical constraints are first class and can be carried over into quantum theory. However, because the geometry operator considered as a multiplication operator does not commute with the energy conditions, the integrand of the norm integral still does not yield the probability density. The interpretation of the Schrödinger geometrodynamics remains viable, but it requires a rather complicated procedure for identifying the fundamental observables. All our considerations admit generalization to other coordinate conditions and other covariant field theories...|$|E
40|$|The {{orbital motion}} about a central {{symmetric}} massive body appears very well {{described in terms}} of polar <b>Gaussian</b> <b>coordinates</b> because these are the only coordinates that can be materialized by a proper reference frame with origin at the centre of the massive body. In fact, by means of the relativistic world function in the post-Newtonian approximation of the exterior field written in these coordinates, it also results that the relativistic Gaussian post-Newtonian distance between two orbiting particles reduces to their Euclidean distance when these particles become in conjunction with the central massive body and the distance is calculated by an observer at rest with respect to this body. Besides, the differential equation in the reciprocal of this polar Gaussian radial coordinate for any bounded orbit is governed by a function which is asymptotically a cubic, so that these orbits can be given in terms of elliptic functions. Since, on the other hand, the most relevant (non-linear) relativistic term appearing in other post-Newtonian approximations of the exterior field disappears when these coordinates are used, to see how the relativistic corrections are now incorporated, an approximate solution for this kind of trajectories, as well as for their respective advances of perihelion is, finally, derived. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use the}} {{so-called}} direct approach to the formulation of the basic equations of shell theory. The advantage of the latter approach was discussed in many papers, see for example [19]. Within framework of the direct approach, an elastic micropolar shell is a two-dimensional analogue of the Cosserat continuum, i. e. a micropolar shell is a material surface each particle of which has {{six degrees of freedom}} of the rigid body. Further we will use the notations [7, 8, 12]. Let σ be a base surface of the micropolar shell in a reference configuration (for example, in an undeformed state), q α (α = 1, 2) be <b>Gaussian</b> <b>coordinates</b> on σ, and r(q 1,q 2) be a position vector of σ. In the actual (deformed) configuration the surface is denoted by Σ, and the position of its particles is given by the vector R(q 1,q 2). Orientation of the particles is described by the so-called microrotation tensor (or turn-tensor) H(q 1,q 2), which is the proper orthogonal tensor. If we introduce three orthonormal vectors dk (k = 1, 2, 3), which describe the particle orientation in a reference configuration, and three orthonormal vectors Dk, which determine the same particle orientation in an actual configuration, then the tensor H is given by H = dk ⊗ Dk. Thus, the micropolar shell is described by two kinematically independent fields R = R(q α), H = H(q α). For the micropolar shell made of an elastic material there should exist a strain energy density W. By using the principle of local action [1, 2] the constitutive equation for the function W is given by the formula [7, 8...|$|E
40|$|In brane-world {{theory in}} five dimensions, the bulk metric is usually written in <b>gaussian</b> <b>coordinates,</b> where g 4 µ = 0 and g 44 = − 1. However, the choice g 44 = − 1 is not mandatory. The {{presence}} of {{matter in the}} brane can generate temporal and spatial variations of g 44, which in turn backreact on the brane. In this paper we study the consequences of having g 44 = ǫΦ 2, where ǫ = ± 1 and Φ is a scalar function, not a constant. This extra field induces new features in the four-dimensional picture. Firstly, {{we find that the}} variable scalar field Φ demands the variation of {{at least two of the}} fundamental parameters in the theory, which are the vacuum energy λ, the gravitational coupling G and the cosmological term Λ (4). These variations are different from those predicted in scalar-tensor and multidimensional theories. Secondly, the conserved energy-momentum tensor on the brane represents a mixture of two fluids, a perfect fluid, with effective energy density Φρ and effective pressure Φp, and a vacuum fluid ρv = −pv = −Φλ. This interpretation is independent of any particular assumption regarding the variation of λ, G and/or Λ (4). Also, we show that the construction of realistic astrophysical and cosmological models, of perfect fluid with inhomogeneous energy density, does not necessarily require a departure from an exact AdS 5 bulk. This departure can be avoided if we demand Φ to be spatially inhomogeneous. Finally we present a simple model that illustrates different physical scenarios for the variation of λ, G and Λ (4) within the context of brane-world theory...|$|E
