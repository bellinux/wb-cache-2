500|$|Leicester—a widower since 1560—had {{for many}} years been in hope of marrying Elizabeth herself, [...] "for whose sake he had {{hitherto}} <b>forborne</b> marriage", as he confessed to Lord North. He also feared Elizabeth's reaction and insisted that his marriage be kept a secret. It did not remain one for long, the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau, reporting it only two months later. When the Queen was told of the marriage the next year, she banished Lettice Dudley permanently from court; she never forgave her cousin, nor could she ever accept the marriage. Even Lady Leicester's movements through London were resented by the Queen, let alone summer visits to Kenilworth by husband and wife.|$|E
60|$|SIR JOHN. What in God's name is your idea? We've <b>forborne</b> long enough, in all conscience.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always {{seeing her}} and {{you with this}} hallowed light about you, I have <b>forborne,</b> and <b>forborne,</b> {{as long as it}} was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch your history with {{something}} not quite so good as itself. But I love her. Heaven is my witness that I love her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Under some circumstances, yes," [...] he agreed. [...] "In our case, however, {{there is}} a certain {{consideration}} upon which I have <b>forborne</b> to touch--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 8 In the {{original}} “had, or had not.” These last words, as involving [...] a subtlety foreign to our present purpose, I have <b>forborne</b> to quote.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Major,' returns Mr Dombey, 'I am obliged. I shall {{put myself}} in your hands when the time comes. The time not being come, I have <b>forborne</b> to speak to you.' ...|$|E
60|$|If I have {{described}} {{life as a}} flux of moods, I must now add that there is that in us which changes not and which ranks all sensations and states of mind. The consciousness in each man is a sliding scale, which identifies him now with the First Cause, and now with the flesh of his body; life above life, in infinite degrees. The sentiment from which it sprung determines the dignity of any deed, and the question ever is, not {{what you have done}} or <b>forborne,</b> but at whose command you have done or <b>forborne</b> it.|$|E
60|$|She stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, {{her eyes}} fixed upon his {{as if she}} would read his very soul. Her hand was on the bell, but she had <b>forborne</b> to ring it.|$|E
6000|$|The cold moon hangs {{to the sky}} by its horn, [...] And centres its gaze on me; The stars, like eyes in reverie, Their westering as for a while <b>forborne,</b> [...] Quiz {{downward}} curiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "So please you, my liege, I would but demand {{wherefore}} he has {{for years}} <b>forborne</b> to take the life he aimed at, when {{it was in his}} power--nay, when it must have been lost but for his seemingly faithful service?" ...|$|E
60|$|Julius had not {{anticipated}} that sh e would approach, {{of her own}} accord, the painful subject on which he had himself <b>forborne</b> to touch. He was a little disappointed. He had expected more delicacy of feeling from her than she had shown.|$|E
60|$|As I {{had long}} <b>forborne</b> to {{encourage}} him with hopes that hung on threads, I made no other comment on this information than that I supposed he would see her soon. Such speculations as it engendered within me I kept to myself, and those were faint enough.|$|E
60|$|It was, indeed, {{only the}} relics and embers {{of the fight}} which {{continued}} to burn; for of the few knights who still continued in the lists, the greater part had, by tacit consent, <b>forborne</b> the conflict for some time, leaving it {{to be determined by}} the strife of the leaders.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] said Ravenswood, {{raising his}} head peevishly, [...] "you had <b>forborne</b> so early a jest, Mr. Hayston; {{it is really}} no {{pleasure}} to lose the very short repose which I {{had just begun to}} enjoy, after a night spent in thoughts upon fortune far harder than my couch, Bucklaw." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, as Gabriel {{sat down}} to his supper he was still haunted by the ominous advice and counsel he had heard that day. When Olly had {{finished}} her meal, he noticed that she had <b>forborne,</b> evidently at great personal sacrifice, to sop the frying-pan with her bread. He turned to her gravely-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{all public}} feasting, and {{particularly}} {{by the companies}} of this city, and dinners at taverns, ale-houses, and other places of common entertainment, be <b>forborne</b> till further order and allowance; and that the money thereby spared be preserved and employed for the benefit and relief of the poor visited with the infection.|$|E
6000|$|I'll tell, {{that if they}} be not glad, [...] They yet may envy me; [...] But then if I grow jealous mad, [...] 10 [...] And of them pitied be, [...] It were {{a plague}} 'bove scorn, [...] And yet it cannot be <b>forborne,</b> [...] Unless my heart would, as my thought, be torn.|$|E
60|$|Upon being apprized, that I had willfully <b>forborne</b> {{taking the}} grand tour with a tutor, {{in order to}} put my hand in a tar-bucket, the {{handsome}} captain looked ten times more funny than ever; and said that he himself would be my tutor, and take me on my travels, and pay for the privilege.|$|E
6000|$|That {{all public}} feasting, and {{particularly}} by the companies[90] of [...] this city, and dinners in taverns, alehouses, {{and other places}} of [...] public entertainment, be <b>forborne</b> till further order and allowance, [...] and that the money thereby spared be preserved, and employed for [...] the benefit and relief of the poor visited with the infection.|$|E
60|$|Some {{things the}} Judge had <b>forborne</b> to mention, {{and for this}} Virginia was thankful. One was the piano. But she had overheard Shadrach telling old Nancy how Mrs. Brice had pleaded with him to move it, {{that he might have}} more room and air. He had been obdurate. And Colonel Carvel's name had never once passed his lips.|$|E
60|$|They had not <b>forborne</b> {{to talk of}} Philip de Mountford's death; {{they would}} not have {{admitted}} that there was anything there that could not be discussed with perfect indifference--she, reclining against the cushions, and he in immaculate morning coat, with hair smoothly brushed, and speckless tie and linen, talking of things which meant life or death for them both.|$|E
6000|$|Dear Mother,-I {{have been}} so much {{occupied}} since my departure from [...] England, that till I could address you at length I have <b>forborne</b> [...] writing altogether. As I have now passed through Portugal, and a [...] considerable part of Spain, and have leisure at this place, I shall [...] endeavour {{to give you a}} short detail of my movements.|$|E
60|$|I am {{pressed by}} the Missouri members of Congress to give General Schofield {{independent}} command in Missouri. They insist that {{for want of}} this their local troubles gradually grow worse. I have <b>forborne,</b> so far, for fear of interfering with and embarrassing your operations. Please answer telling me whether anything, and what, I can do for them without injuriously interfering with you.|$|E
60|$|Point Vancouver {{is about}} one hundred miles from Astoria. Here the reflux of the tide ceases to be perceptible. To this place vessels of two and three hundred tons burden may ascend. The party {{under the command of}} Mr. Stuart had been three or four days in {{reaching}} it, though we have <b>forborne</b> to notice their daily progress and nightly encampments.|$|E
60|$|Yet so far Uncle John, in {{planning}} for the winter, had not mentioned California as even a remote possibility. It was understood he would go somewhere, but up to {{the moment when he}} declared “we will be out of it, of course, when the bad weather sets in,” he had kept his own counsel and <b>forborne</b> to express a preference or a decision.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] Hewson returned, for he {{had caught}} sight of the girl in a distant group, on his way up to Mrs. Rock, but in view of the {{affluent}} opportunity before him had richly <b>forborne</b> trying even to make her bow to him, though he believed she had seen him. [...] "I am to have the happiness of going out with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And joy go with you," [...] {{said the}} falconer, [...] "though {{it is likely}} you may find the old monks in some sorrow; they say the commons are {{threatening}} to turn {{them out of their}} cells, and make a devil's mass of it in the old church, thinking they have <b>forborne</b> that sport too long; and troth I am clear of the same opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fellow," [...] {{said the}} duke, [...] "I have <b>forborne</b> to chide {{you for your}} slowness. Cross me not, therefore. I trust my hand and arm, for all that I be crooked. Ye were {{backward}} when the trumpet sounded: and ye are now too forward with your counsels. But it is ever so; last with the lance and first with the tongue. Let it be reversed." ...|$|E
60|$|How such a {{large house}} came to have only three people living in it, was its own affair. There were at least a score of windows in its high roof alone; how many in its {{grotesque}} front, I soon gave up counting. The owner was a shopkeeper, by name Straudenheim; by trade--I couldn't make out what by trade, for he had <b>forborne</b> to write that up, and his shop was shut.|$|E
60|$|On one {{of those}} ugly nights, which we have faintly hinted at, but <b>forborne</b> to picture forth, the {{minister}} started from his chair. A new thought had struck him. There might be a moment's peace in it. Attiring himself with as much care {{as if it had}} been for public worship, and precisely in the same manner, he stole softly down the staircase, undid the door, and issued forth.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, Belle. I {{know all}} about your affair with Edward Cossey. I have proofs of it, but I have <b>forborne</b> to use them, because I saw {{that in the end}} he would weary of you and desert you for some other woman, and that would be my best revenge upon you. You have all along been nothing but his toy, the light woman with whom he amused his leisure hours." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{should say}} that Mr. Sturge in his family has for many years conscientiously <b>forborne</b> {{the use of any}} article {{produced}} by slave labor. I could scarcely believe it possible that there could be such an abundance and variety of all that is comfortable and desirable in the various departments of household living within these limits. Mr. Sturge presents the subject with very great force, the more so from the consistency of his example.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot tell. He {{certainly}} did not go away immediately after the settlement of accounts, {{but it has not}} been possible to us to keep up a knowledge of his movements, or something might have turned up to justify Edward. Oh, {{what it is to be}} helpless women! You are the very first person, Colin, who has not looked at me pityingly, like a creature to be <b>forborne</b> with an undeniable delusion!" ...|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding {{the reality}} and the warmth of those sentiments, his Britannic Majesty has {{hitherto}} <b>forborne</b> in any manner {{to take part in}} their affairs, in hopes that the common interest of king and subjects would render all parties sensible of the necessity of settling their government and their freedom upon principles of moderation, as the only means of securing permanence to both those blessings, as well as internal and external tranquillity to the kingdom of France, and to all Europe.|$|E
60|$|To one who {{had been}} tossing on a restless bed so long, even these few green leaves and this {{tranquil}} light, although it languished among chimneys and house-tops, were pleasant things. They suggested quiet places afar off, and rest, and peace. The child thought, more than once that he was moved: and had <b>forborne</b> to speak. But now he shed tears--tears that it lightened her aching heart to see--and making as though he would fall upon his knees, besought her to forgive him.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is too much, reverend sir," [...] {{said the}} Lady of Avenel, greatly offended. [...] "You have been long our guest, and have {{received}} from the Knight of Avenel and myself that honour and regard which your character and profession so justly demand. But I am yet to learn that we have at any time authorized your interference in our family arrangements, or placed you as a judge of our conduct towards each other. I pray this may be <b>forborne</b> in future." ...|$|E
