25|$|The {{systems in}} the table below are {{partially}} ordered by inclusion, in the sense that, if all the theorems of system A are also theorems of system B, but the converse is not necessarily true, then B includes A. The resulting <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagram</b> {{is similar to that}} in , and Fig. 3.2 in Casati and Varzi (1999: 48).|$|E
25|$|A <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagram</b> is {{a simple}} picture of a finite {{partially}} ordered set, forming a drawing of the partial order's transitive reduction. Concretely, one represents each element of the set as a vertex on the page and draws a line segment or curve that goes upward from x to y precisely when x < y {{and there is no}} z such that x < z < y. In this case, we say y covers x, or y is an immediate successor of x. In a <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagram,</b> it is required that the curves be drawn so that each meets exactly two vertices: its two endpoints. Any such diagram (given that the vertices are labeled) uniquely determines a partial order, and any partial order has a unique transitive reduction, but there are many possible placements of elements in the plane, resulting in different Hasse diagrams for a given order that may have widely varying appearances.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagram</b> of {{the face}} lattice of an n-simplex is {{isomorphic}} to the graph of the (n+1)-hypercube's edges, with the hypercube's vertices mapping {{to each of the}} n-simplex's elements, including the entire simplex and the null polytope as the extreme points of the lattice (mapped to two opposite vertices on the hypercube). This fact may be used to efficiently enumerate the simplex's face lattice, since more general face lattice enumeration algorithms are more computationally expensive.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{are named}} after Helmut Hasse (1898-1979); {{according}} to , {{they are so}} called because of the effective use Hasse made of them. However, Hasse {{was not the first}} to use these diagrams. One example that predates Hasse can be found in [...] Although <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> were originally devised as a technique for making drawings of partially ordered sets by hand, they have more recently been created automatically using graph drawing techniques.|$|R
25|$|Hasse {{diagrams}} can visually {{represent the}} elements and relations of a partial ordering. These are graph drawings where the vertices are {{the elements of}} the poset and the ordering relation is indicated by both the edges and the relative positioning of the vertices. Orders are drawn bottom-up: if an element x is smaller than (precedes) y then there exists a path from x to y that is directed upwards. It is often necessary for the edges connecting elements to cross each other, but elements must never be located within an edge. An instructive exercise is to draw the <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagram</b> for the set of natural numbers that are smaller than or equal to 13, ordered by | (the divides relation).|$|E
500|$|If a DAG [...] has a {{reachability}} relation {{described by}} the partial order , then the transitive reduction of [...] is a subgraph of [...] that has an edge [...] for every pair in the covering relation of [...] Transitive reductions are useful in visualizing the partial orders they represent, because they have fewer edges than other graphs representing the same orders and therefore lead to simpler graph drawings. A <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagram</b> of a partial order is a drawing of the transitive reduction in which the orientation of each edge is shown by placing the starting vertex of the edge in a lower position than its ending vertex.|$|E
2500|$|Graded posets play an {{important}} role in [...] combinatorics and can be visualized by means of a <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagram.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{numbering}} {{comes about}} because as one {{moves down the}} table from row to row only one variable at a time changes its value. Gray code is derived from this notion. This notion can be extended to three and four-dimensional hypercubes called <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> where each corner's variables change only {{one at a time}} as one moves {{around the edges of the}} cube. <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> (hypercubes) flattened into two dimensions are either Veitch diagrams or Karnaugh maps (these are virtually the same thing).|$|R
40|$|One {{introduces}} {{here the}} natural join P Q of graded posets and with correspondingly maximal and minimal sets being identical as expressed by ordinal sum P⊕ Q {{apart from other}} definition and due to that one arrives at a simple proof of the Möbius function formula for cobweb posets. We also quote the other authors explicit formulas for the zeta matrix and its inverse for any graded posets with the finite set of minimal elements from earlier works of the author. These formulas {{are based on the}} formulas for cobweb posets and their <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> or graphs named KoDAGs which are interpreted as chains of binary complete or universal relations joined by the natural join operation. Natural join of two independent sets is therefore the ordinal sum of this trivially ordered posets represented also by directed biclique named dibiclique and correspondingly by their <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> or graphs named KoDAGs. Such cobweb posets and equivalently their <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> or graphs named KoDAGs are also encoded by discrete hyper-boxes and the natural join operation of such discrete hyper boxes is just cartesian product of them accompanied with projection out of common faces. All graded posets with no mute vertices in their <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> which means that no vertex has indegree or outdegree equal zero are natural join of chain of relations and may be at the same time interpreted an n-ary relation, n ∈ N ∪{∞}.

40|$|Concept lattices {{built with}} Formal Concept Analysis are usually {{represented}} by <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> illustrating the groupings of objects described by common attributes. <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagrams</b> display {{the relations of}} partial order between concepts in a hierarchical fashion, where each concept may have several parent concepts. Lattice visualization becomes a problem {{as the number of}} clusters grows significantly with the number of objects and attributes. Interpreting the lattice through a direct visualization of the line diagram rapidly becomes impossible and more synthetic representations are needed. In this work we propose several methods to enhance the readability of concept lattices firstly though colouring and distortion techniques, and secondly by extracting and visualizing trees derived from concept lattices structures...|$|R
2500|$|In the {{previous}} definitions, we often {{noted that a}} concept can be defined by just inverting the ordering in a former definition. This {{is the case for}} [...] "least" [...] and [...] "greatest", for [...] "minimal" [...] and [...] "maximal", for [...] "upper bound" [...] and [...] "lower bound", and so on. This is a general situation in order theory: A given order can be inverted by just exchanging its direction, pictorially flipping the <b>Hasse</b> <b>diagram</b> top-down. This yields the so-called dual, inverse, or opposite order.|$|E

5000|$|If a {{partially}} ordered set is finite, its covering relation is the transitive reduction of the partial order relation.
