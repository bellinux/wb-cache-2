25|$|While foraging, army ants cause many {{invertebrates}} to {{flee from}} their hiding places under {{leaves of the}} forest floor, under tree bark, and other such locations, thereby allowing predators to catch them more easily. For example, in the tropical rainforests of Panama, swarms of army ants attract many species of birds to this feast of scrambling insects, spiders, scorpions, worms, and other animals. Some of these birds are named “antbirds” due to this tendency. While focused on feeding on these invertebrates, birds at army-ant swarms typically allow very close approach by people—within 1 or 2 meters in many cases—often providing the best opportunities to see many of these species. Depending {{on the size of}} the ant swarm and the amount of prey the ants stir up, birds can number from a few to dozens of individuals. Birds that frequent army-ant swarms include the white-whiskered puffbird, rufous motmot, rufous-vented ground cuckoo, gray-necked wood rail, plain-brown woodcreeper, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, <b>fasciated</b> <b>antshrike,</b> black-crowned antshrike, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced antthrush, and gray-headed tanager.|$|E

50|$|The {{species is}} very {{closely related to}} the bamboo antshrike, and the two have {{previously}} been considered to be the same species. As the entire range of that species is shared with the <b>fasciated</b> <b>antshrike,</b> however, the two are now treated as two species. The <b>fasciated</b> <b>antshrike</b> has three subspecies, ' the nominate subspecies, C. l. lineatus , C. l. fasciatus (Ridgway, 1884) and C. l. intermedius (Hartert & Goodson, 1917).|$|E
50|$|The <b>fasciated</b> <b>antshrike</b> (Cymbilaimus lineatus) is {{a species}} of bird in the antbird family Thamnophilidae. The species is found in Central and Southern America.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>fasciated</b> <b>antshrike</b> {{feeds on}} large insects and other prey in the mid-story, from 5 - 20 m off the ground. It {{particularly}} feeds on vine clusters and near tree trunks, {{but will also}} {{come down to the}} forest floor on occasion. Insects taken include grasshoppers, bugs, beetles and caterpillars, as well as spiders and even lizards, amphibians and occasionally fruit. They will join mixed species feeding flocks with antwrens and foliage-gleaners that pass through their territories, and will also follow army ants to take prey flushed by them, but they are not obligate ant-followers.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is found}} from eastern Honduras down to Colombia, the Amazon Basin and the Guyanas. Its natural habitat {{tropical}} moist lowland forests, in tangled and dense vegetation in the mid-story of the forest. It {{is more common}} in secondary forest in Central America. It is usually found below 800 m and rarely up to 1600 m [...] Where its range overlaps with that of the bamboo antshrike it is found at lower elevations than that species.==Description== The <b>fasciated</b> <b>antshrike</b> is a large antbird, 17 to(-) 18 cm long and weighing 35 - 40 g. The plumage varies by sex (sexual dimorphism), with the male being black with white barring across the whole body. The barring is very faint on the crown and becomes more even further down the body. The crown is rufous on the female, {{and the rest of the}} body is brown bared with faint yellow-brown, become yellow-brown barred with brown further down the body. The bill is large and hooked.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is popular}} with birdwatchers {{due to its}} {{abundance}} of bird species; some 525 bird species are found here. Pipeline Road extends for 17.5 km north-south through the park and passes through old-growth and secondary forest. Pipeline Road {{is one of the}} best places to see tropical birds in the Americas, with a bird species list exceeding 400. Birds regularly seen along Pipeline Road include double-toothed kite, slaty-backed forest-falcon, orange-chinned parakeet, brown-hooded parrot, blue-headed parrot, red-lored parrot, squirrel cuckoo, white-necked jacobin, violet-bellied hummingbird, crowned woodnymph, blue-chested hummingbird, white-tailed trogon, gartered trogon, black-throated trogon, black-tailed trogon, slaty-tailed trogon, black-mandibled toucan, keel-billed toucan, collared aracari, black-cheeked woodpecker, cinnamon woodpecker, crimson-crested woodpecker, white-whiskered puffbird, broad-billed motmot, rufous motmot, northern barred woodcreeper, cocoa woodcreeper, black-striped woodcreeper, <b>fasciated</b> <b>antshrike,</b> black-crowned antshrike, checker-throated antwren, dot-winged antwren, white-flanked antwren, spotted antbird, bicolored antbird, ocellated antbird, chestnut-backed antbird, black-faced antthrush, southern bentbill, brownish twistwing, olivaceous flatbill, ruddy-tailed flycatcher, bright-rumped attila, purple-throated fruitcrow, red-capped manakin, blue-crowned manakin, golden-collared manakin, bay wren, song wren, gray-headed tanager, white-shouldered tanager, red-throated ant-tanager, blue-black grosbeak, scarlet-rumped cacique, and yellow-rumped cacique.|$|E
