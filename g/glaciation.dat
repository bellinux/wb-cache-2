40|$|The Neoproterozoic glacial {{intervals}} represent one of {{the most}} curious expressions of Earth’s climate. Despite the popularity of the hard “Snowball” hypothesis in the popular press, the scientific community remains divided over the extent of the Neoproterozoic <b>glaciations,</b> the age of the <b>glaciations,</b> the number of glacial events and the triggering mechanism for the <b>glaciations.</b> A major, and yet unresolved issue, is knowledge of the exact paleogeography during the so-called Sturtian and younger Vendian <b>glaciations.</b> The problem stems from the paucity of the Neoproterozoic paleomagnetic database, in particular the interval from 600 - 720 Ma along with the varied interpretations of those data. Here we present 4 scenarios for the paleogeographic setting in the Neoproterozoic. The first two paleogeographies are thought to be representative of the Sturtian (700 - 800 Ma) <b>glaciations</b> and the younger reconstructions represent possible extremes for the Vendian glacial events. The paleogeographies presented here have important implications for the posited triggering mechanisms for the Neoproterozoic glacials...|$|R
25|$|<b>Glaciations</b> in East Africa are {{associated}} with a colder, drier climate when the precipitation is less, but the extra temperature drop means any solid precipitation stays.

5|$|Like {{several other}} volcanoes in {{northern}} British Columbia, Level Mountain was volcanically active during past glacial periods. Its involvement with <b>glaciation</b> resulted in several interactions between magma and ice, affording multiple examples of glaciovolcanic processes. Evidence for contemporaneous volcanism and <b>glaciation</b> is widespread throughout the massif. This includes interlayered unconsolidated fluvioglacial and tuffaceous deposits, tills and glacial erratics {{at the base}} of tuffs and lava flows, lahars composed of till and agglomerate, tuyas on the uppermost surface of the shield and as outliers, till cemented by siliceous sinter and the presence of freshwater pillow basalts and volcano-glacial tuff breccias. It is possible that geothermal outputs at Level Mountain had an influence on dynamics of past ice sheets much like the modern Grímsvötn caldera is an important heat source beneath Vatnajökull in Iceland. However, like other large NCVP volcanoes, much of Level Mountain was formed prior to <b>glaciation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea is {{the only}} Hawaiian volcano with {{distinct}} evidence of <b>glaciation.</b> Similar deposits probably existed on Mauna Loa, but have been covered by later lava flows. Despite Hawaii's tropical location, during several past ice ages a drop of only a degree in temperature allowed snow to remain at the mountain's summit through summer, triggering {{the formation of an}} ice cap. There are three episodes of <b>glaciation</b> that have been recorded from the last 180,000 years: the Pōhakuloa (180–130ka), Wāihu (80–60ka) and Mākanaka (40–13ka) series. These have extensively sculpted the summit, depositing moraines and a circular ring of till and gravel along the mountain's upper flanks. Subglacial eruptions built cinder cones during the Mākanaka <b>glaciation,</b> most of which were heavily gouged by glacial action. The most recent cones were built between 9000 and 4500 years ago, atop the glacial deposits, although one study indicates that the last eruption may have been around 3600 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Mount Bailey {{is part of}} the High Cascades in {{the western}} United States. The High Cascades have long been glaciated, by both Pacific-bred storms and natural, elevation-caused, <b>glaciation.</b> In fact, <b>glaciation</b> {{probably}} formed on them as early as the late Miocene. Over time, as the range built up, newer activity diminished older Tertiary age rock. Creating lava plateaus, Pliocene activity, mostly basaltic and andesitic, was probably responsible for the original cones at Bailey, Thielsen, and Union Peak.|$|E

30|$|Because the {{evidence}} of past <b>glaciations</b> were also found in southeastern PNG (Hastenrath 2009), more volcanic materials from the volcanic arc (Papuan Peninsula) should {{be brought into the}} sea by <b>glaciations</b> in glacial periods. The signal related to the increased volcanic materials, i.e., the peaks in the χ record (Fig.  5 b), is therefore thought to be the effect caused by stronger <b>glaciations</b> in colder glacial periods (MIS 8, MIS 7.4, and MIS 6). Also the result from the 230 Th-nomalized analysis of the core shows that the terrestrial input caused by rainfall and river runoff from the Papuan Peninsula would increase during cold periods (Shiau et al. 2012). We could therefore roughly deduce that the volcanic materials, eroded by stronger <b>glaciations</b> from the Papuan Peninsula, would increase and imported to the sea by rainfall and glacial meltwaters in colder glacial periods, MIS 8, MIS 7.4, and MIS 6.|$|R
40|$|Abstract：The {{timing and}} extent of <b>glaciations</b> during the Late Quaternary in the South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica were defined using field mapping, geomorphic {{analysis}} and radiocarbon dating. Landforms of glacial erosion and deposition, in particular subglacial meltwater channel erosion, suggest that at least three <b>glaciations</b> occurred during the late Quaternary within the study region. During the global LGM, glacial troughs (such as Maxwell Bay and Admiralty Bay) were overdeepened by an ice stream moving south from an~ 1000 m-thick ice cap centered on the present-day continental shelf to the north. This ice {{was responsible for the}} subglacial meltwater channel erosion, and glacial polished and striated bedrock on the Fildes Peninsula. The recent local <b>glaciations</b> occurred about 2, 000 years ago and during Little Ice Age (LIA). During these <b>glaciations,</b> glaciers were less extensive than the previous one and less erosive as a cold-based ice...|$|R
5|$|The Rainy Lobe of the Wisconsin <b>glaciation</b> was {{the most}} recent of the <b>glaciation</b> events, and it retreated about 10,000years ago. Glacial {{scratches}} and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east-of-north glacial movement. This direction is transverse to the general trend on the valleys and ridges. The lakes in the Rove Formation area are unique from other well-known linear bedrock lakes in North America because their long axes lie transverse to the general movement of the glaciers.|$|E
