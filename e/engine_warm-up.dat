2500|$|Since the Euro 3 {{regulations}} in 2000, performance has been measured using the New European Driving Cycle test (NEDC; {{also known as}} MVEG-B), with a [...] "cold start" [...] procedure that eliminates {{the use of a}} 40-second <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up</b> period found in the ECE+EUDC test cycle (also known as MVEG-A).|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in 2009 as a 2010 {{model year}} vehicle, the RX 450h (GLV10/GLV15) premiered {{alongside}} its non-hybrid counterpart, the RX 350. Manufacturer's specifications indicated largely identical outward dimensions for the RX 450h with the RX 350. The RX 450h {{was scheduled to}} go on sale in the U.S. in mid to late 2009, with sales introductions for the RX 450h in Asia (including Japan) and Europe in the same year. The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5L 2GR-FXE V6 engine (shared with the RX 350) which produces [...] at 6000 rpm, along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to [...] (with the electric motors providing an added [...] ). The new inverter is 8kg lighter, and more efficient. Up to three electric motors {{are used in the}} hybrid system, including two dual motors for the forward wheels (123kW output), and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model (50kW; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly). The RX 450h's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency. Compared to the prior Otto cycle system, the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio, along with higher expansion ratio inside engine cylinders. This system uses less energy to form fuel-air mixtures, and releases more energy. A lighter, more free-flowing oil (0W-20) is also used, reducing friction energy loss and oil pump power requirements. Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain, an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up</b> periods (optimizing engine start-stop times, particularly in cold conditions), and a cooled exhaust gas-recirculation system to reduce fuel pumping loss. The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling {{on both sides of the}} high-current transistors, allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} shorten the {{launching}} process and {{eliminate the need for}} time-consuming <b>engine</b> <b>warm-ups,</b> the Seirans were to be catapulted from a cold start. This necessitated heating the engine oil for each plane to approximately [...] in a separate chamber and pumping it, as well as hot water, through the engine just prior to launch while the planes were still in the hangar. In this way, the aircraft's engine would be at or near normal operating temperature immediately upon getting airborne. The idea was borrowed from the Germans who planned on using a similar launch method for the aircraft of their unfinished carrier Graf Zeppelin.|$|R
50|$|To {{facilitate}} rapid catapult launches {{and eliminate}} the necessity of time-consuming <b>engine</b> <b>warm-ups,</b> up to eight aircraft were {{to be kept in}} readiness aboard the German carriers on their hangar decks by the use of steam pre-heaters. These would keep the aircraft engines at an operational temperature of 70 C. In addition, engine oil was to be kept warmed in separate holding tanks, then added via hand-pumps to the aircraft engines shortly before launch. Once the aircraft were raised to flight deck level via the elevators, aircraft oil temperature could be maintained, if need be, through the use of electric pre-heaters plugged into power points on the flight deck. Otherwise, the aircraft could have been immediately catapult-launched as their engines would already have been at or near normal operating temperature.|$|R
40|$|A {{waste heat}} {{recovery}} system (WHRS) is very well known to provide no advantage during the cold start driving cycles, such as the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), which are used for certification of emissions and assessment of fuel economy. Here, we propose a novel integrated WHRS using the internal combustion engine (ICE) coolant passages and an exchanger on the exhaust working as pre-heater / boiler / super-heater of a Rankine cycle. The expander is connected to an electric generator unit (GU), and the pump is connected to an electric motor unit (MU). The vehicle is also fitted with an electric, kinetic energy recovery system (KERS). The expander and condenser are bypassed during {{the first part of the}} NEDC when the vehicle covers the four ECE- 15 (Economic Commission for Europe - 15) - UDC (Urban Drive Cycle) segments where the <b>engine</b> <b>warms-up.</b>   Only after the engine is fully warmed up, during the last part of the NEDC, the extra urban driving cycle (EUDC) segment, the expander and condenser are activated to recover part of the coolant and exhaust energy. </p...|$|R

50|$|Research in the 1920s {{showed that}} {{cylinder}} wear was aggravated by condensation of fuel when it contacted a cool cylinder wall which removed the oil film. The {{development of the}} automatic thermostat in the 1930s solved this problem by ensuring fast <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of the exhaust manifold in the engine cylinder head has received considerable attention in recent years for automotive gasoline engines, due to the proven benefits in: engine weight diminution, cost saving, reduced power enrichment, quicker <b>engine</b> and aftertreatment <b>warm-up,</b> improved packaging and simplification of the turbocharger installation. This design practice is still largely unknown in diesel engines because of the greater difficulties, caused by the more complex cylinder head layout, and the expected lower benefits, due {{to the absence of}} high-load enrichment. However, the need for improved engine thermomanagement and a quicker catalytic converter warm-up in efficient Euro 6 diesel engines is posing new challenges that an integrated exhaust manifold architecture could effectively address. A recently developed General Motors 1. 6 L Euro 6 diesel engine has been modified so that the intake and exhaust manifolds are integrated in the cylinder head. Extensive CAD/CAE/CAM analyses have been employed in order to guide the design of the overall surface and the water cooling jacket that surround the exhaust manifold of the new engine version, and thus to be able to improve the low-frequency thermal fatigue resistance of the head. The thus obtained prototype engine head has been tested on a highly-dynamic test bench at the Politecnico di Torino in order to characterize performance, emissions and thermal behavior in comparison to the baseline production engine. The results have generally been very promising and have shown the possibility of maintaining the same performance rating over the overall engine speed range as well as comparable emissions and brake specific fuel consumption in steady-state conditions. Furthermore, appreciably faster <b>engine</b> and aftertreatment <b>warm-up</b> have been recorded due to the higher heat fraction that is transferred to the coolant and to the more favorable exhaust gas enthalpy management. The latter benefit is in fact very interesting as far as the control of HC and CO emissions within the NEDC homologation is concerne...|$|R
2500|$|All Mazda-made Wankel rotaries, {{including}} the Renesis {{found in the}} RX-8, burn a small quantity of oil by design, metered into the combustion chamber to preserve the apex seals. Owners must periodically add small amounts of oil, thereby increasing running costs. Some sources, such as rotaryeng.net, claim that better results come {{with the use of}} an oil-in-fuel mixture rather than an oil metering pump. Liquid-cooled engines require a mineral multigrade oil for cold starts, and Wankel <b>engines</b> need a <b>warm-up</b> time before full load operation as reciprocating engines do. All engines exhibit oil loss, but the rotary engine is engineered with a sealed motor, unlike a piston engine that has a film of oil that splashes {{on the walls of the}} cylinder to lubricate them, hence an oil [...] "control" [...] ring. No-oil-loss engines have been developed, eliminating much of the oil lubrication problem.|$|R
40|$|Engine exhaust {{emission}} and fuel consumption during warm-up period was experimentally investigated.

In order to simulate engine operation condition during warm - up period under various ambient temperatures axillaries cooling water and cooling air systems were designed and coupled to the engine being tested. Results show that as the ambient temperature increases the concentration of both hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide and fuel consumption decreases while the carbon dioxide increases. Also, the time required for the <b>engine</b> to fully <b>warm-up</b> is shortened. Moreover, operating the engine when equipped with EIS has a greater effect on HC, CO and fuel consumption reduction compared to when equipped with CIS at the same operation conditions...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis report {{describes}} {{the development of}} a physically based model which can predict the coolant temperature of an internal combustion <b>engine</b> during its <b>warm-up</b> phase. The model is used to detect if the thermostat in the cooling system is functioning correctly which is a requirement for present day On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD II). The model uses information available within the Engine Control Unit (ECU) and needs little calibration work. Thereby, the model can easily be extended with extra features to remain applicable with future power train applications. The temperature prediction capability has been tested for steady state conditions as well as for ”real-world” driving and regulated driving cycles, thereby the model has been tested on a vehicle with a start-stop system. The model includes a diagnostic function which is performed at the most accurate prediction of the model. The sensitivity of the temperature prediction to sensor input errors and varying parameters (like fuel quality) has been investigated in a sensitivity study. Finally, a threshold value is proposed for the diagnostic function by determining when an invalid faulty thermostat is detected or a faulty thermostat is not detected...|$|R
50|$|Several {{teams had}} made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Ferrari made changes to the 412T2 chassis's sidepods to improve airflow around the tyres, and reverted to a diffuser design used earlier in the season. The Ligier team had Martin Brundle's car fitted with power steering {{for the first time and}} he chose to use it for the race, but teammate Olivier Panis, who had run with the system earlier in the season, decided against it. McLaren revised its troubled MP4/10B chassis's suspension geometry, and Mika Häkkinen's car was equipped with a more powerful version of its Mercedes V10 <b>engine</b> for Sunday's <b>warm-up</b> session and the race itself. Team principal Ron Dennis also re-hired experienced designer Steve Nichols, who had worked for the outfit in the 1980s, in the week before the race. Footwork also arrived with revised suspension, whilst the Jordan team ran with brake disc sensors on its car. Further down the field, the Forti team introduced the revised version of its FG01 chassis for Roberto Moreno. Lead driver Pedro Diniz had first driven the car in its revised specification at the preceding French Grand Prix. The revised aerodynamic package included a higher nose and new sidepods. Both drivers also tested a new development of the Ford-Cosworth ED engine in practice.|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{limitations to}} both NOx and soot emissions have pushed engine researchers to rediscover gasoline engines. Among the many technologies and strategies, {{gasoline direct injection}} plays a key-role for improving fuel economy and engine performance. The paper aims to investigate an extremely complex task such as the idle operating engine condition when the engine runs at very low engine speeds and low engine loads and during the warm-up. Due to the low injection pressure and to the null contribution of the turbocharger, the engine condition {{is far from the}} standard points of investigation. Taking into account the <b>warm-up</b> <b>engine</b> condition, the analyses are performed with a temperature of the coolant of 50 °C. The paper reports part of a combined numerical and experimental synergic activity aiming at the understanding of the physics of spray/wall interaction within the combustion chamber and particular care is used for air/fuel mixing and the combustion process analyses. In order to properly describe the engine condition, different injection strategies are investigated. Late and early injection strategies are deeply analyzed and compared in terms of combustion stability and pollutant emissions. UV-visible imaging and spectral measurements are carried out in real engine with wide optical accesses… Measurements are performed in the optically accessible combustion chamber realized by modifying a real engine. The cylinder head was modified in order to allow in the fourth cylinder the visualization of the fuel injection and the combustion process with high spatial and temporal resolution. The 3 D-CFD engine simulations are reproduced by means the commercial code Star-CD. Due to the warm-up condition and the many physical sub-models a numerical methodology is implemented and particular care is used to boundaries conditions analyses. CFD analysis is used to find a possible explanation of the high cycle to cycle variability. The experimental and numerical comparisons, in terms fuel mixing and front flame propagation, give an explanation of the idle condition...|$|R
50|$|Also in 1941, Packard {{introduced}} the Electro-Matic clutch, {{which was a}} vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by {{the position of the}} accelerator.

40|$|As the {{legislation}} on vehicle emissions {{is becoming more}} and more stringent, increasing attention has been paid to the fine particles emitted by diesel and gasoline vehicles. The high number emission of fine particles has been shown to have a large impact on the atmospheric environment and human health. Researchers have shown that gasoline engines, especially Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engines, tend to emit large amounts of small size particles compared to Port Fuel Injection (PFI) gasoline engines and diesel engines fitted with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs). As a result, the particle number emissions of GDI engines will be restricted by the EU 6 legislation. The particulate emission level of GDI engines means that they would face some challenges in meeting the EU 6 requirement. This thesis undertakes research in the following area. Firstly, the filtration efficiencies of glass fibre filters were quantified using a Cambustion Differential Mobility Spectrometer 500 (DMS 500) to see if all of the particles from the sampled gas can be collected by the filters. Secondly, various valve timings and different injection modes such as double injection with a second injection after compression, single early injection and split early injection were implemented to measure the Particulate Matter (PM) emissions and combustion characteristics of a GDI <b>engine</b> under <b>warm-up</b> operating conditions. Thirdly, the techniques for removing volatile particles were investigated using a catalytic Volatile Particle Remover (VPR) and an Evaporation Tube (ET) with hot air dilution under various test conditions. The results show that for the glass fibre filters tested here, the transmission efficiencies of the particles are very low, indicating that PM sampling using fibre filters is an effective method of studying the particulate emissions from the engine. Particle number emissions using double injection with injection after compression were much higher than those with single injection during the intake stroke. Under 1200 rpm, 110 Nm cold engine operation, no reduction effect on PM emissions was shown by using split intake injection to further facilitate homogeneous mixture formation compared with single intake injection. Valve timings showed moderate effects on particulate emissions. Properly adjusted timing for exhaust valve closure led to reduced particulate emissions by a factor of about 2 and the combustion characteristics were not adversely affected much. The VPR temperature and exhaust residence time did not show much effect on the catalytic VPR performance once the mass flow rate of exhaust was above 0. 09 g/s. Generally, the transmission efficiencies of the VPR follow the trends of the scaled PMP counting efficiency specification. Hot air dilution is effective in reducing the small size particles. At 23 nm, the transmission efficiencies are within the error range of the PMP specification. The catalytic VPR and the Evaporation Tube were all found to be effective in reducing the particle number of small size (nucleation mode) particles. Both systems have some particle loss mainly due to the physical effects of diffusion and thermophoresis. Until now, GDI engines have not been optimised for reducing particulate emissions as the focus has been on gaseous emissions and fuel economy. With careful re-optimisation of the catalyst light-off and engine calibration (especially for transients) then there is scope for GDI engines to meet forthcoming emissions legislation. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R
40|$|Surface-mounted {{heat flux}} sensors {{have been used}} in the intake port of a fuel injected, spark {{ignition}} engine to investigate heat transfer between the surface, the gas flows through the port, and fuel deposited in surface films. This investigation has been carried out with a single-cylinder engine on which the cylinder head is from a production four valve per cylinder engine with a bifurcated intake port. The objective has been to establish how engine operating conditions affect trends in surface heat transfer rates both with and without fuel deposition on the surfaces, and to relate these to the mechanisms involved in the transport of fuel into the engine. The effects on these mechanisms of injector type and fuel characteristics have also been studied. Fuel transport has been characterised using the τ and X parameters, and experimental studies have been carried out to examine these for fully-warm and <b>warm-up</b> <b>engine</b> operating conditions, with a range of injector types representative of those currently used in service. This data has been compared to the results of a photographic study of the fuel distribution pattern produced by each injector type, and these combined results used to decide upon suitable positions within the inlet port for the heat flux sensors. The dynamic response characteristics of the surface-mounted heat flux sensors have been determined, and measured heat flux data corrected accordingly to account for these characteristics. Details of the model and data processing technique used, are described. Corrected intra-cycle variations of heat transfer to fuel deposited have been derived for engine operating conditions at 1000 RPM covering a range of manifold pressures, fuel supply rates, port surface temperatures, and fuel injection timings. Both pump-grade gasoline and isooctane fuel have been used. The influence on heat transfer rates of the deposited fuel and its subsequent behaviour has been examined by comparing fuel-wetted and dry-surface heat transfer measurements. With both fuel types, the heat transfer rate to the fuel reaches peak values up to around 50 kW/m 2 during the engine cycle, and is typically 5 kW/m 2 on average in regions of heavy fuel deposition. The effects of operating conditions on the magnitude and features of the heat flux variations are described Integration of this heat flux data has provided values of heat transfer per cycle, allowing direct comparisons of operating condition and injector type effects to be made. For dry-port conditions heat transfer per cycle varies between 0 and 300 J/m 2 depending on location, towards the surface at low temperatures and away from the surface at fully-warm conditions. During warm-ups with fuel deposition, as coolant temperature increases from 0 to 90 °C, values of heat transfer to the fuel typically increase from 300 J/m 2 to 1000 J/m 2. For a given coolant temperature, heat transfer values generally increase as manifold absolute pressure (MAP) is lowered or fuel flow rate increases. The effect of fuel deposition on heat transfer has been characterised by a function of MAP, fuel flow rate and coolant temperature. When running on isooctane fuel the heat transfer measurements were made using a heat flux gauge bonded to the intake port surface in the region where highest rates of fuel deposition occur. Heat transfer changes are consistent with trends predicted by convective mass transfer over much of the range of surface temperatures from 20 °C to 100 °C. Towards the upper temperature limit, heat transfer reaches a maximum limited by the rate and distribution of fuel deposition. The inferences drawn from the isooctane results are discussed and related to characteristics observed when gasoline is used...|$|R

50|$|The list of powertrains {{includes}} Ford's newest, {{most advanced}} engine: the 1.0-litre EcoBoost developed at Ford's Dunton Technical Center in the UK. The 1.0-litre, 3 cylinder, turbocharged, cast aluminium engine comes in two versions: 74 kW (101 PS; 99 hp) and 88 to 92 kW (120 to 125 PS; 118 to 123 hp), {{with the latter}} delivering a peak torque of 170 Nm (125 lb·ft) from 1,300-4,500 rpm and 200 Nm (148 lb·ft) on overboost. Ford's decision to use cast-iron for the engine block instead of aluminium improved <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up</b> time by 50 per cent. However, The 3-cylinder engine design causes inherent vibrations, which Ford overcame by incorporating a deliberately unbalanced flywheel. Employing the unbalanced flywheel conserves energy more efficiently than employing the more commonly used balance shafts to ensure smooth running. Additionally, an internal timing belt bathed in engine oil ensures longer life and even greater efficiency. Lastly, to reduce warm-up times and increase efficiency even further, Ford engineers cast the exhaust manifold into the cylinder head. The EcoBoost engine design is quite compact, with the entire engine block's height and width dimensions comparable to an A4 size sheet of paper. The EcoSport is available with this engine design in China, India and Europe, but not Brazil.

50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up</b> are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the block ribs and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|E

The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings. Its solid-lifter cam, known as the [...] "30-30 Duntov" [...] cam named after its /0.030 in hot intake/exhaust valve-lash and Zora Arkus-Duntov (the first Duntov cam was the / 1957 grind known as the '097, which referred to the last three digits of the casting number) the [...] "Father of the Corvette", was also used in the 1964-1965 carbureted 327/365 and fuel injected 327/375 engines. It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up.</b> Its single-point distributor had an ignition point cam designed to reduce point bounce at high rpm along with a vacuum diaphragm to advance ignition timing at idle and part-throttle for economy and emissions. Pulleys for the balancer, alternator, water-pump, as well as optional power-steering, were deep-groove to retain the drive belt(s) at high rpm. In 1969, the 302 shared the finned cast-aluminum valve covers with the LT-1 350 Corvette engine. Conservatively rated at [...] (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and [...] at 4800, actual output with its production 11:1 compression ratio was around [...] with [...] primary x 3.00 in secondary Sanderson tubular headers that came in the trunk when ordered with a 1967 Z/28, and associated carburetor main jet and ignition timing tuningneeded. In 1968, the last year for factory headers, they had [...] primaries x 3.00 in secondaries. A stock 1968 Z/28 with the close-ratio transmission, optional transistorized-ignition and 4.88 gear, fitted with little more than the factory cowl plenum cold-air hood induction and headers, was capable of running 12.9 second/ 1/4-mile times on street tires.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe work {{presents}} the results of experimental tests, which were carried out on a small-displacement spark ignition engine, where a low flow rate electric pump was used to substitute the standard crankshaft-driven one. The engine was then operated both under usual single-phase heat transfer regime and under nucleate boiling conditions. The engine was properly instrumented in order to record coolant pressure, temperature and flow rate as well as metal temperatures. The experimental investigation was coupled with the development of a dynamic lump-parameter model of the engine cooling system. The model calculates the spatial averaged metal temperature, the engine-out coolant temperature and the fraction of metal heat transfer area which is involved in nucleate boiling as a function of engine-in coolant flow rate, pressure and temperature, fuel mass flow rate and engine speed. The experimental data and the model results show a good agreement and the model is suitable to develop a coolant flow rate control system. This facilitates faster <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up,</b> lower fuel consumption and lower CO 2 emissions, which can be significant under low-load and cold-start conditions...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{diesel engines}} are being {{continuously}} developed {{in order to}} improve their specific output thus reducing the fuel consumption. This is in response to both increasingly stringent regulations and {{to the demands of the}} customer evolving. With this in mind a more detailed understanding of some of the fundamental processes within the engine are required. A prime example of one of these processes is heat transfer. In the region of 17 - 35 % of fuel energy will pass to the coolant, therefore the rate of heat transfer has a considerable effect on the design and function of the engine. This thesis describes a method to calculate heat transfer through a combustion chamber wall of a modern production engine and uses the data to improve the understanding of the impact of active thermal management systems on the rate of heat transfer and how this can be incorporated into empirical modelling, also improving fundamental understanding and evaluating established correlations focusing on the warm-up period. Development of prototype engines over extended test schedules can prove expensive, therefore in order to reduce the necessary test and development period of a new engine it is useful to be able to predict the heat transfer within the combustion chamber using modelling data. A large number of correlations have been developed over the years, however with the rate of development of the diesel engine; some of these correlations have been left behind. A number of steady state operating conditions were employed to approximate the New European Drive Cycle. By approximating the drive cycle performance it was possible to further the understanding of the effect of changing the engine operating conditions on the temperature distribution in key areas of the engine, including the crankshaft bearings, camshaft bearings and combustion chamber walls. The main focus of this thesis is the cylinder wall temperatures and the rate of heat transfer through the cylinder wall from the combustion gases. It was found that there was a temperature rise of 7 °C between the oil in the main oil gallery and that used to lubricate the journal bearings; however the oil in the camshaft bearings was found to decrease in temperature along the inlet camshaft but increase along the exhaust camshaft. In addition the temperature and heat transfer profiles were significantly different between the inlet and exhaust sides of the engine. Existing correlations were found to in general over-predict the gas side convective heat transfer coefficients at high power conditions. The accuracy of these correlations could be improved by 77. 6 % by modifying the correlation coefficients; however the introduction of a cylinder wall temperature component, in addition to modifying the correlation coefficients, led to an improvement in the correlation by a further 17. 4 %. Prototype hardware and a Design of Experiments (DoE) based test programme were used to investigate the impact of actively changing the external oil and coolant circuits during a New European Drive Cycle on the <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up.</b> It was found that the driving force for improved warm-up when throttling the engine coolant flow was the increase in the gas side wall temperature, and the reduction in the local coolant temperature. The coolant local to the combustion chamber wall was cooler as it remained isolated from the majority of the external cooling system. In addition, the low engine coolant flow retained the heat energy which had been transferred through the cylinder wall, within the engine structure. This unique approach of combining cylinder wall temperature measurements and active thermal management systems allowed for the fundamental heat transfer paths to be explained. The insight obtained during the steady state experiments and the transient tests was then used to evaluate the potential to calculate the convective heat transfer during different stages of the <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up.</b> A strong correlation, a R-squared of between 0. 77 and 0. 83, was found between the rate of energy transfer to coolant across the engine and the gas side convective heat transfer coefficient during early stages of the drive cycle, however this decayed as the engine warmed up. A correlation was also found between the convective heat transfer coefficient and the temperature used by the ECU for engine control, in this case measured in the cylinder head. The modified convective heat transfer correlation developed in this thesis allows for the gas side convective heat transfer coefficient to be estimated at different stages of the <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up</b> based on the average cylinder wall temperature. This was not possible with existing correlations and could significantly improve thermal modelling during <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up.</b> The findings of this thesis are relevant to engine designers, combustion simulation engineers and thermal management teams as 1 -D modelling will continue to play a significant role in the development process of internal combustion engines for the foreseeable future. This is primarily due to the cost implications of high performance computers for 3 -D modelling; therefore the development of these models remains vital...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEnergy {{management}} of hybrid propulsion systems is considered, presenting new issues that extend the energy management role beyond the standard torque splitting to maximize system efficiency. The new issues include additional optimization criteria, constraints and relevant dynamics to deal with. New optimization criteria in addition the sole fuel consumption minimization include engine-out pollutant emissions and battery aging. State constraints are modified {{to account for}} plug-in hybrid vehicles. Moreover, specific supervisory control problems are recognized to need additional state variables. The latter comprise: engine and catalyst temperature to deal with <b>engine</b> <b>warm-up</b> effects on fuel consumption and after-catalyst emissions; thermal dynamics of heat recovery systems (Rankine or Thermo-Electric Generators, TEGs); and battery temperature, which influences battery performance and aging. It is shown that all these control problems can be treated in an unified fashion by extending the well-known ECMS (Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy), which is an implementation of Pontryagin Minimum Principle (PMP) as formulated by optimal control theory. Extended definitions of the Hamiltonian function and Lagrange multipliers are introduced. Optimization runs performed off line are reported.
