5|$|Many of {{the damaged}} houses were of poor construction, {{and in the}} wake of Althea, {{engineering}} studies of the destruction resulted in a new understanding of the structural design loads necessary to withstand severe winds. In particular, inadequate roof cladding and <b>fastening</b> <b>systems</b> were among the primary points of failure. Consequently, much stricter building codes were explored in Queensland and Australia as a whole. Three years later, Cyclone Tracy's devastation in Darwin, Northern Territory, bolstered the trend of more rigorous construction specifications in the country. Many of the buildings destroyed by Tracy were government housing units constructed according to new guidelines based on findings after Althea, showing the need for further study. The severe cyclones prompted Queensland to develop its first statewide building regulations in 1975; the new Queensland Home Building Code was fully adopted in the mid-1980s. Under the new regulations, roofs had to be more securely anchored than before using bolts and reinforced fastenings. Having seen the dangers of deficient construction first-hand, Townsville was the first community to enact the enhanced building standards, and served as a testing ground for further revisions. The Cyclone Testing Station, a wind damage research organisation housed within James Cook University's Townsville campus, was established in 1977 in response to cyclones Althea and Tracy.|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the en banc ruling of the Federal Circuit, a new test to {{determine}} whether an adjudged infringer can be held in contempt for continued infringement was implemented. This new test replaced the old two-step KSM test from the 1985 decision in KSM <b>Fastening</b> <b>Systems,</b> Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. The new test “raised the bar for proving that defendant committed contempt” by requiring that a patentee show “the elements found infringing in the original product without significant change in the redesign.” The KSM test required that the original and redesign were “generally similar.” In addition, the patentee must “show that the defendant’s redesigned product infringes upon the same patent claims as the original product.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} appeal concluded, TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp in {{contempt}} {{of the permanent}} injunction. The District Court utilized the two-part test for patent infringement established in KSM <b>Fastening</b> <b>Systems,</b> Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. [...] The crux of this test involved determining whether there is “more than a colorable difference” between the original infringing product and the redesign. EchoStar claimed significant changes to their DVR system {{in order to be}} compliant with the ruling. [...] The key changes to the system were replacing the infringing event detection system with [...] "start code detection was replaced by statistical estimation, a method which EchoStar characterized as an indexless system and a brute-force search method." [...] The court determined that EchoStar Corp’s software redesign still infringed TiVo Inc. ‘389 patent; thus, EchoStar was held in contempt of the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.|$|E

Therefore, the condition detection of the rail <b>fastening</b> <b>system,</b> looseness or absence, is {{an important}} task in railway maintenance. However, the vision-based method cannot identify the severity of rail fastener looseness. In this paper, the condition of rail <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> is monitored based on an automatic and remote-sensing measurement system. Meanwhile, wavelet packet analysis is used to analyze the acceleration signals, based on which two damage indices are developed to locate the damage position and evaluate the severity of rail fasteners looseness, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experiment is performed on a high-speed railway experimental platform.

30|$|Walker et al. [13] {{conducted}} a noise comparison study of two cases, {{the first of}} which was a concrete bridge carrying light rail vehicles. The measured noise level was used as the target for a steel–concrete composite bridge to be built later. Finite element analysis used to predict the noise level of the steel–concrete composite bridge determined that low-frequency noise was the dominant component of the bridge-borne noise. To achieve a noise level {{similar to that of the}} concrete bridge, an elastic <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> was used on the steel-concrete composite bridge. In the second case, they conducted noise and vibration tests on a bridge with elastic fastenings installed; noise was measured before and after the installation of noise barriers. The results showed that both the elastic <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> and the noise barriers could effectively reduce noise levels; however, the noise reduction effect of the elastic <b>fastening</b> <b>system</b> was slightly less effective, because the main noise source was wheel–rail interactions.|$|R
