5|$|In the 19thcentury, York {{became a}} {{hub of the}} railway network and a {{confectionery}} manufacturing centre. <b>In</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>the</b> economy of York has moved from being dominated by its confectionery and railway-related industries to one that provides services. The University of York and health services have become major employers, whilst tourism has become {{an important element of}} the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Infections {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{acquired in the}} urban environment. <b>In</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>the</b> expansion of villages, towns and cities in {{the areas in which}} it is common, and the increased mobility of people has increased the number of epidemics and circulating viruses. Dengue fever, which was once confined to Southeast Asia, has now spread to Southern China, countries in the Pacific Ocean and America, and might pose a threat to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Literary critics {{received}} Rand's fiction {{with mixed}} reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades.</b> <b>The</b> Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, {{both to the}} public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.|$|E

5|$|The square {{is one of}} the {{vertices}} of the Downtown Triangle commercial district. Since the British Mandate era, Zion Square {{has been}} {{the focal point of the}} cultural life of downtown Jerusalem. The square is busy day and night with tourists, elderly immigrants, overseas students, local youth, street performers, and religious activists. <b>In</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>the</b> square has become a hangout for disaffected and homeless youth.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} with other results, this 12 percentage point margin was smaller than Gore's 25 point margin over Bush in the state Presidential contest, was slightly larger than the 10 point margin by which fellow New York senator Charles Schumer defeated incumbent Republican Al D'Amato in the hotly contested 1998 race, but was considerably smaller than the 47 point margin by which Senator Schumer won reelection in 2004 against little-known Republican challenger Howard Mills. The victory of a Democrat in the Senate election was not assured, because <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades</b> <b>the</b> Republicans had won about half the elections for governor and senator.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} {{is common}} {{throughout much of}} its range, although densities are lower in the far north and in coniferous forests. Annual numbers in Siberia fluctuate depending {{on the availability of}} pine cones from year to year. <b>In</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>the</b> nuthatch has colonised Scotland and the Netherlands, and expanded its range in Wales, northern England, Norway and the High Atlas mountain range in North Africa. S. e. asiatica breeds intermittently in Finland and northern Sweden following irruptions. Because large trees are essential, felling or fragmentation of old woodland can lead to local declines or losses.|$|E

5|$|The mythology {{surrounding}} Rommel {{has been}} the subject of analysis by both English- and German-speaking historians <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades.</b> <b>The</b> reevaluation has produced new interpretations of Rommel, including his relationship with National Socialism, his abilities as operational and strategic level commander, and his role (if any) in the July 20th plot to assassinate Hitler. Historians and commentators conclude that Rommel remains an ambiguous figure, not easily definable either inside or outside the myth.|$|E
5|$|The Assistant Commandant is {{nominated}} for appointment by the President {{and must be}} confirmed via majority vote by the Senate. In {{the event that the}} Commandant is absent or is unable to perform his duties, the Assistant Commandant assumes the duties and responsibilities of the Commandant. For this reason, the Assistant Commandant is appointed to a rank equal to the sitting Commandant; since 1971, each Assistant Commandant has been, by statute, a four-star general, making it the most common rank held among Marines serving this position. Additionally, he may perform other duties that the CMC assigns to him. Historically, the Assistant Comandant has served for two to three years. <b>In</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>the</b> Assistant Commandant has frequently been a Marine aviator. James F. Amos is the first aviator to serve as Assistant Commandant and then be promoted to Commandant.|$|E
5|$|The religion's origins {{lie in the}} 19th- {{and early}} 20th-century Romanticist {{movement}} which glorified the pre-Christian beliefs of Germanic societies. In this period organised groups venerating the Germanic gods developed in Germany and Austria; these {{were part of the}} Völkisch movement and typically exhibited a racialist interpretation of the religion, resulting in the movement largely dissolving following the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. In the 1970s, new Heathen groups emerged in Europe and North America, developing into formalized organizations in order to promote their faith. <b>In</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>the</b> Heathen movement {{has been the subject of}} academic study by scholars active in the field of Pagan studies. Scholarly estimates put the number of Heathens at no more than 20,000 worldwide, with communities of practitioners active in Europe, North America, and Australasia.|$|E

5|$|Since 1954, a {{year ahead}} of the 1955 general election, an Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) has been {{appointed}} to advise the executive on the number and geographical division of electoral divisions. Even though neither the Constitution nor any law requires this to be done, the Prime Minister has continued to do so from Singapore's independence in 1965. This is generally done just before a general election to review the boundaries of electoral divisions and recommend changes. <b>In</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades,</b> <b>the</b> Committee has been chaired by the Cabinet Secretary and has had four other members who are senior public servants. In the EBRC appointed before the general election of 2006, these were {{the head of the}} Elections Department, the Chief Executive Officer of the Singapore Land Authority, the Deputy CEO of the Housing and Development Board and the Acting Chief Statistician. Since the Committee is only convened shortly before general elections, the preparatory work for boundary delimitation is done by its secretariat the Elections Department, which is a division of the Prime Minister's Office.|$|E
5|$|Al-Mu'tadid was unable, however, {{to restore}} {{effective}} caliphal control {{north of the}} Jazira in Transcaucasia, where Armenia and Adharbayjan remained {{in the hands of}} virtually independent local dynasties. Ibn Abu'l-Saj, who was now the caliphal governor of Adharbayjan, proclaimed himself independent around 898, although soon he recognized again the Caliph's suzerainty during his conflicts with the Christian Armenian princes. When he died in 901, he was succeeded by his son Devdad, marking the consolidation of the semi-independent Sajid dynasty in the region. In 900 Ibn Abu'l-Saj was even suspected of plotting to seize the Diyar Mudar province with the co-operation of the notables of Tarsus, after which the vengeful Caliph ordered the latter arrested and the city's fleet burned. This decision was a self-inflicted wound on the centuries-long war against Byzantium; <b>in</b> <b>recent</b> <b>decades</b> <b>the</b> Tarsians and their fleet had {{played a major role in}} the raids against the Byzantine frontier provinces. While a Syrian fleet under the renegade Damian of Tarsus sacked the port of Demetrias around 900, and Arab fleets would go on to wreak havoc in the Aegean Sea over the next two decades, the Byzantines were strengthened on land by an influx of Armenian refugees, such as Melias. The Byzantines began to expand their control over the border regions, scoring victories and founding new provinces (themes) in the former no-man's land between the two empires.|$|E
