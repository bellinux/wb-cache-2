The <b>Joint</b> <b>Programming</b> <b>Initiative</b> on Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND) recently developed a novel funding mechanism to rapidly mobilise scientists to address these issues from a broad, international community perspective. Ten expert Working Groups, bringing together a diverse range of community members and covering a wide ND landscape (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, frontotemporal degeneration, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lewy-body and vascular dementia) were formed to discuss and propose potential approaches to better exploiting and coordinating cohort studies. The purpose of this work is to highlight the novel funding process along with a broad overview of the guidelines and recommendations generated by the ten groups, which include investigations into multiple methodologies such as cognition/functional assessment, biomarkers and biobanking, imaging, health and social outcomes, and pre-symptomatic ND. All of these were published in reports that are now publicly available online.

40|$|In agrarian societies, HIV/AIDS extends {{far beyond}} the realm of {{healthcare}} into agricultural production and food security as well. Namibia is a developing country with a large portion of its population involved in agriculture; the average HIV/AIDS infection rate of 21. 3 % in the country leaves a large portion of agricultural workers living with or affected by HIV/AIDS.

In addition, this research aims to define the specific training needs for this population, and to identify possible barriers to access. Four focus groups and four key informant interviews were conducted in northern Namibia, and participants were asked a variety of questions relating to People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in agriculture.

40|$|International {{science and}} {{technology}} cooperation has become increasingly important when facing the global challenges such as climate change, food security and health issues. Both Norwegian and EU strategies {{stress the importance of}} pooling our financial, infrastructure and knowledge resources together. The <b>Joint</b> <b>Programming</b> <b>Initiatives</b> (JPI) are bottom-up, member state driven initiatives set up to coordinate national efforts and pooling together resources to handle the challenges. This thesis is an explorative case study of Norwegian participation in three of the JPIs, with a focus on national motives and funding structures. The central issues from the principal-agent framework, goal conflict, moral hazard and adverse selection, have been used to highlight some of the governance challenges. I used document studies and semi structured interviews of representatives from the Ministry and Agency level to collect my empirical data. My studies show that the motives for participation are linked to social, scientific and economical drivers. For one of my cases economic return and strengthening the competitiveness of national research communities was an important driver, for two of my cases the chance to influence the European research agenda is an important motive, and access to knowledge and facing the grand challenges together is important for all my cases. There are slight differences in the governance structures of each JPI, and the funding arrangements mirror this. The case with the strongest strategic influence motive intends to use mostly institutionalized funding, while the two others have only just started to tackle this issue.

40|$|Examining {{natural hazards}} {{responsible}} for cultural heritage damages all over Europe, especially over large or remote areas is extremely difficult, expensive and time consuming. There {{is a need}} identify and respond to natural hazards before they create irreparable damage to cultural heritage sites. The PROTHEGO project uses radar interferometry to monitor surface deformation with mm precision to analyze the impact of geo-hazards in cultural heritage sites in Europe. The project applies novel InSAR techniques to monitor monuments and sites that are potentially unstable due to landslides, sinkholes, settlement, subsidence, active tectonics as well as structural deformation, all {{of which could be}} affected of climate change and human interaction. To magnify the impact of the project, the approach will be implemented in more than 400 sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List (WHL) in geographical Europe. After the remote sensing investigation, detailed geological interpretation, hazard analysis, localscale monitoring, advanced modelling and field surveying for the most critical sites will be carried out to discover the cause and extent of the observed motions.
