5|$|Despite the {{withdrawal}} of Tiberius from Rome's political scene, the presence of Livia seems to have checked Sejanus' overt power for a time.

Networks of spies and informers brought the victims to trial with false accusations of treason, and many chose suicide over the disgrace of being condemned and executed. Among those who perished were Gaius Asinius Gallus, a prominent senator and opponent of Tiberius who was linked to Agrippina's faction. Agrippina and two of her sons, Nero and Drusus were arrested and exiled <b>in</b> <b>AD</b> 30, and later starved to death in suspicious circumstances.

He avenged the Roman Empire's defeat in the Teutoberg Forest and retrieved two of the three legionary eagles that had been lost during the battle. <b>In</b> <b>AD</b> 17 he returned to Rome where he received a triumph before leaving to reorganize the provinces of Asia Minor, whereby he incorporated the provinces of Cappadocia and Commagene <b>in</b> <b>AD</b> 18.|$|E

5|$|In a 2003 {{review of}} the literature, Rowan et al. {{proposed}} one model for how LTP might be affected <b>in</b> <b>AD.</b> AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP).
