5|$|Reynolds {{believes}} The Sun Also Rises {{could only}} have been written in 1925: <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> captured the period between World WarI and the Great Depression, and immortalized a group of characters. In the years since its publication, the novel has been criticized for its anti-Semitism, as expressed in the characterization of Robert Cohn. Reynolds explains that although the publishers complained to Hemingway about his description of bulls, they allowed his use of Jewish epithets, which showed the degree to which anti-Semitism was accepted in the US after World WarI. Cohn represented the Jewish establishment and contemporary readers would have understood this from his description. Hemingway clearly makes Cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as a character who is Jewish. Critics of the 1970s and 1980s considered Hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic; by the 1990s his work, including The Sun Also Rises, began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars.|$|E
25|$|The {{popular culture}} concept of “{{photographic}} memory,” where (e.g.) someone can briefly {{look at a}} page of text and then recite <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> from memory, {{is not the same}} as seeing eidetic images, and photographic memory has never been demonstrated to exist.|$|E
25|$|We {{would like}} to make <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> clear here at camp LED that we do not in any way condone any such {{behavior}} related to these charges. We, however, are not a judge or a jury and don't want to be one any time soon. We are however a band that really just wants to continue playing music. We know that these times have been severely trying for Dominic and the accuser. We hope for the best outcome for all parties. However, Dominic will no longer be playing music or working on behalf of Love Equals Death. This matter that he faces requires all of his attention right now and we wish him well as I know all of you do.|$|E

25|$|Milner and Haig {{met again}} at GHQ in France (21 September) - Milner warned Haig that {{manpower}} {{would not be}} available for 1919 if squandered now and told Wilson (23 September) that Haig was being “ridiculously optimistic”, might “embark on another Paschendal (sic)” and that he “had grave doubts whether he had got inside of DH’s head”; Wilson thought the War Cabinet would have to “watch this tendency & stupidity of DH”. He complained that Haig, Foch and du Cane {{did not understand the}} shortage of manpower – in fact Haig understood <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> well but hoped to win the war before British manpower ran out. Lloyd George still hoped to shift British efforts to other fronts, leaving the Americans to take over more of the burden on the Western Front going forward.|$|E
25|$|Although Eugene {{was not of}} Austrian extraction, he {{did have}} Habsburg antecedents. His grandfather, Thomas Francis, founder of the Carignano line of the House of Savoy, {{was the son of}} Catherine Michelle—a {{daughter}} of Philip II of Spain—and the great-grandson of the Emperor Charles V. But of more immediate consequence to Leopold I was the fact that Eugene was the second cousin of Victor Amadeus, the Duke of Savoy, a connection that the Emperor hoped might prove useful in any future confrontation with France. These ties, together with his ascetic manner and appearance (a positive advantage to him at the sombre court of Leopold I), ensured the refugee from the hated French king a warm welcome at Passau, and a position in Imperial service. Though French was his favored language, he communicated with Leopold in Italian, as the Emperor (though he knew <b>it</b> <b>perfectly)</b> disliked French. But Eugene also had a reasonable command of German, which he understood very easily, something that helped him much in the military.|$|E
500|$|McCay {{made the}} [...] {{drawings}} on translucent rice paper. [...] The film {{came before the}} development of cel animation, in which animators draw on clear sheets of celluloid and lay them over static backgrounds. [...] Thus, on each drawing McCay had to redraw the background, which appears to waver slightly due {{to the difficulty of}} reproducing <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> each time. [...] McCay re-used some of the drawings to loop repeated actions, a technique he used once in Little Nemo and more extensively in his later films.|$|E

500|$|After Homer quits {{his job at}} {{the power}} plant, he violently tosses his old boss Mr. Burns out of the cart he is driving. Homer then drives across a wooden bridge and tosses a match onto it; the whole bridge is {{instantly}} engulfed in flames. Mirkin came up with the joke, and said that [...] "the thing with animation is that you can stage almost anything and time <b>it</b> <b>perfectly,</b> something you {{would not be able to}} do in live action". As a live-action director, Mirkin said he enjoys the amount of control they have in animation.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of {{contemporary}} criticism of [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] in 1998, James O'Rouke claimed that [...] "To judge from the volume, the variety, and the polemical force of the modern critical responses engendered, {{there have been few}} moments in English poetic history as baffling as Keats's repetition of the word 'forlorn'". When referring to the reliance of the ideas of John Dryden and William Hazlitt within the poem, Poet Laureate Andrew Motion, in 1999, argued [...] "whose notion of poetry as a 'movement' from personal consciousness to an awareness of suffering humanity <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> illustrates." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{next day}} the arrests were {{publicly}} queried in the House of Commons, and a Labour backbencher Jack Jones started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. W. C. Bridgeman, the Home Secretary, {{said that he had}} directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920, and that he had consulted the Attorney General who considered <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> legal. Hastings immediately stood and protested, saying that the Act was [...] "one of the most dreadful things that has been done {{in the history of our}} country" [...] and that the internments and deportations were effectively illegal.|$|E

500|$|The JAMs offered {{what they}} claimed were [...] "the last five" [...] copies of 1987 {{for sale at}} £1000 each in a full-page {{advertisement}} in the April 1988 edition of The Face. Drummond argued that the offer exploited a loophole in The JAMs' agreement with the MCPS: [...] "We were browsing around this record shop and came across these five copies of 1987.... We made <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> clear to the MCPS that we couldn't actually force the shops to send our LPs back.... ecause we bought them in a shop, these LPs don't come into the agreement {{and we can do}} what we like with them and not break any laws." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{the game}} has rapidly {{achieved}} a cult following and has been praised by many reviewers, it also {{has its share of}} criticism. A common complaint is that the game is relatively short and repetitive—it can be completed in under ten hours, and the gameplay stays virtually the same all the way through. However, others, such as Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Mark McDonald (who gave the game 8.5 out of ten with his EGM staff), argue that the game's limitations are made up for by its strengths: [...] "Sure, you're basically doing the same thing each mission, but Katamari's elegant controls, killer soundtrack, and wicked humor make <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> suited for replay." [...] As a well-executed, non-traditional game, Katamari Damacy has been influential in the game development community. [...] Since its release, a number of designers have developed works inspired by Katamari: one example is The Wonderful End of the World.|$|E

500|$|Coincidentally, <b>it</b> <b>perfectly</b> {{captured}} {{the experience of}} the singer, who arrived at the studio moments after another altercation with her former lover. Angry and unfocused, she denounced her ex-lover's tendency to [...] "turn the tables" [...] on her during their arguments, an expression that Tedder decided to reference in the song's lyrics. Adele recorded the demo with Abbis the following day. [...] "Turning Tables" [...] was mixed by Abbiss and Ian Dowling. Neil Cowley played the piano in the song, while the string arrangement was made by Chris Elliot. The strings were played by Patrick Kernan, Stephen Morris, Tom Pigott-Smith, Julian Leaper, Boguslaw Kostecki, Bruce White, Peter Lale, Rachel Stephanie Bolt, David Danels, Caroline Dale, Warren Zelnski, Jackie Shave, Chris Laurence, Rita Manning, Cathy Thompson, Emlyn Singleton and Chris Worsey. XL Recordings serviced the song to UK mainstream radio on 5 November 2011 as fifth single from 21 alongside [...] "Rumour Has It". On 14 December 2011, the song was sent for airplay to Italian radio stations.|$|E
500|$|Rest of the {{ensemble}} included leather, metallic combinations, green silk vest from A.F. Vandevorst, and cotton clothing from Greg Lauren. The lace shorts Madonna wore was vintage, and Åkerlund burnt up the singer's Agent Provocateur bra and applied dirt on it for giving special effects. The whole inspiration for Åkerlund behind the look was Jonas, {{as well as the}} couple's interest in rock-n-roll. Madonna approved the design, saying that [...] "It was magical... <b>It</b> <b>perfectly</b> represented the vibe that we wanted to bring to the video." [...] She also asked for a golf club and pocket knife to make the look more edgy. With Swedish broadcasting channel Sveriges Television, Åkerlund explained that for the opening shot, where Madonna is shown laying on the bed, she wanted boots which looked like leg braces. She contacted a designer in New York who said that he developed such pieces for fetish fashion. Åkerlund wanted him to provide the designs for arms also.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} she remembered her first day of filming, Woodburne {{recalled}} [...] "Yes - I remember <b>it</b> <b>perfectly.</b> We were unpacking stuff from the car and moving into No 28. I already knew Alan, but I didn't know the kids. It all just meshed, though, and we knew immediately what type of family {{we were going to}} be." [...] Susan was given a teaching job at the local high school and Karl became the local GP, giving the family immediate links with other characters. In 1995, Rainey Mayo portrayed a teenage Susan in a daydream. In October 2009, Woodburne became the longest-serving actress in the show's history, having appeared on-screen as Susan for fifteen years. Of her television milestone, Woodburne said, [...] "It seems both bizarre and wonderful to me that I'm coming up to 15 years on the show, even though the world of Neighbours feels instinctive and familiar, I'm still challenged and rewarded by the work." ...|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Abby West considered Pam's {{speech to}} be [...] "a terrific payoff {{for those of}} us invested (some might say too much) in the Jim-Pam-Karen love triangle." [...] West also praised other aspects of the episode, such as the fire walk and the sequences with Stanley' to her, [...] "everyone brought his or her A game (in hilarity, if not in effort) to the race to succeed Michael." [...] IGN's Travis Fickett rated [...] "Beach Games" [...] 8.5/10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode. Like West, he highlighted Stanley for praise, and also liked Helms being trapped on the lake. Fickett concluded that [...] "while this episode's closing scene doesn't have the impact of Jim telling Pam {{he was in love with}} her at the end of Season 2, it is one of those long awaited moments that we knew was coming. And Jenna Fischer, as Pam, handles <b>it</b> <b>perfectly.</b> Once again the Scranton branch is facing some big changes, and the show has us eagerly awaiting the season finale." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{working at}} Wanamaker's Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a {{colleague}} {{who had seen}} him dance, of {{a role in the}} upcoming production Every Sailor. A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled Every Woman. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew <b>it</b> <b>perfectly.</b> This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while waiting to go on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: [...] "For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him when I put on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "New Rules" [...] gained many {{positive}} reviews from critics, who praised its themes of female empowerment. As of November 2017, {{it has received}} over 570 million views on YouTube. Its release also made Lipa debut on Billboard Social 50 chart at number 26. Aliza Abarbanel of Refinery29 commented on the visual, [...] "'New Rules', and all the epic outfits in <b>it,</b> <b>perfectly</b> encapsulates the joy of female friendship—and the joy in getting dressed up together." [...] Papers Claire Valentine labelled it Lipa's [...] "strongest video so far." [...] Hafeezah Nazim of Nylon called it [...] "a empowering visual", while New Statesman writer Anna Leszkiewicz {{described it as a}} [...] "colourful and acutely choreographed video", as well as considering it one of the best clips released in July 2017. Alessia Scappaticci of The Loop praised the visual's themes of self-esteem, diversity and friendship, adding that it [...] "definitely deserves all of the positive attention it's been getting". T.L. Stanley of Adweek noted that in the plot, the women are [...] "standing together, mirroring a current trend in pop culture and entertainment that shows women supporting each other (catfights are so yesterday)." ...|$|E
