40|$|Hedonic pricing methods {{typically}} {{employ a}} distance-to-site variable to measure variation in exposure to environmental disamenities. Some environmental disamenities, like hazardous waste sites, may be spatially correlated with another prominent {{feature of the}} urban plain zones of <b>industrial</b> <b>activity.</b> In these cases, failure to account for <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> is hypothesized to bias coefficient estimates of the distance-to-site measure. The data set includes a distance-to-site measure {{as well as a}} distance-to-industrial measure. These measures allow for empirical estimations of the hedonic price function that distinguish the property value effect associated with exposure to hazard from the property value effect associated with <b>industrial</b> <b>activity.</b> The results suggest that failure to account for <b>industrial</b> <b>activity</b> will overstate the effect of hazardous waste sites on property values and inflate benefit estimates associated with hazardous waste clean-up.

Various shipping companies offices are also located in the port area which also is home to an Eshkol A power station and coal terminal.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{subsidence}} {{coupled with}} structural and political {{changes to the}} mining industry began the decline in Astley's <b>industrial</b> <b>activities</b> during the mid-20th century; its cotton mill closed in 1955, and the last coal {{was brought to the}} surface in 1970. However, Astley has grown as part of a commuter belt, supported by its proximity to Manchester city centre and inter-city transport links. Astley Green Colliery Museum houses collections of Astley's industrial heritage.|$|E

5|$|There are {{no state}} roads and {{virtually}} no township {{roads in the}} watershed of Hammersley Fork. However, there are dirt roads and gravel roads, and several stream crossings in the watershed. The first settlers arrived in the watershed in 1827 and the first roads in the area were constructed several years later. <b>Industrial</b> <b>activities</b> such as logging were common in the watershed in the early 20th century, but there is currently virtually no such activity there.

5|$|Heavy metals can degrade air, water, {{and soil}} quality, and {{subsequently}} cause health issues in plants, animals, and people, {{when they become}} concentrated {{as a result of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>activities.</b> Common sources of heavy metals in this context include mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; lead-acid batteries; fertilisers; paints; and treated timber; aging water supply infrastructure; and microplastics floating in the world's oceans. Recent examples of heavy metal contamination and health risks include the occurrence of Minamata disease, in Japan (1932–1968; lawsuits ongoing as of 2016); the Bento Rodrigues dam disaster in Brazil, and high levels of lead in drinking water supplied to the residents of Flint, Michigan, in the north-east of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Llanelli, Ammanford and {{the upper}} parts of the Gwendraeth Valley are {{situated}} on the South Wales Coalfield. The opencast mining activities in this region have now ceased but the old mining settlements with terraced housing remain, often centred on their nonconformist chapels. Kidwelly had a tin-plating industry in the eighteenth century, with Llanelli following not long after, {{so that by the}} end of the nineteenth century, Llanelli was the world-centre of the industry. There is little trace of these <b>industrial</b> <b>activities</b> today. Llanelli and Burry Port served at one time for the export of coal, but trade declined, as it did from the ports of Kidwelly and Carmarthen as their estuaries silted up. Country towns in the more agricultural part of the county still hold regular markets where livestock is traded.|$|E

5|$|Salford {{became a}} major factory town and inland port during the 18th and 19th centuries. Cotton and silk {{spinning}} and weaving in local mills attracted an influx of families and provided Salford with a strong economy. Salford Docks was a principal dockyard of the Manchester Ship Canal. By {{the end of the}} 19th century Salford had an enlarged working class community and suffered from chronic overpopulation. <b>Industrial</b> <b>activities</b> declined during the 20th century however, causing a local economic depression. Salford subsequently became one of contrasts, with regenerated inner-city areas like Salford Quays next {{to some of the most}} socially deprived and violent areas in England.|$|E
5|$|Brick sewers {{had been}} built in London from the 17th century when {{sections}} of the Fleet and Walbrook rivers were covered for that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred sewers were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 cesspits and 360 sewers. Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, {{while many of the}} sewers were in a poor state of repair. During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined with the introduction of flushing toilets and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being flushed into the sewers, along with the associated effluent. The outfalls from factories, slaughterhouses and other <b>industrial</b> <b>activities</b> put further strain on the already failing system. Much of this outflow either overflowed, or discharged directly, into the Thames.|$|E
5|$|The {{labour force}} is 2.45million people, of whom 7.1 per cent are {{employed}} in agriculture, 35.2 per cent {{are employed in}} industry and 57.7 per cent are employed in the services sector. Extraction of metals and minerals, production of chemicals, machinery and vehicle components, petroleum refining and steel are among the major <b>industrial</b> <b>activities.</b> Mining and its related industries employ a total of 120,000 people and generate about five per cent of the country's GDP. Bulgaria is Europe's sixth-largest coal producer. Local deposits of coal, iron, copper and lead are vital for the manufacturing and energy sectors. Almost all top export items of Bulgaria are industrial commodities such as oil products, copper products and pharmaceuticals. Bulgaria is also a net exporter of agricultural and food products, of which two-thirds go to OECD countries. It is the largest global producer of perfumery essential oils such as lavender and rose oil. Agriculture has declined significantly {{in the past two}} decades. Production in 2008 amounted to only 66 per cent of that between 1999 and 2001, while cereal and vegetable yields have dropped by nearly 40 per cent since 1990. Of the services sector, tourism is the most significant contributor to economic growth. In recent years, Bulgaria has emerged as a travelling destination with its inexpensive resorts and beaches outside the reach of the tourist industry. Lonely Planet ranked it among its top 10 destinations for 2011. Most of the visitors are British, Romanian, German and Russian. The capital Sofia, the medieval capital Veliko Tarnovo, coastal resorts Golden Sands and Sunny Beach and winter resorts Bansko, Pamporovo and Borovets are some of the locations most visited by tourists.|$|E
