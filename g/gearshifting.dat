40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development and}} the experimental validation of a controller for the simulation {{of the behavior of}} automotive automatic <b>gearshifts.</b> For this purpose a <b>gearshift</b> simulator was developed based on 2 DOF haptic interface to evaluate users qualitative judgment of automatic <b>gearshifts</b> response. In fact, many car manufacturers use vehicle and primary controls simulators to evaluate the characteristics of a new model before building physical mock-ups or even prototypes. A dedicated control law was designed in order to reproduce different experimentally measured force profiles during forward and backward run of the <b>gearshift</b> handle. The force feedback control law was based on an impedance model with different stiffness values along the path of the <b>gearshift.</b> A state machine selects the characteristics of the force feedback profile according to lever position and velocity. An additional state machine implements the hysteresis behavior of the force profiles by a transition function. The transition algorithm and constraints related to stability are discussed in this paper.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{integrated}} powertrain control for <b>gearshifts</b> on twin clutch transmissions is developed. First, a detailed model of an automotive powertrain featuring a twin clutch transmission is developed in Matlab/Simulink®. This model includes detailed friction {{models for the}} twin clutch that enable {{an investigation into the}} effects of different friction materials on the performance of the <b>gearshift</b> controller. The transmission model also includes detailed models of the synchronisers and thus allows a simulation of synchroniser-to-synchroniser shifts. A simplified phenomenological model, derived from a more complex non-linear model, is employed to model the hydraulic actuation of clutches and synchroniser. The thesis finds that the dependency of the friction coefficient on the sliding speed has an important influence on the <b>gearshift</b> quality and the performance of <b>gearshift</b> controller, while the absolute level of the friction coefficient is less important. Based on this powertrain model the key problems of <b>gearshifts</b> on twin clutch transmissions were identified and a control that overcomes these problems was developed. The first stage was to devise a <b>gearshift</b> control algorithm that handles single clutch-to-clutch shifts without a oneway (freewheeler-, overrunning-) clutch. This basic <b>gearshift</b> control algorithm featured a control of clutch slip for the engine torque transfer and a control of engine speed through engine torque manipulation (plus clutch pressure manipulation for downshifts). In a second stage, an optional transmission output torque control was developed that could be integrated in the basic control. The thesis shows that these control strategies are superior, in terms of shift quality, to conventional <b>gearshift</b> controls as used on planetary-type transmissions and are also robust against variations in the powertrain parameters (including friction coefficient) and sensor noise. The control strategies developed for single clutch-to-clutch shifts were extended to handle double and other multiple <b>gearshifts</b> that take place in the same transmission half. The thesis also investigates the other main part of <b>gearshifts</b> on twin clutch transmissions, the gear pre-selection. The thesis shows that, on power-on <b>gearshifts,</b> the torque reactions at the transmission output due to the gear pre-selection with conventional hydraulically actuated synchronisers can be effectively compensated for by a simple manipulation of engine torque.

SCG Ltd devised the Semi-Automatic gearbox, under their brand name [...] "Pneumocyclic" [...] as an advance. It had the same gearbox principle, but instead of pre-selecting a gear and then separately operating a change-gear pedal, both functions were combined and operated from a small lever alongside the steering wheel, the driver merely moving this to the next gear and the transmission responding accordingly. The mechanism was operated either by air pressure or low-voltage electrics, although the physical <b>gearshifting</b> in the gearbox was nearly always by air pressure, (some vehicles used high pressure hydraulics, notably BMMO vehicles). This style of transmission was also widespread in UK buses, {{from a range of}} manufacturers, until different types came onto the market in the 1980s. A further advance was the Fully Automatic gearbox, which still used the same principles but shifted gears automatically. This was pioneered on the well-known London AEC Routemaster type, and later spread, although not widely, to other vehicle types.|$|E

Volvo Construction Equipment Components has a simulation environment of the powertrain, SimPow, which is implemented in Matlab/Simulink. SimPow is mostly used for simulation of control strategies and performance. In order to be able to study <b>gearshifting</b> comfort, Volvo has an interest in developing new models for SimPow. The purpose of this thesis work is to build complementing models for SimPow, and evaluate what modifications are needed in order to be able to study <b>gearshifting</b> comfort. The work is limited to study only movement in the longitudinal direction and for one vehicle - the Wheel Loader L 150 E. The models are implemented in Simulink. The complementing models are of two kinds: – Models of the vehicle. The bodies, vehicle frame and cabin are considered as rigid bodies. Elements consisting of springs and dampers, insulators, are connecting frame and cabin. Driving forces from the wheels results in acceleration (longitudinal, vertical and rotational) and jerk for the center of gravity of the vehicle frame. The acceleration of the frame gives rise to forces in the insulators, connecting frame and cabin. These forces accelerates the cabin and the driver. – Longitudinal models of the wheels. Torque from the powertrain gives rise to a longitudinal force, driving force, in the contact patch between ground and tire. The conclusion from the evaluation shows that a longitudinal model of the wheels is needed. Further, it is considered sufficient to study and measure the longitudinal acceleration of the frame. Therefore, the models of the vehicle are not needed...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDriver {{sensation}} {{during a}} gearshift in a manual transmission {{is one of}} the most remarkable actions in terms of comfort perception in motor vehicles. This importance has increased in a reasonable way in the last years mainly because of higher quality requirements demanded by the market. All movements and efforts, mainly the so-called double bump, are directly transferred to the drive's hand thru the gearshift lever inside the vehicle and cables that make the connection of the lever with the shifting tower. Having said that, it is possible to verify in the available literature that no human interaction analysis with the gearshift system considering human factors and ergonomics (HFE) are used to define its relation to the physical values observed during the process of <b>gearshifting</b> (e. g. efforts, impulses, times, etc.) to support changes in the transmission hardware. Therefore, using a HFE approach for the gearshift system, this study analyzes the models of the available literature and check its considerations, and applying HFE concepts proposes a different approach to estimate human perception about shift comfort...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} the focus of {{powertrain}} control has shifted perspective from control of the individual powertrain components to control of the complete powertrain, so-called integrated powertrain control. The idea presented in this thesis is to view the powertrain as one single control object and to used the engine as a torque actuator {{to the rest of}} the driveline. The investigated powertrain consists of a diesel engine with a variable geometry turbocharger, an automated manual transmission, exible driveshafts and wheels and chassis to make the vehicle complete. The vehicle in focus is a heavy duty truck. The power a diesel engine can generate is limited by the amount of fuel that can be burnt effciently. The combustion effciency is determined mainly by the amount of air that is available for combustion. An insufficientient amount of air results in in- creased particulate emissions and visible smoke, while a surplus of air results in NOx emissions. This means that active engine control not only deals with manipulation of the engine speed or the engine torque but also includes efficient control of the engine itself. The idea of integrated powertrain control is to use the engine as an active part of the control system. A turbocharged diesel engine is a complex and dierent actuator compared to other actuators used in control systems. The working region is limited, the outcome from the actuator (torque) is uncertain, the capacity varies with operating point and the performance is directional dependent. Several dierent solutions to the problem of controlling the air-to-fuel ratio for a turbocharged diesel engine are proposed. The solutions are nonlinear model-based control laws, designed using stability analysis by means of Lyapunov functions. Two applications are also studied; driveline oscillations and <b>gearshifting</b> in an auto- mated manual transmission. In both cases engine control becomes an essential part of the solution. The engine is used actively in order to remove oscillations in the driveline and to perform fast and smooth gearshifts. The resulting solutions are obtained by combining engine speed/torque and air-to-fuel ratio control...|$|E

40|$|Torque-fill {{capability}} during <b>gearshifts</b> is {{an important}} customer requirement in automated transmission systems. This functionality can be achieved through transmission system layouts (e. g., based on dual-clutch technology) characterized by significant mechanical complexity, and hence with relatively high cost and mass. This paper describes a parallel hybrid electric drivetrain concept, based on the integration of an electric motor drive into a relatively simple six-speed automated manual transmission. The resulting hybrid electric drivetrain actuates the torque-fill function through control of the electric motor torque during the <b>gearshifts</b> on the engine side of the drivetrain. An optimal controller, based on the off-line computation of the control gain profiles, is presented for the clutch re-engagement phase.
