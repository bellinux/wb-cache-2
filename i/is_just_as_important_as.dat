25|$|Psychology {{was first}} {{recognized}} as a major subject at the university by Professor Imre Sándor, who realized {{that the study of}} psychology <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> that of pedagogy. Accordingly, on 20 October 1926, he filed his petition to the directors of the university {{for the establishment of a}} fundamentally different, modern Department of Pedagogy and Psychology. György Málnási Bartók, the Professor of the Department of Philosophy, was an avid supporter of the petition, since the tuition of Psychology had been the responsibility of his department at that period. In his petition, Imre Sándor listed the following fields and branches as belonging to the new Department's sphere of competence: General Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Psychology of Differences, Education of Backward Children, Psychotechnics, and Pedagogical Somatology.|$|E
25|$|While Poe herself {{admitted}} that her biggest {{strength in the}} campaign was her surname, she also conceded {{that it would be}} insufficient for her to be elected simply on that alone, emphasizing that her platform <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> her name in getting her elected to the Senate. She also dismissed claims that her candidacy was her family's revenge against her father's loss in 2004, saying that all she wants to do is serve should she be elected to the Senate. A day after the election, Poe was announced as among the winners with her having the highest number of votes. She was officially proclaimed a senator by the COMELEC board on May 2013, along with fellow Team PNoy candidates Chiz Escudero, Sonny Angara, Alan Peter Cayetano, and Loren Legarda, as well United Nationalist Alliance candidate Nancy Binay (who did not attend, opting instead to send her lawyer to represent her).|$|E

2500|$|Word {{order is}} {{comparatively}} free. Adjectives may precede or follow nouns; subjects, verbs and objects may occur in any order. However, the article [...] "the", demonstratives such as [...] "that" [...] and prepositions (such as [...] "at") must come before their related nouns. Similarly, the negative [...] "not" [...] and conjunctions such as [...] "and" [...] and [...] "that" [...] must precede the phrase or clause that they introduce. In copular (A = B) clauses, word order <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> in English: [...] "people are animals" [...] is distinguished from [...] "animals are people".|$|E
2500|$|When {{first put}} into production, {{the film was}} {{promoted}} as having the title Rapunzel Unbraided, which was later changed to Rapunzel. Disney's previous animated feature The Princess and the Frog in 2009, while being well-received by various critics [...] and taking in nearly $270 million worldwide was not as successful as Disney had hoped. Catmull would later admit in writing that Disney Animation's faith that The Princess and the Frogs excellent quality would bring in all audiences notwithstanding the word [...] "princess" [...] in the title was their version of [...] "a stupid pill." [...] In order to market the film to both sexes and additional age groups, Disney changed the film's name from Rapunzel to Tangled while also emphasizing Flynn Rider, the film's prominent male character, showing that his story <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> Rapunzel's. Disney was criticized for altering the classic title as a marketing strategy. Floyd Norman, a former Disney and Pixar animator and story artist, said, [...] "The idea of changing {{the title of a}} classic like Rapunzel to Tangled is beyond stupid. I'm convinced they'll gain nothing from this except the public seeing Disney as desperately trying to find an audience." ...|$|E

A fight to the finish between competitor number five and six, half a lap behind the winner, can <b>be</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> the actual winner.

2500|$|It can be assumed, that Hahn was {{in close}} contact with the universally known natural {{scientist}} Jakob Sturm and probably with his two sons. He named a spider species after Jakob: Araneus Sturmii, now Atea sturmi (Hahn, 1831). His relationship with Johann Georg Wagler must have been similarly close. He also named a spider species after him: Lÿcosa Waglerii, now Pardosa wagleri (Hahn, 1822). Nothing reliable is known about other contacts within the remarkably productive Nuremberg zoologist scene. Nor is there any proof, that Hahn knew Franz von Paula (von) Schrank personally, a highly regarded natural scientist, to whom he dedicated the [...] "Monograph on Spiders". The scientific value of Hahn's lifework in natural history varies. His ornithological work, for example, never had any discernible influence on this field. On the other hand, Hahn's work on the true bugs (Heteroptera) <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>important</b> <b>as</b> his works on spiders (Araneae). One species of bug even carries his name: Lopus hahni Stål, 1860. He was also given this honour in the field of arachnology: Carl Ludwig Koch, who continued [...] "Die Arachniden" [...] after Hahn's death, called a genus after him in 1841 (Hahnia), on which later the name of the whole family was based – Hahniidae Bertkau, 1878.|$|E

Of course some will attract you more than others, and some will need more attention than others; but be careful not to ignore any patient.
