5|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects. It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram {{and it was still}} frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in {{order to protect}} against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.|$|E

Beginning with the premiere of the 1979 syndicated version, the wheel was re-designed so that each section had three stars in separate, evenly spaced squares; the pointer now <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a square in order to double the money.|$|E

Radio Jan Mayen also served as an important radio station for ship traffic in the Arctic Ocean. In 1959, NATO decided to build the LORAN-C network in the Atlantic Ocean, {{and one of the}} transmitters <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> Jan Mayen. By 1961, the new military installations, including a new airfield, were operational.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, Operation Musketeer needed {{the element of}} total {{surprise}} to succeed, and all 660 men <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the ground at El Gamil airfield and ready for action within {{four and a half}} minutes. At 04.15 hours on November 5, 1956, British 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment jumped in and although opposition was heavy, casualties were few. Meanwhile, French paratroopers of the 2nd Marine Infantry Parachute Regiment under the command of Colonel Chateau-Jobert jumped on the water treatment factory South of Port Said.|$|E
25|$|The battalions {{were not}} used in combat. However, they worked on {{military}} projects that were subject to sabotage efforts by Soviet partisans. Therefore, the units <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> guard and patrol and occasionally engaged the partisans in shootouts. For example, men from the second battalion were ambushed while transporting food from Pskov; a few taken captive and a few were killed. The Germans organized a day-long hunt for the partisans which also involved the Lithuanians. These, however, were incidental activities. The Bau-Bataillonen suffered only occasional casualties, some due to work accidents, others due to partisan activities.|$|E
25|$|According to one critic, Watson's {{portrayal}} of Franklin in The Double Helix (written after Franklin's death when libel laws {{did not apply}} anymore) was negative and gave the appearance that she was Wilkins' assistant {{and was unable to}} interpret her own DNA data. The latter accusation was indefensible since, e.g., Franklin herself told Crick and Watson that the helix backbones <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> the outside, which was crucial to the elucidation of the helix since before this both Crick and Watson and Linus Pauling had independently generated flawed models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards.|$|E

5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played <b>on</b> {{different}} days. Normally they both would <b>be</b> held <b>on</b> Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, {{the games were}} split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, so they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played <b>on</b> Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played <b>on</b> different days.|$|R

25|$|This was {{initially}} limited to 10 words per letter, but was later changed to 25, {{which was the}} standard for POWs. The rules changed over the years; at one point islanders were not permitted to write to relatives, but could write to friends. The number of messages one could send were limited, and replies <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> {{the back of the}} original message. Messages might take months, although a few arrived in weeks. All messages were routed via the International Red Cross headquarters in Geneva, which dealt with 24 million messages during the war. The islands dealt with around 1 million. Each message sent cost 6d.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, tougher {{criteria}} were adopted for saves where the tying run <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> base {{or at the}} plate when the reliever entered {{to qualify for a}} save (unless he pitched three innings). This addressed saves such as Ron Taylor's in a 20–6 New York Mets win over the Atlanta Braves. The rule was relaxed in 1975 to credit a save when a reliever pitches at least one inning with no more than a three-run lead, or comes in with runners on base but the tying run on deck. In 2000, Rolaids started recording a tough save when a pitcher enters a save situation with the potential tying run already on base, but still earns the save.|$|E
500|$|The {{physical}} trainers {{also had}} to ensure that {{not only do the}} actors look like soldiers before filming, but they had to remain that way throughout the shoot. In addition, Stapleton and Winchester had to lose and gain weight, respectively. Winchester <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> a diet of 4,000 calories a day, which included taking protein shakes between meals. The actor described the diet as [...] "a workout in itself," [...] having found it [...] "exhausting" [...] eating more food than he was used to. In total, training took approximately one month.|$|E
