40|$|Abstract. A key {{aspect of}} {{industrialization}} is {{the adoption of}} increasing-returns-to-scale, <b>industrial,</b> <b>technologies.</b> Two other, well-documented aspects are that <b>industrial</b> <b>technologies</b> are adopted throughout intermediate-input chains and that they use intermediate inputs intensively relative to the technologies they replace. These features of <b>industrial</b> <b>technologies</b> combined imply that countries with access to similar technologies may have very different levels of industrialization and income, even if the degree of increasing returns to scale at the firm level is small. Furthermore, a minor improvement in the productivity of <b>industrial</b> <b>technologies</b> can trigger full-scale industrialization and a large increase in aggregate income...|$|R

5|$|The Panic of 1893 had a {{severely}} {{negative effect on}} the Hoosier economy when many factories closed and several railroads declared bankruptcy. The Pullman Strike of 1894 hurt the Chicago area and coal miners in southern Indiana participated in a national strike. Hard times were not limited to industry; farmers also felt a financial pinch from falling prices. The economy began to recover when World War I broke out in Europe, creating a higher demand for American goods. Despite economic setbacks, advances in <b>industrial</b> <b>technology</b> continued throughout the last years of the 19th and into the 20th century. On July 4, 1894, Elwood Haynes successfully road tested his first automobile, and opened the Haynes-Apperson auto company in 1896. In 1895, William Johnson invented a process for casting aluminum.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{a series of}} {{articles}} appeared in the school's student newspaper The Tower, detailing significant safety and space issues within what was then known as the IA (Industrial Arts) Building. Much debate over the conditions (and need for expansion) in the 1930s-era wing ensued between the cost-conscious GPPS Board and concerned parents and teachers. The School Board ultimately agreed that major improvements were necessary. An area with tennis courts was selected for the expansion, which were later replaced on top of the <b>industrial</b> <b>technology</b> shops. The top floor of math rooms was unchanged. A modern photography classroom and lab sat next to a new drafting room, while two modernized art rooms provided general and commercial art classes with fine homes. The first floor featured a fine drawing and painting studio, a superlative ceramics, sculpture, and metals laboratory, and an art appreciation lecture classroom. The <b>industrial</b> <b>technology</b> department started in earnest in the remodeled basement. The sprawling underground addition started with the parking and outdoor service area of the four-bay automotive shop backed up by a sophisticated wood and metal shop and a TV studio.|$|E

25|$|To {{clean up}} pollution, {{the federal and}} local governments {{implemented}} numerous plans including the constant monitoring and reporting of environmental conditions, such as ozone and nitrogen oxides. When the levels of these two pollutants reached critical levels, contingency actions were implemented which included closing factories, changing school hours, and extending the A day without a car program to two days of the week. The government also instituted <b>industrial</b> <b>technology</b> improvements, a strict biannual vehicle emission inspection and the reformulation of gasoline and diesel fuels. The introduction of Metrobús bus rapid transit and the Ecobici bike-sharing were among efforts to encourage alternate, greener forms of transportation.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the most}} poignant criticisms of {{technology}} are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, Anthony Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. In Goethe's Faust, Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted {{as a metaphor for}} the adoption of <b>industrial</b> <b>technology.</b> More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by Philip K. Dick and William Gibson and films such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity.|$|E

It opened five years became independent in 1845, patent medicine factories like Hood's Sarsaparilla Laboratory later, making the Middlesex Canal obsolete. Soon, lines up the Merrimack to Nashua, downriver to Lawrence, and inland to Groton Junction, today known as Ayer (renamed after Lowell patent medicine tycoon Dr. James Cook Ayer), were constructed.|$|E

25|$|The School of Applied Technology {{was founded}} as the Center for Professional Development in 2001 {{in order to}} provide {{technology}} oriented education for working professionals. In December 2009, IIT announced the formation of the School of Applied Technology, composed of undergraduate and graduate degree programs in <b>Industrial</b> <b>Technology</b> and Management (INTM) and Information Technology and Management (ITM), as well as non-credit Professional Learning Programs (PLP). These programs were all formerly part of the Center for Professional Development. Professional Learning Programs offers non-credit continuing education courses and certificates, corporate training, a Professional Engineering Exam Review program, international programs including English as a Second Language instruction, short courses and seminars ranging from a few hours to several days in length. In 2014 the Department of Food Science and Nutrition was formally launched within the School of Applied Technology, formed from degree programs originating within IIT's Institute for Food Safety and Health (IFSH).|$|E
25|$|The lion’s {{share of}} {{government}} expenditure on R goes to universities, {{as in most}} countries. This level of spending increased slightly from 58% to 61% of total government funding of R between 2008 and 2012. Among specific sectors, agriculture comes next, in {{a reflection of the}} sector’s relevance for Brazil, the second-largest foodproducing country in the world after the USA. Brazilian agricultural productivity has risen constantly since the 1970s, due to the greater use of innovative technology and processes. Industrial R comes third, followed by health and infrastructure, other sectors having shares of 1% or lower of government expenditure. With some exceptions, the distribution of government spending on R in 2012 is similar to that in 2000. After a sharp increase in <b>industrial</b> <b>technology</b> from 1.4% to 6.8% between 2000 and 2008, its share of government expenditure declined to 5.9% in 2012. The share of space science and technology (civilian) has been pursuing a downward spiral from a high of 2.3% in 2000. Defence research spending had been curtailed from 1.6% to 0.6% between 2000 and 2008 but has since rebounded to 1.0%. Research into energy has also declined from 2.1% (2000) to just 0.3% (2012). Overall, though, the allocation of government R spending seems to be relatively stable.|$|E
