5|$|Both {{supporters}} and critics of Cheney regard {{him as a}} shrewd and knowledgeable politician who knows the functions and <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> the federal government. A sign of Cheney's active policy-making role was then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert's provision of an office near the House floor for Cheney {{in addition to his}} office in the West Wing, his ceremonial office in the Old Executive Office Building, and his Senate offices (one in the Dirksen Senate Office Building and another off the floor of the Senate).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Sanchez entered the eighth grade, he had {{developed}} an interest in football but was unsure of what position to play. His father consulted coaches Bill Cunerty, who formerly coached at Saddleback College, and Bob Johnson, the head coach at Mission Viejo High School. Both coaches stated Mark could be a quarterback if he applied himself and was open to learning the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> the position. Nick Sr. trained Mark during sessions in their backyard or at the park. Mark, who was attending Santa Margarita High School, joined the football team. During his first pass attempt as a sophomore, Mark threw a 55-yard touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each ignoring the other, {{at least in the}} public eye. However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by protecting and expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention {{came in the form of}} building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the Communists and constantly bombing the trail. They also provided heavy support for the Laotian government.|$|E

5|$|Jennings was {{determined}} to build his journalism credentials abroad. In 1968, he established ABC's Middle East bureau in Beirut, Lebanon, the first American television news bureau in the Arab world. The next year, he demonstrated his growing expertise in Middle Eastern affairs with Palestine: New State of Mind, a well-received half-hour documentary for ABC's Now news program. As ABC's Beirut bureau chief, Jennings soon became familiar with the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> the Arab–Israeli conflict, including {{the rise of the}} Palestinian Black September Organization during the early 1970s. He conducted the first American television interview with Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat. While stationed in the Lebanese capital, Jennings dated Palestinian activist Hanan Ashrawi, who was then a graduate student in literature at the American University in Beirut.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's writing {{technique}} was unpretentious {{with a natural}} element of humour about it. It focused on ordinary people, reminding the reader of next-door neighbours, cousins and the like, thereby providing a greater ability {{to relate to the}} topic. Unlike his national contemporaries, he was able to write about the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> Indian society without having to modify his characteristic simplicity to conform to trends and fashions in fiction writing. He also employed the use of nuanced dialogic prose with gentle Tamil overtones based on the nature of his characters. Critics have considered Narayan to be the Indian Chekhov, due to the similarities in their writings, the simplicity and the gentle beauty and humour in tragic situations. Greene considered Narayan to be more similar to Chekhov than any Indian writer. Anthony West of The New Yorker considered Narayan's writings to be of the realism variety of Nikolai Gogol.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the Everglades region for {{thousands}} of years. Within the past 100years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.|$|E

5|$|Sanchez {{grew up in}} a well-disciplined and {{athletic}} family. In the eighth grade, he began to play football and learn the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> the quarterback position, training with his father, Nick. A well-regarded prospect, Sanchez committed to Southern California following his successful high school career in which he led his team to a championship title during his senior season. At USC, Sanchez was relegated as the backup quarterback during his first three years though he rose to prominence due to his brief appearances on the field in 2007 due to injuries suffered by starting quarterback John David Booty. Sanchez also became popular within the community due to his Mexican-American heritage. Named the starter in 2008, Sanchez led USC to a 12–1 record and won the Rose Bowl against Penn State for which Sanchez was awarded the Most Valuable Player award for his performance on offense.|$|E
5|$|There {{was only}} one public {{pre-season}} friendly on 13 August, which saw the club's first team take on the reserves; it ended with a surprise 4–2 victory for the reserves, Roland Lewis scoring a hat-trick. Pre-season training consisted primarily of assistant manager Ken Fish leading a marathon running session from Burslem to Hanley and back to Burslem following a stop at a pub for a half-pint of shandy. After returning to the ground Fish would organise a practise game. The fitness work was actually crucial to the team's success, as Steele was {{ahead of his time}} in that he insisted that wide players should defend when the opposition were on the ball, in order to support the defence. Superstition was of great importance to Steele, who ensured that the team rigidly stuck their pre-match rituals such as the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> kit layout and the order in which players entered the pitch.|$|E
5|$|And the Band Played On {{was used}} as the basis for a 1993 Primetime Emmy Award-winning HBO {{television}} film of the same name. It was produced by Aaron Spelling, directed by Roger Spottiswoode, and starred Matthew Modine as epidemiologist Don Francis and Richard Masur as William Darrow at the Centers for Disease Control. Alan Alda portrayed controversial viral researcher Robert Gallo, and many other stars appeared in supporting and cameo roles, who agreed to appear in the film for union-scale pay. The film was released the same year as Philadelphia and , which prompted one reviewer to note it a triumph and a loss: 12 years after the epidemic had begun, such works of art were necessary still to draw attention to it. Reviews of the film were mixed, claiming that it was a noble try, but failed to be comprehensive enough to cover all the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> the response to AIDS. However, And the Band Played On, along with other well-received films at the time, was noted for raising the standards of HBO-produced films.|$|E

5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players had complained the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E
5|$|One of the Wattle Birds, Anderson's {{seventh and}} final novel, was {{published}} in 1994. Set in Sydney, it details three days {{in the life of}} Cecily Ambruss. Although the novel is ostensibly set in the present, the final paragraph of the novel reveals that the three-day sequence has been devised by Cecily as a means of coping with the fact that a year earlier, her mother, Christine had died of breast cancer, while Cecily had been away on holiday. Throughout the novel, Cecily attempts to resolve two quandaries: she does not understand why her mother did not tell her about that fatal illness and let her go overseas, refusing to let family members call her back, even for the funeral, nor why Christine included the cruel stipulation in her will that Cecily must marry before she can inherit. In addition to its adept depiction of the <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> social and family life, One of the Wattle Birds speaks to the process of writing and creating, as Cecily is herself a writer.|$|E
5|$|The {{important}} {{relationship between}} ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible {{with the development}} of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication Molecular Ecology in 1992. Molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution. Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and nematodes. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny <b>intricacies</b> <b>of</b> nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology. For example, molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous. In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called phylogeography.|$|E
