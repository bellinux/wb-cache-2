5|$|Pattle joined No. 80 Squadron RAF. The {{squadron}} was in {{the midst}} of re-forming at RAF Kenley and he was able to fly the Gloster Gladiator fighter for the first time in May 1937. In June, the unit moved to RAF Debden. Here, they practised aerial combat against RAF Bomber Command squadrons which staged mock raids against London. During these exercises, he mastered deflection shooting. Pattle developed his own air tactics. He preferred attacking at higher altitudes than his quarry, meeting head-on, then waiting for the enemy to fly by before rolling over and diving to attack from the side and rear of the enemy. He usually held his fire until very close to the target to make sure of hitting his opponent. His qualities as an officer led to him being promoted to squadron adjutant. A gifted flyer and natural marksman, he took pains to improve both talents, doing exercises to improve his <b>distance</b> <b>vision</b> and sharpen his reflexes. He progressed in rank with the squadron and was duly promoted to pilot officer on 27 July 1937.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of terns cannot {{accommodate}} under water, so {{they rely}} on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens <b>distance</b> <b>vision,</b> especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.|$|E

25|$|In {{all types}} of surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and {{replaced}} with an artificial lens, known as an intraocular lens, which stays in the eye permanently. Intraocular lenses are usually monofocal, correcting for either distance or near vision. Multifocal lenses may be implanted to improve near and <b>distance</b> <b>vision</b> simultaneously, but these lenses may increase the chance of unsatisfactory vision.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{sclerosis}} is {{the most}} common type of cataract, and involves the central or 'nuclear' part of the lens. This eventually becomes hard, or 'sclerotic', due to condensation on the lens nucleus and the deposition of brown pigment within the lens. In its advanced stages it is called a brunescent cataract. This type of cataract can present with a shift to nearsightedness, causing problems with <b>distance</b> <b>vision</b> though reading is less affected.|$|E
25|$|Some bird {{groups have}} {{specific}} modifications to their visual system linked to {{their way of}} life.

The placement of their eyes gives them good binocular vision enabling accurate judgement of distances. Nocturnal species have tubular eyes, low numbers of colour detectors, but a high density of rod cells which function well in poor light. Terns, gulls and albatrosses are amongst the seabirds which have red or yellow oil droplets in the colour receptors to improve <b>distance</b> <b>vision</b> especially in hazy conditions.|$|E

25|$|Monovision {{is the use}} of single-vision lenses (one {{focal point}} per lens) to focus an eye (typically the {{dominant}} one) for <b>distance</b> <b>vision</b> and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, who are at risk of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.|$|E
25|$|The visual {{ability of}} {{birds of prey}} is legendary, and the keenness of their {{eyesight}} {{is due to a}} variety of factors. Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The resolving power of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in American kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long <b>distance</b> <b>vision.</b> It is proposed that the shape of the deep central fovea of raptors can create a telephoto optical system, increasing the size of the retinal image in the fovea and thereby increasing the spatial resolution. Behavioural studies show that some large eyed raptors (Wedge-tailed eagle, Old world vultures) and have ca 2 times higher spatial resolution than humans, but many medium and small sized raptors have comparable or lower spatial resolution.|$|E

50|$|Much {{of current}} {{research}} {{is focused on}} how larvae, especially larval fish, navigate in the pelagic zone and ultimately {{find a place to}} settle. While larvae are very tiny and have limited complexity, they actually have very active and useful sensory systems. Fish can hear a range from about 100 to 1000 Hz and the ear is developed within the first two days of larval life. Sound is a useful tool for larvae because the ocean is not a quiet place. Coral reefs, for example, are quite noisy and likely provide a large stimulus for larvae looking to settle there. Olfaction, or the sense of smell, is also used by larvae, but on a smaller scale. Chemical signals that are detected through olfaciton have a limited lifetime in the ocean and do not travel long <b>distances.</b> <b>Vision</b> is used by larvae in two ways. The first is what is commonly thought of as vision, observing the immediate surroundings. This is useful for larvae in predator avoidance and prey detection but the limited visibility in some oceans and the small scale do not make this a useful tool for finding a settlement site. Studies have found that fish can detect polarized light and this is used to orient themselves in the water and can direct larval to settlement regions as a solar compass. It is likely that larvae use a combination of all these sensory systems when locating settlement sites. Although these sensory systems exist in larvae, they are highly reduced. Upon settlement or metamorphosis, there is large development in the sensitivity and proliferation of these systems. Understanding how larvae navigate the ocean has very useful implications for managing fisheries and marine protected areas.|$|R
