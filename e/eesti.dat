5|$|Kalep died on 15 August 1989, aged 90, in the Regency Health Care Center of Lake Worth, Florida. She {{had lived}} in the {{facility}} since 1986. She had been married three times but had no surviving family {{at the time of her}} death. Obituaries for Kalep were published in the Florida newspaper the Sun-Sentinel and Vaba <b>Eesti</b> Sõna, an Estonian-language newspaper published in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, <b>Eesti</b> Kiviõli and New Consolidated Gold Fields {{established}} the service station chain Trustivapaa Bensiini (now: Teboil) in Finland, which in 1940 sold more shale-oil-derived gasoline in Finland {{than did the}} entire conventional gasoline market in Estonia. Since 1935, Estonian shale oil has been supplied to the German Kriegsmarine as a ship fuel. In 1938, 45% of Estonian shale oil was exported, accounting for 8% of Estonia's total exports. Although {{the price of oil}} shale-based gasoline was at least triple that of global gasoline prices, high production and bilateral agreements with Germany facilitated its export. In 1939, Estonia produced 181,000tonnes of shale oil, including 22,500tonnes of oil that were suitable gasoline equivalents. The mining and oil industry employed 6,150 persons.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the 48MW Kohtla-Järve Power Station– {{the first}} power {{station in the}} world to use {{pulverised}} oil shale at an industrial scale– was commissioned, followed by the 72.5MW Ahtme Power Station in 1951. To ensure sufficient electricity supply in Estonia, Latvia and north-west Russia, the Balti Power Station (1,430MW) and the <b>Eesti</b> Power Station (1,610MW) were built, the former between 1959 and 1971 and the latter between 1969 and 1973. The stations, collectively known as the Narva Power Stations, are the world's two largest oil shale-fired power stations. In 1988 Moscow-based authorities planned a third oil shale-fired power station in Narva with a capacity of 2,500MW, together with a new mine at Kuremäe. The plan, disclosed {{at the time of the}} Phosphorite War and the Singing Revolution, met with strong local opposition and was never implemented.|$|E
5|$|The {{shale oil}} {{industry}} at Kohtla-Järve and Kiviõli was redeveloped. In 1945, the first tunnel kiln was restored, {{and by the}} end of the 1940s four tunnel kilns located in Kiviõli and Kohtla-Nõmme had been restored. German prisoners of war contributed most of the labour. Between 1946 and 1963, 13Kiviter-type retorts were built in Kohtla-Järve and eight in Kiviõli. In 1947, a pilot Galoter retort was built at the Ilmarine engineering plant in Tallinn. This unit, in operation until 1956, was capable of processing 2.5tonnes of oil shale per day and was used for modelling the next generation of commercial-scale retorts. The first Galoter-type commercial-scale pilot retorts were built at Kiviõli in 1953 and 1963 with capacities of 200 and 500tonnes of oil shale per day, respectively. The first of these retorts closed in 1963 and the second in 1981. The Narva Oil Plant, annexed to the <b>Eesti</b> Power Station and operating two Galoter-type 3,000-tonnes-per day retorts, was commissioned in 1980. Started as a pilot plant, the process of converting it to a commercial-scale plant took about 20years.|$|E

They were engaged in slash and burn agriculture, animal husbandry, hunting and fishing. From the 8th to the 13th century, the Gulf of Finland and Neva were parts of the waterway from Scandinavia, through Eastern Europe to the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, Sander {{took the}} role of a judge in <b>Eesti</b> otsib superstaari, an Estonian version of Pop Idol. Another major success was the program Su nägu kõlab tuttavalt (Your Face Sounds Familiar), a musical parody show, that premiered in April 2013 on TV3 and became an instant hit with the viewers. In 2014, he created a role in the TV movie The last round, which the cast also took to {{theatrical}} tour in 2015. Sander has often been compared to the American talk show host Conan O'Brien, based on both their physical resemblance as well as their razor sharp wit and wicked sense of humour. To this Sander has characteristically replied that Conan is obviously imitating him, as his career has been lasting twice as long as that of Conan O'Brien (even though Conan O'Brien is older, Sander began his TV career at the age of 7).|$|E
500|$|In 1995, the Government of Estonia started {{negotiations}} with American company NRG Energy {{to create a}} joint venture {{on the basis of}} the Narva Power Stations, the largest consumer of oil shale in Estonia. As a part of the deal, 51% of the government-owned shares in the oil shale mining company <b>Eesti</b> Põlevkivi was transferred to the Narva Power Stations. [...] The proposed deal with NRG Energy met a strong public and political opposition and was cancelled after NRG Energy failed the deadline to secure financing for the project. [...] Consequently, the Government transferred its remained shares in <b>Eesti</b> Põlevkivi to a state-owned company <b>Eesti</b> Energia, a parent company of the Narva Power Stations, and <b>Eesti</b> Põlevkivi became a fully owned subsidiary of <b>Eesti</b> Energia.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} shale-oil {{producers}} in Estonia. [...] In 2012, VKG Oil (a subsidiary of Viru Keemia Grupp) produced 370,000tonnes of shale oil, <b>Eesti</b> Energia Õlitööstus (a subsidiary of <b>Eesti</b> Energia) produced 211,000tonnes, and Kiviõli Keemiatööstus (a subsidiary of Alexela Energia) produced 70,000tonnes. [...] Two processes– the Kiviter {{process and the}} Galoter process– are in use for shale oil extraction. [...] <b>Eesti</b> Energia Õlitööstus uses the Galoter process while VKG Oil and Kiviõli Keemiatööstus use both– Kiviter and Galoter processes.|$|E
500|$|In 1945–1946 {{the mining}} {{industry}} was merged into <b>Eesti</b> Põlevkivi ( [...] , , now <b>Eesti</b> Energia Kaevandused) under the General Directorate of Oil Shale Industry of the USSR (Glavslanets). Shale oil extraction, except the Kiviõli and Kohtla-Nõmme plants, was merged into the Kohtla-Järve shale oil combinate ( [...] , now Viru Keemia Grupp) under the General Directorate of Synthetic Liquid Fuel and Gas of the USSR (Glavgaztopprom). Both organisations were directed from Moscow.|$|E
500|$|<b>Eesti</b> Energia {{owns the}} largest oil shale-fuelled power {{stations}} (Narva Power Stations) in the world. and SO2 emissions until 2030 ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, two {{power units}} with {{circulating}} fluidised bed combustion boilers were put into operation at the Narva Power Stations. [...] Construction of the Auvere Power Station, located next to the existing <b>Eesti</b> Power Station, began in 2012. [...] In the end of 2012, the Ahtme Power Station was closed.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, <b>Eesti</b> Energia {{established}} a joint venture, Enefit Outotec Technology, with the Finnish technology company Outotec. The venture sought {{to develop and}} commercialise a modified Galoter process–the Enefit process–that would enhance the existing technology by using circulating fluidised beds. [...] In 2013, Enefit Outotec Technology opened an Enefit testing plant in Frankfurt.|$|E
500|$|Kiviõli Keemiatööstus {{began to}} test two Galoter-type retorts in 2006. [...] <b>Eesti</b> Energia {{opened a new}} {{generation}} Galoter-type plant using Enefit 280 technology in 2012. [...] VKG Oil opened three new Galoter-type oil plants called Petroter correspondingly in December 2009, in October 2014, and in November 2015. [...] In January 2016, the company announced that due to low oil price, it will close the old oil plants using Kiviter technology and lay off 500workers.|$|E
500|$|The Narva open-pit mine is {{operated}} by <b>Eesti</b> Energia Kaevandused, and the Põhja-Kiviõli open-pit mine {{is operated}} by privately owned Kiviõli Keemiatööstus. Both mines use highly selective extraction in three layers of seams. The Narva mine uses {{a technology that}} involves breaking up both the overburden and the targeted deposits by blasting and then stripping the rock with relatively large-bucket (...) excavators. The third open-pit mine, operated by Kunda Nordic Tsement which belongs to German HeidelbergCement group, is located at Ubja.|$|E
500|$|The Estonia {{underground}} mine at Väike-Pungerja, operated by state owned <b>Eesti</b> Energia Kaevandused, {{is the largest}} oil shale mine in the world. The other {{underground mine}}, operated by privately owned Viru Keemia Grupp, is located at Ojamaa. Both mines use the room and pillar mining method. Oil shale mined at Ojamaa is transported to the processing plant by a unique [...] conveyor belt. Although there are similar conveyors in operation in other countries, the one at Ojamaa is an unusually challenging installation since its path contains many curves and sharp turns.|$|E
500|$|Shale oil {{production}} started in Estonia in 1921 when Riigi Põlevkivitööstus built 14experimental oil shale processing retorts in Kohtla-Järve. These vertical retorts used the method developed by Julius Pintsch AG {{that would later}} evolve into the current Kiviter processing technology. [...] Along with the shale oil extraction plant, an oil shale research laboratory was founded in 1921. Following the experimental retorts, the first commercial shale oil plant was put into operation on 24 December 1924. [...] The German-owned company <b>Eesti</b> Kiviõli ( [...] , , predecessor of Kiviõli Keemiatööstus), affiliated with G. Scheel & Co. and Mendelssohn & Co., was established in 1922. By {{the end of the}} 1930s, it had become the largest shale oil producer in Estonia. Around the company's mine and oil plant, the Kiviõli settlement (now town) was formed {{in the same way as}} the Küttejõu settlement (now district of Kiviõli) formed around the mine owned by <b>Eesti</b> Küttejõud. In 1924, the British investor-owned Estonian Oil Development Syndicate Ltd. (later Vanamõisa Oilfields Ltd.) purchased an open-pit mine in Vanamõisa and opened a shale oil extraction plant that was abandoned in 1931 due to technical problems. The Swedish–Norwegian consortium Eestimaa Õlikonsortsium ( [...] , [...] ), controlled by Marcus Wallenberg, was founded in Sillamäe in 1926. New Consolidated Gold Fields Ltd. of the United Kingdom built a shale oil extraction plant at Kohtla-Nõmme in 1931. This facility continued to operate until 1961.|$|E
