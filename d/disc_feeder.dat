40|$|The time {{defined and}} {{continuous}} powder supply {{is one of}} the main preconditions of laser cladding, alloying and particle injection. Powder feeders available from thermal spraying technique fulfill the laser typical requirements only incomplete. Therefore the development of a new powder feeding device was necessary. The presented <b>disc</b> <b>feeder</b> system with integrated measurement and control of the powder mass flow permits the dosage of metallic, carbidic and ceramic powders bigger than 20 mym with feeding rates of 1 to 150 g/min and tolerances of less than 5 percent. The powder mass flow measurement system makes a fast and precise setting, long time constancy as well as a variable control of the feeding rate during the whole treating process possible...|$|E
40|$|Only in the {{construction}} industry millions of tons of bulk materials that need to be transported to the place of processing, storing and evenly or dosed feeding are recycled annually. Decreasing the costs of these processes will significantly reduce the cost of the finished product. The article presents a review of studies conducted in the field of storage, transport and feed bulk materials, and it describes the innovative design of energy-efficient <b>disc</b> vibrating <b>feeder</b> bulk materials...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} various small-particle plasma spray powder {{injection}} parameters on the in situ particle position, velocity, and temperature is measured for yttria-stabilized zirconia and yttrium-aluminum-garnet powder. Using full-factorial experiments and multiple regression analysis, carrier gas flow, injector angle, and powder <b>feeder</b> <b>disc</b> speed {{were found to}} significantly affect the particle properties. Temperature and velocity were inversely related; on average, the cooler particles traveled faster. These properties also correlated to the particle position in the flame, where particles above the centerline of the flame traveled faster. The trends are discussed {{on the basis of}} residence time in the flame, as well as in terms of particle size segregation effects. Coating density and splat geometry reflect the temperature and velocity differences between the runs. Slower, hotter particles possessed more intrasplat and intersplat porosity and less splat-substrate contact area, leading to lower overall coating density...|$|R
