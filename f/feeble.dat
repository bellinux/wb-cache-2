5|$|The sand whiting has a {{very similar}} profile to {{other members of the}} genus Sillago, with a {{slightly}} compressed, elongate body tapering toward the terminal mouth. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first made of <b>feeble</b> spines and the second of soft rays headed by a single <b>feeble</b> spine, while the ventral profile is straight. The species is known to grow to a maximum size of 51cm and around 1.25kg weight.|$|E

5|$|With their closed valence shells, {{the noble}} gases {{have the highest}} first {{ionization}} potentials in each of their periods, and <b>feeble</b> interatomic forces of attraction, with the latter property resulting in very low melting and boiling points.

2500|$|Jackson's {{next film}} to see release was Meet the <b>Feebles</b> (1989), co-written with Sinclair, Walsh and Mulheron. An {{ensemble}} musical comedy starring Muppet-style puppets, Meet the <b>Feebles</b> originally {{began as a}} short film intended for television, but was rapidly expanded into a full-length film after unexpected enthusiasm from Japanese investors, {{and the collapse of}} Braindead, six weeks before filming. Begun on a very low budget, Meet the <b>Feebles</b> went weeks over schedule. Jackson stated of his second feature-length film, [...] "It's got a quality of humour that alienates a lot of people.. It's very black, very satirical, very savage." [...] <b>Feebles</b> marked Jackson's first collaboration with special effects team Richard Taylor and Tania Rodger, who would later work on all Jackson's movies. Jackson's next release was the horror comedy Braindead (1992) (released in North America as Dead Alive).|$|R
5|$|Around 956, Olaf, at Melkorka's urging, {{decided to}} go abroad to seek his fortune. Hoskuld was opposed and would not provide trade wares, and the {{property}} of Olaf's foster-father Thord was mostly in immobile goods and land. In part to arrange financing for his expedition, his mother Melkorka married Thorbjorn the <b>Feeble,</b> a farmer who had previously assisted her {{in the management of}} Melkorkustead. Melkorka and Thorbjorn had a son named Lambi.|$|E
5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the {{tinkering}} with Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later on, {{but only if the}} writing improves.

5|$|Preliminary {{designs for}} the Prophets, {{including}} the Hierarchs, were done by artist Shi Kai Wang. According to The Art of Halo, the Prophets were designed to look <b>feeble,</b> yet sinister. Originally, the Prophets appeared to be fused to the special hovering thrones they use for transport; even in the final designs, the Prophets are made {{to be dependent on}} their technology.

5|$|The years {{following}} the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict. A <b>feeble</b> attempt at a common peace {{had been made in}} 375 BC, but desultory fighting between Athens and Sparta had resumed by 373BC (at the latest). By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.|$|E
5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} {{geomagnetic}} storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass ejection from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively <b>feeble,</b> the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 5th National Congress, the party {{leadership}} had turned into a veritable gerontocracy. The five most powerful Politburo members were all over the age of 70; Lê Duẩn was 74, Trường Chinh was 75, Phạm Văn Đồng was 76, Phạm Hùng was 70 and Lê Đức Thọ was 72. Lê Duẩn {{is believed to have been}} in bad health during this period; he had travelled to the Soviet Union on several occasions for medical treatment during the late-1970s and early 1980s. It was reported that Lê Duẩn did not lead the party delegates of the 5th National Congress to the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum because of his deteriorating health. Lê Duẩn looked both <b>feeble</b> and old; he had problems reading his report to the Congress.|$|E

5|$|The adult has {{two pairs}} of long, narrow, multiveined, {{translucent}} wings and a long, slender abdomen. Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies, they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects. Antlion adults are easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent, apically clubbed antennae which are {{about as long as}} the head and thorax combined. Also, the pattern of wing venation differs, and compared to damselflies, the adults are very <b>feeble</b> fliers and are normally found fluttering about at night in search of a mate. Adult antlions are typically nocturnal, and rarely seen by day.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} also react {{similarly}} with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides, where the hydride anion {{acts as a}} pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the cyanides. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. Ternary alkali metal halide oxides, such as Na3ClO, K3BrO (yellow), Na4Br2O, Na4I2O, and K4Br2O, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the <b>feeble</b> polarising power of these extremely large cations.|$|E
5|$|Adapted from The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens, {{the film}} has been {{shortened}} and streamlined for the single reel format. The film focuses on a grandfather who gambles himself into poverty. He dotes on his granddaughter, Little Nell, and desires to give her every luxury. The grandfather turns to gambling to try and earn money, firmly believing that luck would favor him. His gambling results in losing everything and Nell fears {{that he will be}} taken away to an asylum. At night, Nell flees with him and they find refuge and shelter with Mrs. Jarley. The grandfather, seeking to win money, robs Nell of her money and proceeds to gamble it away. The grandfather is coerced by men to steal to pay the debts, but Nell intervenes and flees with her grandfather again. Exhausted and <b>feeble</b> in health, Nell meets a kind schoolmaster and appeals to him for aid before falling unconscious at his feet. The schoolmaster takes the two in, but it is too late to save Nell and she dies. Her grandfather is brokenhearted and is found dead on her grave several days later.|$|E
5|$|Further {{action was}} not taken until 1902, when new {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette. A new Prison Act was passed in 1903, replacing sixteen previous acts. It provided for classification of prisoners, provision of adequate work for prisoners, and the creation of the position of comptroller general of prisons, to assume the functions the sheriff had undertaken as inspector of prisons. While in theory the passing of the act should have been a landmark moment in prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a <b>feeble</b> document. Other problems included Fremantle Prison's inscrutability for classification, due to its design, and that the sheriff was allowed to hold the office of comptroller general of prisons, effectively making it no more than a change in name.|$|E
