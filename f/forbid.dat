5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature.

Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat.

The paper demonstrates that some well-known relationships concerning the language families resulting from ordinary ET 0 L grammars do not hold in terms of the <b>forbidding</b> ET 0 L grammars. Most interestingly, while E 0 L grammars are less powerful than ET 0 L grammars, their <b>forbidding</b> versions with conditions of length one are equally powerful. On the other hand, while EP 0 L grammars are as powerful as E 0 L grammars, FEP 0 L grammars are less powerful than FE 0 L grammars...|$|R

While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, {{been transformed into a}} hideous demon. She musters enough strength to <b>forbid</b> Finn and Jake from coming back to the Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal.|$|E

5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings was accomplished by Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize the decorations rather than to go through the standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to <b>forbid</b> Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E
