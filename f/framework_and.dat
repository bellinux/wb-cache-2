5|$|By {{the end of}} {{his first}} term, Rosas was {{generally}} credited with having staved off political and financial instability, but he faced increased opposition in the House of Representatives. All members of the House were Federalists, as Rosas had restored the legislature that had been in place under Dorrego, and which had subsequently been dissolved by Lavalle. A liberal Federalist faction, which accepted dictatorship as a temporary necessity, called for the adoption of a constitution. Rosas was unwilling to govern constrained by a constitutional <b>framework</b> <b>and</b> only grudgingly relinquished his dictatorial powers. His term of office ended soon after, on 5 December 1832.|$|E

These were probably worn only in tournaments, not battle: not only did they add to the already considerable weight of the helm, they could also have been used by opponents as a handle to pull the wearer's head down.|$|E

In general, these <b>frameworks</b> <b>and</b> methodologies focus on interpretations of the static state of a system. They also often support the analysis of parts and the specific processes that can scrutinize individual aspects of complexities. Conversely, they can also produce generalized overviews that aim to reduce the complexities. However, the conceptual nature of complex dynamics demands that the <b>frameworks</b> <b>and</b> methodologies should adequately internalize both of these ends.b This means that {{in the face of}} complex dynamics, observation processes {{play a key role in}} the evaluation of sustainability.|$|R
