A 7 day course of daily intravenous amikacin and ceftazidime was initiated along with twice daily intravesicular amikacin <b>irrigations</b> (15 mg/ 30 mL) with a dwell time of 2 hours. The patient improved and was discharged on prophylactic Bactrim SS (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) 1 tablet daily and intravesicular amikacin <b>irrigations</b> (15 mg/ 30 mL) once every other day. Approximately 2 months after discharge, the patient developed another UTI from multidrug resistant Escherichia coli and was treated with a 14 day course of daily intravenous ciprofloxacin accompanied by daily intravesicular amikacin <b>irrigations.</b> Adjunctive therapy with either once daily or twice daily intravesicular amikacin <b>irrigations</b> successfully treated the patient's UTI.

5|$|<b>Irrigation</b> systems: In {{the modern}} Sichuan region {{belonging}} to the State of Qin of ancient China, the Dujiangyan <b>Irrigation</b> System devised by the Qin Chinese hydrologist and <b>irrigation</b> engineer Li Bing was built in 256 BCE to irrigate a vast area of farmland that today still supplies water. By the 2nd century AD, during the Han Dynasty, the Chinese also used chain pumps that lifted water from a lower elevation to higher one. These were powered by manual foot pedal, hydraulic waterwheels, or rotating mechanical wheels pulled by oxen. The water was used for public works of providing water for urban residential quarters and palace gardens, but mostly for <b>irrigation</b> of farmland canals and channels in the fields.|$|E

The River Murray Waters Agreement of 1915 allowed 26 weirs to be constructed with locks to provide permanent riverboat access to Echuca. When riverboat transport was no longer significant, the weirs supported <b>irrigation.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> in the region continued to develop with the construction of the Hume Dam between 1919 and 1931, the Burrinjuck Dam built in 1928 and Blowering Dam built in 1968.|$|E
5|$|Snowfall can be {{beneficial}} to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator, conserving {{the heat of the}} Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth, both directly and via runoff through streams and rivers, which supply <b>irrigation</b> canals. The following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an important part of their flow on which <b>irrigation</b> depends: the Ganges, many of whose tributaries rise in the Himalayas and which provide much <b>irrigation</b> in northeast India, the Indus River, which rises in Tibet and provides <b>irrigation</b> water to Pakistan from rapidly retreating Tibetan glaciers, and the Colorado River, which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and provides <b>irrigation</b> water to some 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Smoking is a self-destructive {{behavior}} that is known to induce remodeling of the lower airways, leading to squamous metaplasia, but {{little is known about}} its effects on the nose and paranasal sinuses. Nasal <b>irrigations</b> are often mentioned as measures for treating sinonasal inflammations. The purpose of our study was to compare the effects of nasal <b>irrigations</b> with sulfurous-arsenical-ferruginous thermal water or isotonic sodium chloride solution in smokers with nonallergic chronic rhinosinusitis, based on clinical and olfactory evidence. Materials and methods: The present study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind study performed in a tertiary academic referral center. Seventy smokers with nonallergic chronic rhinitis were enrolled. Nasal endoscopy, rhinomanometry, nasal cytology, and odor threshold measurements were performed in subjects randomized to daily nasal <b>irrigations</b> with either thermal water or isotonic sodium chloride solution for 1 month. Results: Immediately after the treatment, the thermal water <b>irrigations</b> revealed a positive pharmacologic action, judging from a tendency toward lower nasal resistances (P =. 07) and larger numbers of ciliated cells in the patients treated (P =. 003). Endoscopic findings in the thermal water group were still better than in the control group a further 2 months later (P =. 03). Conclusions: Our results indicate that nasal <b>irrigations</b> with thermal water had a good effect on endoscopic objective signs, nasal resistances, and epithelial trophism...|$|R
