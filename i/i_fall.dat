25|$|If, therefore, in the {{following}} pages <b>I</b> <b>fall</b> into any errors, I hope they will be dealt with as honest mistakes, and not as indicating that I have forgotten our ancient motto.

Our ancestors were Roman Catholics; they were made Protestants by the laird coming round with a man having a yellow staff, which would seem to have attracted more attention than his teaching, for the new religion went long afterward, perhaps it does so still, by the name of “the religion of the yellow stick”.|$|E

500|$|On {{behalf of}} Digital Spy, Catriona Wightman {{suggested}} that Cyrus was [...] "writing lyrics based on real-life experience" [...] {{in a fashion}} similar to Taylor Swift; she assumed that the lyrics [...] "cried" [...] and [...] "lied" [...] acknowledged the reportedly turbulent relationship she experienced with Hemsworth.

500|$|In {{a review}} for Q, writer Hugh Montgomery noted genres such as disco ("Shampain"), bubblegum punk ("Girls") and cabaret ("Hermit The Frog"). The opening track, [...] "Are You Satisfied?", ponders {{the meaning of}} a {{fulfilling}} life; a writer for The Line of Best Fit likened it to the thinking of Danish existentialist philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. In a January 2010 interview with The Daily Telegraph, Diamandis admitted that she [...] "cringes" [...] at the lyrics of the song [...] "Girls", which [...] "could be seen as a bit misogynistic", including the lines [...] "Girls they never befriend me/'Cause <b>I</b> <b>fall</b> asleep when they speak/Of all the calories they eat"; she clarified that the lyrics concerned her own psychological problems with weight. A Neon Gold press release for a limited double A-side of [...] "Obsessions" [...] and [...] "Mowgli's Road" [...] described the former as a [...] "bold and ambitious... master work" [...] and the latter as a [...] "a high intensity, left field pop smash".|$|E
500|$|The first logicians {{to debate}} {{conditional}} statements were Diodorus Cronus and his pupil Philo. Writing five-hundred years later, Sextus Empiricus {{refers to a}} debate between Diodorus and Philo. Philo regarded all conditionals as true except those which with a correct antecedent had an incorrect consequent, and this meant a proposition such as [...] "if it is day, then I am talking," [...] is true unless it is day and <b>I</b> <b>fall</b> silent. But Diodorus argued that a true conditional {{is one in which}} the antecedent clause could never lead to an untrue conclusion – thus, because the proposition [...] "if it is day, then I am talking" [...] can be false, it is invalid. However, paradoxical propositions were still possible such as [...] "if atomic elements of things do not exist, atomic elements exists." [...] Chrysippus adopted a much stricter view regarding conditional propositions, which made such paradoxes impossible: to him, a conditional is true if denial of the consequent is logically incompatible with the antecedent. This corresponds to the modern-day strict conditional.|$|E
500|$|Producers of {{the show}} cast Naturi Naughton as Bunny Brenda. Naughton auditioned four times for the role before getting cast, singing the Nat King Cole song [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Fall</b> in Love" [...] {{during one of the}} auditions. In researching the role, Naughton {{consulted}} the black former Playboy Bunny Pat Lacey, watched the documentary film The Bunny Years (1999) and read the book 50 Years of the Playboy Bunny. Brenda was loosely based on the model Jennifer Jackson, the actual first Black [...] "Playmate of the Month", although neither Naughton nor the Playboy Club producers contacted Jackson in preparing the role. Providing the role of the manager of the Playboy Club, Billy Rosen, David Krumholtz exclaimed that he was drawn to the character and wished to play a role different from Charlie Eppes, the character he played for six seasons on the crime drama Numb3rs. Other members of the main cast include Jenna Dewan, Laura Benanti, Leah Renee, Wes Ramsey, and Sean Maher. Hugh Hefner performed a brief voice-over narration during the pilot episode.|$|E
