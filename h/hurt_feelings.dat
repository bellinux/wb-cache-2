But when the agreeable Danny learns of Jenna's <b>hurt</b> <b>feelings,</b> he arranges for them to perform a duet, in which he sings off-key to make Jenna look good.|$|E

25|$|The {{award was}} {{originally}} intended {{to be made in}} the 1975 Queen's Birthday Honours, but since there was a royal visit to Barbados planned for February 1975, it was moved forward to the New Year list so that Sobers could be knighted by the Queen in person during the visit. The very short turnaround between the decision to make the award and its announcement meant that the Governor-General of Barbados was not informed of the award before the public announcement, which caused some <b>hurt</b> <b>feelings</b> between London and Bridgetown.|$|E
25|$|After a {{decision}} process ends, leaders should {{reflect on the}} process and try to derive lessons learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively. Since reflections can lead to new insight, individuals must take time to critically assess the experience. They also must address and repair any <b>hurt</b> <b>feelings</b> and damaged relationships {{that may not have}} been apparent during the process itself. If these relationships are not repaired, trust could be lost which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive conflict management and help others to remember the success of the process (Roberto, 2005).|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1870, Crazy Horse invited Black Buffalo Woman to {{accompany}} him on a buffalo hunt in the Slim Buttes area of present-day northwestern South Dakota. She was the wife of No Water, who {{had a reputation for}} drinking too much. It was Lakota custom to allow a woman to divorce her husband at any time. She did so by moving in with relatives or with another man, or by placing the husband's belongings outside their lodge. Although some compensation might be required to smooth over <b>hurt</b> <b>feelings,</b> the rejected husband was expected to accept his wife's decision. No Water was away from camp when Crazy Horse and Black Buffalo Woman left for the buffalo hunt.|$|E

Although Gilbert and Sullivan were persuaded to collaborate on two last operas, they were not as successful as the previous ones. In later years, Gilbert wrote several plays, and a few operas with other collaborators. He retired, with his wife Lucy, and their ward, Nancy McIntosh, to a country estate, Grim's Dyke. He was knighted in 1907. Gilbert died of a heart attack while attempting to rescue a young woman to whom he was giving a swimming lesson in the lake at his home.|$|E
500|$|Nicole's {{best friend}} during her initial storylines was Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance). After Brendan Austin (Kain O'Keeffe) caused Roman to go blind, {{he took his}} anger out on Nicole and Aden. Subsequently they became [...] "each other's support network" [...] and Lasance {{said it was not}} long {{afterward}} that they [...] "slipped between the sheets". One of the conditions of Aden's tenancy was to never sleep with Nicole, this made the pair feel guilty that they had deceived Roman. Lasance felt the storyline was controversial as he had a strong fan base for his relationship with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) - which meant he knew it would [...] "cause a stir" [...] and divide the audience. In January2010, Nicole and Aden [...] "get up close and personal" [...] and they decided to spend Aden's remaining time in the Bay together. They shared a kiss and James told TV Week that there are [...] "a lot of complications" [...] for them. She said that no one {{knew what was going to}} happen with Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) and that Nicole felt guilty for betraying Belle because she was her friend. James explained that Nicole's pairing with Aden was [...] "a bit more serious and in-depth than her usual relationships." [...] James opined that Aden was the [...] "nicer guy" [...] for Nicole, but Liam may have had [...] "the edge she's after." [...] Nicole and Aden then embarked on a relationship. James thought that Nicole and Aden's relationship was great and said [...] "They started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more." [...] Nicole declared her love for Aden, however he did not reciprocate. Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: [...] "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden." [...] Aden appreciated her love for him, however cannot say it back until he felt the same way. It is this that made their relationship [...] "awkward", Nicole tried to withdraw her declaration and hide her <b>hurt</b> <b>feelings.</b>|$|E
60|$|Whitefoot's anger did {{not last}} long. It was {{replaced}} by that <b>hurt</b> <b>feeling.</b> He felt {{that he must have}} done something little Mrs. Whitefoot did not like, but though he thought and thought he couldn't remember a single thing. Several times he went back to see if Mrs. Whitefoot felt any differently, but found she didn't. Finally she told him rather sharply to go away and stay away. After that Whitefoot didn't venture over to the new home. He would sometimes sit a short distance away and gaze at it longingly. All the joy had gone out of the beautiful springtime for him. He was quite as unhappy as he had been before he met little Mrs. Whitefoot. You see, he was even more lonely than he had been then. And added to this loneliness was that <b>hurt</b> <b>feeling,</b> which made it ever and ever so much worse. It was very hard to bear.|$|R

2500|$|The Anglo-American {{journalist}} John Derbyshire, who {{was fired}} from the National Review for writing a similar column in 2012 titled [...] "The Talk: Nonblack Version", came to Hanson's defense, praising him for [...] "spot-on observations" [...] about race relations in modern America, through he argued that his column was much superior. In [...] "The Talk: Nonblack Version", Derbyshire, who had earlier been criticized by Hanson on his advocacy for racial stereotyping well beyond the context of traveling in high crime areas, went well beyond what Hanson had advocated, telling his children not to live in cities with black mayors, never to help a black person in distress, to avoid all public gatherings {{with large numbers of}} black people and only have a few black people as friends to avoid allegations of prejudice. Contra Coates, Derbyshire argued in support of Hanson {{that the best way to}} avoid being a victim of crime was: [...] "..stay well clear of crowds of unfamiliar blacks. Might application of those rules leave someone with <b>hurt</b> <b>feelings?</b> [...] Probably. [...] So in this pan we have some stranger's <b>hurt</b> <b>feelings.</b> In the other pan, we have our kids' safety. What's the beam doing, Ta-Nehisi?".

2500|$|Messages that convey {{negative}} feelings or rejection lead to emotions such as hurt and anger. Hurtful messages {{are associated with}} less satisfying relationships.

[...] The interpersonal damage caused by hurtful messages is sometimes permanent. [...] People are more likely to be upset if they believe their relational partner said something to deliberately hurt him or her. [...] Some of the most common forms of hurtful messages include evaluations, accusations, and informative statements.|$|E

2500|$|In 1876, Edward Lasker (a Jewish parliamentarian in the Prussian Landtag) {{introduced}} the [...] "Secession Bill" [...] (Austrittsgesetz), which would enable Jews {{to secede from}} a religious congregation without having to relinquish their religious status. The law was passed on July 28, 1876. Despite the new legislation, a conflict arose whether [...] "Austritt" [...] (secession) was required by Jewish law. Hirsch held this was mandatory, even though it involved a court appearance and visible disapproval of the Reform-dominated [...] "Main Community" [...] (Grossgemeinde). His contemporary Isaac Dov Bamberger, Rabbi of WÃ¼rzburg, argued {{that as long as}} the Grossgemeinde made appropriate arrangements for the Orthodox element, secession was unnecessary. The schism caused a terrible rift and many <b>hurt</b> <b>feelings,</b> and its aftershocks could be felt until the ultimate destruction of the Frankfurt community by the Nazis.|$|E
2500|$|Oliver was {{replaced}} by another working head coach, Jim Aiken of Nevada. Aiken had immediate success with the team he inherited, which like many post-war squads, was peppered with war veterans including Brad Ecklund, Jake Leicht and Norm Van Brocklin, and transfers George Bell, Woodley Lewis and John McKay. [...] Oregon's 1948 team went 9â€“1 {{in the regular season}} and tied with California for the PCC championship; the teams did not meet on the field that season and in a secret ballot by the conference presidents, Cal was awarded the 1949 Rose Bowl bid.
