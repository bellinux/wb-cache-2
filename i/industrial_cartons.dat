40|$|AbstractThe large bending {{behavior}} of a creased paperboard is studied {{in the range of}} rotation θ∊[0 °, 180 °] – new results, apparently not reported previously in literature – with the aim to point out some crucial aspect involved in an adaptive robotic manipulation of the <b>industrial</b> <b>cartons.</b> The loading tests show a great variability of the mechanical behavior, depending dramatically on the crease indentation depth (also for the specimens obtained from the same carton) : (a) when the damage induced during the crease formation is relatively small, the bending response is unusually complex: the moment constitutive function, mL(θ), presents (up to) two peaks followed by unstable branches; (b) for greater indentation, the mL(θ) is monotone. In the unloading case the response mU(θ) is always monotone and is practically independent of the formation conditions of the crease. These behaviors can be easily described analytically using (piecewise) third degree splines. In a companion paper, the erection of a typical carton corner with unstable constitutive behavior is fully analyzed to detect the possible criticalities...|$|E
