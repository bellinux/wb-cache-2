5|$|Not {{known for}} his {{offensive}} ability, Regehr ended a 100-game goal scoring drought early in the season, finishing with four for the season.

5|$|After the {{experience}} of World War II, Belgium abandoned its neutral stance in international politics, in favour of military, political and economic integration. In 1949, Belgium joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950. Belgium was also a <b>key</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> the unsuccessful negotiations about {{the creation of a}} European Defence Community (EDC) in the 1950s. Belgium was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany, around the city of Cologne, which it occupied from 1945. Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their final withdrawal in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Davidson {{reached his}} all round peak during the 1960–61 home series against West Indies and was {{regarded}} as the <b>key</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> Australia's victory. In the First Test in Brisbane, Davidson became {{the first player to}} take ten wickets and accumulate more than a hundred runs in a match despite a broken finger on bowling hand. He took 5/135 and 6/87 and after scoring 44 in the first innings, made 80 in a counter-attacking seventh-wicket partnership of 134 with captain Richie Benaud as Australia sought victory in the run-chase rather than attempt to survive for a draw. Davidson was run out for 80 as Australia lost their way in the final minutes, causing the first Tied Test in history. He took five-wicket hauls in the three other Tests that he played, including Australia's victory in the Fifth Test to take the series 2–1. Despite missing a Test due to injury, he scored 212runs at 30.28 and took 33 wickets at 18.55, almost half the average of the next best bowler. He ended the first-class season with 551 runs at 55.10 and 45 wickets at 20.62.|$|E

While poised to launch a direct assault on Athens in 346 BC, the Macedonian king was met with an Athenian embassy that arranged a peace treaty known as the Peace of Philocrates. As a result, Macedonia and Athens became allies, yet Athens was forced to relinquish its claims to the city of Amphipolis (in modern-day Central Macedonia).|$|E

Our preliminary experimental {{results indicate that the}} entropy measures can be used effectively to identify a set of <b>key</b> <b>players</b> <b>in</b> a social network...|$|R

5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became a <b>key</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of funds paid by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E
5|$|Roberts {{became a}} <b>key</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> Crewe's bid for {{promotion}} in the 2006–07 season, playing mostly as a midfielder. He made nineteen appearances during the season, scoring three goals – against Swansea City, Nottingham Forest and Yeovil Town. The first two goals {{came from the}} penalty spot, as he built {{his reputation as a}} solid penalty taker. He also received the first red card of his professional career in October 2006, in a defeat at Bristol City. He was dismissed for violent conduct after a challenge on Louis Carey, though the referee's decision was reported as 'harsh' and 'strange' by the Bristol City website. That red card was the only sending off, and subsequent suspension, of the season for Crewe, as the club was awarded the 'Bobby Moore Fair Play award for outstanding conduct and discipline throughout the season'.|$|E
5|$|During {{the year}} after Khánh's rise to power, Thi helped Khánh stage or put down several coup attempts, making him a <b>key</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> South Vietnamese {{military}} politics. In September 1964, he and Kỳ helped rescue Khánh from a coup attempt by two disgruntled Catholic Diệmist generals, Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức. This gave Kỳ and Thi increased leverage in the junta. Two months later, he was prominent in shutting down a junta-appointed civilian advisory body after they disapproved of a plan by younger officers to compulsorily retire old generals. In January 1965, he helped Khánh depose the junta-appointed civilian Prime Minister Trần Văn Hương, but by this time he had turned against Khánh. In February 1965, he helped defeat a coup attempt by Phát and Phạm Ngọc Thảo, and helped to force Khánh's resignation at the same time. Over the next year, Kỳ and Thi were the foremost officers in the junta, and in June 1965, Thi declined an opportunity to serve as prime minister after being nominated by his fellow officers following the resignation of civilian Phan Huy Quát. Thi wanted to let a rival take the job and then step in after he had failed, but he never received a second opportunity.|$|E

5|$|Hirst {{was born}} on 7 September 1871 in the Brown Cow Inn, Kirkheaton, a village close to Huddersfield. He {{was the last of}} 10 {{children}} born to James Hirst and his wife Sarah Maria Woolhouse. When his father died in 1880, Hirst lived with his sister Mary Elizabeth Woolhouse and her husband John Berry in Kirkheaton. After leaving school at 10 years of age, Hirst first worked for a hand-loom weaver in a local cottage, and then at a dyeing firm. He played rugby football as a full back during winter, and cricket with his friends and brothers in summer. By the age of 15, Hirst was playing regularly for the Kirkheaton cricket team and his batting and bowling performances regularly won prizes from a local newspaper. His reputation grew; when he was 18 he was a <b>key</b> <b>player</b> <b>in</b> the Kirkheaton team which won the Lumb Challenge Cup of 1889. In the final, watched by players from Yorkshire County Cricket Club, he took five wickets for 23 runs. Days later, invited to take part along with another local player, he appeared for Yorkshire against Cheshire in a non-first-class match in Huddersfield. He scored six runs in his only innings, and took three wickets in the match.|$|E
