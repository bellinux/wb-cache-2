60|$|This basis was {{no sooner}} {{admitted}} than {{the rejection of}} a treaty upon that sole foundation was a thing of course. The enemy {{did not think it}} worthy of a discussion, as in truth it was not; and immediately, as usual, they began, in the most opprobrious and most insolent manner, to question our sincerity and good faith: whereas, in truth, there was no one symptom wanting of openness and fair dealing. What could be more fair than to lay open to an enemy all that you wished to obtain, and the price you meant to pay for it, and to desire him to imitate your ingenuous proceeding, and in the same manner to open his honest heart to you? Here was no want of fair dealing, but there was too evidently a <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> kind: there was much weakness,--there was an eager and impotent desire of associating with this unsocial power, and of attempting the connection by any means, however manifestly feeble and ineffectual. The event was committed to chance,--that is, to such a manifestation of the desire of France for peace as would induce the Directory to forget the advantages they had in the system of barter. Accordingly, the general desire for such a peace was triumphantly reported from the moment that Lord Malmesbury had set his foot on shore at Calais.|$|E

In {{these and}} the like cases, when the {{government}} is dissolved, the people are at liberty to provide for themselves, by erecting a new legislative, differing from the other, by the change of persons, or form, or both, as they shall find it most for their safety and good: for the society can never, by the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>another,</b> lose the native and original right it has to preserve itself, {{which can only be}} done by a settled legislative, and a fair and impartial execution of the laws made by it. But the state of mankind is not so miserable that they are not capable of using this remedy, till it be too late to look for any. To tell people they may provide for themselves, by erecting a new legislative, when by oppression, artifice, or being delivered over to a foreign power, their old one is gone, is only to tell them, they may expect relief when it is too late, and the evil is past cure. This is in effect no more than to bid them first be slaves, and then {{to take care of their}} liberty; and when their chains are on, tell them, they may act like freemen. This, if barely so, is rather mockery than relief; and men can never be secure from tyranny, if there be no means to escape it till they are perfectly under it: and therefore it is, that they have not only a right to get out of it, but to prevent it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{situation}} when {{the tests are}} generated for a particular implementation. In this case there rises a question – can a test generated for one implementation be used for another implementation? Naturally, that a test generated according to one structure may not detect all specified <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> structure. In this work we explore the test quality of one realization for detecting <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> other realizations. We analyze only such implementations that are generated by the same synthesis tool according to the same description, changing only the target library used during the synthesis. We have performed various experiments with sequential benchmark circuits. Our experiments show that the fault coverage surprisingly coincides. We {{think that there are}} two possible explanations of the outcome of the experiments. Firstly, the test redundancy is very high., Secondly, the combinational parts of all analyzed sequential circuits have simple logic and, therefore, the test sequences generated for particular realization are equally good for other realizations as well. 1.

50|$|Individuals high in psychopathy lack any true {{sense of}} guilt or remorse for harm they may have caused others. Instead, they {{rationalize}} their behavior, blame someone else, or deny it outright. A person with psychopathy {{has a tendency to}} be harmful to his or herself and to others. They have little ability to plan ahead for the future. An individual with psychopathy will never find themselves at fault because they will {{do whatever it takes to}} benefit themselves without reservation. A person that does not feel guilt or remorse would have no reason to find themselves at fault for something that they did with the intention of hurting another person. To a person high in psychopathy, their actions can always be rationalized to be the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> person. This is seen by psychologists as part of a lack of moral reasoning (in comparison with the majority of humans), an inability to evaluate situations in a moral framework, and an inability to develop emotional bonds with other people due to a lack of empathy.|$|E

40|$|Our {{system of}} {{liability}} based on fault {{is part of an}} economic and social philosophy of individualism. Quite naturally then an individual is generally held only for his own fault and not for the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>another.</b> Innocent A is not usually liable for injuries caused by guilty B. It is commonplace, however, that he sometimes is. That is where there is a relationship between A and B to which the law attaches the consequences of vicarious liability. Such relationships are those between master and servant, and persons engaged in a partnership or a joint enterprise. Where the servant, for instance, acting within the scope of his employment negligently injured C, the innocent master, A, is liable to C for that injury. This result is usually described by identifying master and servant. Qui facit per alium facit per se. This means that the servant 2 ̆ 7 s negligence is imputed to the master...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{multilayered}} elegy “Westminster Abbey;” which was not {{given a lot of}} attention by Matthew Arnold’s critics. The poem is dedicated to Arnold’s life-long friend Dean Stanley; who was; like Arnold himself; “a child of light. ” The term refers to their common fight against Philistinism in the English society of the time. As the poem is about a real person; it contains real data; such as excerpts from Stanley’s life; described in the form of praise. However; the poem also introduces the old Saxon legend of consecration of the Abbey; namely the consecration by the light; performed by the First Apostle (St Peter) himself. In addition to the legend; Arnold also used some classical Greek allusions to depict the late Dean’s character. In one of the allusions; Stanley is associated with Demophon; whose immortality was never achieved due to the <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> human; and in the second he is transformed into an everlasting oracle of the Abbey using the Trophonius; a builder of Delphi; metaphor.

40|$|Motorcyclists are {{over-represented}} in collision statistics. While many collisions may be {{the direct}} <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> <b>another</b> road user, {{a considerable number of}} fatalities and injuries are due to the actions of the rider. While increased riding experience may improve skills, advanced training courses may be required to evoke the safest riding behaviours. The current research assessed the impact of experience and advanced training on rider behaviour using a motorcycle simulator. Novice riders, experienced riders and riders with advanced training traversed a virtual world through varying speed limits and roadways of different curvature. Speed and lane position were monitored. In a comparison of 60 mph and 40 mph zones, advanced riders rode more slowly in the 40 mph zones, and had greater variation in lane position than the other two groups. In the 60 mph zones, both advanced and experienced riders had greater lane variation than novices. Across the whole ride, novices tended to position themselves closer to the kerb. In a second analysis across four classifications of curvature (straight, slight, medium, tight) advanced and experienced riders varied their lateral position more so than novices, though advanced riders had greater variation in lane position than even experienced riders in some conditions. The results suggest that experience and advanced training lead to changes in behaviour compared to novice riders which can be interpreted as having a potentially positive impact on road safety...|$|E
