40|$|A new driving {{technique}} is introduced {{with which the}} number of scan drivers for the conventional 3 -electrode surface-discharge AC-PDPs can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude. The technique utilizes the gas discharge AND logic, with which an address speed for HDTV expression can be attained. 1. Introduction One of the disadvantages of matrix displays is that a circuit driver is needed {{for each of the}} electrodes, resulting in high system cost. One way of reducing the cost is to decrease the number of expensive high-voltage drivers by using a gas <b>discharge</b> <b>logic</b> capability which is associated with a strong non-linearity of discharge current vs. voltage. Although various techniques have been introduced [1] 0 [5], no color-PDP monitors nor TVs utilize the capability because of insufficient operating margin. Table I shows the expected numbers of the scan drivers by applying the gas discharge AND logic technique to the conventional 3 -electrode AC-PDPs. The numbers of A and B sc [...] ...|$|E
40|$|In Logique du Fantasme, Lacan {{argues that}} the {{compulsion}} to repeat does not obey the same <b>discharge</b> <b>logic</b> as homeostatic processes. Repetition installs a realm that is categorically {{different from the one}} related to homeostatic pleasure seeking, a properly subjective one, one in which the mark “stands for,” “takes the place of,” what we have ventured to call “an event,” and what only in the movement of return, in what Lacan calls a “thinking of repetition,” confirms and ever reconfirms this point of no return, which is also a qualitative cut and a structural loss. The kind of “standing for” Lacan intends here with the concept of repetition is certainly not something like an image or a faithful description. No, what Lacan wishes to stress is that this mark is situated at another level, at another place, it is “entstellt,” and as such, it is punctually impinging upon the bodily dynamics without rendering the event, without having an external meta-point of view, but cutting across registers according to a logics that is not the homeostatic memory logics. This paper elaborates on this distinction {{on the basis of a}} confrontation with what Freud says about the pleasure principle and its beyond in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, and also takes inspiration from Freud’s Project for a Scientific Psychology. We argue that Lacan’s theory of enjoyment takes up and generalizes what Freud was after in Beyond the Pleasure Principle with the Wiederholungszwang, and pushes Freud’s thoughts to a more articulated point: to the point where a subject is considered to speak only when it has allowed the other, through discourse, to have impacted and cut into his bodily pleasure dynamics...|$|E

This method consists of transforming high glitch gates into modified devices which filter out the glitches when a control signal is applied. When the control signal is high, the F-Gate operates as normal but when the control signal is low, the gate output is disconnected from the ground. As a result it can never be <b>discharged</b> to <b>logic</b> 0 and glitches are prevented.|$|R
50|$|The {{basics of}} {{thermodynamics}} were stated by Sadi Carnot in 1824. He considered a heat engine which operates by drawing heat {{from a source}} which is at thermal equilibrium at temperature , and delivering useful work. Carnot saw that, in order to operate continuously, the engine requires also a cold reservoir with the temperature , to which some heat can be <b>discharged.</b> By simple <b>logic</b> he established the famous ‘’’Carnot Principle’’’: ‘’No heat engine can be more efficient than a reversible one operating between the same temperatures’’.|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the design and}} implementation of a supervisory controller for the energy management of an AC stand-alone microgrid. The microgrid under study consists of a photovoltaic (PV), battery energy storage system (BESS) and auxiliary (micro gas turbine) units connected to a common AC bus and supplies a local load. The BESS unit has to maintain the AC bus voltage and frequency and needs to balance {{the difference between the}} intermittent PV power and that consumed by the load. However, the BESS has limited energy capacity and power rating and therefore it is important to implement a supervisory controller that can curtail the PV power to prevent the battery from being overcharged and also to operate the auxiliary unit to prevent the battery from being over <b>discharged.</b> A Fuzzy <b>Logic</b> Controller (FLC) that can be implemented inside the BESS unit is proposed. It monitors the battery power and State of Charge (SOC) and varies the bus frequency accordingly. The variation in the bus frequency serves as a communication means to the PV and auxiliary units. If the frequency is increased above the nominal value, the PV unit starts to curtail its power and if the frequency is decreased, the auxiliary unit starts to generate power. Power curtailment and supplement are proportional to the frequency variation. In order to avoid any need for communication links between the units, the DC/AC inverters of all the units adopt the well-known wireless droop technique. The droop control of the auxiliary unit is implemented {{in such a way that}} the unit is floating on the bus and thus it generates power only if the bus frequency is decreased below its nominal value. The main merits of the proposed controller are simplicity and easiness of implementation inside the BESS unit. The effectiveness of the controller in protecting the battery from over-charging/over-discharging has been verified by simulations including a real-time simulation and experimentally. Furthermore, the thesis investigates the effect of sudden shading of a PV and concentrated PV (CPV) on the bus frequency of an AC stand-alone microgrid. It is known that the CPV power can drop drastically, compared to traditional PV, when it is exposed to shading. A simulation model of the CPV in a microgrid has been built and the results are compared to those of the traditional PV. It is found that shading of the CPV has much more stronger effect on the bus frequency. Government of Oman (Embassy of Oman - London...|$|R
