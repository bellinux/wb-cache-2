Starting from turning points chronologies, a binary measure of association for expansion and contraction regimes is used to perform a nonparametric analysis. This framework allows to address the relative groupwise dependency and not only the frequently studied pairwise correlations under very few assumptions. Studying relative dependency is important {{in order to establish}} if and how much “europeanization” is a different phenomenon with respect to globalization. Data lead to conclude that an English-speaking club is emerging in the last decades, whereas explicit and formal commitments seem to have had a relatively weaker power in determining Euro-zone business cycles comovements.

40|$|In {{both the}} United States and {{the nations of}} Western Europe, {{significant}} constitutional commitments safeguard both expressive freedom (including {{freedom of speech and}} of the press) and also a generalized constitutional right of privacy. With some regularity, however, these rights will come into conflict, as the protection of one right can be achieved only at the cost of abridging or denying the other. When a government official or public figure objects to the publication of an embarrassing photograph, perhaps taken by an invasive paparazzo, it is simply not possible to fully vindicate both a newspaper’s interest in publishing the photograph and the subject’s interest in privacy. Although generalizations often oversimplify complex legal, cultural, and moral understandings, it nevertheless remains true that European courts tend to place greater relative emphasis on safeguarding privacy than do courts in the United States. Thus, the standard narrative posits that the United States gives an absolute priority to speech, over vindication of privacy interests, whereas European law tends to discount the importance of expressive freedom in favor of more reliably safeguarding privacy. At one level of analysis, this standard account gets things right—protected speech is both wider and deeper {{on this side of the}} Atlantic than in contemporary Europe. This standard account, however, underestimates the <b>European</b> <b>commitment</b> to protecting expressive freedom; the <b>European</b> <b>commitment</b> to safeguarding privacy does not, and will not, invariably override free speech. A comparative legal analysis also demonstrates that privacy is far from dead in the United States. Going forward, the challenges presented by the advent of “Big Data” and society-wide government surveillance programs increasingly will require both the United States and Europe to see privacy as an essential condition for safeguarding speech. Democratic self-government presupposes an ongoing dialogue among citizens, but an open dialogue about government simply cannot exist in a surveillance state. In the brave new world of PRISM and secret government manipulation of metadata, we must recognize that privacy and speech are fundamentally complementary, rather than competing, human rights. Moreover, this is a lesson that comparative legal analysis can teach...|$|E

Moreover, the acceptance of the <b>European</b> <b>commitment</b> has itself produced an important dynamic behind wider policy changes (Holden, 1999). Yet, the shift on Europe is all the more remarkable given that the Labour Party in the early 1980 s appeared to be one of the least likely candidates in the then EC to be ‘Europeanized. ’ Its problems in steering a united and consistent position on the major questions of European integration are well known.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, some European {{members of the}} EEC/EU have participated in several peace {{operations}} in Lebanon, mainly under UN command, contradicting their usual reluctance towards these kind of interventions. As a result, {{it is important to}} understand the reasons for the specificity of the Lebanese case and the long-lasting <b>European</b> <b>commitment</b> towards this country. The main factors that justify these interventions are the interests of some Mediterranean countries (France, Italy, Spain), which have considered them as a means to spread their influence in the region and guarantee their own security, avoiding any escalation of violence that could spill over into Southern Europe. But there is also a link with the European normative approach, that tries to turn the Mediterranean into an area of cooperation, prosperity and security, given the fact that the resolution of the Middle East conflicts would be a prerequisite for the success of the Euro-Mediterranean policy. However, these objectives are not easy to conciliate, leading to a lack of coherence in the EU policy towards Lebanon...|$|E
30|$|Many of the European {{states have}} also {{committed}} to better human rights standards {{around the world}} and inclined to use human rights as a foreign policy tool. Member states of the European Community, through the Copenhagen Declaration proclaimed their determination to “defend” the principles of representative democracy, rule of law, social justice and human rights (King 1999). It is generally believed that the European countries are more proactive and genuine in terms of ensuring a vibrant HR culture in the South, compared to for example, the United States. However, even these countries could not delink human rights concerns from their own national interest considerations. For example, <b>European</b> <b>commitment</b> to human rights came under severe threat during the political troubles in Greece in the late 1960 s. A military junta came to power through a coup and relied on repression to stay in power. Commentators pointed out that the “Western European Governments uncomfortably and silently acknowledged that the Cold War and the stability of the South-Eastern flank of NATO had to take precedence over the violation of the democratic process in Greece and decided to treat the whole messy situation as an internal matter” (Pedaliu 2007, 189).|$|E
40|$|As the {{flexibility}} of blended learning especially appeals to mature learners with family and/or work obligations, the format corresponds to the <b>European</b> <b>commitment</b> to increase adults’ participation in lifelong learning. Whereas participation in education is an important policy objective, it is mainly students’ persistence (i. e. the progress towards degree completion) that constitutes an indicator of learning program effectiveness. Although strong in popularity, blended learning programs suffer {{from a lack of}} student persistence. Since persistence monitoring is a catalyst for ongoing program review and improvement, this contribution tentatively explores the availability of current persistence measures that allow blended program managers to follow up on adult learners’ persistence during training. Initial findings indicate that a majority of studies is conceived as one-shot assessments, failing to track students’ progress through longitudinal designs and multiple observations. Research that does take into account learners’ progress, does not simultaneously address blended settings and program level factors. As blended program managers are provided with little theoretical and empirical support to capture adult learners’ persistence, the road is open to future reflections on frameworks that integrate both students’ progress and program level factors. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: “How far {{are we in}} the WHO European Region in {{implementing}} action to counter the health impacts of climate change? ” This was the question posed to representatives of Member States in the WHO European Region of in the WHO working group on health in climate change (HIC). Twenty-two Member States provided answers to a comprehensive 2012 questionnaire that focused on eight thematic areas (governance vulnerability, impact and adaptation (health) assessments (VIA); adaptation strategies and action plans; climate change mitigation; strengthening health systems; raising awareness and building capacity; greening health services; and sharing best practices). Strong development has been in climate change vulnerability and impact assessments, as well as strengthening health systems and awareness raising. Areas where implementation would benefit from further action are the development of national health adaptation plans, greening health systems, sharing best practices and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in other sectors.

This experiment represents a natural continuation of the <b>European</b> <b>commitment</b> on the characterisation of the Ka and Q/V band demonstrated during the recent period by the development of ESA OLYMPUS, ASI ITALSAT and CNES STENTOR satellites.
