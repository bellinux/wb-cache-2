25|$|The {{official}} {{explanation for}} the explosion and subsequent crash of TWA Flight 800 is that an explosive fuel/air mixture was created {{in one of the}} aircraft's fuel tanks. Faulty wiring then provided an ignition source within the tank, destroying the airliner. While the accuracy of the official findings is still questioned in this case, similar explosions have occurred in other aircraft. It is possible to reduce the chance of fuel tank explosions by a fuel tank <b>inerting</b> system or fire fighting foam in the tanks.|$|E
25|$|The first launch {{attempt was}} delayed by 24 hours due to weather concerns, {{including}} multiple weather violations in NASA's launch rules beginning over 2 {{hours before the}} scheduled launch. During the second attempt on Wednesday morning, {{a problem with a}} LH2 fill-and-drain fuel valve inside Discoverys aft compartment led to another scrubbing. The problem arose when sensors did not detect the closure of the valve when commanded to do so. The issue was thought to be with the sensors rather than the valve itself. After <b>inerting</b> the orbiter's tank, which involved draining it, tests were conducted on the valves. Despite the valves working normally, another delay was called for to have more confidence in the system, and to give the console operators who performed the test some rest. The launch team evaluated the issue, passing on a possible launch window on 27 August 2009 at 01:10 EDT. The launch was delayed until 23:59 EDT, 28 August 2009, to allow the engineers to be fully satisfied with the vehicle. Later the mission was cleared for launch which involved a flight rule waiver for cycling the valve and a discussion to analyze the test failure of an Ares-1 booster that was similar to the SRBs used for the mission. NASA feared another delay when storms formed near the Kennedy Space Center on 28 August 2009, but the weather cleared in time for a successful launch of Discovery at 23:59 EDT.|$|E

50|$|The {{compounds}} {{are made}} up of two main types of ingredients: active, which control pests, and <b>inert,</b> which improve performance of the pesticides. For example, some <b>inert</b> ingredients are responsible for increasing the shelf life while other <b>inert</b> ingredients act as solvents for the active ingredients. It is important to know that not all <b>inert</b> ingredients are safe. In fact, adding <b>inert</b> ingredients to pesticides requires permission from the Environmental Protection Agency.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. EPA is {{authorized}} by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act FIFRA) to register pesticide products. Pesticide products consist {{of one or more}} active ingredients, and may contain one or more <b>inert</b> ingredients (<b>inerts).</b> An <b>inert</b> ingredient is any substance, other than an active ingredient, which is intentionally included in a pesticide product. <b>Inerts</b> may be added to improve plant uptake, extend shelf-life, enhance water solubility/dispersion, make application easier, etc. Just as with pesticide active ingredients, <b>inerts</b> are evaluated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to ensure that there will be reasonable certainty of no harm to human health or the environment if used according to the label. For its evaluation of <b>inerts</b> EPA requires the same minimal data set that it requires for active ingredients. Data requirements (at 40 CFR 158) include residue chemistry, product chemistry, toxicology for human health risk assessment, ecotoxicology, and environmental fate. Under the List Category Policy of 1987, EPA categorized <b>inerts</b> into four groups, or lists, based on toxicity.

40|$|The {{deformation}} of an <b>inert</b> confiner by a steady detonation wave in an adjacent explosive is investigated for {{cases where the}} confiner is suciently strong (or the explosive suciently weak) such that the overall change in the sound speed of the <b>inert</b> is small. A coupling condition which relates the pressure to the deflection angle along the explosive-inert interface is determined. This includes its dependence on {{the thickness of the}} <b>inert,</b> for cases where the initial sound speed of the <b>inert</b> is less than or greater than the detonation speed in the explosive (supersonic and subsonic <b>inert</b> ows, respectively). The {{deformation of}} the <b>inert</b> is then solved by prescribing the pressure along the interface. In the supersonic case, the detonation drives a shock into the <b>inert,</b> subsequent to which the ow in the <b>inert</b> consists of alternating regions of compression and tension. In this case reverberations or `ringing' occurs along both the deflected interface and outer edge of the <b>inert.</b> For the subsonic case, the flow in the interior of the <b>inert</b> is smooth and shockless. The detonation in the explosive initially defl ects the smooth interface towards the explosive. For sufficiently thick <b>inerts</b> in such cases, it appears that the deflection of the confiner would either drive the detonation speed in the explosive up to the sound speed of the <b>inert</b> or drive a precursor wave ahead of the detonation in the explosive. Transonic cases, where the <b>inert</b> sound speed is close to the detonation speed, are also considered. It is shown that the confinement affect of the <b>inert</b> on the detonation is enhanced as sonic conditions are approached from either side...|$|R

5000|$|The order affects {{aircraft}} whose {{air conditioning}} units have a possibility of heating up what {{can be considered a}} normally empty center wing fuel tank. Some Airbus A320 and Boeing 747 aircraft are slated for [...] "early action". Regarding new aircraft designs, the Airbus A380 does not have a center wing fuel tank and is therefore exempt, and the Boeing 787 has a fuel tank safety system that already complies with the proposed rule. The FAA has stated that there have been four fuel tank explosions in the previous 16 years—two on the ground, and two in the air—and that based on this statistic and on the FAA's estimate that one such explosion would happen every 60 million hours of flight time, about 9 such explosions will probably occur in the next 50 years. The <b>inerting</b> systems will probably prevent 8 of those 9 probable explosions, the FAA said.Before the <b>inerting</b> system rule was proposed, Boeing stated that it would install its own <b>inerting</b> system on airliners it manufactures beginning in 2005.
