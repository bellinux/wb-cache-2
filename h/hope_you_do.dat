500|$|Michael Giacchino, Abrams' most {{frequent}} collaborator, composed {{the music for}} Star Trek. He kept the original theme by Alexander Courage for the end credits, which Abrams said symbolized {{the momentum of the}} crew coming together. Giacchino admitted personal pressure in scoring the film, as [...] "I grew up listening to all of that great [...] music, and that's part of what inspired me to do what I'm doing [...] You just go in scared. You just <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> your best. It's {{one of those things where}} the film will tell me what to do." [...] Scoring took place at the Sony Scoring Stage with a 107-piece orchestra and 40-person choir. An erhu, performed by Karen Han, was used for the Vulcan themes. A distorted recording was used for the Romulans. Varèse Sarabande, the record label responsible for releasing albums of Giacchino's previous scores for Alias, Lost, , and Speed Racer, released the soundtrack for the film on May 5. The music for the theatrical trailers were composed by Two Steps from Hell.|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am {{sure you}} must have been wet.--We {{scarcely}} got home in time. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> turned directly." ...|$|R
60|$|Saint. I see you are ignorant; but verily, {{you are a}} new vessel, and I may season you. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not use the parish-church.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{believed}} to be an honourable profession, my good dame; I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not think the worse of me for having belonged to it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear sir," [...] said Walkirk, {{rising in}} much agitation, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not think that}} I seriously {{proposed}} your building an annex to"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bless me, Phoebe! I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not meet}} any poor curate at that place of Honor Charlecote's. Your papa would never consent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not take}} the trouble, sir, to inquire on my account," [...] {{retorted}} Jane, coloring slightly with vexation at his speech.|$|R
60|$|I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not get a}} {{chill in}} the garden. The weather is a little wrong again, but I am thankful for last night's sunset.|$|R
6000|$|After {{a little}} pause Lily {{said in a}} subdued voice, 'Claude, I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe that I was {{thinking}} of what really happened when I said that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Stowel, your {{doctrine}} {{would make}} a quiet nation, {{as well as a}} quiet ship. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> me the justice to think there is no co-equal in my commands!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no right}} to bear that name any longer. Pray call me by my assumed name still, and keep my secret. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not believe all the {{newspapers}} said?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{not suffer}} much," [...] said the major, {{looking at the}} calm face and neatly-tied white hair, which seemed to have {{suffered}} no disarrangement.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] he admitted, [...] "that it {{was rather}} a clumsy joke. I apologize, Mrs. Fitzgerald. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not really imagine {{that it had been}} stolen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not perfectly, sir; but, if I am not mistaken, it was {{something}} like this: <b>you</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not distrust the creature; for that would imply distrust of the Creator." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Well, {{four miles}} {{distant from the}} town of Wicklow is a village called Four Mile Water. The {{resident}} priest is Father Hickey. You have heard of the miracles at Knock?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Lydia. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not think}} I am a silly little fool. It is only that I {{have not been}} {{accustomed}} {{to that kind of}} treatment, and I will not have it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{still had}} on the little round hat, but as Jack went she laid it aside. [...] "Oh, Mr Neverbend," [...] she said, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not think that I have been unkind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There!" [...] said Cissy, {{when they}} had passed, [...] "didn't I tell you? Did you ever see such conceit in your born days? I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not look at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Would it {{be generous}} and honourable {{to step into}} your place--if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> so, for I don't know that <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> and I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not--anticipating, or knowing beforehand, that I should come here, and {{designing}} to take me at this disadvantage?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You seem to {{have slept}} with one ear open," [...] said her mother. [...] "And oh!" [...] as Janet took off her gloves, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not show those hands!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your sentiments do you credit, Sanders," [...] {{said the}} minister; [...] "but I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not enter upon the blessed state of matrimony without full {{consideration}} of its responsibilities. It {{is a serious}} business, marriage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{called at}} your place," [...] Mr. Carmyle was saying, [...] "and the hall porter {{told me that}} you were here, so I ventured to follow you. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not mind? May I smoke?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not object, sir, to my having {{stated in}} public, emphatically, {{that he will}} {{reappear}} here, whenever any new suspicion may be awakened, or any new circumstance may come to light in this extraordinary matter?’ ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had another}} letter from Mrs. Fenton, who says {{you were with}} her; I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not go on purpose. I will answer her letter soon; it is about some money in Lady Giffard's hands.|$|R
6000|$|... “No,” {{said the}} girl quietly, {{though there was a}} faint gleam in her eyes. “That {{contract}} is too big for me. Still, I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not lose many opportunities, Mr. Broughton, through taking care of me.” ...|$|R
60|$|Lord. Nay, {{my sweet}} mistress, be not so unjust to suspect any new attempt: I am too {{penitent}} for my last fault, so soon to sin again. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not {{tell it to}} your aunt.|$|R
6000|$|... "Trouble, Miss Stanbury! How {{could it}} be trouble? The labour we delight in physics pain. But {{to go back to}} the subject-matter. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not doubt that my affection for you is true and honest, and genuine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Mr. Audley took leave; and as Felix went to {{the front}} door with him, he said, 'Forgive me, Felix; but I am a younger brother myself, and I do <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not mean to assert your {{authority}} by licking.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{to thank}} you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind {{forgiving}} message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not retract what you then said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes. I {{understood}} {{that you thought}} you had not treated your aunts rightly by not consulting them about your intercourse with the Whites, and that you had very properly resolved to tell them all. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the matter, Frona?" [...] {{the colonel}} demanded, bluntly. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not come under protest. I am sorry, not for you, because lack of frankness deserves nothing, but for Lucile. It {{is not fair}} to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not {{forward the}} stones {{presented}} by the Consul.--Julia says to tell Mary that she got a very rich fur cloak in Paris and hopes she got one also. Is there anything we can <b>do</b> for <b>you</b> in Paris? ...|$|R
