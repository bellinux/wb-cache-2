40|$|This paper {{presents}} a graphical {{method of analysis}} for preliminary design of horizontally loaded tall buildings which are laterally supported by vertical <b>trussed</b> <b>frames</b> and horizontal off-set riggers which {{are located in the}} exterior or facade skeletal frame structures {{in the direction of the}} lateral loading. The interaction between the <b>trussed</b> <b>frames</b> and these facade riggers is through the two floor structures adjacent to the top and bottom cords of the riggers. The method of analysis requires the calculation of seven planar stiffness parameters: bending and shear stiffness of the vertical <b>trussed</b> <b>frames,</b> the horizontal off-set riggers and the floor structures in addition to the bending stiffness of the exterior skeletal frame structures which support the riggers. The method allows a graphical procedure for obtaining the optimum level of the facade riggers in addition to a rapid assessment of the influence of the floor structures and facade riggers on the performance of the high-rise structure such as the reduction in lateral deflection at the top and the overturning moment at the base of the <b>trussed</b> <b>frames...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{simplest}} kind of vault is {{the barrel}} vault (also called a wagon or tunnel vault), {{which is generally}} semicircular in shape. The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a temporary support is needed while rings of voussoirs are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the keystone, is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this temporary support is provided by centering consisting of a <b>framed</b> <b>truss</b> with a semicircular or segmental head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.|$|R

An upper floor level created at the northern end of the space provides a split level work platform, originally used in conjunction with the simple timber and steel gantry. Rails for the gantry are fitted at both sides of the section, and run the full length of the space. A single large opening at the rear provides vehicular access to the building's interior.

40|$|Abstract. A current {{development}} {{trend of}} the industrial equipment is ultra-large scale. The construction, transportation, and installation of these equipments require ultra-large tonnage lifting equipments. At present, domestic ultra-large tonnage lifting equipments, particularly for special purpose are still immature, unable to meet requirements of the lifting of ultra-large structures. Based on the need of ultra-large steel structures (offshore oil platforms) lifting, using strength theory and finite element analysis, a continuous lifting mechanism for the lifting of ultra-large structures was designed in this article. The continuous lifting mechanism consists of two parts: the mechanical support structures which was designed in this article, and the hydraulic system. The main characteristics of the mechanism are: the <b>framing</b> <b>truss</b> structure assures large height lifting; and the accumulated of synchronous blocks achieves large height lifting...|$|R
50|$|Home Farm at the Beamish Museum, County Durham, {{contains}} an early 19th-century, semi-octagonal gin gang with sandstone or millstone grit walls and slate roof. The renovated internal roof structure {{is based on}} a traditional space <b>frame</b> <b>truss</b> with its primary plane in line with the tie beam (or joist), and with members fixed between king post and rafters to support the semi-octagonal plan of the roof. There is one main transverse oak tie beam on which the king post of the main truss is based. The king post is in tension to prevent sagging of the horizontal tie beam, so neither the king post nor the tie beam are resting on the mill below. The roof construction is not structurally dependent on the horse mill, or connected with it.|$|R
