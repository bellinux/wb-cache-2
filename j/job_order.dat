In the differentiation of the uses of, and the accounting for <b>job</b> <b>order</b> costing and process costing, Nicholson was especially farsighted, missing only the now-taken-for granted concept of equivalent production in the valuation of inventories and the calculation {{of the cost of}} goods sold. He was apparently the first individual to develop the concepts and comparative advantages of accounting for costs departmentally, on a cumulative or non-cumulative basis that is, pyramided and non-pyramided departmental costs.|$|E

[...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million. Originally planned as the first installment in an 11-part saga, Shenmue was eventually downsized to a trilogy—and only one sequel was ever released.s development |publisher=Polygon |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=December 17, 2014 |quote=Yu Suzuki: The biggest challenge we encountered was project management.

It's the ultimate Dreamcast fanboy's pilgrimage, and as I took my first steps down Dobuita Street and recognized locations I'd walked past countless times before—Kurita's Military Store, Mary's Embroidery Store and the parking lot where Ryo honed his fighting skills—I couldn't help but go a little dewy eyed." [...] According to Moore, Shenmue sold [...] "extremely well", but the game had no chance of making a profit due to the Dreamcast's limited installed base. Shenmue II [...] "was completed for a much more reasonable sum", while Sato defended Shenmue as an [...] "investment [...] will someday be recouped" [...] because [...] "the development advances we learned... can be applied to other games". In addition to the mixed reception for Shenmue, IGN's Travis Fahs stated that [...] "the [...] era wasn't as kind to [...] as earlier years"—citing (among others) F355 Challenge as an [...] "acclaimed" [...] arcade title that [...] "didn't do much at home", and Genki's port of Virtua Fighter 3 as inferior to the arcade version, [...] "which was already a couple years old and never as popular as its predecessors."s view, buyers of modern coin-op conversions have the right to expect more from their investments than unenhanced facsimiles. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006102942/http://www.edge-online.com/review/virtua-fighter-3tb-review/ |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }} The Virtua Fighter series would experience a [...] "tremendous comeback" [...] with the universally acclaimed Virtua Fighter 4—which saw a console release exclusively on PS2.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} optimal {{methodology}} for synchronized scheduling of production assembly with air transportation to achieve accurate delivery with minimized cost in consumer electronics supply chain (CESC). This problem {{was motivated by}} a major PC manufacturer in consumer electronics industry, where it is required to schedule the delivery requirements to meet the customer needs {{in different parts of}} South East Asia. The overall problem is decomposed into two sub-problems which consist of an air transportation allocation problem and an assembly scheduling problem. The air transportation allocation problem is formulated as a Linear Programming Problem with earliness tardiness penalties for <b>job</b> <b>orders.</b> For the assembly scheduling problem, it is basically required to sequence the <b>job</b> <b>orders</b> on the assembly stations to minimize their waiting times before they are shipped by flights to their destinations. Hence the second sub-problem is modelled as a scheduling problem with earliness penalties. The earliness penalties are assumed to be independent of the <b>job</b> <b>orders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Apparel {{production}} is characterised by labour-intensive manual operations, frequent style changes, seasonal demand and shortening production lead times. With fierce competition worldwide, many manufacturers are switching their production from mass mode to lean mode to shorten their response time to changes. In a complex mixed mode production environment, {{it is very}} important to allocate <b>job</b> <b>orders</b> to suitable production lines so as to ensure the effective utilization of production resources and on-time completion of all <b>job</b> <b>orders.</b> In this paper, planning algorithms are proposed for automatic job allocations based on group technology and genetic algorithms. For genetic algorithms based intelligent planning algorithms, single-run and multiple-run genetic algorithms are suggested. Real production data are used to validate the proposed method.

These planning algorithms are currently used by apparel manufacturers in Hong Kong as part of their routine planning operations. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
