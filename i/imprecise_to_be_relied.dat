50|$|Absolute radiometric dating {{requires}} a measurable fraction of parent nucleus {{to remain in}} the sample rock.

5000|$|Leibniz's {{concept of}} infinitesimals, long {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{used as a}} foundation of calculus, was eventually replaced by rigorous concepts developed by Weierstrass and others. Consequently, Leibniz's quotient notation <b>was</b> re-interpreted <b>to</b> stand for the limit of the modern definition. However, in many instances, the symbol did seem {{to act as an}} actual quotient would and its usefulness kept it popular {{even in the face of}} several competing notations. In the modern rigorous treatment of non-standard calculus, justification can <b>be</b> found <b>to</b> again consider the notation as representing an actual quotient.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Assessment of dyspnea, fatigue, and {{physical}} disability <b>is</b> fundamental <b>to</b> the monitoring {{of patients with}} heart failure (HF). A plethora of patient-reported measures exist, but most are too burdensome or <b>imprecise</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful in clinical practice. New techniques used for computer adaptive tests (CATs) may <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> address these problems. The {{purpose of this study}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> build a CAT for patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Item banks of 74 queries (2 ̆ 2 items 2 ̆ 2) <b>were</b> developed <b>to</b> assess self-reported physical disability, fatigue, and dyspnea. All queries <b>were</b> administered <b>to</b> 658 adults with HF to build 3 item banks.
