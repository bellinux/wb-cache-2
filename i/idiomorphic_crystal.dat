40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of structural, petrographic, mineralogical and chemical studies of dunite veinlets in spinel peridotite from the Kraka ophiolites. It is demonstrated that plastic deformation of polycrystalline olivine, which form dunite, was accompanied by precipitation of impurities (aluminum and chrome) as newly formed chrome spinels. The thinnest acicular inclusions of 0. 3 - 0. 5 micron thick are aligned in olivine grains along [010] axis. Bigger elongated irregular chrome spinel grains usually occur along grain and sub-grain olivine boundaries, and, occasionally, inside the grains along [100] axis. Alteration from the fine xenomorphic grains of chrome spinels to the bigger <b>idiomorphic</b> <b>crystals</b> was observed. Analogically to dynamic ageing (dispersion hardening) in metals, the structural and chemical alterations in dunites are interpreted as deformation induced segregation of impurities. It is suggested that the euhedral chrome spinel grains typical for ophiolitic dunites were formed by coalescence and spheroidization. This process may be a key factor in the formation of ophiolitic chrome ore deposits...|$|R

In-clusions of small rhombs and granules of calcite are commonly observed in the albite crystals.

40|$|The Merensky Reef of the Bushveld Complex {{consists}} of two chromitite layers separated by coarse-grained melanorite. Microstructural analysis of the chromitite layers using electron backscatter diffraction analysis (EBSD), high-resolution X-ray microtomography and crystal size distribution analyses distinguished two populations of chromite crystals: fine-grained idiomorphic and large silicate inclusion-bearing crystals. The lower chromitite layer contains both populations, whereas the upper contains only fine idiomorphic grains. Most of the inclusion-bearing chromites have characteristic amoeboidal shapes that have been previously explained as products of sintering of pre-existing smaller <b>idiomorphic</b> <b>crystals.</b> Two possible mechanisms have been proposed for sintering of chromite crystals: (1) amalgamation of a cluster of grains with the same original crystallographic orientation; and (2) sintering of randomly orientated crystals followed by annealing into a single grain. The EBSD data show no evidence for clusters of similarly oriented grains among the idiomorphic population, nor for earlier presence of idiomorphic subgrains spatially related to inclusions, and therefore are evidence against both of the proposed sintering mechanisms. Electron backscatter diffraction analysis maps show deformation-related misorientations and curved subgrain boundaries within the large, amoeboidal crystals, and absence of such features in the fine-grained population. Microstructures observed in the lower chromitite layer are interpreted {{as the result of}} deformation during compaction of the orthocumulate layers, and constitute evidence for the formation of the amoeboid morphologies at an early stage of consolidation. An alternative model is proposed whereby silicate inclusions are incorporated during maturation and recrystallisation of initially dendritic chromite crystals formed as a result of supercooling during emplacement of the lower chromite layer against cooler anorthosite during the magma influx that formed the Merensky Reef. The upper chromite layer formed from a subsequent magma influx, and hence lacked a mechanism to form dendritic chromite. This accounts for {{the difference between the two}} layers...|$|R
50|$|The scapolite limestones {{and contact}} {{metamorphic}} rocks. As silicates rich in calcium, {{it is to}} be expected that these minerals will be found where impure limestones have been crystallized by contact with an igneous magma. Even marialite (the variety richest in soda) occurs in this association, being principally obtained in small crystals lining cavities in ejected blocks of crystalline limestone at Vesuvius and the craters of the Eifel in Germany. Scapolite and wernerite are far more common at the contacts of limestone with intrusive masses. The minerals that accompany them are calcite, epidote, vesuvianite, garnet, wollastonite, diopside and amphibole. The scapolites are colorless, flesh-colored, grey or greenish; occasionally they are nearly black from the presence of very small enclosures of graphitic material. They are not in very perfect crystals, though sometimes incomplete octagonal sections are visible; the tetragonal cleavage, strong double refraction and uniaxial interference figure distinguish them readily from other minerals. Commonly they weather to micaceous aggregate, but sometimes an isotropic substance of unknown nature is seen replacing them. In crystalline limestones and calc-silicate rocks they occur in small and usually inconspicuous grains mingled with the other components of the rock. Large, nearly <b>idiomorphic</b> <b>crystals</b> are sometimes found in argillaceous rocks (altered calcareous shales) that have suffered thermal metamorphism. In the Pyrenees there are extensive outcrops of limestone penetrated by igneous rocks described as ophites (varieties of diabase) and lherzolites (peridotites). At the contacts scapolite occurs in a great number of places, both in the limestones and in the calcareous shales that accompany them. In some of these rocks large crystals of one of the scapolite minerals (an inch or two in length) occur, usually as octagonal prisms with imperfect terminations. In others the mineral is found in small irregular grains. It is sometimes clear, but often crowded with minute enclosures of augite, tourmaline, biotite and other minerals, such as constitute the surrounding matrix. From these districts also a black variety is well known, filled with minute graphitic enclosures, often exceedingly small and rendering the mineral nearly opaque. The names couzeranite and dipyre are often given to this kind of scapolite. Apparently the presence of chlorine in small quantities, which may often be detected in limestones, to some extent determines the formation of the mineral.|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince the 1990 s a {{large number}} of sinkholes have {{appeared}} in the Dead Sea (DS) coastal area. Sinkhole development was triggered by the lowering of the DS level. In the literature the relationship between the sinkholes and the DS level is explained by intrusion of relatively fresh water into the aquifer thereby dramatically accelerating the salt dissolution with creation of subsurface caverns, which in turn cause sinkholes. The main goal of our project was detection and localization of relatively fresh groundwater. During our study we used the transient electromagnetic method (TEM) to measure the electrical resistivity of the subsurface. As a test site we selected Nahal Hever South which is typical for the DS coast. Our results show that resistivity of the shallow subsurface reflects its vertical and lateral structure, e. g., its main hydrogeological elements explain the inter-relations between geology, hydrogeology, and sinkholes. The TEM method has allowed detailed differentiation of layers (clay, salt, etc.) in the subsurface based on their bulk resistivity. The 10 m-thick salt layer composed of <b>idiomorphic</b> <b>crystals</b> of halite deposited during the earlier Holocene period was extrapolated from borehole HS- 2 through the study area. It was found that in Nahal Hever the typical value of the bulk resistivity of clay saturated with the DS brine varies between 0. 2 and 0. 3 Ωm, whereas saturated gravel and sandy sediments are characterized by resistivity between 0. 4 and 0. 6 Ωm. The high water salinity of the aquifer (enveloping the salt layer) expressed in terms of resistivity is also an important characterization of the sinkhole development mechanism. The electrical resistivity of the aquifer {{in the vicinity of the}} salt unit and its western border did not exceed 1 Ωm (in most cases aquifer resistivity was 0. 2 - 0. 6 Ωm) proving that, in accordance with existing criteria, the pores of the alluvial sediments are filled with highly mineralized DS brine. However, we suggest that the criterion of the aquifer resistivity responsible for the salt dissolution should be decreased from 1 Ωm to 0. 6 Ωm corresponding to the chloride concentration of approximately 100 g/l (the chloride saturation condition reaches 224 g/l in the northern DS basin and 280 g/l in the southern one). Based on TEM results we can reliably conclude that in 2005, when most of sinkholes had appeared at the surface, salt was located within a very low resistivity environment inside sediments saturated with DS brine. Intrusion of relatively fresh groundwater into the aquifer through the 600 × 600 m 2 area affected by sinkholes has not been observed...|$|R

Dry-process roasting and/or sublimation products with an arsenolite/sulphur mixture consist mainly of amorphous golden yellow oval drops and spherules of amorphous arsenic sulphide glass (g-AsxSx) with a smooth surface ranging from 1 to 20 μm Ø in association with arsenolite crystal aggregates {{and members of the}} alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9). A bright lemon yellow to orange-red arsenic sulphide pigment on a sixteenth/seventeenth-century South German polychrome recumbent sculpture and a seventeenth-century Dutch painting attributed to Rembrandt's studio has been identified as an artificial orpiment produced with dry-process (roasting/sublimation) methods. The recumbent figure contains (i) yellow, orange or red-brown amorphous splintery fragments and spherules of arsenic sulphide glass of up to 25 μm Ø, (ii) yellow, brown or red-brown crystalline spherules and splintery fragments of alacranite, (iii) lemon yellow to red-brown agglomerates of arsenic sulphide glass, and (iv) colourless irregular fragments or octahedral crystals of arsenolite. This type can be classified as 'complex artificial orpiment'. The arsenic sulphide pigment in the yellowish paint layers of the Rembrandt studio painting proved to be very uniform bright yellow spherules (max. 9 μm Ø) of arsenic sulphide glass, which can be classified as 'purified artificial orpiment glass'. A deep red historic arsenic sulphide cake from the collection of the Landesmuseum Joanneum (Graz, Austria) called 'Realgar' {{turned out to be an}} amorphous arsenic sulphide glass matrix (approx. g-As 2 S 3) filled with numerous red crystal aggregates of alacranite (approx. As 8 S 9) in the form of spherules, which fill gas bubbles and pores with an average 3 μm Ø (max. 20 μm Ø). A very fine-grained light red arsenic sulphide powder called 'Realgar' from an archaeological excavation of a historic arsenic smelter near Strassegg (Steiermark, Austria) turned out to be a member of the alacranite solid solution series (As 8 S 8) –(As 8 S 9) in the form of <b>idiomorphic</b> <b>crystals</b> and complex twinned crystal aggregates (average 10 μm Ø, max. 30 μm Ø).

40|$|Pyroclastic {{material}} including <b>idiomorphic</b> <b>crystals</b> of sanidine, biotite, and apatite, first {{identified in}} the type section at Tercis are contemporaneous with the Radotruncana calcarata (planktonic foraminifer) total range zone. A search was undertaken to define the palaeogeographical extent and to determine {{the importance of these}} remains of a previously unknown Campanian regional alkaline volcanic episode. A preliminary biostratigraphical search was carried out in the Tercis area and in the western Pyrenees followed by detailed micropalaeontological studies in southwestern France and northern Spain. The findings from five upper Campanian platform and flysch facies are reported in detail and deductions from three others are summarized. First, The microfaunal count of the boundary stratotype at Tercis has been increased by the use of acetolytic techniques to disaggregate indurated carbonates. So isolated tests of some key biostratigraphic markers are documented for the first time. The paucity in specimens of Radotruncana calcarata previously seen in thin sections from the type outcrop is not due to a scarcity of this particular taxon but to a general dearth of globotruncanids in the platform facies deposits of the Aturian Basin. The study shows that acetolysis multiplies the power of investigation of indurated limestones. Thus, the abundance and diversity of microproblematica discovered and studied in the stratotype section since 2006 has been confirmed and two new forms of incertae sedis are reported, one of which is called here Velafer ovatus. Today, 70 species of microproblematica are recognized at Tercis. These microproblematica allow a chronologic calibration of the deposits like or even more precise than those obtainable using ammonites or planktonic foraminifers. Sections sampled in the western Pyrenean flysch facies include the stratigraphic interval comprising the total range zone of Rd. calcarata for which we suggest here a duration of 0. 80 ± 0. 05 Ma. No microproblematica were found in these deep detrital facies. All sections reaching the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary contain a Contusotruncana (foraminifer) of which the morphology, illustrated anew from 3 discrete sections, is consistent with that of the specimens identified at this level in the Tercis type-section; they were called C. contusa or C. contusa?/C. patelliformis? These micropalaeontological studies substantiate the choice of Tercis as the best section in the world for location of the stratotype of the Campanian-Maastrichtian stage boundary; they show again its striking regional and global correlative power thanks to the unique diversity of its biological record of the late Cretaceous. In addition, it justifies the choice of a boundary level selected using the near-coincidence of a variety of key events bracketting a guide-event; 12 were clustered around the mid-level 115. 2 of the type section where the GSSP of the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary has been recognized internationally. Consequently, the selected level does not depend on a unique "magic marker" with its inherent uncertainty caused by difficulty in identification and scarcity locally and in other localities and environments. This may well be the case for the guide-ammonite Pachydiscus neubergicus as commonly used as a marker of the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary. The biostratigraphical study precisely locates the pyroclastic material observed at Tercis as within the range of Rd. calcarata, immediately above the last occurrence of Tubellus hunzikeri, the first occurrences of Lucernellus aubouini and Aquilegiella varia, 3 microproblematica of which the distribution is well documented at Tercis. Previously reported evidences of volcanism at Tercis: the presence of kaolinite in the clay size fraction and of microcrystals of sanidine, biotite, zircon, apatite are supplemented here by the discovery of slightly calcic and sodic siliceous spherules with traces of magnesium, aluminum and potassium. Kaolinite and sanidine have also been found in contemporaneous levels at Peyrata, {{in the vicinity of the}} type section. Farther away in the flysch facies, the contemporaneous deposits contain pyroclastic biotite mica flakes, <b>idiomorphic</b> zircon <b>crystals</b> and, more rarely, apatite crystals of which the morphology is consistent with a volcanic origin. The presence of traces of a volcanic episode in Campanian levels representing about 1 Ma of deposition are thus confirmed but in the Pyrenees no information is available concerning the site of its origin. In fact, the explanations for the presence of the pyroclastic material involves two possibilities: either there was Campanian alkaline volcanic activity in the Pyrenees similar to that associated with subduction (which has not been identified and is not consistent with the accepted geodynamical model of the area) or the pyroclastic material comes from North America, distant some 5000 km. Such long distance transport would involve an west-east eolian conveyance of mm sized volcanic elements for 1 Ma (a hypothesis to our knowledge undocumented) ...|$|R

A different association that includes aluminian diopside and grossular occurs (1) as veinlets in the marble close to the skarns and (2) as relict inclusions in endoskarns. From the geometrical relationships of the zone sequences and the veins, the textural features of the mineral associations and the inferred conditions of fluid–mineral equilibrium, these mineralogical peculiarities are interpreted as resulting from the superposition of two main stages. Firstly, there was circulation of a comparatively CO 2 -rich fluid formed the early aluminian diopside – grossular endoskarns, with depletion in Si (and Fe, Na, K) and inert behavior of Mg, Al, Ti. Then, a high-temperature (750 °C) fluid circulated {{on both sides of}} the contact between marble and endoskarns, and developed the melilite-rich, titanian-garnet-bearing rocks partly at the expens...|$|R

Bioturbation traces consist of Mg-calcite cemented sediment with N 13 C values between 337 and 346 x PeeDee Belemnite (PDB), which implicate methane as the carbon source. Glendonite, a calcite pseudomorphosis after ikaite (CaCO 3 W 6 H 2 O), and amber-colored concretions are both composed of varying amounts of calcite and Mg-calcite with N 13 C values between 319 and 334 x PDB. Isotope analyses of an ikaite crystal recovered in the vicinity reveals N 13 C values between 320 x and 322 x PDB indicating organic matter as the carbon source. Microscopic investigations of glendonites and amber-colored concretions show a porous fabric of a primary calcite phase that is overgrown by a secondary Mg-calcite cement. As ikaite pseudomorphs to porous calcite and as carbon isotope values are {{the same for the}} ikaite and the high end member values of glendonite samples, the primary calcite phase is suggested to be a former ikaite phase.

40|$|Abundant coal {{deposits}} {{have very}} low inorganic contents (ash yield; < 2 %) and hence are almost ash-free. Inexplicable {{to date is}} that the precursor of coal, modern peat deposits, almost nowhere have such low ash yields {{as a result of}} both the inorganic mineral and biogenic phytolith contents. However, despite the common occurrence of phytoliths in modern peats, they are invariably absent in coals. It has thus been hypothesized by some investigators that modern environments are not ideal analogues for the formation of low ash coal deposits. Here we present new evidence to suggest that mineral diagenesis during coalification can transform biogenic inorganics to new minerals and that a substantial component of these new minerals could be removed in solution during expulsion of moisture with coalification resulting in low ash precursors of coal. This study presents results from artificial coalification experiments of modern tropical forest peat material with ash yields between 2 - 4. 3 wt. %. The inorganic material of the peat consists almost exclusively of Al-Si-and Si-rich phytoliths and other bioliths; no other inorganic mineral matter is present. Compressed pellets of dried peat were deformed in a Griggs constant strain rate apparatus at a constant confining pressure of 5 kb and constant strain rate of 10 - 5 s - 1 at variable temperatures from 350 [degree sign]C to 550 [degree sign]C. The samples, exposed to artificial coalification processes, were then analysed by SEM, EDS, and XRD for semi-quantitative chemical analyses. The deformed material showed a lack of any biogenic silica and Al-Si-phytoliths, but contained neoformed <b>idiomorphic</b> quartz <b>crystals</b> and clays. We conclude that modern peat forming environments that have low-ash peats containing biogenic silica and other biogenic Al-Si-material can represent precursors of very low-ash coal deposits. Our experiments illustrate that during coalification, it is likely all or almost all biogenic material is transformed into new minerals, mainly quartz and clay minerals, such as kaolinite. Because natural systems are not confined to the same degree as our experiments, it is likely that part or all of the inorganic fraction migrates in solutions out of the peat or coal seam with available fluids, resulting in an almost ash-free coal deposit...|$|R
40|$|The Matongo {{carbonatite}} intrusion {{belongs to}} the Neoproterozoic Upper Ruvubu alkaline plutonic complex (URAPC), that is located in Burundi along the western branch of the East African Rift. Beside the Matongo carbonatite, the URAPC alkaline complex comprises feldspathoidal syenites, diorites, quartz-bearing syenites and granites. Three main facies have been recognized in the Matongo carbonatite: (1) Sövites represent the dominant facies. Two varieties have been recognized. A scarce coarse-grained sövite (sövite I), which is altered and poorly enriched in REE (4 <σREE< 8 ppm), is encountered in highly fractured zones. A fine-grained sövite (sövite II), which is made of saccharoidal calcite, commonly associated with apatite, aegirine and amphibole, is abundant in the intrusion. Sövite II is enriched in LREE (442 <σREE< 1550 ppm, 49 <LaN/YbN< 175). (2) Ferrocarbonatites, that form decimeter-wide veins crosscutting the sövites, are characterized by a LREE enriched patterns (225 <σREE< 1048 ppm, 17 <LaN/YbN< 64). (3) K-feldspar and biotite-rich fenite facies (silicocarbonatites) have been recognized at the contact between the carbonatites and the country rock. They are likewise LREE-enriched (134 <σREE< 681 ppm, 25 <LaN/YbN< 46). Additionaly, "late" hydrothermal MREE-rich carbonatite veinlets {{can be found in}} sövite I. They are characterized by moderate enrichment in REE (σREE= 397 ppm), with a MREE-humped pattern (LaN/YbN= 3. 7). The different facies represent the typical magmatic evolution of a carbonatite, while the silicocarbonatites are interpreted as resulting from the fenitisation of the country host-rocks. In addition, the most REE-depleted and fractionated facies, i. e. the coarse-grained sövite facies and the "late" calcite veinlets testify for hydrothermal processes that occurred after carbonatite emplacement and result from REE mobilization and redistribution. Large <b>idiomorphic</b> zircon <b>crystals</b> (megacrysts), found {{in the vicinity of the}} carbonatite can directly be related to the carbonatite evolution.

40|$|The Malm aquifer in {{southern}} Germany {{is one of}} the country’s most important geothermal reservoirs due to groundwater temperatures exceeding 100 °C and a high-flow regime. This thesis deals with the hydraulic and hydrochemical characterization of the Malm aquifer with regard to a minimization of the exploration risk of geothermal boreholes. The aim of this study is the analysis of processes that control groundwater dynamics and mass transport in the deep molasse in order to derive information on the flow regime and the groundwater quality of the aquifer. Within the scope of a first study, the hydrochemical conditions as well as the groundwater evolution are investigated based on the analysis of data obtained from 140 wells. As a result of major ion analyses, 6 hydrochemical water types are distinguished in the aquifer. In {{the northern part of the}} aquifer a Ca-(Mg) -HCO 3 water type occurs. These groundwaters are characterized by low mineralization and isotopic signatures indicating a recharge under recent climate conditions. Towards the central basin the Na-Ca-Mg-HCO 3 water type (IIa) is common and implies the influence of ion exchange processes and an increase of the total mineralization due to NaCl-waters leaking out of the overlying Tertiary formations. However, this infiltration volume is low compared to the groundwater exchange rates in the Malm aquifer. Therefore, the Na-Ca-HCO 3 -Cl water type (IIb) is still dominating in deeper parts of the aquifer. Their stable isotope signatures reflect colder climate conditions during recharge. The crystalline basement of the “Landshut-Neuöttinger Hoch” acts as a hydraulic barrier as well as a hydrochemical boundary to the Na-HCO 3 -Cl-waters in the Lower Bavarian Basin. A fourth water type (Na-HCO 3 -Cl) is detected in the northeastern basin, which is characterized by low earth alkali/alkali ratios combined with a high mineralization. Here, Na-Cl-HCO 3 water indicates the inflow of deep groundwaters from the crystalline basement of the Bavarian Forest (Bayerischer Wald). Special attention is paid to the less permeable rocks in the southwestern part of the Molasse Basin, where highly mineralized Na-Cl-HCO 3 formation waters dominate with occasionally increased hydrocarbon concentrations of still unknown origin. In order to determine the applicability of these waters for geothermal exploitation, a hydrogeochemical model is developed. The model results indicate that high concentrations of hydrosulphide as well as certain pressure and temperature conditions significantly promote mineral precipitation and corrosion in a geothermal binary cycle. The second part of this thesis examines the lithofacial influence on the productivity of the Moosburg SC 4 well. The well was drilled in 1990 to a final depth of 1585. 20 m. Purbeck (134 m) and Malm (453 m) were cored completely. The facial development is described based on 31 thin-sections of core samples obtained from the Malm basis to the Lowermost Cretaceous. The main focus is on the thick-bedded dolomites of the Malm Delta to Zeta 2, which are compared to outcrops in the Northern and Southern Franconian Alb, respectively. Size and morphology of the various dolomite types as well as the total porosity (18 samples) and permeability are analyzed. The thicknesses of the exploitable units with varying petrophysical characteristics are about 106 m for Malm Delta–Epsilon, 37 m for Malm Zeta 1 and 61 m for Malm Zeta 2. Porosities vary between << 1 % and 17. 1 %. The permeability is caused by intercrystalline pores between dolomite crystals (matrix permeability) and varies between 0. 03 and 63 mD. Size, morphology and interlocking of the dolomite crystals control the permeability. Fine-, medium- and coarse-crystalline, hypidiomorphic to <b>idiomorphic</b> dolomite <b>crystals</b> (up to 300 µm in size) of the Malm Delta-Epsilon exhibit permeabilities of up to 63 mD. In contrast, units with a higher content of non-carbonates (clay; higher gamma log) are mainly composed of xenomorphic to hypidiomorphic dolomite crystals up to 100 µm in size and reveal permeabilities between 0. 03 and 0. 26 mD. Highly porous zones (up to 17. 1 %) in the Malm Zeta 1 consist of <b>idiomorphic</b> <b>crystals</b> (20 - 70 µm), which form a loose, open crystal texture with a comparatively high permeability (6. 5 mD and 46 mD). Based on the determined permeabilities of 0. 03 mD to 63 mD, matrix productivities of 8 e- 6 to 1. 6 e- 2 l/(s•bar) are calculated under reservoir conditions (Temp. = 77 °C, TDS = 650 mg/l) for a 1 m thick interval in the well-bedded dolomite zone of the Moosburg SC 4 well. Hypothetically, a matrix productivity index of 3. 8 l/(s•bar) can be calculated from the maximum matrix productivity in relation to the entire dolomite unit thickness of 236 m. When comparing this hypothetical value to the calculated total productivity of the well of 5. 4 l/(s•bar), which was obtained from pumping test analyses, it becomes clear that even under these conditions only 70 % of the inflow is gained from the matrix. However, most of the determined matrix permeabilities are significantly smaller than the maximal value. This leads to the assumption, that fissured and karstified zones supply the most important inflow volume to the Moosburg SC 4 well. The third part of this thesis concentrates on the hydraulic characterization of the Malm aquifer based on pumping and drill-stem test data obtained from 98 wells. The analysis of thermally affected pumping test data requires the development of a method to adjust measured hydraulic heads, which enables a first interpretation of the pressure regime of many tests. Based on the interpretation of the hydraulic test data, information on mud losses as well as a detailed analysis of the paleohydrogeographic development, a map of the regional hydraulic conductivity distribution in the Malm aquifer is generated. Due to intensive karstification, the highest permeabilities of up to 1 e- 4 m/s occur along the northern border of the basin and on the southern rim of the Lower Bavarian Basin. Hydraulic conductivities of 1 e- 5 m/s characterize the karstified regions south of the river Danube. While west of the river Iller the permeability is rapidly decreasing {{in southern}} direction towards the Helvetic facies (< 1 e- 8 m/s), values of T/H = 1 e- 5 m/s extend to the Greater Munich Area. The high conductivity in the deeper parts of the basin is probably caused by intensive karstification of the South German carbonate platform during the Cretaceous. The greater Munich area, which is characterized by decreasing permeabilities from T/H = 1 e- 5 m/s in the northeast to T/H = 1 e- 7 m/s in the southwest, represents the transition zone to less permeable areas in the west. This thesis gives a concise overview on the results of more than 80 years of exploration of the Malm aquifer in the German Molasse Basin and provides a comprehensive insight into the hydraulic and hydrochemical conditions of this thermal system. It becomes apparent, that the Malm aquifer is a complex system consisting of pores, fractures and karst cavities, although on a larger basin scale, hydrostratigraphic units with similar characteristics can be combined. According to groundwater temperatures, hydraulic conductivities and hydrochemistry, the Malm aquifer in the South German Molasse Basin is a hydrogeothermal reservoir with a high potential for heat and electricity production...|$|R

The intrusive complex has an extension of 1. 2 x 0. 8 km occupying an area of 0. 5 km². It is constituted mainly by monzonite and trachyte. At the south flank of the massif, there exits a pyroclastic dyke and at the northwest flank, an intrusive welded crystal tuff. The pyroclastic dyke is 40 to 80 cm wide and intrudes into the basement porphyritic granite. This rock is constituted by welded tuff breccia with large amount of lapilli-size angular lithic fragments of trachyte. Along the contact plane of this dyke, there is an intercalation of the trachyte. The crystal tuff is characterised by abundant alkaline feldspar phenocrysts and mineral fragments of alkaline feldspar, quartz, biotite, and amphibole, showing a crystal matrix-supported texture.

Schreibersite occurs an <b>idiomorphic</b> and xenomorphic <b>crystals</b> and its mode of occurrence is variable in iron meteorites. Xenomorphic schreibersite is subdivided into 6 types {{on the basis}} of their textures and relationships with coexisting minerals. Chemical composition of schreibersite varies from 20 to 40 atom. % Ni with textural types among some iron meteorites with different bulk chemical compositions and even in the same meteorite (e. g. Canyon Diablo), while it does not vary so clear with textural types in ALH- 77263. Schreibersite seems to maintain a local equilibrium with coexisting metal phases. Based on the Fe-Ni-P phase diagram, it is estimated that xenomorphic and coarse-grained schreibersite in Y- 75031 and in DRPA 78007 were crystallized from stability field of taenite and schreibersite at about 800 ℃ under rapid diffusion conditions. Cooling rates within the parent bodies are calculated by using the diffusion rate of Ni between schreibersite and kamacite as follows; Canyon Diablo: 1. 1 × 10 ^ 6, Odessa: 1. 7 × 10 ^ 6, North Chile: 2. 3 × 10 ^ 6, ALH- 77263 : 8. 7 × 10 ^ 7 (year/℃). It is considered that ALH- 77263 had been cooled keeping more equilibrated state with slower cooling rate than Canyon Diablo. Variable textures and chemical compositions of schreibersite suggest that it had been maintained a local equilibrium with kamacite. Estimated temperatures at which the reaction mostly completed among metals and sulfide tend to show higher value in unequilibrated iron meteorites than equilibrated ones. It is inferred that unequilibrated iron meteorites had been rapidly cooled, but equilibrated ones slowly to maintain diffusion under the lower temperatures...|$|R
40|$|An area {{of massive}} barite {{precipitations}} was studied at a tectonic horst in 1500 m water depth in the Derugin Basin, Sea of Okhotsk. Seafloor observations and dredge samples showed irregular, block- to column-shaped barite build-ups up to 10 m high which were {{scattered over the}} seafloor along an observation track 3. 5 km long. High methane concentrations {{in the water column}} show that methane expulsion and probably carbonate precipitation is a recently active process. Small fields of chemoautotrophic clams (Calyptogena sp., Acharax sp.) at the seafloor provide additional evidence for active fluid venting. The white to yellow barites show a very porous and often layered internal fabric, and are typically covered by dark-brown Mn-rich sediment; electron microprobe spectroscopy measurements of barite sub-samples show a Ba substitution of up to 10. 5 mol% of Sr. Rare <b>idiomorphic</b> pyrite <b>crystals</b> (~ 1 %) in the barite fabric imply the presence of H 2 S. This was confirmed by clusters of living chemoautotrophic tube worms (1 mm in diameter) found in pores and channels within the barite. Microscopic examination showed that micritic aragonite and Mg-calcite aggregates or crusts are common authigenic precipitations within the barite fabric. Equivalent micritic carbonates and barite carbonate cemented worm tubes were recovered from sediment cores taken {{in the vicinity of the}} barite build-up area. Negative d 13 C values of these carbonates (>- 43. 5 per mill PDB) indicate methane as major carbon source; d 18 O values between 4. 04 and 5. 88 per mill PDB correspond to formation temperatures, which are certainly below 5 °C. One core also contained shells of Calyptogena sp. at different core depths with 14 C-ages ranging from 20 680 to > 49 080 yr. Pore water analyses revealed that fluids also contain high amounts of Ba; they also show decreasing SO 4 ** 2 - concentrations and a parallel increase of H 2 S with depth. Additionally, S and O isotope data of barite sulfate (d 34 S: 21. 0 - 38. 6 per mill CDT; d 18 O: 9. 0 - 17. 6 per mill SMOW) strongly point to biological sulfate reduction processes. The isotope ranges of both S and O can be exclusively explained as the result of a mixture of residual sulfate after a biological sulfate reduction and isotopic fractionation with 'normal' seawater sulfate. While massive barite deposits are commonly assumed to be of hydrothermal origin, the assemblage of cheomautotrophic clams, methane-derived carbonates, and non-thermally equilibrated barite sulfate strongly implies that these barites have formed at ambient bottom water temperatures and form the features of a Giant Cold Seep setting that has been active for at least 49 000 yr...|$|R
40|$|The Lac Volant Ni-Cu-Co-PGE prospect, located 75 km {{northeast}} of Sept-Iles in the Grenville Province of Québec, {{is an example}} of magmatic sulfide mineralization associated with mafic magmas in a high-grade metamorphic terrain. Disseminated and massive sulfides occur within a 20 - to 25 -m-thick zone in a gabbronorite dike intruding the gabbronorite of the host Matamec Complex. The average composition (n = 29) of the sulfides is estimated to be 2. 0 % Cu, 1. 5 % Ni, 0. 12 % Co, 67 ppb Pt, and 256 ppb Pd. The age of the dike is 1351 ± 6 Ma (U-Pb zircon age), which is identical to the age of the Rivière-Pentecôte anorthosite (1354 ± 3 Ma) located 130 km to the southwest. The dike originated by means of multiple injections of sulfide-bearing, tholeiitic magmas derived from a depleted, N-type mid-ocean ridge basalt (N-MORB) -type source. The dike is chemically similar to the gabbronoritic host, suggesting similar parental magmas. Geochemical variation within the dike was caused by fractional crystallization of silicates (orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, and plagioclase) and by ingestion of crustal rocks. Assimilation is suggested by the presence of xenoliths of granite and metasediment within the dike or narrow branching dikes; enrichment of the dike in Rb, Th, Ba, and light rare earth elements; and a negative Ta anomaly with respect to Th. The observed composition of the dike can be explained by 15 % crustal contamination, which would have occurred at depth before the magma began to crystallize mafic minerals. Massive, matrix, and disseminated sulfides, interpreted to be of magmatic origin, are composed of pyrrhotite (the principal species, 75 %), pentlandite (altered to bravoite and violarite), chalcopyrite, and pyrite. Magmatic breccia structures are common in gabbronorite containing disseminated sulfides. The presence of metasedimentary xenoliths and a high S/Se ratio (9, 000 – 16, 000) suggest that sulfide saturation was caused by contamination of the magma. The sulfide liquid interacted with a small volume of magma (R = silicate liquid/sulfide liquid = 200). Impoverishment of the sulfides in platinum-group elements (PGE) relative to Ni and Cu may have been caused by the loss of PGE during an earlier and deeper episode of sulfide separation. Limited sulfide fractionation is suggested by the chemical similarity of the three types of sulfide. Metamorphic recrystallization produced xenomorphic pyrrhotite and <b>idiomorphic</b> pyrite <b>crystals</b> up to 25 cm and 4 cm in size, respectively. Alteration by meteoric water caused the transformation of pentlandite into bravoite and violarite.

40|$|Mg-calcite-cemented bioturbation traces, glendonite {{aggregates}} of <b>idiomorphic,</b> bi-pyramidal <b>crystals</b> and porous, amber-colored carbonate concretions {{were recovered}} from a methane-dominated cold vent area in 380 m water depth at the northern Sakhalin Slope, Sea of Okhotsk. Bioturbation traces consist of Mg-calcite cemented sediment with δ 13 C values between − 37 and − 46 ‰ PeeDee Belemnite (PDB), which implicate methane as the carbon source. Glendonite, a calcite pseudomorphosis after ikaite (CaCO 3 · 6 H 2 O), and amber-colored concretions are both composed of varying amounts of calcite and Mg-calcite with δ 13 C values between − 19 and − 34 ‰ PDB. Isotope analyses of an ikaite crystal recovered in the vicinity reveals δ 13 C values between − 20 ‰ and − 22 ‰ PDB indicating organic matter as the carbon source. Microscopic investigations of glendonites and amber-colored concretions show a porous fabric of a primary calcite phase that is overgrown by a secondary Mg-calcite cement. As ikaite pseudomorphs to porous calcite and as carbon isotope values are {{the same for the}} ikaite and the high end member values of glendonite samples, the primary calcite phase is suggested to be a former ikaite phase. Because they share the equal color, fabric, mineral and isotopic composition with glendonites, the amber-colored concretions are also suggested to represent calcite that transformed from ikaite. A mixture of pseudomorph calcite (δ 13 C − 20 ‰ PDB), which originally formed as ikaite from degraded organic matter, and Mg-calcite (δ 13 C − 43 ‰ PDB), which crystallized due to the anaerobic oxidation of methane, can explain the varying carbon isotope data of the glendonites and the amber-colored concretions. The growth of ikaite, the transformation of ikaite to calcite, and the crystallization of Mg-calcite indicate changing geochemical conditions within a cold vent environment at different times. Ideal conditions for the ikaite formation are given during the establishment of a cold vent site when upward-migrating, methane-rich fluids enhance the anaerobe decomposition of organic matter, which again increases the phosphate and alkalinity concentrations near the sediment surface. Lower rates of organic matter decomposition during on-going venting decrease these high phosphate but also sulphate concentrations and allows other carbonate phases as Mg-calcite to form. This additional carbonate precipitation and the ikaite formation itself lower the high alkalinity and destabilize ikaite, which pseudomorphs to porous calcite. Triggered by the further upward-shifting SO 4 /H 2 S boundary and increasing methane oxidation rates, the typical cold vent methane-derived carbonate genesis takes place, which cements the sediment pore space and induces the secondary Mg-calcite crystallization within the glendonite fabric. Taking this scenario into account, ikaite formation should be a common process in the beginning of methane-dominated vent activity at cold bottom water temperatures; glendonite pseudomorphs can be assumed to represent a typical manifestation at fossil and recent cold vents at high latitudes...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{investigation}} of the abundance and modes of occurrence of the mineral matter and trace elements in the Permian coal seams of the Sydney Basin, eastern Australia and the Songzao Coalfield, SW China, as well as the relationships between trace elements and mineral matter components within the different parts of the coal seams. A range of analytical techniques have been used to obtain relevant data, including optical microscopy, electron microscopy/microprobe analyses, quantitative X-ray diffraction, geochemical techniques (ICP-MS/OES, CV-AFS, HG-AFS and Eschka method), and Laser Raman spectroscopy analysis. The Greta coal is a high-volatile bituminous coal and typically contains a high proportion of liptinite. The upper section of the Greta seam has several different indicators of marine influence, such as anomalously low vitrinite reflectance and abundant syngenetic pyrite, in the top part of the seam. Pyrite typically comprises 40 to 56 % of the mineral assemblage in the coals from the marine-influenced upper section. In contrast, the mineral matter in the lower section contains minor pyrite, and relatively abundant dawsonite, which may have been formed by reactions between earlier-precipitated kaolinite and Na 2 CO 3 - or NaHCO 3 -bearing fluids. The minerals, including most of the clay minerals, pyrite, siderite and quartz, within most of the Greta coal plies are largely of authigenic origin. Authigenic Na-rich I/S may have been syngenetically precipitated, probably after the peat was accumulated, with abundant Na and relatively minor K ions being supplied by the marine water. Coals from the Great Northern and Bulli seams are mainly high volatile A bituminous and medium volatile bituminous in rank, respectively. The mineral fractions of the coals, especially in the middle parts of the seams, are dominated by authigenic kaolinite with a very low abundance of quartz and carbonate minerals. Apart from tonstein bands in the Great Northern seam, authigenic processes therefore appear to be the dominant mechanism of mineral matter formation in both coal seams. Authigenic K-feldspar also occurs in {{the lower part of the}} Great Northern seam, with a variety of unusual modes of occurrence. A late syngenetic low-temperature hydrothermal fluid injection process is suggested for formation of this feldspar component. Both quartz and non-kaolinite clay minerals are also abundant in the lowermost ply of the coal seams, suggesting that the immediate base of the peat bed in each case was made-up of organic matter admixed with the same detrital sediment as supplied to the basin. K-feldspar, which is present in the coals and non-coal bands in the lower metre of the Great Northern seam section, is not present in the Bulli seam. This may reflect deposition of the Bulli seam at a greater distance from the sediment source, which was located in the New England Fold Belt. The coals from the Songzao Coalfield are mainly high ash, high sulphur semianthracites. XRD analysis indicates that minerals within the Songzao coals are mainly kaolinite, pyrite (or marcasite in some cases), and quartz, with minor proportions of carbonates, feldspar, anatase and sulphate minerals. Some of the illite and I/S is Na-rich in some of Datong coal samples. The I/S in the Songzao coals is mainly an alteration product of the original dispersed volcanic ash, due to the availability of necessary ions (e. g. K, Na, Mg) in the marine-influenced coal swamp. Organically-bound Na, which was expelled from the organic matter with coal rank advance, especially with anthracitization, may have supplied additional Na for the formation of Na-rich illite and I/S. Authigenic I/S also commonly occurs in a Tonghua coal ply that is overlain by a mafic bentonite and underlain by an alkali tonstein. K, Na and Mg for the formation of the I/S were probably derived from the leaching of the adjacent alkali tonstein and mafic bentonite. Although the marine water was also a possible supplier of the alkali elements, authigenic I/S is rare in other coals that occur further away from the altered volcanic layers. REE minerals, which occur as fracture infillings in a Tonghua coal sample, were probably crystallized from ascending hydrothermal fluids carrying high REE concentrations, which may in turn have been associated with contemporaneous volcanic activity. Two groups of REE minerals, probably REE-hydroxides or oxyhydroxides, and REE-carbonates, were tentatively identified. Tonstein bands in the Great Northern seam consist essentially of kaolinite. The occurrence of <b>idiomorphic</b> <b>crystals</b> of K-feldspar, which may represent members of the anorthoclase-sanidine series or a sodic sanidine, indicates an acid to intermediate volcanic ash input. Two tonstein and one K-bentonite bands in the Songzao coal seams have kaolinite and I/S as the dominant clay minerals, respectively. The volcanic ash layers in the peat swamp may have been originally converted to smectite, which was in turn altered to I/S and illite during diagenesis and/or rank advance, assuming that necessary ions (e. g. K, Na and Mg) were available from the marine water percolating in the peat swamp. Na-rich I/S may also have been formed in the claystones, with the additional Na probably being released from the organic matter during the coals rank advance. The thin tonstein layers were formed, with relevant ions having been largely removed, probably due to a greater leaching efficiency. In the relatively low-ash coals of the Greta, Great Northern, and Bulli seams, the concentrations of most trace elements are lower than that of average worldwide coals. By contrast, the high-ash Songzao coals have relatively high concentrations of most trace elements compared to averages for worldwide coals. In the sulphur-rich Songzao and Greta coals, most of the chalcophile trace elements show either poor or negative correlations with total iron sulphide contents. Only Hg and Se in the Songzao coals and Hg, Tl and As in the Greta coals are positively correlated with iron sulphides, respectively. This may be because the pyrite in the Songzao and Greta coals is mostly of syngenetic origin. Some chalcophile elements are correlated with Al 2 O 3, which most likely indicates a common source. The absence of traditional pyrite-metal associations may reflect wide variations in the concentrations of these elements in individual pyrite/marcasites, or simply poor retention of those elements in the pyrite/marcasite of the relevant coals. In addition to the lithophile elements, chalchophile elements in the Great Northern coals, including Se, Pb and Cu, also appear to be associated with kaolinite, and more likely a common source as well. The geochemistry of the coals has been affected by the adjacent tonstein/bentonite bands. The relatively immobile elements enriched in the altered volcanic ashes also tend to be enriched in the adjacent coal plies, possibly due to leaching by groundwaters. The coals near the alkali tonstein bands in the Tonghua and Yuyang sections of the Songzao Coalfield are high in Nb, Ta, Hf, Ga, Th, U, and REE. Coal samples overlying the mafic bentonite in the Tonghua section are high in TiO 2, V, Cr, Zn and Cu. However, the influence of the acid to intermediate tonstein layers in the Great Northern seam on the geochemistry of the adjacent coals is not as significant as in the Songzao coal seams. Trace elements, such as Li, Th, and U, are relatively high in most of the Great Northern coal plies adjacent to the tonstein bands...|$|R
40|$|As condições de geração e migração de magmas na crosta {{continental}} foram investigadas a partir de estudos de detalhe em dois afloramentos de granitos anatéticos tipo Nazaré Paulista (Nappe Socorro Guaxupé, região de Atibaia, SP), utilizando como ferramentas principais a geoquímica de elementos maiores e traços em rochas e minerais e a isotopia Sr-Nd. O granito Nazaré Paulista tem uma ampla variedade composicional, sendo as duas variedades principais um granada leucogranito e um granada-biotita granito cinza com uma rede de vênulas de leucogranito (625 Ma, U-Pb monazita). Ambos os tipos formam corpos sub-concordantes de dimensões decamétricas nos dois afloramentos; as relações de contato quando observadas indicam a intrusão posterior dos granada leucogranitos. Dois tipos de leucossomas foram reconhecidos em paragnaisses migmatíticos associados aos granitos Nazaré Paulista: (1) granada-biotita tonalito com baixa razão Rb/Sr (0, 3), padrões de ETR pouco fracionados ((La/Yb) N = 4 - 5) e com anomalia negativa de Eu e assinatura isotópica Sr-Nd idêntica à do mesossoma; (2) granada leucogranito, com razão Rb/Sr de 0, 56, padrões de ETR pouco fracionados ((La/Yb) N = 5), com anomalia positiva de Eu e eNd(t) idêntico ao do mesossoma, mas com 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(t) mais baixa. Ambos os tipos de leucossomas são distintos dos granitos e foram interpretados como produtos da fusão em presença de água do paragnaisse, respectivamente antes e depois da geração de feldspato potássico no protolito. Alguns contrastes geoquímicos relevantes são observados entre os granitos cinza e os leucogranitos: os primeiros apresentam maior mg# e Zr e padrões de ETR mais fracionados; as razões Rb-Sr de ambos os tipos são semelhantes (0, 4 - 0, 7). A assinatura isotópica Sr-Nd dos granitos mostra importante variação (eNd(t) = - 16 a - 13 e 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(t) = 0, 716 - 0, 728); apenas duas amostras de leucogranito têm assinatura coincidente com o campo dos paragnaisses regionais. Assumindo os paragnaisses como fonte única dos granitos Nazaré Paulista, é necessário que a fusão tenha ocorrido em desequílibrio e em presença de água. A química de elementos traços em granada foi fundamental para a identificação dos diversos processos de diferenciação que respondem pela variedade de granitos observada. Parte dos granitos cinza carrega um componente restítico, representado por granadas com núcleos ricos em ETRP+Y semelhantes às granadas dos paragnaisses encaixantes. As vênulas de granada leucogranito que cortam o granito cinza são formadas provavelmente pela ?refusão? do mush original durante a rápida ascensão e exibem granadas pobres em ETRP, cujos teores aumentam para a borda, definindo um padrão tipicamente magmático. Os leucogranitos que formam corpos isolados podem em parte corresponder a diferenciados do granito cinza, conforme indicado pelas relações de campo e pela geoquímica de rocha. No entanto os leucogranitos com alta 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(t) apresentam granadas com núcleos ricos em ETRP+Y e monazita com composição similar a dos paragnaisses, reforçando a hipótese de serem estes produtos da fusão direta de paragnaisses. The {{conditions of}} melt generation and migration {{in the continental}} crust were investigated through a detailed study of two outcrops of the anatectic Nazaré Paulista granites (Socorro-Guaxupé, Nappe, Atibaia region, SE Brazil), using as main tools the rock and mineral major and trace-element geochemistry and Sr-Nd isotopy. The Nazaré Paulista granite shows a wide compositional variation, and can be grouped into two main types: a garnet leucogranite and a veined grey garnet-biotite granite, the latter dated at 625 Ma (monazite U-Pb ID-TIMS). These types occur as subconcordant bodies 10 - 50 m wide and are present in both outcrops; where observed, the contact relationships show that the garnet leucogranites intruded after the grey granites. Two types of leucosome were recognized in migmatitic paragneisses associated to the Nazaré Paulista granites: (1) garnet-biotite tonalite with low Rb/Sr (0. 3), slightly fractionated REE patterns ((La/Yb) N = 4 - 5) with negative Eu anomalies and Sr-Nd isotope signature identical {{to that of the}} mesosome; and (2) garnet leucogranite, with Rb/Sr 0. 56, slightly fractionated REE patterns ((La/Yb) N 5) with positive Eu anomalies, eNd(t) identical to that of the mesosome, but lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(t). Both leucosomes are different from the granites, and were interpreted as the products of water-present melting of the paragneiss, respectively before and after the crystallization of K-feldspar in the protolith. Some relevant geochemical contrasts are observed between the two types of Nazaré Paulista granites: compared to the leucogranites, the gray granites show greater mg# and Zr and more fractionated REE patterns; the Rb/Sr ratios of both are low (0. 4 - 0. 7). The Sr-Nd isotope signature has important variations (eNd(t) = - 16 to - 13 and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(t) = 0. 716 - 0. 728); only two leucogranite samples have signatures that are coincident with the field of the regional paragneisses. Assuming the paragneisses as the only source of the Nazaré Paulista granites would require that melting occurred under disequilibrium and water-present conditions. The trace-element chemistry of garnet was important to identify the differentiation processes that respond for the observed variety of anatectic granites. Part of the gray granites carries a restitic component, represented by ETRP+Y-rich garnet cores that are similar to the garnets from the country-rock paragneisses. The garnet leucogranite veins that cut the gray granite were probably formed by p̈artial remeltingöf the original mush during rapid ascent, their <b>idiomorphic</b> garnet <b>crystals</b> have a distinctive composition (low HREE in the cores, increasing slightly to the rims), interpreted as magmatic. Some of the leucogranites forming isolated bodies may have been generated by fractionation from the gray granite, as indicated by field relations and rock geochemistry. On the other hand, the leucogranite with high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(t) has ETRP+Y-rich garnet cores and its monazite is compositionally {{similar to that of the}} paragneisses, features indicative that they were probably produced by direct melting of these rocks...|$|R
