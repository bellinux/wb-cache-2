5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E

500|$|Locke {{does not}} {{dedicate}} much space in Some Thoughts Concerning Education to outlining a specific curriculum; {{he is more}} concerned with convincing his readers that education is about instilling virtue and what Western educators would now call critical-thinking skills. Locke maintains that parents or teachers must first teach children how to learn and to enjoy learning. As he writes, the instructor [...] "should remember that his business is not so much to teach [...] all that is knowable, as to raise in him a love and esteem of knowledge; and to put him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>way</b> of knowing and improving himself." [...] But Locke does offer a few hints as to what he thinks a valuable curriculum might be. He deplores the long hours wasted on learning Latin and argues that children should first be taught to speak and write well in their native language, particularly recommending Aesop's Fables. [...] Most of Locke's recommendations are based on a similar principle of utility. So, for example, he claims that children should be taught to draw because {{it would be useful to}} them on their foreign travels (for recording the sites they visit), but poetry and music, he says, are a waste of time. Locke was also at the forefront of the scientific revolution and advocated the teaching of geography, astronomy, and anatomy. Locke's curricular recommendations reflect the break from scholastic humanism and the emergence of a new kind of education—one emphasising not only science but also practical professional training. Locke also recommended, for example, that every (male) child learn a trade. Locke's pedagogical suggestions marked the beginning of a new bourgeois ethos that would come to define Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.|$|E
