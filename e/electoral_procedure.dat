Averell Harriman from the United States, and Archibald Clerk-Kerr from the United Kingdom—visited the capital Bucharest and agreed for {{elections}} to be convened in May 1946, {{on the basis of the}} Yalta Agreements. Nevertheless, and despite opposition protests, the pro-Soviet Groza cabinet took the liberty to prolong the term, passing the required new <b>electoral</b> <b>procedure</b> on June 17.|$|E
25|$|Some quirks of the <b>electoral</b> <b>procedure</b> at the AGM {{are that}} posts are filled in {{descending}} order, allowing those {{who failed to}} win more important posts to stand for others, and that candidates must leave the room while a vote is taken on them. The AGM was traditionally held {{at the end of}} the University's Candlemas Term, around the middle of March. Despite the new semester-based structure of the University's academic year, this remains the case and the AGM is now held shortly before the end of the teaching period of the second semester, which is separated from the exam period by the Easter vacation.|$|E
500|$|Huskisson's {{supporters}} refused {{an offer}} {{to return to the}} Duke of Wellington's cabinet after his death, and at the beginning of November Wellington announced to Parliament that [...] "the constitution needed no improvement and that he would resist any measure of parliamentary reform {{as long as he was}} in office". Fearing serious social unrest, large numbers of Tory MPs rebelled in a vote on governmental expenses. On 15November 1830, exactly two months after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, Wellington lost a vote of no confidence and was replaced as Prime Minister a week later by Earl Grey. Grey set about reforming Britain's corrupt and antiquated <b>electoral</b> <b>procedure,</b> the issue over which Huskisson had resigned. In 1832 the Representation of the People Act (commonly known as the Reform Act) was finally passed.|$|E

The party's board announced a new <b>electoral</b> <b>procedure.</b> During the congress Kathalijne Buitenweg, an MEP and candidate, announced wish to be considered for the position of top candidate. She narrowly won the elections from Lagendijk. This came as a great surprise to all. Especially for Buitenweg who had not written an acceptance speech and read out Lagendijk's.|$|E

40|$|When {{developing}} electoral protocols, desiderata {{include a}} system which is transparent, non-manipulable, honest, and not open to strategizing. However, these desiderata are in tension with each other: Often, transparent <b>electoral</b> <b>procedures</b> are the least strategy resistant, and many honest procedures encourage manipulation. Thus, a balance between these different goals must be sought. In modern times, since the seminal result on vote manipulation, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem, much attention {{has been devoted to}} developing voting rules where manipulation is never {{in the best interest of}} the voters, or which are computationally too complex for the average bounded agent to be able to manipulate. In medieval times, such computational routes were generally not available, meaning that other constraints had to be put in place to discourage strategizing and manipulation. We discuss various voting rules and <b>electoral</b> <b>procedures</b> used in the Middle Ages in both ecclesiastical and secular context, highlighting some protocols with unique properties. ...|$|R
