30|$|Unpredictability {{by local}} farmers, {{insufficiency}} and seasonality of rainfall have severely affected productivity of rain-fed agriculture in Cheleleka watershed. Thus, irrigated agriculture has a paramount role in lifesaving and insuring food security. Mismanagement of irrigation water influences agricultural productivity {{and efficiency of}} water uses. This study aimed to assess performance and potential of traditional surface irrigation schemes and to survey conflicts resulting from irrigation water use and management. Three major rivers in Cheleleka watershed (Wesha, Worka and Wodesa) where traditional irrigation has been widely practiced were selected purposively. The <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> of each river were identified and categorized into upper, middle and lower parts based on its related location in the watershed. The soil samples, infiltration rate, long time meteorology, conveyance efficiency, <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> and discharge at diversion points were analyzed. In addition, 49 households in <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> of the three rivers were interviewed and three focus group discussions were held. About 0.16 and 0.14  m 3 /s of discharge were recorded in irrigation areas of the middle Wodesa and upper Worka rivers, respectively. The conveyance efficiency of the traditional surface irrigation canals at middle Wodesa and upper Wesha and Worka was less than 50 %. The general potentials of surface irrigation water across the three perennial rivers were greater than 23 million cubic meters per year. The moisture stored in root zone or readily available water in existing farmers’ practices was found far beyond the carrying capacity of the soils, especially in middle Wodesa and upper Wesha and Worka areas. Performances of the traditional surface irrigation schemes are very low and had aggravated irrigation water losses and contributed to crop water scarcity and conflicts. The results also showed that farmers in the upper parts of the area {{and close to the}} diversion points excessively irrigate the cropland, whereas those far away and in lower watersheds of each river receive irrigation water insufficiently and irregularly. Even though there was irrigation management system/committee, the set principle was not respected.|$|R

In relation to water saving, it studies the most important irrigation modernization processes and their water saving goals. Next, it presents water accounting as a tool for water resource assessment of <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas.</b> Based on this, it concludes that, in general, modernized irrigation in Spain consumes more water than before, mainly due to changes in crop patterns, the increase in irrigated areas, and the greater satisfaction of the water requirements of crops. Different case studies are analyzed, all revealing higher water consumption after modernization. Regarding energy consumption, it studies the greater electricity consumption arising from irrigation modernization when surface irrigation is replaced by pressurized irrigation using pumping systems. It analyses the high economic cost of this pressurization since the liberalization of the electricity market in 2008, and how this high operating cost constitutes a serious threat to the economic viability of some modernized areas. As a general conclusion, it observes that irrigation modernization policy in Spain, mainly financed with billions of euros from Europe, Spanish state and Spanish regions, and justified socially by hypothetical water savings, has not in practice led to any water savings, but rather the reverse. Productivity in modernized farms has increased, but their general costs and the costs of amortizing the investments made have also increased.

A simulation model was developed based on the concept of rotation irrigation and was used in the irrigation water management study to estimate the optimal irrigation time interval that will maximize the yield of rice, determine the effects of subdividing the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> into rotation areas on the yield of rice and water supply, and estimate the maximum area that would give the highest yield and the optimal area that could be put under rice production for a river water source;The input data were rainfall, pan evaporation and stream flow. The depth of water applied and the potential evapotranspiration were computed. Water depletion was calculated by adding the potential evapotranspiration and soil percolation. The number of moisture-stress days was determined, based on the depth of water in the field; the yield of rice was calculated by use of a yield function {{based on the number of}} moisture-stress days developed from the data obtained in the Philippines;The combination of the number of rotation areas and the rotation interval that produced the highest yield was selected as the optimal water management for a given area. Since the simulation was done for several irrigable areas, the largest area that gave the potential yield of 2. 43 tons/acre was selected as the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> that can be supplied with irrigation water without moisture stress, and the area that obtained the highest profit was selected as the optimal irrigable area;It was not necessary to subdivide the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> into rotation areas when the water supply was adequate. The rotation interval varied from 1 to 8 days and did not affect significantly the yield of rice. However, an interval of more than 8 days considerably decreased the yield. For the <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> of highest profit, it was necessary to divide the area into 4 rotation areas which were irrigated at 4 -day intervals;There was no significant difference between the rotation irrigation scheme and continuous irrigation for small irrigable areas when the water supply was adequate.

This study was initiated {{with the objective of}} assessing the water and land resources potential of river catchments in Dale Woreda of Sidama Zone for irrigation development and generating geo-referenced map of these resources by using Geographic Information System. Watershed delineation, identification of potential irrigable land, and estimation of irrigation water requirement and surface water resources of river catchments were the steps followed to assess this irrigation potential. Results of the watershed delineation lead to gave two main watersheds (Bilate and Gidawo) and four sub-watersheds on Gidawo (Dama, Raro, Wamole and Woyima). To identify potential irrigable land, irrigation suitability factors such as soil type, slope, land cover/use, and distance from water supply (sources) were taken into account. The irrigation suitability analysis of these factors indicate that 86 % of soil and 58. 5 % slope in the study area are in the range of highly suitable to marginally suitable for surface irrigation system. In terms of land cover/use, 87. 1 % of land cover/use are highly suitable where as 12. 9 % were restricted from irrigation development. Overall, the weighted overlay analysis of these factors gave potential irrigable land among river catchments as Bilate (3, 621. 6 ha), Dama (552. 7 ha), Gidawo (7, 265. 6 ha), Raro (693. 35 ha), Wamole (1, 511. 3 ha) and Woyima (805. 66 ha). To grow on these identified <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas,</b> two crops such as banana and sugarcane were selected and their gross irrigation demand calculated by using nearby climatic stations.

40|$|The {{development}} of different tools {{to evaluate the}} performance of Water Users Associations (WUAs) is an important practice for improving water and energy management, together with other production costs. One of these tools is the Benchmarking technique, {{which is based on}} the comparison between different WUAs to determine the best practices in each of them. In this paper, a Benchmarking process is applied to seven WUAs located in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) during three irrigation seasons (2006 - 2008). The performance indicators developed by the International Programme for Technology and Research in Irrigation and Drainage (IPTRID) are used, while new indicators dealing with production and energy are proposed. The goals of this paper are to group WUAs with the same characteristics, using performance and energy indicators, and to reduce the set of indicators using statistical methods. The most important indicators, easy to obtain and yielding result in maximum information are retained for further use. Three proposals reducing the initial number of indicators were proposed, with an aim of being useful for future applications based on characterizing WUAs. Indicators results highlighted that <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> can be grouped based on the application of drip irrigation systems and those with sprinkler irrigation systems. When using groundwater resources, no significant differences were observed for energy consumption between these irrigation systems. This {{can be explained by the}} indicator energy load index (ICE, m), which had similar values in all WUAs analyzed. According to annual irrigation water supply per unit irrigated area (VTSr, m 3 Â ha- 1), the highest values (between 5200 Â m 3 Â ha- 1 and 6800 Â m 3 Â ha- 1) were obtained in WUAs with sprinkler irrigation systems, which contained crops characterized by high water requirements, compared to the VTSr (less than 1800 Â m 3 Â ha- 1) of WUAs with drip irrigation systems, with crops that required less volume of irrigation water. Regarding production efficiency indicators, in drip irrigation systems the high presence of vineyards, almond and olive trees, crops with low water requirements, explained high values of gross margin per unit irrigation delivery (MBVs, [euro]Â m- 3) (close to 0. 82 Â [euro]Â m- 3) in comparison with sprinkler irrigation systems (close to 0. 36 Â [euro]Â m- 3).

However, the performance of Jari and Aloma Small Scale Irrigation (SSI) schemes was not assessed since its operation. Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate the water delivery, on-farm water management and organizational performances of the two SSI schemes. Secondary data from different reports and primary data through field measurements, household surveys, key informant interviews and group discussions were collected. CROPWAT 8. 0 model, SPSS and GIS software were {{used to analyze the}} data. The result of this study revealed that, the overall canal water delivery efficiencies of Jari and Aloma SSI schemes were 66 % and 59 %, respectively. Majority of the respondents, 37 % in Jari and 61. 9 % in Alom, reflected that the maintenance condition of irrigation infrastructures was bad. From the respondents 45. 5 % in Jari and 50 % in Aloma described that illegal water abstraction accounts the primary cause for unfair water distributions. The ratios of relative water supply and the relative irrigation water supply were almost equal to 1 at both SSI schemes. This implied that the amount of water supplied was sufficient for the water demand of the schemes. Output per unit irrigated area values of 2198 $/ha and 1356 $/ha were calculated at Jari and Aloma SSI schemes, respectively. Furthermore, the output per unit command area of Jari (3464 $/ha) was three fold higher than the value of Aloma (1061 $/ha). Water productivity indicators such as, Output per unit irrigation water supplied (OPUIS), Output per unit irrigation water delivered (OPUID) and Output per unit water consumed (OPUWC) values of 0. 47 $/m 3, 0. 89 $/m 3 and 0. 49 $/m 3 in Jari, and 0. 2 $/m 3, 0. 55 $/m 3 and 0. 3 $/m 3 in Aloma schemes were calculated, respectively.

However, in developing countries planning of such activity is greatly hampered {{by the lack of}} a sufficiently dense network of weather stations measuring precipitation. The objective of this dissertation is, therefore, to evaluate the freely available high resolution satellite rainfall estimates in the Lake Tana Basin which has a relatively denser ground rainfall stations network. Rainfall estimates of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3 B 42 version 7, EUMETSAT's Meteorological Product Extraction Facility (MPEF), Multi-Sensor Precipitation Estimate-Geostationary (MPEG) and Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) are considered. The satellite rainfall is validated by a direct comparison with the gauged rainfall data, and through hydrological modelling to capture the observed flow using a semi-distributed hydrological model Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning (HBV) and Parameter Efficient Distributed (PED). The result of direct comparison indicated that, the MPEG and CFSR rainfall provided the most accurate rainfall estimates. On average, for 38 stations, 78 and 86 % of the observed rainfall variation is explained by MPEG and CFSR data, respectively, while TRMM explained only 17 % of the variation. The hydrological modelling indicated that both the gauged and the CFSR precipitation estimates were able to reproduce the stream flow well for either of the models. The TRMM data was not be able to capture the observed flow through model calibration for both models. Bias corrected MPEG rainfall by the gauged monthly means performed as well as or better than the gauged rainfall data in capturing the observed flow through hydrologic model calibration.

40|$|Land {{cultivated}} in paddy increased almost ten-fold in Northeast Thailand during {{the twentieth century}} and now accounts for almost 40 % of the area of this region. Such intensive paddy expansion was attained through reclamation not only of natural wet or irrigable land, but also of somewhat dry, hilly land. It is considered that the increase in dry paddy fields in hilly areas has caused land degradation, by reducing the stability of land, and decreasing rice yields in the area. This paper provides a background to the processes involved in paddy expansion in the Thap Than River basin {{in the southern part of}} Northeast Thailand based on the results of interviews with local people and an analysis of geographical information. The results show that lower-lying lands are not always reclaimed earlier, because the migration of people to land suitable for rice cultivation is often restricted by the lack of a road network. The percentage of <b>irrigable</b> paddy <b>area</b> to total paddy area has not changed significantly except in the Sangkha District at the origin of the Thap Than River system, where rice land has been developed in areas in which the riverbeds lopes relatively steeply. Only in this district has rice production drastically shifted from irrigation-based to rain-fed...|$|R
40|$|Small {{reservoirs}} (SRs) development, as {{a strategy}} to enhance food and water security in water-scarce regions, has long attracted the interests of governments and development agents. The main argument put forward was that by providing water for small-scale agriculture, they can cushion the impacts of drought and rainfall variability on vulnerable and less-developed regions. Because of the dominance of interests in small-scale irrigation, performance assessments of SRs have concentrated on irrigation outcomes. The multiple non-irrigation uses/benefits and potential negative externalities were largely neglected in the measurement of their performance. The publication of Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in 2005 triggered the concept of ‘ecosystem services’ and prompted both academia and policy decisions to consider multiple effects/impacts of human activities on natural capital, ecosystem services, and human wellbeing. Along {{the lines of the}} surge in thoughts in ‘ecosystem services’, SRs, besides irrigation use, could generate multiple benefits such as improved access to domestic water, enhance women’s position, recreation, livelihood diversification, fisheries, water availability for livestock, limiting floods, and increased biodiversity. On the other hand, SRs may have unwanted side-effects such as environmental deterioration, decrease in water quality, adverse health impacts (e. g., harbour mosquitos), and reduce environmental flows and ground water recharge. Thus, SRs’ performance need to be assessed against these multiple benefits/dis-benefits and whether there exist trade-offs or synergetic relationship. In the context of ecosystem services (ES), trade-offs between ES arise from management and/or utilization choices made by humans, which can change the type, magnitude, quality and relative mix of ES. Trade-offs occur when the provision of one or more ES is reduced as a consequence of increased use of another ES. In some cases, trade-offs may be an explicit choice; in others, it may take place without explicit account or even without awareness of the decision makers. As human activities transform ecosystems to obtain more of specific services, other services tend to diminish (trade-offs). Understanding how trade-offs operate temporally and spatially in various ecosystems and analysis of either to minimize the trade-offs or find synergetic solutions could provide decision support evidence for sustainable management of natural resources and human wellbeing. Most parts of Burkina Faso (BF) suffer from physical water scarcity and irregular distribution of groundwater. SR development has been promoted as a key strategy aiming at enhancing water and food security in BF. A conservative estimate shows that there are about 1500 SRs in BF. These are used for small-scale irrigations, livestock, and domestic purposes. From 2002 BF has initiated a program to develop village irrigation, which facilitates the exploitation of all the <b>irrigable</b> <b>areas</b> around the SRs and inland valleys. On the other hand these reservoirs may have negative effects such as flooding and health impacts. Using an ecosystem services-based approach on a sample of small reservoirs in BF, this study investigates the multiple ecosystems services/dis-services, their trade-offs, and synergetic relationships. This provides evidence for improved management and utilization of the SRs in order to minimize the trade-offs and enhance synergetic solutions that ultimately contribute to water and food security...|$|R
30|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Nkhate irrigation scheme, located in Chikwawa district in the Southern region of Malawi. The net <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> of the scheme is 233  ha, divided into 22 blocks of various sizes. The scheme benefits a total of 1032 farmers. The scheme was first constructed with funding from the Chinese Government between 1979 and 1980 and was later rehabilitated under the Irrigation, Rural Livelihood Agriculture Development Project (IRLADP) in 2009. The type of irrigation adopted at the scheme is the gravity fed furrow irrigation whose irrigation water is diverted from Nkhate River which empties into the Shire River. Most of the major crops grown at the scheme are maize, beans and rice. The dominant soil types found at the scheme are sandy-clay and heavy clay soils.|$|E
40|$|On-farm {{water storage}} (OFWS) is a farmers' {{response}} to mitigating inadequate and variable water supply in canal commands in the Indira Gandhi Nahar Pariyojana project in Rajasthan, India. This paper assesses {{the impact of}} OFWS on on-farm performance, based on a sample of farms with and without storage tanks. OFWS facilitated the use of sprinklers, {{and the use of}} both together contributed to an improved level of on-farm water control and timing of inputs, which resulted in an increase in gross irrigated area and crop yields. As a result, the average net value of output per hectare is 56 % higher in farms with the new infrastructure. This is a financially viable intervention for farms with an <b>irrigable</b> <b>area</b> larger than 5 ha, with a benefit?cost ratio of 2. 2 and internal rate of return of 35 %. OFWS can be a catalyst for rejuvenating canal irrigation schemes with low on-farm performance...|$|E
40|$|European water policy, as {{set out in}} the Water Framework Directive (WFD), {{requires}} all EU Member States {{to implement}} volumetric water pricing at rates that roughly cover the total costs of providing water services. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a methodology that, for the different farmtypes in an <b>irrigable</b> <b>area,</b> will enable us to analyse the differential impact that a pricing policy for irrigation water would have. For this purpose, Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT) mathematical programming models have been used. The methodology is implemented on a representative area in the Duero Valley in Spain. Our results show the usefulness of differential analysis in evaluating the impact of a water pricing policy. This allows significant differences in the evolution of agricultural incomes to be observed, as well as the recovery of costs by the State, demand for agricultural employment and the consumption of agrochemicals resulting from rising prices of irrigation water in various groups of farmers within a given irrigated area...|$|E
40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{cultivation of}} energy crops irrigated with {{non-conventional water resources}} could reduce the negative impacts of fossil fuel use, while still saving potable supplies and decreasing pollution in surface water, particularly in water-deficient environments, like the Mediterranean region. Energy planning is a complex process involving multiple decision makers and criteria. Given the spatial nature of the problem, the research proposes a spatial analysis model to assess the agronomic and economic feasibility of vegetation filter systems in Basilicata region, southern Italy. The model chosen for land suitability analysis is the ordered weighted averaging (OWA) {{with the use of}} linguistic quantifiers. The suitability map obtained from the OWA model was used as input in the spatial analysis functions to quantify the productivity and irrigation needs of the species, the potential <b>irrigable</b> service <b>area</b> of the wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), as well as the distances between them and SRF, which are all key elements in the economic evaluation. The results show that the distance is the main element that influences the feasibility: only 25 out of 163 WWTPs are cost-effective and can actually irrigate 864 ha of SRF. The research demonstrates that there is a great potential for bio-energy development in the region with significant economic advantages; in fact, there is a large number of sites with positive NPV up to 50, 876. 43 €/ha and payback period between 3 and 10 years. The implementation of vegetation filter systems could create chains with a high number of local actors (farmers, intermediaries, forest nurseries, etc.) and contribute to promoting territorial development and employment...|$|R
40|$|Degradation of {{irrigation}} schemes, low and variable land productivity, and inefficient use of production inputs are major concerns in Mauritania. That prompted this benchmarking analysis of 17 small and 3 large irrigation schemes located along the River Senegal. The objectives were to establish benchmarks for both productivity and performance {{of irrigation}} schemes along the valley, and to inquire whether small schemes function better than large schemes. Cluster and data envelopment analyses enabled, respectively, grouping and ranking of irrigation schemes according {{to a set of}} pre-determined performance indicators: viz. energy costs, relative irrigation supply, irrigation intensity related to <b>irrigable</b> and equipped <b>area,</b> adequacy, and land productivity. Land productivity, which was highly variable, was compared to simulated land productivity for non-limiting conditions in order to determine yield gap variations. Few early sown crops were close to the simulated yield frontier of 10. 6 tha- 1 and the mean yield was similar for large and small schemes (3. 50 tha- 1 and 3. 77 tha- 1, respectively). The analysis of the indicators revealed that, on average, large schemes performed similarly to small-scale schemes, but small schemes were more variable, particularly in input-use efficiency. Analysis of clusters identified three groups of irrigation schemes: viz. consuming and productive, precarious, and productive and economic. According to data envelopment analysis, four irrigation schemes were identified as technically efficient. Their average land productivity was relatively high (4. 75 tha- 1) and energy costs were contained (59 €ha- 1). Data envelopment analysis also identified the particular efficient schemes that should be taken as reference for improvement of each inefficient scheme. © 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Los tradicionales paisajes agrarios del Valle cordobés, ligados a la presencia del Guadalquivir, han sido importantes y tempranas áreas de modernización económica, gracias al desarrollo de la agricultura, el regadío y la industrialización. Sin embargo, esas funciones agrarias, antaño insepa- rables de la identidad paisajística de los ruedos y el extrarradio de Córdoba, se hallan en retroceso desde el último tercio del siglo XX, un retroceso provocado por la expansión de la ciudad difusa de Córdoba y su rururbanización. Las funciones agrarias de antaño han dejado paso a nuevos usos y a nuevos paisajes, todo ello unido al devenir socioeconómico de la capital y a las demandas que ésta exige de su entorno. El presente artículo, utilizando argumentos y principios geográfi co- históricos, persigue la descripción y concreción {{temporal}} de esos cambios mediante la recopilación documental, fotográfi ca y cartográfi ca, lo que habrá de permitir la reconstrucción de esos cambios paisajísticos y de los signifi cados que se le han atribuido con el paso del tiempoThe {{main purpose}} of the refl ections set out {{in this article is}} to outline and defi ne new lines of research in the conceptualisation and evolution of landscape in the area known as the Valle Medio Cordobés, its terraces and meadow lands, its relationships with the immediate surrounding areas and the city of Córdoba, with a view to sketching the landscape dynamics in the area of study and their evolution from traditional agrarian models to the current situation of predominant rur-urbanisation. This evolutionary reconstruction of the landscape, and the description of territorial relations which explain its changes, can be expressed through the following issues: evolutionary analysis of possible physical alterations in the area of study; examination of cultural and natural relations and dynamics as shapers of the landscape; evolutionary description of the structure of property and the socioeconomic composition of land ownership; dynamic diagnosis of usage; evolution of organised or infrastructural landscape; communication, service and supply links, etc.; and chronological reconstruction of the landscape identity of the area studied. The methodological proposal used, within fl exible parameters, is as follows: search and analysis of historic and recent bibliography; archive search (Municipal Archive of Córdoba, Historic Provincial Archive of Córdoba, Archive of the Hydrographical Confederation of the Guadalquivir, Archive of the Guadalmellato Irrigation Association, Municipal Urban Planning Department, Cadastral Register, General Archive of Simancas, National Historic Archive and Royal Chancery of Granada); search and study of historic and contemporary cartographic sources; and fi eldwork. The fi ndings of this research have revealed, fi rstly, the undisputable strategic value of the Valle Cordobés within the geographic and urban context of the city of Córdoba, since this nucleus, its history and socioeconomic needs have since time immemorial conditioned the uses made of its rural surroundings. Similarly, evolutionary analysis of the territory and the agrarian landscape of its outlying areas shows the existence of an evident dynamic of transformation, destruction and reconstruction, associated with the needs of Córdoba and its inhabitants. From natural corridor and communication link, to the current rur-urban scenario, the Valle Medio Cordobés area has moved through the predominance of extensive agrarian uses, the exploitation of the ‘dehesa’ pasture lands for livestock, and the introduction of irrigation and agro-industrialisation. And in this development, an intensely humanised environment has been shaped, littered with anthropic imprints and also symbols and identities which have changed along with the predominant uses and demands imposed by the city of Córdoba itself. From the mid 1950 s up to the present day, there has been a process of de-agrarianisation in the Valle Cordobés area, accompanied by a division of property which has practically eradicated the former predominance of large ‘Latifundio’ estates. There has also been a sustained diminishment, particularly since the 1980 s, of the <b>irrigable</b> land <b>area</b> of Guadalmellato, which was once particularly highly valued. In addition to the peri-urban growth of Córdoba and Almodóvar, the creation of certain industrial estates, and the increase in residential areas of certain population nucleuses such as Vil- larrubia, this area has also been witness to a process of rur-urban parcelling. The once extensive swathes of agricultural land have been divided up into small plots of just 1, 000 and 1, 500 m 2, which are now home to chalets, swimming pools, allotments, small industries, and restaurants, et...|$|R
