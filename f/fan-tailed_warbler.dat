50|$|This genus is {{sometimes}} split off with various other southern warbler genera and given family {{status as the}} Cisticolidae. This species was previously known as <b>Fan-tailed</b> <b>Warbler,</b> but the current name gives consistency with the many tropical cisticola species, and avoids confusion with an American species also named <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>warbler</b> is {{sometimes}} {{placed in the}} monotypic genus Euthlypis due to its unique morphology, but its nest, eggs, voice, and juvenile plumage are consistent with Basileuterus.|$|E
50|$|The {{zitting cisticola}} (or <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>warbler)</b> is {{widespread}} throughout the tropics and even breeds in southern Europe. It has occurred {{on a few}} occasions as a vagrant to England.|$|E
50|$|The {{foraging}} of {{nine-banded armadillo}} can cause mild {{damage to the}} root systems of certain plants. Skunks, cotton rats, burrowing owls, pine snakes, and rattlesnakes can be found living in abandoned armadillo burrows. Occasionally, the armadillo may threaten the endangered gopher tortoise by aggressively displacing them from their burrows and claiming the burrows for themselves. Studies have shown the <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>warbler</b> habitually follows armadillos to feed on insects and other invertebrates displaced by them.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fan-tailed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Basileuterus lachrymosus) is a New World warbler in {{the genus}} Basileuterus that lives along the Pacific slope from {{northern}} Mexico to Nicaragua. Vagrant records exist for Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. It is yellow on its throat and underparts with a tawny wash on its chest. The head is gray with a black-framed yellow crown and white around the eyes. The undertail coverlets are white. They are 5.8-6.3 in (14.5-16 cm) long and have pleasant, upslurred song. Fan-tailed warblers {{live in and}} {{at the edge of}} evergreen and semideciduous forest, especially near ravines. They eat ants, especially army ants, and are seen hopping around on either the forest floor or close to it. They are found alone or in pairs.|$|E
