5|$|Entering Folsom in Atlantic County, US 322 {{passes a}} couple lakes and some wooded residences {{before coming to}} an {{interchange}} with Route 54, where the route has a median. Past this interchange, the road continues southeast through heavily forested areas to an intersection with the southern terminus of Route 73 (signed as County Route 561 Spur). After this intersection, US 322 turns south and enters Hamilton Township, where it encounters County Route 559 at a traffic circle that has been modified to <b>have</b> <b>US</b> 322 run through it. After passing more woods and a clearing for farms, the road widens into a four-lane divided highway and has an interchange with Route 50. A short while after, the route enters a residential and commercial area, passing by Atlantic Cape Community College before heading {{to the south of}} the Hamilton Mall. Here, US 322 intersects U.S. Route 40, which merges onto the Black Horse Pike.|$|E

25|$|The {{reciprocal}} recognition of licenses frequently not only {{depends on the}} involved licensing authorities, {{but also on the}} nationality of the bearer. As an example, in the US, foreign licenses are recognized only if the bearer does not <b>have</b> <b>US</b> citizenship and holds no US license (which may differ in terms of operating privileges and restrictions). Conversely, a US citizen may operate under reciprocal agreements in Canada, but not a non-US citizen holding a US license.|$|E

The Secretary of Agriculture is given responsibility and stewardship for the 4-H name and emblem, at the direct request of the U.S. Congress. These protections place the 4-H emblem in a unique category of protected emblems, along with the U.S. Presidential Seal, Red Cross, Smokey Bear and the Olympic rings.|$|E

The closest US location from China is Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US dependency in the western Pacific Ocean that allows Chinese visitors without visa restrictions. The island is currently experiencing an upswing in Chinese births. This option is used by relatively affluent Chinese who often have secondary motives as well, wishing their children {{to be able to}} leave mainland China when they grow older or bring their parents to the US. Canada is less achievable as their government denies many visa requests.|$|E

Moreover, persons who are not US residents and are not US persons and do not share accounts with US persons still must self-certify said status when opening a bank account outside the US at any FFI. According to the FATCA IGA, if such a person does not self-certify said status, that person cannot open a bank account at that institution. Canada and United Kingdom have interpreted the IGAs differently and believe that non-US persons who fail to self-certify shall not be refused a bank account. However, non-cooperating non-US persons shall be FATCA reported {{in the same way}} as those persons who <b>have</b> <b>US</b> indicia.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{hearing of}} the {{proposed}} extensions, citizens of Wickenburg, Arizona, Wikieup and Aguila protested to <b>have</b> <b>US</b> 93 run through their towns instead. The protest was considered and the Arizona Highway Department changed its proposal to meet the protester's arguments. The Arizona State Legislature passed a bill instructing the Highway Department to eventually designate and maintain a route for US 93 from Kingman to US 60 via Wikieup once construction work was completed on existing US 93 within the state. The first extension proposal was modified, asking for the US 93 concurrency with US 66 and US 89 to be signed instead as US 93T and for the proposed US 193 to become US 93A. On June 7, 1937, the finalized proposal was submitted to the AASHO, with the US 93T and US 93A suffixes omitted. Interestingly enough, the proposal wasn't accepted.|$|E
25|$|This rather {{straightforward}} {{account of}} the Ring's origins, however, has been disputed {{by a number of}} authorities, who accuse Wagner of deliberately distorting the facts so as to bring them into harmony with his own private version of history. The actual sequence of events, it seems, was not nearly as clear-cut as he would <b>have</b> <b>us</b> believe. It was in October 1846 â€“ some sixteen months before the February Revolution â€“ that he first drew up a plan for a five-act drama based on the life of Friedrich Barbarossa. He may even have considered writing an opera on Siegfried as early as 1843, when he read Jacob Grimm's Deutsche Mythologie (German Mythology), or possibly in 1844, when he borrowed several works on the Nibelungs from the Royal Library in Dresden. As for Die Wibelungen, it would appear that he only started work on this essay in December 1848 at the earliest, finishing it sometime before 22 February 1849, when he read it to his friend Eduard Devrient.|$|E

500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to <b>have</b> <b>us</b> apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ... We {{come from the same}} planet as far as our sense of humor and comic sensibilities are concerned. But we also {{wanted to make sure that}} it felt like a SpongeBob episode." ...|$|E

The entire third act is {{just the two of them}} talking, which is actually kind of interesting. The scene where Mulder and Scully talk while stranded on a rock included approximately 10 pages of dialogue. Gillian Anderson said of the scene: [...] "I loved that. That was so much fun, and I think it was written really well... It was just neat to <b>have</b> <b>us</b> separated from everything and stuck on this island where we could wax philosophical and kind of tell the truth to each other in strange ways."

500|$|Plans for a Naches Tunnel or highway {{date back}} to the early 1930s, {{designated}} as the Naches Pass Link of Primary State Highway 5. The state legislature appropriated $50thousand (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for a study on the feasibility of a new highway. In the early 1960s, Governor Albert Rosellini established a committee to study the feasibility of a toll road. The route was considered feasible by the committee, and they estimated tolls of $1.50per vehicle (equivalent to $ in [...] ) would need to be levied to pay for the highway. Proponents of the new highway were pushing to <b>have</b> <b>U.S.</b> Route 10 routed over the pass, away from the routing over Snoqualmie Pass; however this never occurred. Ultimately, the highway was not built as the state considered the highway unfeasible. The highway has been codified in Washington law since 1970, while the tunnel through Naches Pass has been codified in state law since 1959.|$|E
