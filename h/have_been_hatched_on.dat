40|$|The {{glycosaminoglycan}} {{content of}} cartilage is decreased in manganese deficiency in the chick (perosis). The activity of xylosyltransferase, the first enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of sulphated glycosaminoglycans, was {{studied in the}} epiphysial cartilage of 4 -week-old chicks which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> maintained since <b>hatching</b> <b>on</b> a manganese-deficient diet. Enzymic activity {{was measured by the}} incorporation of [14 C]xylose from UDP-[14 C]xylose into trichloroacetic acid precipitates. Optimal conditions for the xylosyltransferase assay were established and shown to be the same for both control and manganese-deficient cartilage. Assay of the enzyme by using an exogenous xylose acceptor showed no difference in xylosyltransferase activity between control and manganese-deficient tissue. Further, the extent of xylose incorporation was greater in manganese-deficient than in control cartilage preparations, suggesting an increase in xylose-acceptor sites on the endogenous acceptor protein in the deficient cartilage. 35 S turnover in the manganese-deficient cartilage was also increased. The data suggest that the decreased glycosaminoglycan content in manganese-deficient cartilage is due to decreased xylosylation of the acceptor protein plus increased degradation of glycosaminoglycan...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria (including salmonellae) can {{be pulled}} into {{and through the}} shell and {{membrane}} of broiler hatching eggs as they cool. When this occurs, salmonellae are {{out of reach of}} a surface-applied chemical treatment, because direct contact is usually required to achieve a kill. Over many years of research, a large number of disinfectant chemicals <b>have</b> <b>been</b> tested <b>on</b> <b>hatching</b> eggs. We have found H 2 O 2 (1. 4 %) to be a fairly effective disinfectant to reduce Salmonella that is artificially inoculated onto hatching eggs. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether the efficacy of H 2 O 2 could be enhanced by utilizing vacuum and a surfactant to remove air and reduce surface tension within the eggshell, enabling the bactericide to penetrate deeper into the egg to kill Salmonella. Eggs were inoculated with nalidixic acid-resistant Salmonella typhimurium. Inoculated eggs were treated with H 2 O 2 with or without a surfactant and with or without the application of vacuum to facilitate shell penetration. Thirty percent of eggs exposed to H 2 O 2 with surfactant and vacuum were still positive for the marker Salmonella. Although this represents a decrease in number compared with a water control, 30 % remained contaminated. Results demonstrate the difficulty involved in reaching and killing Salmonella that has penetrated the hatching egg, even with an effective bactericide...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} animal species have {{undergone}} domestication, {{the process of}} becoming adapted to living in captivity and in proximity to humans. Common for these species <b>is</b> that they <b>have</b> all developed certain traits, including changes to coat color, body size and level of fearfulness. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> termed the domestic phenotype. Among these traits is also an attenuation of the response to stress, both behaviorally and physiologically. Thus, release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol or corticosterone is lower in domesticated species. However, the underlying mechanism for this is not yet well understood. In this thesis, we have investigated genetic mechanisms for the attenuation of the physiological stress response in ancestral chickens, the Red Junglefowl, and domesticated chickens, the White Leghorn. We found a number of genes that differed in expression between the two breeds in several tissues involved in the stress response. Among the most interesting findings were lower expression of genes involved in production and secretion of ACTH in the pituitary, and in the production of glucocorticoids in the adrenal glands, in the domesticated White Leghorns. We also found higher expression of the glucocorticoid receptor in White Leghorns, indicating that they may have a more efficient negative feedback of the physiological stress response. We then investigated the transcriptome of the chicken pituitary more closely, and we discovered that a number of genes highly involved in several important physiological axes showed differential expression between the ancestral and the domesticated breed. Among these were genes involved in the stress response, the reproductive system, and in metabolism and growth. As these traits are modified in domesticated species, our results suggest that changes to gene expression in the pituitary may be an important underlying factor of the domestic phenotype. A separate aim of this thesis was to investigate effects of hatching time in chickens on their subsequent phenotype. Time of hatching constitutes an early experience that may differ between individuals, and we therefore hypothesized that differences in hatching time would affect chickens later in life. While a number of studies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed <b>on</b> <b>hatching</b> time and post-hatch growth, very little work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> done on effects on behavior. We found that the time of hatching had sex-specific effects. Hatching times in females were negatively correlated with body weight, whereas in males, behaviors such as reaction to novelty and spatial learning were affected. As time of <b>hatching</b> <b>is</b> governed by various hormones, including thyroid hormone and corticosterone, we suggest that changes to the levels of these hormones could affect both hatching time and post-hatch phenotypes. Understanding these mechanisms better would be beneficial in terms of production, where batch homogeneity is important, in research on early experiences and the potential for maternal programming, and in evolutionary questions on trade-off between different life strategies...|$|R

40|$|During {{the course}} of its {{embryonic}} development, the Canadian lobster Homarus americanusMilne-Edwards exhibits steady increases in water content (56. 2 to 86. 8 %) and ash (5. 8 to 21. 2 %), and a progressive decrease in energy content from 6636 to 4292 cal/g dry weight. Mean dry weight of a single egg is 965 μg, equivalent to 6. 4 cal; a freshly hatched egg. The lobster hatches about 1, 500 larvae per night {{over a period of}} 4 to 5 days. Dry weight, ash and calorific contents of larvae <b>hatched</b> <b>on</b> different days show considerable variations.
