25|$|Kobayashi's English tutor {{and friend}} Naru gets hurt in an accident, so she {{arranges}} for {{her older brother}} to take her place in exchange for Kobayashi making him lunches. Their initial sessions are very antagonistic, with Toyo complaining about Kobayashi's lack of English skills, and Kobayashi complaining about Toyo's pickiness about food. Eventually they become friendlier, but then Naru confesses her feelings to Kobayashi, though she knows he is gay. He gently rejects her, and despite Kobayashi's worries, Toyo does not <b>get</b> <b>mad</b> at him. Their friendship continues deepening, and Toyo realizes that Kobayashi is always watching him. After confirming with Naru that Kobayashi is gay, Toyo confronts him and Kobayashi confirms {{that he is in}} love with him. Due to an incident in his past, Toyo initially rejects his feelings, but one night during a storm Kobayashi is hurt protecting Toyo and they go back to Kobayashi's house to treat the wound. Toyo tells him about a man he was in love with, but rejected publicly out of fear of his friend's reactions and because the man was moving away. Toyo finally accepts Kobayashi's feelings. They initially keep their relationship secret from Naru, afraid of hurting her, but she quickly realizes what is going on. She yells at Kobayashi for lying because {{they are supposed to be}} friends, then tells him she is okay with their relationship. After they part ways, she walks along crying and runs into Ida, who comforts her.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{revolves}} around Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) noticing {{a man named}} Jeff (Paul Rae) in the emergency room, whom he thinks is [...] "too nice". House thinks that Jeff's inability to <b>get</b> <b>mad</b> {{is a symptom of}} an underlying condition and decides to find out what is wrong with him. Meanwhile, Dr. Eric Foreman (Omar Epps), thinks the other diagnostic team members don't respect him, while Amber Volakis (Anne Dudek) and House try to create a deal in which they can both spend time with Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard).|$|E
500|$|Subsequent to the announcement, John's husband, David Furnish, opined on his {{personal}} Facebook page that [...] "Madonna winning Best Original Song truly shows how these awards {{have nothing to do}} with merit". Madonna commented backstage: [...] "I hope [...] speaks to me for the next couple of years. He's been known to <b>get</b> <b>mad</b> at me so I don't know. He's brilliant and I adore him so he'll win another award. I don't feel bad!" [...] Three days later Furnish recanted his comments saying, [...] "My passion for our film Gnomeo & Juliet and belief in Elton's song really got my emotional juices going," [...] and continuing by wishing her well on the premiere of W.E.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{was unable}} to film an {{accompanying}} music video for the single; {{at the time of}} its release, she was recovering from a physical and emotional breakdown that left her hospitalized in August 2001, and caused her to cancel all public appearances to promote Glitter. She said, [...] "When I was asked about the video I said, 'I can't do it today'. And nobody could accept that answer. And that's when I started to <b>get</b> <b>mad.</b> I was, like, look, I am too fatigued. I'm overly-tired, I can't do it as a human being. And nobody was hearing those last two words — human being. They were used to the Mariah that always says, 'Come on, let's fight, let's go'. They just weren't used to me ever saying no. I never said no before". Instead, a video was created using a scene taken directly from the film, where Billie Frank (played by Carey) sings the song at Madison Square Garden during her first sold-out concert. Frank's performance of the song in the film omits its entire second verse, and the song's development runs in parallel with the film's love story.|$|E

500|$|Songs such as [...] "Fight the Power", [...] "Power to the People", and [...] "Brothers Gonna Work It Out" [...] {{propose a}} {{response}} for African Americans {{to the issues}} criticized throughout the album. [...] "Power to the People" [...] has a tempo of approximately 125 beats per minute and elements of Miami bass, electro-boogie, and fast-paced Roland TR-808. Addressing their plight {{at the turn of}} the 1990s, [...] "Brothers Gonna Work It Out" [...] features cacophonic sound textures and a theme of unity among African Americans, with Chuck D preaching [...] "Brothers that try to work it out / They <b>get</b> <b>mad,</b> revolt, revise, realize / They're superbad / Small chance a smart brother's gonna be a victim of his own circumstance". Richard Harrington of The Washington Post writes that songs such as [...] "War at 33⅓" [...] and [...] "Fight the Power" [...] "may sound like a call to ohms and arms, but they are really a call to action ('turn us loose and we shall overcome'), a message to conscience and a plea for unity ('move as team, never move alone,' both cautionary advice and game plan)". [...] "War at 33⅓" [...] has a theme of resistance and a 128 bpm-tempo, cited by Chuck D as [...] "the fastest thing I've ever rapped to, rapping right on top of the beat".|$|E

I had finally found where the blame must be laid: that the money we are spending for national defense is not defending us from the villains real and near, the awful villains of ignorance, and cancer, and heart disease and highway death.

[...] Then the umpire did <b>get</b> <b>mad.</b> [...] He chased Taylor out of the park, and it was funny to see Dummy trying to explain to him that he shouldn't be ejected."

Additionally, Jon Stewart was hired to play the lover of Goldie Hawn's character Elise; however, he never actually {{made it to the}} film. [...] "I played her boyfriend and apparently they felt that that was not inherently part of the storyline and so she broke up with me before the movie started," [...] he joked on Larry King Live in 2006.|$|E

I didn't defend myself because I wasn't prepared. What was I supposed to do, talk about how often I had been right? Praise myself? <b>Get</b> <b>mad?</b> I was mad, but I didn't want to give the audience any blood. The national media said I got crushed, which I did, and made me into a buffoon...

2500|$|In an {{interview}} for Time magazine, Vidal said that in film production, directors were [...] "parasites" [...] and a film's author was its screenwriter; in response, Brass demanded Vidal's removal from the set and Guccione agreed. Guccione considered film to be a [...] "collective effort, involving the input of {{a great number of}} artists and craftsmen", and the director to be the leader of a [...] "team effort". Vidal filed a contractual dispute over the film because of Brass' rewrites; Guccione said Vidal had demanded 10% of the film's profits, which Vidal said was not the case. Vidal distanced himself from the production, calling Brass a [...] "megalomaniac". Brass publicly stated, [...] "If I ever really <b>get</b> <b>mad</b> at Gore Vidal, I'll publish his script". Vidal's name was removed from the film's title; the credits were changed to state that the film was [...] "adapted from a screenplay by Gore Vidal", crediting no official screenwriter. Guccione said, [...] "Gore's work was basically done and Tinto's work was about to begin".|$|E

MTV, CBS, [...] the NFL {{had no knowledge of}} this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention". Jackson later commented, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident" [...] when the statement was replayed in the media. A written statement read, [...] "The decision to have a costume reveal {{at the end of my}} halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL." [...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, [...] "It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [...] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand." [...] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, [...] "Who knows...Maybe they'll <b>get</b> <b>mad</b> at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason." ...|$|E
