30|$|Considering {{parts and}} {{components}} suppliers, we verify that <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> the ROW, EU, EA, LA, and North America promoted {{an increase in}} the sophistication of the final products traded inside Latin America. A 1 % increase in North American participation in the import basket composition, all ceteris paribus, promotes an increase of 0.06 % in the quality of the intra-bloc export basket, while <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> EU promoted an increase of 0.04 %, followed by increases of 0.02 % in the case of <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> LA or EA, and 0.01 % for the ROW. The second column reveals that <b>imports</b> just <b>from</b> LA and North America had a positive effect in the electric machinery sector, while the coefficients for <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> other regions are statistically insignificant. Increases of 1 % in <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> North America promote an increase of 0.07 % in the quality of final electric machinery intra-bloc export basket, while <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> LA promote an increase of 0.06 %. Transport equipment coefficients were all statistically insignificant. In the second half of Table  5, we verify similar results for the case of pooled machinery data. North American imports promote an increase of 0.1 % in the quality of the parts and components export basket, while <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> the EU and EA promote an increase of 0.04 % each. In column 5, the coefficients are slightly different, revealing that <b>imports</b> only <b>from</b> China promote a 0.04 % increase in the intra-bloc export basket of electric machinery parts and components, while <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> EA have a negative effect. Once again, transport equipment coefficients are statistically insignificant.|$|R
5|$|Early {{on in the}} force's history, most of its {{equipment}} and weapons had to be <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> abroad, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were <b>imported</b> <b>from</b> the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local firms, with the police becoming an important source of business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to be imported, {{due to the lack of}} indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates empirically {{whether the}} level or growth of cheap <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> China {{has had an}} impact on UK inflation. We use two methods; the first calculates UK {{weighted}} world export price inflation as the sum of the effect of the inflation level in the UK's trading partners and the effect of substituting <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> more expensive countries with <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> countries with lower price levels. The second estimates these two effects on UK inflation using panel regressions. The results from the first method suggest that the substitution of <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> more expensive countries with <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> China reduced UK weighted world export price inflation by an average of - 0. 75 percentage points per annum from 2000 to 2004. Similarly, the panel regressions suggest that over the 1997 - 2005 period this substitution had a small but significant downward impact on UK CPI inflation. However, the same regressions also suggest that higher inflation in <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> China than in <b>imports</b> <b>from</b> other countries has put upward pressure on some components of UK CPI inflation. As this upward 'inflation effect' is likely to have outweighed the downward 'substitution effect' the regressions suggest that the overall effect of Chinese imports on UK CPI inflation from 1997 - 2005 was positive.
