5|$|Another {{canceled}} {{proposal to}} orbit Ganymede was the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter. It {{was designed to}} use nuclear fission for power, ion engine propulsion, and would <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> Ganymede in greater detail than previously. However, the mission was canceled in 2005 because of budget cuts. Another old proposal was called The Grandeur of Ganymede.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the curve-shortening flow on smooth curves, {{researchers}} <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> {{methods for}} flowing polygons {{so that they}} stay polygonal, with applications including pattern formation and synchronization in distributed systems of robots.

5|$|The likely {{presence}} of an ocean within Callisto leaves {{open the possibility that}} it could harbor life. However, conditions are thought to be less favorable than on nearby Europa. Various space probes from Pioneers 10 and 11 to Galileo and Cassini <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> Callisto. Because of its low radiation levels, Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jovian system.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{were among}} the wild animals hunted for food before the Neolithic {{revolution}} {{and the development of}} agriculture. For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both waterfowl and migratory birds were eaten. Archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E
5|$|Born about 1110, Foliot {{became a}} monk of Cluny, {{probably}} in about 1130. He became Prior of Cluny Abbey, then Prior of Abbeville, a Cluniac house. There are some indications that he studied law at Bologna, {{and he may}} <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> under Robert Pullen, the English theologian, either at Oxford or Exeter. He also acquired a knowledge of rhetoric {{as well as the}} liberal arts. The names of two of his early teachers are known, but nothing else of them. Foliot also learned biblical exegesis, probably from Pullen.|$|E
5|$|Details about Cẩn's {{early life}} are scarce.

Regarded as the leading revolutionary of his time, Châu had been captured and sentenced to death, before having his sentence reduced to house arrest. Cẩn regularly traveled to Châu's sampan on the Perfume River with gifts of food and listened to Châu's political lectures. Regarded as the least educated of his family, Cẩn had never traveled outside Vietnam and was the only Ngô brother not to <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> at a European-run institution.|$|E

5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E
5|$|Encountering MissingNo. causes {{graphical}} {{errors and}} the mass replication of the sixth item in the player's item menu; the latter effect resulted in the glitch's coverage by strategy guides and game magazines. IGN has noted MissingNo.'s appearance in Pokémon Red and Blue {{as one of the}} most famous video game glitches. Fans of the series have attempted to rationalize MissingNo. as part of the games' canon, and sociologists <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> its impact on players.|$|E
5|$|In 1203, Thomas of Marlborough, {{who was a}} monk of Evesham Abbey, pleaded a {{case for}} Evesham before Archbishop Walter, and later, in his chronicle, he noted that Simon, John of Tynemouth, and Honorius, all canon lawyers from the archbishop's household, sided with the abbey. He also {{described}} the three men as magistri mei in scholis. Surviving evidence shows that Simon and John frequently found themselves on opposing sides of cases, which suggests a rivalry between the two over their expositions of canon law. Thomas appears to <b>have</b> <b>studied</b> under Simon, John and Honorius at Oxford.|$|E
