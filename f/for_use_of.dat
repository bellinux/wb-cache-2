A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.|$|E

5|$|Eugene Harold Krabs is {{commonly}} known as the greedy founder and owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, where SpongeBob works as a fry cook and Squidward works as a cashier. The restaurant's success is built on little competition and the popularity of the Krusty Krab's signature sandwich, the Krabby Patty, the formula to which is a closely guarded trade secret. Mr. Krabs frequently exploits his restaurant's popularity, engaging in price gouging and charging his own employees <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the building's services.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, an {{animated}} television series called Lupin VIII was planned as a French-Japanese co-production, featuring {{the descendants of}} Lupin, Goemon, Jigen, and Zenigata, but was never completed. Created by DiC Animation, with Rintaro directing, and character designs by Shingo Araki; two scripts were written, and one episode was fully animated with a music and sound effects track, but the voice-overs were never recorded. It {{has been suggested that}} the project was stopped due to Leblanc's estate wanting a large amount of money <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the Lupin name.

5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural resonance frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead {{is used as a}} sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient. Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{have been}} {{part and parcel of}} culture and religion. Vivid scale {{patterns}} have been thought to have influenced early art.

5|$|Sunderland {{have had}} seven stadiums {{throughout}} their history; {{the first was}} at Blue House Field in Hendon in 1879. The ground {{was close to the}} place where Sunderland formed, at Hendon Board School; at that time the rent <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the ground was £10 (£ today). The club relocated briefly to Groves Field in Ashbrooke in 1882, before moving again the following season. The club's third stadium was Horatio Street in Roker, the first Sunderland stadium north of the River Wear; the club played a single season there before another move, this time to Abbs Field in Fulwell for two seasons. Abbs Field was notable for being the first Sunderland ground to which they charged admission.|$|E

The recent and accelerated growth of the Swedish fleet of E85 flexifuel vehicles {{is the result of}} the National Climate Policy in Global Cooperation Bill passed in 2005, which not only ratified the Kyoto Protocol but also sought to meet the 2003 EU Biofuels Directive regarding targets <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> biofuels, and also let to the 2006 government's commitment to eliminate oil imports by 2020.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of there being no tolls <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{the river was}} established by the 1664 act of parliament. This was reversed by the 1794 act, which imposed high tolls, until they were reduced by the provisions of an act of Parliament obtained in 1824. The river is now managed by the Environment Agency between Stamford and just below Fosdyke bridge, and a licence is required to use it. From there to the Wash, it was managed by the Port of Fosdyke Authority, but since they went into administration, the Environment Agency have also managed the section from Fosdyke Bridge to below the Holbeach River.|$|E

The G-1 was converted from older D-series airframes, retaining the smaller wing, but without the dive brakes. The G-2 was similar to the G-1 except <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the extended wing of the D-5. 208 G-2s were built and at least a further 22 more were converted from D-3 airframes.|$|E

King John had given or recognised Donnchadh's possession of this territory, and that of Donnchadh's nephew Alaxandair (Alexander), {{as a reward for}} his help; similarly, John had given Donnchadh's cousins Ailean and Tómas, sons of Lochlann, a huge lordship equivalent to 140 knight's fees that included most of northern County Antrim and County Londonderry, the reward <b>for</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> their soldiers and galleys.|$|E
