50|$|Door {{chains are}} {{fairly easy to}} install and use. Use of a <b>door</b> <b>chain</b> {{provides}} a little security when dealing with strangers. A properly installed <b>door</b> <b>chain</b> is resistant to tampering from the outside requiring use of physical force to open the door, which will leave obvious evidence.|$|E
50|$|A <b>door</b> <b>chain,</b> {{security}} chain, {{or security}} <b>door</b> <b>chain</b> {{consists of a}} small chain attached to the door frame, which attaches to a track on the door for security purposes. It {{is a type of}} lock that is often used along with other types of locks to secure a door.|$|E
50|$|A door bar is a newer device {{intended}} to replace <b>door</b> <b>chains.</b> It {{consists of a}} U shaped bar that attaches to a hinge on the doorframe, and a knob on the door. The bar swings over the knob to restrict the full opening of the door. Door bars are easier to use, and can be made of much sturdier material than <b>door</b> <b>chains.</b> Also, <b>door</b> bars cannot be defeated {{in the same way}} that <b>door</b> <b>chains</b> can be, although they can be defeated just as easily in different ways.|$|R

50|$|<b>Door</b> <b>chains</b> {{installed}} on hollow-core doors, or {{that are not}} anchored into solid materials (such as the wood door frame) do not provide protection. This is because the chain can easily be defeated by pushing on a <b>door.</b> The <b>chains</b> are helpful to sound an alert to the person inside that someone is breaking through a door. The noise may be heard by the occupants giving them time to call for help, escape via another exit, or get a weapon to protect themselves. <b>Door</b> <b>chains</b> are also sometimes used to slow down mentally-challenged individuals who may attempt to exit from inside a structure.|$|R
50|$|When fitting a {{standard}} <b>door</b> <b>chain</b> featuring a linear slide, {{it is imperative}} that it not allow the door to open sufficiently for a person's hand to reach through the gap between the door and the doorframe, as otherwise the <b>door</b> <b>chain</b> could be quickly opened from the outside by an intruder.|$|E

50|$|Door chains {{also can}} be set in place when the door {{does not need to}} be opened. They can only be touched from outside when the door has been opened, and therefore, if the locks on the door are compromised, a <b>door</b> <b>chain</b> may cause some delay, draw more attention, or leave more {{evidence}} of force being used when gaining unauthorized access to the structure.|$|E
50|$|Door chains {{normally}} come {{equipped with}} very short screws which easily rip out. Any {{amount of force}} capable of defeating a deadbolt will also defeat a <b>door</b> <b>chain.</b> The tracks are usually straight, {{and any number of}} simple tools will allow the chain to be separated from the track. Elderly individuals, uncoordinated people, and individuals with hand tremors may find it difficult to connect the chain to the track. The chain is often a thin metal. Door chains are often installed improperly, making them easily subjected to a number of attacks.|$|E

[...] 100 U.S.App.D.C. at 310, 244 F.2d at 758.

The whole episode must have involved only a few seconds. At the hearing on the motion, the only witnesses called, Officer Wurms and Agent Wilson, testified that Officer Wurms knocked on Miller's door, and when a voice from inside asked 'Who's there?', Wurms answered, 'Blue, police.' Miller {{opened the door and}} looked out. The officers immediately recognized him and Miller recognized them. 'Did he say anything when he opened the door?' 'Yes, sir, he didn't want to let us in.' 'What were his words?' 'I can't recall, but he wanted to know what we were doing there.' Miller tried to close the door. Officer Wurms tried to keep it open. 'He took one look at me and tried to slam the door, at which time I grabbed the door and opened it.' The door was not broken, but a <b>door</b> <b>chain</b> was." ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{the others}} are eliminated, the four finalists are Maverick, Bransford, Angel, and Commodore Duvall (James Coburn), the boat's owner and the tournament organizer. Maverick almost fails to reach the final table by the 5:00 AM deadline, having had his stateroom <b>door</b> <b>chained</b> shut (by an unknown person) after a tryst with Bransford. The game proceeds, with Bransford the first eliminated. A [...] "fixed" [...] hand is dealt to the three {{remaining}} players: four eights to Duvall, a low straight flush to Angel, and Maverick needing either the nine of spades to complete a king high straight flush, or the ace of spades to complete an unbeatable royal flush. Noticing that the dealer has bottom-dealt {{to the other two}} on the discard, Maverick protests, then agrees to accept one card dealt by Angel {{from the top of the}} deck. Duvall and Angel each bet [...] "all in," [...] and Maverick calls without looking at his new card. When the three reveal their hands, that card turns out to be the ace of spades, giving Maverick the championship. An enraged Angel (who thinks Maverick cheated) draws his gun, but he and his stooges in the audience are gunned down by Cooper and Maverick.|$|R

Glencoe Place is often forgotten. As a side street tucked between the undulating hillsides of Mt. Auburn, it’s rarely visited by anyone. Formerly known as Little Bethlehem, the Standish Apartments, the Glencoe Place Redevelopment Project, and now “The Hole, ” the buildings wait in disrepair, with windows boarded up, <b>doors</b> <b>chained</b> shut, and nature slowly reclaiming the surrounding lands (Radel). It’s not rare to see Cincinnati’s older residential building stock abandoned and in disrepair, but {{the character of the}} buildings lining Glencoe Place and the adjoining streets exemplifies local urban decay on a unique level. Only here will one find such an overpowering complex of buildings, where a monotonous, cavernous allotment of facades ascend a steep hillside. While the colors have changed over the years the original exteriors are almost completely in tact, {{only a few of the}} complex’s buildings have been removed since construction. The scene of these houses is one unique in Cincinnati. While other row houses do exist, and records show that at one time an even greater amount existed, they are most often limited to sets of three, four, or five – not over fifty (Langsam).

50|$|Other migrant {{groups were}} limited in number by the National Origins quota system, which {{designated}} national quotas based on census ratios from 1890. These ratios heavily favored Western European nations and older migrant groups, {{such as the}} English, Irish, and Germans. The ratios attempted to limit the rising number of Southern and Eastern European immigrants. The National Origins quota system provided limited family reunification {{as a means for}} chain migration and placed a preference on naturalization. If an immigrant became a U.S. citizen, he or she had the ability obtain non-quota visas for more family members, but as a resident that number was capped annually. Additionally, the Immigration Act of 1924 formally opened the <b>door</b> to <b>chain</b> migration from the entire western hemisphere, placing that group under non-quota status.|$|R

Coming at last to a narrow cell, with a stone table, and heavy bolts on the old door, she felt sure this was poor Elfrida's prison, and called Anderl to come on with his candle, for the boy had lighted one, for his own comfort rather than hers.

50|$|The quartet endured abusive prison {{conditions}} at Alcatraz for several months.

The men were transferred to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, arriving on Nov. 19, 1918. Within two weeks, Joseph (Nov. 29) and Michael (Dec. 2) Hofer were dead. The U.S. Army said that the men had died of pneumonia, victims of the Influenza Pandemic of 1918. The Hutterites, convinced that the men had died of mistreatment, buried them in the Rockport Colony with the word “martyr” appended to their grave markers.|$|R
