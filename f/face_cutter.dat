Cutter then heads back to the hospital in Kentucky and tells Kim that Aubrey broke up with him because he lied about what he did with Rex's gun, and blamed Kim for the break-up. Cutter also wanted to revert to being a grifter by blackmailing Kim to give him the forged documents that Echo signed Rex's signature on that will give Clint back his fortune, or he will tell everyone in Llanview that Stacy is still alive with her sister Gigi Morasco's <b>face!</b> <b>Cutter</b> then asks Kim if she was sure if the woman in the hospital room is really Stacy. Kim confessed to Cutter that Stacy survived drowning in that frozen lake {{a year and a half}} ago, and that she got plastic surgery in South America to look like Gigi so that she could take over her life! Kim also said that she tried to stop Stacy by following her to Llanview to stop her scheme against her sister. Kim then discovered that Stacy was trapped in the basement of a rental house that was leaking carbon monoxide along with her dead sister Gigi. Cutter then told Kim that he believed her about what she told him about Stacy. Kim also let her brother have the forged documents on the condition that he could give her some of the money that he'll extort to pay for Stacy's hospital bills. On October 14, 2011, Cutter met up with Rama at an arranged meeting at the Spotted Pony where Rama revealed what happened that night several years ago at the strip club. When Rama try to track down Kim at the club to get try to get the money she stole from her to pay for her plastic surgery, she saw her brother Cutter kneeling over a dead body named Mr. Berger, who was a rich guy that was a patron at the club who was Cutter and Kim's mark. Cutter enlisted Kim to seduce Mr. Berger for his money by working as a stripper at the club. Cutter then sneaked in too much [...] "mickey" [...] in Mr. Berger's drink, which caused him to pass out and die. Rama said she had proof of the incident with a picture she took on her cell phone of Cutter and the dead guy, and she still wanted to blackmail Cutter for the crime. Cutter then convinced Rama to conspire with him to let Kim take the fall for the crime, or they will both lose everything they want in their respective scams. Cutter and Rama then set up Kim to have her arrested for the murder of Mr. Berger. Before Kim was sent to jail, she tells Cutter to help take care of Stacy for her while she's gone. Cutter then goes to the hospital and finds out that she woke up from her coma.|$|E
