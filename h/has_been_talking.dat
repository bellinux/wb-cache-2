Rose's husband, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), was in {{the tail}} section of the plane in the bathroom. He, {{along with the rest}} of the tail section's passengers, is {{believed}} by the survivors to be dead, but Rose is convinced that he is alive and that the tail section of the plane thinks that the middle section is dead.|$|E
5|$|Michael {{is trying}} to juggle his lives in the two realities, and wears a red {{wristband}} on his wrist in the reality where Hannah is alive and a green one in the reality where Rex is alive. In the Rex, or green, reality, Michael has noticed that Rex has focused a lot on tennis lately, as it was his mother's sport. Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with Rex lately about his feelings.

5|$|The sheriff {{finds the}} wolf in the woods, {{and when he}} whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he {{believes}} they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Henry, and while {{this is not the}} case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma.|$|E
5|$|Rhys treats Susan {{when she}} has an MS relapse and he tries {{to make sure she}} is {{prepared}} in case her condition becomes worse. He later looks after Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) when she is brought in with severe morning sickness. Vanessa learns Rhys <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about her with his friends and she tells him to stay out of her business. Rhys later helps Vanessa carry some boxes and he spends the day baking a cake with her. He buys her a new mixer and Vanessa invites him to dinner. Rhys gives the cake to Elaine and when he tells her about Vanessa, she warns him to think about what he is doing before letting it go any further. Rhys thinks about cancelling on Vanessa, but he later arrives with dessert. Rhys asks Vanessa to bid on him at a charity bachelor auction, so he can raise more money than Karl. Vanessa wins and she chooses a couples massage for them to enjoy together. Rhys learns Susan has befriended Elaine and he angrily tells her to stay away from his mother. Vanessa witnesses the scene and becomes cold towards him. Rhys apologises to Susan and opens up to Vanessa about why he did it.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to him and is responsible for his new look and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E

25|$|Keyes brings Jackson to Los Angeles, suspecting {{that the}} man aboard the train had not been Dietrichson, but rather had been Phyllis' {{accomplice}} in Dietrichson's murder. After examining photographs of Dietrichson, Jackson is sure {{that the man}} he met was not that old, but at least ten years younger. Now certain that he can prove murder, Keyes is eager to reject the claim and force Phyllis to sue. Neff warns Phyllis not to pursue the insurance claim in court and admits that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to Lola about her past. Phyllis, however, insists on filing suit to pursue the claim despite the risk to both her and Neff. Lola eventually tells Neff that she has discovered that her boyfriend, the hotheaded Nino Zachetti (Byron Barr), has been seeing Phyllis behind her (and Neff's) back.|$|E
25|$|Eugenia {{is talking}} and flirting with Robert Acton; {{she says she}} will divorce her husband. She visits Mrs Acton and says a white lie – that her son <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about her a lot – which {{comes across as a}} terrible faux-pas. Later, Mr Wentworth tells Felix that Clifford got {{suspended}} from Harvard owing to his drinking problem, and that he is improperly in love with Lizzie Acton – Felix suggests fixing him up with Eugenia instead. Later still, Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry Mr Brand, though she doesn't love him. Mr Brand then criticises Felix. Gertrude emotionally blackmails Charlotte into keeping him from talking to her, lest she tell him Charlotte likes him. Clifford then visits Eugenia. Robert Acton goes to the Wentworths' but Eugenia is not in their house; he goes into hers and asks her about the divorce note and going to see the Niagara Falls with him.

Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries {{to persuade him to}} take her to his villa that evening: [...] "Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta" [...] ("Do you not long for our little cottage"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she {{recognises}} as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church. He reassures Tosca of his fidelity and asks her what eyes could be more beautiful than her own: [...] "Qual'occhio al mondo" [...] ("What eyes in the world").|$|E
500|$|Carr's {{essay was}} widely {{discussed}} in the media both critically and in passing. While English technology writer Bill Thompson observed that Carr's argument had [...] "succeeded in provoking a wide-ranging debate", Damon Darlin of The New York Times quipped that even though [...] " [...] <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about [...] article in The Atlantic magazine", only [...] "ome subset of that group has actually read the 4,175-word article, by Nicholas Carr." [...] The controversial online responses to Carr's essay were, according to Chicago Tribune critic Steve Johnson, partly {{the outcome of the}} essay's title [...] "Is Google Making Us Stupid?", a question that the article proper doesn't actually pose and that he believed was [...] "perfect fodder for a 'don't-be-ridiculous' blog post"; Johnson challenged his readers to carefully consider their online responses in the interest of raising the quality of debate.|$|E
500|$|Trevor Slattery, {{having been}} {{captured}} {{at the end}} of Iron Man 3, is now being held in Seagate Prison. At the prison, he is living luxuriously, having his own personal [...] "butler", Herman, as well as other inmates who act as his fan club and protection from other inmates. Looking on at the attention Slattery receives in the cafeteria is Justin Hammer, who wonders what makes him so special. Slattery <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> with a documentary filmmaker, Jackson Norriss, to chronicle the events of the Mandarin situation seen in Iron Man 3. Norriss, trying to learn more about Slattery personally, recounts his past from his first casting as a child as well as starring in a failed CBS pilot. Norriss eventually informs Slattery that his portrayal has angered some people, including the actual Ten Rings terrorist group, which Slattery did not know existed. Norriss tells him the history of the Mandarin and the terrorist group, before revealing that he is actually a member of the group. The real reason for Norriss interviewing Slattery is to break him out of prison so he can meet the actual Mandarin. Hearing this, Slattery still has no idea of the full ramifications of his posing as the Mandarin.|$|E

500|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to beat Jack home from a {{restaurant}} to hide the evidence, (and the feral cat destroyed the living room) Jack calls Greg out on his deceit, and kicks him out, with everyone else, including Pam, siding with Jack. Greg, desperate to save himself, reveals that Jack <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to strange people and is planning a secret operation after the wedding, thus lying himself about being retired from the CIA. The secret operation {{turns out to be}} a surprise honeymoon for Debbie and her fiance, as Jack angrily explains, and Greg realizes he's only dug himself deeper into a hole. Unwillingly, Greg goes to the airport where he is detained by airport security for making a scene on the plane while trying to stow his recently-found bag into the overhead storage hold (and for saying [...] "bomb"). Back at the Byrnes household, Jack tries to convince his wife and Pam that Greg would be an unsuitable husband. But he receives retribution from both Pam and Dina, who reminds him that he is only caring about himself, not Pam's happiness, and that he was also equally vicious to Kevin until Pam ended her relationship with him. Jack realizes that Pam truly loves Greg. Jack rushes to the airport, convinces airport security to release Greg and brings him back to the Byrnes household.|$|E

This was the first time that Singapore had won the event. In the game she played, Wang beat world number one Liu Shiwen. The Southern Daily published in Guangdong criticized Chinese sports authorities for permitting China-born players like Wang, Feng and Li to leave and play for other countries: [...] "For the sake of developing the sport, China <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> about 'breeding wolves'. Well, now the wolf has grown up and it has returned home to bite." ...|$|E

In 2009, the outdoor minigolf course was almost torn out, and a {{restaurant}} put in its place, but it was saved due to its historical value. Bob Lawton said, [...] "When we opened it in 1964, {{we were the only}} ones in the Lakes Region that had minigolf, but then several opened up. Last year, we decided we wouldn't close it {{and we were going to}} keep it. It's historic; the buildings are fantastic." [...] There is currently an empty lot next to the outdoor minigolf course where Funspot <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to hotel chains such as Best Western, Hilton, and Marriott, about the possibility of building a hotel.|$|E

2500|$|The song {{received}} positive reviews upon release. Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone {{called it}} [...] "a touching ballad", where [...] "any trace of disco or glam" [...] is muted by her [...] "costentatiously squeaky {{fingers on the}} guitar strings". NME Emily Mackay wrote about the song, saying it was [...] "a leavetaking song of great, simple beauty, more tenderly affecting than anything Gaga's done before, showcasing the emotive power rather than the force of that great voice." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the track a positive review in comparison to other ballads on the album, stating that the song [...] "boasts a sublime hook and a relatively restrained vocal performance". Patrick Bowman from Idolator said, [...] "'Joanne' is definitely {{the best example of}} the 'real and personal' aesthetic Gaga <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> up ahead of the album's release, full of pretty guitar picking and arguably her best vocal." [...] Marc Snetiker from Entertainment Weekly believed that it was [...] "Gaga's most disarming and original ballad in years".|$|E

Upon hearing her daughter in danger, Laura really wakes up and convinces Scott to leave with her to protect her daughter.

2500|$|First part of {{the story}} arc [...] "Latter Days". After a prodigious leap in time over two issues, Cerebus returns from the north intent on {{provoking}} the Cirinists into killing him. Instead, he is captured by a trio of characters based on the Three Stooges, who await a religious revelation from him. [...] While Cerebus was in the north, a religious movement developed out of the teachings of Rick and his writings about Cerebus. Once Cerebus supplies the required revelation, he inspires a successful anti-Cirinist rebellion and a subsequent reordering of society. Much of the second half of this chapter consists of Cerebus giving a highly idiosyncratic analysis of the Torah. Published over the course of nearly a year, this section, called [...] "Chasing YHWH" [...] was presented almost entirely in text format, with minimal art. This story arc is unusual in that disembodied thought balloons give the impression that Cerebus is speaking directly to the reader at times. It is revealed in the last issue of the arc that Cerebus <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> to a woman reporter who bears a striking resemblance to Jaka. He eventually falls in love with the woman and marries her.|$|E
