Because of this, the IPC had a huge impact on the amount of revenue that the government generated and thus had a certain amount of influence over the government. The second major factor was inability of the Iraqi government at that time to source the technical <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> necessary to take over oil operations in the country.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: This paper {{explores the}} {{perceptions}} of early-career music teachers regarding {{the effectiveness of their}} preservice preparation. Findings suggest that early-career music teachers' perceptions of effective preparation contrast with their experiences in preservice education, and that their perceptions of a practical course are not reflected in the design of courses in Queensland. Whilst early-career teachers recommend a course that focuses on pedagogical content <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> professional <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills,</b> many courses focus predominantly on general education <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> <b>and</b> music <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills.</b> Analysis of interviews suggests that a course that integrates these traditionally separate areas of preservice education, as well as contextualising learning in terms of the realistic roles of music teachers, may prepare preservice teachers more effectively for their future roles...|$|R

Although wild grapes of the Vitis genus could be found throughout the known world and all could be fermented, it took some degree of <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> to turn these grapes into palatable wine. This knowledge was passed along the trading routes {{that emerged from the}} Caucasus and Zagros Mountains down through Mesopotamia and to the Mediterranean, eventually reaching Phoenicia. Specific varieties of grapevines of the V. vinifera species were identified as especially favorable for winemaking, cuttings of which were spread via these trade routes.|$|E

Among these young men were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, who were given new names (Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah became Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, while Daniel's Babylonian name was Belteshazzar) and allocated rations of food and wine. But Daniel resolved not to defile himself, and refused the royal food and wine, thriving instead on vegetables and water. God gave them <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill,</b> and to Daniel he gave insight into visions and dreams, and when the three years of training were completed none were found to compare with them in wisdom and understanding.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the indigenous Indian architecture which was of the trabeate order, i.e. all spaces were spanned by means of horizontal beams, the Islamic architecture was arcuate, i.e. an arch or dome was adopted {{as a method of}} bridging a space. The concept of arch or dome was not invented by the Muslims but was, in fact, borrowed and further perfected by them from the architectural styles of the post-Roman period. Muslims used a cementing agent in the form of mortar {{for the first time in}} the construction of buildings in India. They further put to use certain scientific and mechanical formulae, which were derived by experience of other civilisations, in their constructions in India. Such use of scientific principles helped not only in obtaining greater strength and stability of the construction materials but also provided greater flexibility to the architects and builders. One fact that must be stressed here is that, the Islamic elements of architecture had already passed through different experimental phases in other countries like Egypt, Iran and Iraq before these were introduced in India. Unlike most Islamic monuments in these countries, which were largely constructed in brick, plaster and rubble, the Indo-Islamic monuments were typical mortar-masonry works formed of dressed stones. It must be emphasized that the development of the Indo-Islamic architecture was greatly facilitated by the <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> possessed by the Indian craftsmen, who had mastered the art of stonework for centuries and used their experience while constructing Islamic monuments in India.|$|E

New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so Gauthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire, which she combined with <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skill</b> in modernist western singing.

40|$|This {{study is}} focused on {{examining}} the need for agricultural <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> within the total labor force structure, as delimited by {{the scope of the}} present study. The data in the study were based on a sample of 544 taxpayers between the ages of 21 and 69 in two metropolitan Nebraska counties, which consisted of 45 unemployed and retired taxpayers and 499 employed taxpayers. The present study was restricted to an investigation of the need for agricultural <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> by a sample of workers in the two metropolitan Nebraska counties of Lancaster (which includes Lincoln) and Douglas (which includes Omaha). The following implications were drawn from the present study: Persons classified as “associated agricultural workers” need specific vocational training, in many areas of vocational education. “Associated agricultural workers” and workers in non-agriculture occupations need <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> in many of the areas of vocational education. Workers with agricultural backgrounds or training often find these agricultural <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> useful when employed in non-agricultural businesses and industries. It seems reasonable to assume that agricultural education should be made available to large groups of people as workers in numerous occupations find some agricultural <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> useful. There are implications that broad, comprehensive programs of vocational education with emphasis on underlying basic principles in all areas of vocational education should be available for all types of workers. There are implications that “associated agriculture workers” in metropolitan areas are employed in occupations that require agriculture <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> along with other <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> in other areas of vocational education. In general, workers who expressed a need for agricultural <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> are {{more likely to engage in}} activities involving work with persons outside the business firm than other workers. In general, workers who expressed a need for agricultural <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> <b>skills</b> consistently checked items concerned with working with people. Hence, educational programs should be directed at providing workers with abilities in the area of personal relations. Advisor: John K. Coste...|$|R

William Buckland credited Anning with two key observations about certain odd fossils, that they were sometimes found in the abdominal regions of ichthyosaur skeletons, and that they often contained fossilized fish scales and bones (and sometimes the bones of small ichthyosaurs), which led him to conclude that coprolites were fossilized faeces. [...] This discovery led Buckland to write a vivid description of the Lias food chain.
