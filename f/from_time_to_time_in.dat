5|$|The {{question}} {{of an independent}} Jersey has been discussed <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the Assembly of the States of Jersey. In 2005–08, a working group of the States of Jersey examined the options for independence, concluding that Jersey 'is equipped to face the challenges of independence' but making no recommendations. Proposals for Jersey independence continue to be discussed outside the States.|$|E
5|$|Bacher {{remained}} {{chair of}} the division of physics, mathematics and astronomy at Caltech until 1962, when he was appointed as vice president and provost. He stepped down from the post of provost in 1970 at the age of 65, and became a professor emeritus in 1976. He still did some research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and visited Caltech <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> 1983 he was master of ceremonies at Los Alamos for events commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the laboratory in 1943.|$|E
5|$|Most {{sharks are}} carnivorous. Basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have {{independently}} evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction {{to take in}} plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. This type of feeding requires gill rakers—long, slender filaments that form a very efficient sieve—analogous to the baleen plates of the great whales. The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> huge mouthfuls. Teeth in these species are comparatively small {{because they are not}} needed for feeding.|$|E

5|$|At this time, Jean-Paul-François de Noailles, Duc d'Ayen {{was looking}} to marry off some of his five daughters. The young Lafayette, aged 14, seemed a good match for his 12-year-old daughter, Marie Adrienne Françoise, and the duc spoke to the boy's {{guardian}} (Lafayette's uncle, the new comte) to negotiate a deal. However, the arranged marriage was opposed by the duc's wife, who felt the couple, and especially her daughter, were too young. The matter was settled by agreeing {{not to mention the}} marriage plans for two years, during which time the two spouses-to-be would meet <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> casual settings and {{get to know each other}} better. The scheme worked; the two fell in love, and were happy together from the time of their marriage in 1774 until her death in 1807.|$|E
5|$|Following {{service in}} the First World War, Wilson became known for singing tenor roles in oratorios by composers from Bach to Elgar, and was {{particularly}} admired both as the Evangelist in Bach's St Matthew Passion and {{in the title role}} of The Dream of Gerontius. He was a champion of music by English composers of his generation, notably Ralph Vaughan Williams, Gustav Holst and Rutland Boughton. He also appeared <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> operatic tenor roles, including Satyavan in the first professional performance of Holst's Savitri. The quality of his voice and even his technique, though, was not universally admired. In a high-profile libel case Wilson sued a member of the public who had criticised one of his performances in a letter, and the BBC for publishing it: he won £2,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|NATO {{increased}} its naval {{presence in the}} Black Sea significantly following the Russian invasion, with ships docking in Georgian ports, {{and according to the}} US Navy, delivering humanitarian aid. NATO said that its presence in the Black Sea was not related to the Georgian crisis; its vessels were conducting typical visits and preplanned naval exercises with Romania and Bulgaria. Russian General Anatoliy Nogovitsyn reminded NATO of the limit on the number of vessels allowed in the Black Sea under the 1936 Montreux convention. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev questioned the claim that ships going to Georgia were bringing only humanitarian assistance, alleging the delivery of military material. According to political analyst Vladimir Socor, the US maintained a continual presence in the Black Sea. The ships were rotated <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the Black Sea because of the constraints on ship's weight and length of visits set by the Montreux Convention.|$|E

5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
5|$|The Abbot-Emeritus of the Abbey of New Clairvaux, Fr.Thomas X.Davis, OCSO, {{first saw}} the stones and pictured them {{reassembled}} as a monastery on September 15, 1955—his first day in California. He arrived that day in San Francisco {{to serve as a}} new monk in Vina, California, at the monastery of Our Lady of New Clairvaux. The monastery belonged to Trappists of the order known as Cistercians of the Strict Observance. The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by Leland Stanford to grow wine grapes. Davis's superior met him at the airport and drove him through Golden Gate Park where he stopped to show Davis the stones sitting among the weeds. <b>From</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> subsequent years, Davis inspected the stones only to find them in increasingly poor condition.|$|E
5|$|The work {{of makeup}} artist Phil Leakey in {{transforming}} Richard Wordsworth's Carroon into the mutating creature {{was a key}} contribution {{to the effectiveness of}} the film. Val Guest, Anthony Hinds and Leakey all agreed that the makeup should make Carroon appear pitiful rather than ugly. Leakey placed a light above the actor in the makeup chair and then worked on accentuating the shadows cast by his eyebrows, nose, chin and cheekbones. The makeup was a liquid rubber solution mixed with glycerine to give the impression of sweat. Leakey's job was made easier by Wordsworth's natural high cheekbones and hollow temples and he also worked closely with cinematographer Walter J. Harvey to ensure the lighting in each shot emphasised Wordsworth's features. Leakey also created Carroon's mutating arm. The hand was created from a cast of the hand of an arthritis victim, enlarged and exaggerated by Leakey. The rest of the arm was built up using latex and rubber and, inside, had a series of plastic tubes through which fluid was pumped to give the effect of the arm swelling. A large sponge-rubber prosthetic was used for a brief scene in the zoo showing Carroon's mutation had advanced further. The shrivelled corpses of Carroon's victims, glimpsed <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the film, were also made by Leakey.|$|E
