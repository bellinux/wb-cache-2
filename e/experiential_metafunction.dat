30|$|Wang and Xu (2013) {{provides}} a complementary account {{by focusing on}} the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction.</b> Specifically, they give a cross-linguistic account of existential and relational clauses (possessive and circumstantial types). While acknowledging that Michael Halliday's IFG is meant to be a description of English, Wang and Xu (2013) problematises the universal applicability of dividing clauses that construe location into two different process types, relational and existential. Based on their cross-linguistic data (examples are given from about 21 languages), they argue for a universal classification of existential clauses as a sub-type of relational processes. We interpret their account as highlighting the competing interest in describing individual languages in their own right and describing languages as a manifestation of the one human semiotic system called language.|$|E
30|$|The ideational metafunction can {{be divided}} into two subtypes embodying {{different}} modes of construing experience—experiential and logical. Within the simple clause, the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction</b> construes experience in terms of configurations such as the configuration of a process, participants involved in it and attendant circumstances by means of the grammatical system of TRANSITIVITY (Halliday and Matthiessen, 1999, Halliday and Matthiessen, 2010). Thompson (2014 : 94) states that the term ‘transitivity’ will probably be familiar as a way of distinguishing between verbs according to whether they have an Object or not (i.e., transitive verbs and intransitive verbs). Here, however, it is being used in a much boarder sense and refers, in particular, to a system for describing the whole clause, rather than just the verb and its Object.|$|E

Halliday divides the ideational into the logical and the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunctions.</b> The logical metafunction refers to the grammatical resources for building up grammatical units into complexes, for instance, for combining two or more clauses into a clause complex. The experiential function refers to the grammatical resources involved in construing the flux of experience through the unit of the clause.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} analyze the errors arising in {{translation}} of legal documents from English to Persian. Most of the researchers conducted on explaining the complexity of legal language, has shown that vocabulary and terminology has justifiably received the most attention, as lexis fulfills the symbolic or representational function of language {{better than any other}} linguistic component. Consequently it has been supposed that in legal translation, just finding appropriate equivalent for vocabulary and terminology is sufficient. But in this paper, which examines the errors occurred in English –Persian translation of legal documents, the translated text will be analyzed at sentence level based on a meaning-based functional approach; i. e. Systemic Functional Grammar Approach (SFG) to see whether we can apply it as an objective criteria for error analysis of translated legal documents & how. For this purpose, nine error categories were considered; including interpersonal, textual, logical and <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunctions</b> and in order to understand experiential meaning, it was broken into three functional constituents; that is participant, process and circumstance. Further to the above categories, three other issues, including mistranslation, omission and word choice were considered, as well. Then while dividing the legal text into separate sentences, each sentence was analyzed according to these categories. The results of this research show that SFG approach would be an appropriate criteria and scale for evaluating the accuracy of the legal documents translation, not only for legal translators in producing an accurate and perfect translation, but also for teachers in evaluating the students’ translation abilities, objectively...|$|R
30|$|Third, {{seen in this}} perspective, {{the nature}} of the {{parameter}} is very likely to validate the 1973 CMR hypothesis: the metaphor of ‘resonance’ is apt for referring to the reciprocal relations of context and metafunction. The metafunctions have evolved in language being used as a form of action, as a means of enacting interpersonal relations, and also as a means of creating relevance, continuity and coherence in interaction. These resources are common to all languages. If field is far more likely to be realised by the meaning-wording resources of ‘transitivity’ and ‘reference’ (i.e., Saussure’s ‘signification’), and both derive from the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction,</b> this is not a statement of two facts, but of one: the design of language has evolved in the living of life. The resonance of context and metafunction is a good indication of how eventually what happens as part of speaking (parole) might end up as a feature of the system of language (langue).|$|E
30|$|To {{establish}} {{the identity of}} the context, one needs to focus on the varying features in the textual environment; this is what register variation correlates with: this was the basis for the recognition of the three parameters whose linguistic character was made more specific in the CMR hypothesis: now field, tenor and mode could be viewed as realisationally oriented respectively to the ideational, interpersonal and textual meaning-wording. And this can be interpreted as assigning each parameter a ‘default realisation’ thus granting the possibility of ‘variant’ realistions under specifiable conditions. The ARC hypothesis strengthens the basis of the parameters by a systematic correspondence: for example, field concerns what concerns Action, so it should subsume aspects of Action, e.g., its types, circumstances and participants as recognized within the culture; and of course these are exactly the phenomena, realised ‘more often than not’ as meaning-wording derived from the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction.</b> The same applies mutatis mutandis to the other two parameters.|$|E

Introduction [...] 2. Context of the research [...] 3. Literature review [...] 4. Methodology [...] 5. Thematic content {{analysis of the data}} [...] 6. SFL analysis of data [...] 7. Discussion [...] 8. Conclusions [...] AppendicesIn the world today, the demand for English teachers is growing exponentially in wide-ranging contexts and for numerous purposes. Despite this demand, teachers who do not speak English as their first language continue to experience bias in hiring and in the workplace even when they are well-qualified. In the United States, where the immigrant population has grown and continues to grow significantly, TESOL programs are also scurrying to meet the demand for ESL teachers. The teacher learners themselves form a diverse pool of native (NES) and nonnative English (NNES) speakers with various backgrounds in language learning. This qualitative study delved into the academic writing of the NES and NNES participants, who were enrolled in a Master's in Education/TESOL program in New York. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to investigate their literacy development and language learning to add to the growing body of research in this area, specifically to discover more about the background and needs of NESs and NNESs in teacher preparation programs. [...] This study explored the nature of literacy and language development among NES and NNES teacher learners through an analysis of surveys and a two-pronged textual analysis, which involved a thematic content analysis and a Hallidayan Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) analysis of the literacy and linguistic autobiographies that the participants wrote as part of their coursework. Specific observer perspectives offered within the SFL framework, in particular the <b>experiential</b> and interpersonal <b>metafunctions,</b> were used as tools to discover how the participants construed and negotiated their experiences of language and literacy. SysConc, an SFL concordancing tool, aided in the selection of targeted clause complexes with the pronominal "I" and words related to literacy, including read, write, listen, speak, book, language, and learn. [...] The interpretation of the data indicated that literacy learning and language development are complex, interactive, and sometimes emotionally charged processes, about which the participants often expressed themselves through non-assertive lexicogrammatical choices. The comparison of data also revealed the people who most influenced the participants' language development, and the similarities and differences among their writings from the standpoint of grammatical intricacy. The research has implications for the development of literacy and the training of teachers of English. Mode of access: World Wide Web. 1 online resource (xvii, 413 pages) colour illustration...|$|R
30|$|Halliday {{has often}} {{suggested}} that metafunctions resonate systematically {{with the three}} contextual parameters, which are realised as the relevant meaning-wording that is equal to producing the texts. Thus (i) the linguistic patterns oriented to the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction</b> would typically correlate with the features in the system of field; (ii) those deriving from the interpersonal metafunction would typically correlate with the features in the tenor of discourse, and (iii) the textural and organisational resources of the textual metafunction would typically correlate with the mode of discourse. In short, the ‘default’ linguistic realisation of the features pertaining to the three parameters are predicted by reference to the metafunctional orientation of the lexicogrammar and semantics: the formulation leaves open the possibility of departures from the highly probableg. This probabilistic formulation of the context-metafunction resonance (CMR) was greeted with a lively controversy (for some detail, Hasan, [1995]). Those expressing objections never took any notice {{of the fact that}} in the study of sociolinguistic variation, predictions about linguistic features correlating with situational ones such as age, gender, geographical and/or social provenance, have typically been stated in probabilistic terms, and continue to do so even today.|$|E
30|$|Transitivity is a {{grammatical}} system {{within the}} <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction</b> of language, which concerns those language resources that humans use to construe {{their experience of}} the world. It is, in Halliday’s (2002 [1971], 119) terms, “really {{the cornerstone of the}} semantic organization of experience”. For example, in his detailed account of the grammatical construal of pain, Halliday (2005 [1998]) shows how the experience of pain transforms into meaning via the transitivity resources of English language and how the investigation of such features in the grammar of daily life helps the understanding of the underlying construction of human experience. Thompson (2008, 17) argues that the analysis of the transitivity choices of language users “is {{one of the most effective}} ways of exploring the ideological assumptions that inform and are construed by the texts” and further suggests a ‘transitivity concordance’ approach to the analysis of transitivity as an approach that “highlight[s] the key patterns” and “make[s] the movement from the identification of these patterns to interpretation of their significance in ideological terms more transparent”. The transitivity concordance approach, according to Thompson (2008, 18), involves the gathering together of “all the clauses in which each entity or group of entities in the text is represented in a particular participant role”.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the huge}} public {{attention}} {{received by the}} male beauty contest discourse in Hong Kong as reflected in extensive local media coverage, studies on the discourse are rare. Concerning the limited literature in the male gender studies, this dissertation addressed the issue and examined the representation of and sexism against male in male beauty contest discourse in Hong Kong. Two latest publicized major male beauty contests in Hong Kong (TVB Mr. Hong Kong Contest 2011 and ATV Mr. Asia Contest 2012) were analyzed using frameworks of ‘dialectical-relational approach’ to Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, 2009), the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction</b> of Systemic Functional Linguistics (Halliday & Christian, 2004) and a combination of sexist characteristics suggested by influential theories such as Objectification Theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). This study integrated findings across analyses of the contests {{in terms of their}} linguistics and multi-modal texts as well as culture of context. The findings showed that representations of men portrayed were seen to be degrading men. There was also clear evidence of sexism against male realized through language and visual aspects. It was concluded that the representations and sexist elements were possibly generated from the competitive rivalry between the two broadcasting companies and the change in public perception on gender characteristics. It also suggested that stricter regulating guidelines are needed to secure the professional ethics in media production in Hong Kong. This study grounded future research on the application of SFL framework as a useful quantitative analytical tool to supplement qualitative research in gender studies in media discourse. published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|E
40|$|Two media labels Kong Girls (Hong Kong Girls) and Kong Boys (Hong Kong Boys), {{which take}} on pejorative meanings, are {{constantly}} circulated {{by the local}} media. This research looked into the representations of these two emergent stereotypes in the reality shows Bride Wannabes and Bachelors at War {{in light of their}} explicit focus on gender relations and the substantial press coverage received. Since literature on gender and media discourses in Hong Kong has been dominated by qualitative and interpretative analyses from the sociology perspective, there exists a research gap in quantitative linguistic studies to unveil latent gendered ideologies (Fung & Yao, 2012). Therefore, this dissertation adopted an analytical framework integrating Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, 2003) and the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction</b> of Systemic Functional Linguistics (Halliday, 1985), for a provision of a sociocultural study that is rooted in linguistic methodology. Drawing upon the Visual Social Semiotics model (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2006), a multimodal analysis was conducted to examine how textual and visual resources co-articulate gendered discourses in the reality series. The findings identified a range of gendered discourses which simultaneously confirm or contest conventional gender stereotypes, embodying how Kong Girls and Kong Boys shape their multiple gendered selves. Implications can be drawn from the results that both language and visuals tend to be manipulated by the media to perpetuate unfavourable gender stereotypes, it is thus crucial to raise the public’s awareness of the ideological impacts of different semiotic choices through media literacy education. published_or_final_versionApplied English StudiesMasterMaster of Arts in Applied Linguistic...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is twofold. Firstly it seeks to find the generic {{structures}} that are inherent in the introduction sections of entrepreneurship research articles and secondly it investigates the role of <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction</b> and its distribution in realization of obligatory generic elements that are found in the data. The approach applied is a combination of Halliday and Hasan’s (1989) model of genre analysis to find the generic structure potential (GSP) of the introduction sections as well as Halliday’s (1994) model of transitivity analysis to find the typicality of the process types and their contribution in the realization of the obligatory elements. The corpus comprises 20 research article introduction sections that are published from 2010 onward in the Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship and Small Business and Enterprise Development. The analysis reveals that 13 types of generic elements might occur in the entrepreneurship research articles introductions. Two of these elements such as ‘Purpose of study’ and ‘Previous study’ element are present in the whole data while others are found to be optional. Based on the obligatory, optional and recursive elements found on the data, the model of Generic Structure Potential (GSP) of the entrepreneurship research article’s introduction sections is proposed. Moreover, in the second phase of analysis the findings reveal that the typicality of the process types within each obligatory element is mostly in line with the function that each obligatory generic element fulfills in that particular genre. As an instance, in the present study, the ‘purpose of study’ element is mostly recognized with Mental processes and Relational processes while the ‘Previous study’ element is highly characterized with Material and Mental processes...|$|E
30|$|Notwithstanding {{good reasons}} for {{treating}} context as point of origin, its in-built complexity cannot be ignored. Would this affect its linguistic description? At first glance, {{the use of multiple}} braces may appear iconic of that problem. But somewhat surprisingly even here it seems possible not only to generalize about the function of the multiple braces but also to offer analogous relations at the language internal strata of wording and meaning. Thus, the first large opening brace of a sys-net such as incorporated in Figure  3 seems to have an especial function: occurring immediately after the point of origin or close to the primary system – but always {{in the vicinity of the}} less delicate part of the sys-net – the brace seems to be reserved for identifying the metafunctional orientations of the various systems that will constitute the comprehensive system network pertaining to the point of origin. For example, with the unit ‘clause’ as the point of origin, the primary system has two options ‘minor’ or ‘major’; and following ‘major’ an opening brace announces a number of dimensions such as those of mood and modality (interpersonal orientation), transitivity, tense and projection (ideational orientation), and theme and information focus (textual orientation) (see Halliday, [1976]; Matthiessen and Halliday [2014] etc.). Similar to this, at the semantic stratum, Figure  1 has shown two primary options, ‘punctuative’ or ‘progressive’; the latter option is followed by the first large brace of that sys-net; and this specifies four entries, each oriented to a specific metafunction: the first to interpersonal, he next to textual; the third to logical and the last to the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction</b> (Hasan [2013]: 286). A similar situation unfolds with context as well: thus, in Figure  3, immediately after the point of origin, is the first brace; it announces the four domains pertinent to the description of context – that is to say, the three dimensions of field, tenor and mode plus that of iteration. I interpret this as signifying that these three domains have carved up the vast area of description called context of situation by reference to their metafunctional orientations.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{statements by}} the Chairman and CEO of BP plc from the company’s 2010 annual report. Working {{on the premise}} that the reputational fallout from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010 would have heightened the need for the company to engage in reader positioning through its annual report to protect and repair the company’s legitimacy, it is suggested that differences would manifest in the approach to and strength of that positioning because the Chairman and CEO occupy different roles. Following M. A. K. Halliday’s Systemic Functional Linguistics framework, a comparative register analysis was undertaken of the respective statements of the Chairman and CEO of BP plc from the company’s 2010 annual report. This concentrates on relevant aspects of the interpersonal metafunction, Tenor and the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction,</b> Field. Reviewing the Tenor of each statement framed an examination of how the Chairman and CEO each present to the reader through their respective statements, i. e. the persona which comes across through lexicogrammatical choices and how this is likely to impact upon reader interpretations. Each persona was drawn through interpretation of stance, personalisation, social distance and standing. Reviewing the Field of each statement framed an examination of each statement’s angle of representation through the characterisation of events/entities and elements of agency and affectedness. Particular consideration was given to how connections are made or avoided between participants through clausal structures, evidence of agency through transactional and non-transactional actor roles and agent deletion/de-emphasis through intransitive and passive grammatical constructions. The findings from this comparative register analysis were revisited and informed by corpus analysis of the two statements and of two additional largerscale corpora constructed from Chairman and CEO statements extracted from the annual reports of 25 FTSE 100 companies published in 2013. The findings suggest that readers’ perceptions are shaped by the statements of the Chairman and CEO of BP plc in the company’s 2010 annual report, but similarities and differences are apparent in the way this positioning is engineered. Broader corpus analysis suggests that these similarities and differences are not localised to BP plc...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{to report on}} teachers’ ability in {{composing}} expository texts. The texts were composed by six high school teachers in Bandar Lampung, Lampung, Indonesia. This study is a descriptive qualitative case study investigating three Analytical and three Hortatory Expository texts. Those texts were analyzed using Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) {{to deal with the}} textual, experiential and interpersonal metafunctions which were exposed within the texts’ Theme, Transitivity and Mood systems. The results of texts analyses then were confirmed and validated through interviews conducted with the teachers. The result of this study shows that the teachers could demonstrate appropriate strategies to compose the texts although some problems of writing were evident in the texts. The grammatical analyses indicate that the writers had successfully attempted to use some of the main conventions of written argumentative discourse. In this case, to construe textual metafunction, the teachers could employ the demands of the generic form of arguing genre, the linguistic devices as well as the thematic progression. Furthermore, referring to <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction,</b> the teachers could demonstrate their ability to use various linguistic resources such as appropriate conjunction system and appropriate Process types, Circumstantials and Nominalisations. Finally, interpersonally, the writers could enrich the text with the use of appropriate Modality to create objective arguments and communicate with the readers. However, the study reveals that not all of the teachers’ texts can be considered successful or mature texts in that they seem to have problems with Argument development characterized with lack of fact and objective evidence, inconsistency of argument, and absence of intertextuality. Besides, the inappropriate use of imperative mood, realis/universal statements and some syntax errors are also found. It is found that the teachers’ problems were mainly to do with their time management to carry out the task which resulted in their inability to give maximum efforts to work with the texts. In addition their background knowledge and language competence as well as their commitment to carry out the task also appeared to be problems in producing the texts. Thus, the teachers are suggested to commit to more practices and to have effective teacher trainings to maintain and improve the teachers’ professional competence particularly to concern the issue of SFL and GBA within the curriculum...|$|E
40|$|The author employs feminist stylistics, {{along with}} {{language}} & gender and language & sexuality, {{to explore a}} number of erotic limericks {{which appeared in the}} first issue of The Pearl, a Victorian pornographic magazine published from 1879 to 1881. The author examines the language of sexuality and of eroticism in the poems, and how it is employed to describe the bodies and actions of the female, male and even animal characters portrayed in the texts under scrutiny, ironically called “nursery rhymes” by their anonymous author(s). In the introductory section to her article, the author presents the pornographic magazine The Pearl, also called A Journal of Facetiae and Voluptuous Reading, and introduces Victorian sexuality and masculinity, while clearly stating the objectives of her study. She then analyses the discursive structure and the textual genre of the limerick, concentrating on the prototypical addresser-addressee interaction in relation to the function of the genre itself and to the textual achievement of hyperbolic comedy. Next she investigates the lexical level of the ‘nursery rhymes’, focussing principally on the nature of sexual desire and on the use of coarse language and lexemes denoting or referring to body parts; she then treats the resulting strategy of cropping and the commodification of human bodies. Finally she discusses the erotic poems through the deployment of Hallidayan functional grammar, more precisely of the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction,</b> scrutinising those “prototypical and non-prototypical realisations of functional process types and participants that effectively convey sexuality {{on the one hand and}} male dominance of female figures on the other”, and analysing how that male control is wielded over females and animals. The author’s ultimate aim is to show how the models of femininity and of masculinity represented in the erotic limericks are the product of a hegemonic chauvinist ideology teamed up with a dominant heterosexual ideology; at the same time, she demonstrates that masculine hegemony is created and maintained through the denial of femininity, namely, through compliance with the value system of Victorian white military masculinity. The linguistic application in the diachronic context which is implied confirms the appropriacy of stylistics as an analytical tool which can confirm or reject hypotheses formed by others as well as by its own research...|$|E
40|$|Magister Artium - MAThis {{research}} {{uses the}} Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) approach, more specifically, the appraisal theory to analyse the online message postings by {{fans of the}} popular music artist, Beyoncé Knowles. Through their online writings, insight into their evaluative discourses is gained. This research focuses on the emotional, judgemental and evaluative stance in their writings, especially; the linguistic choices that the online fans use in order to convey their attitudes: appreciation and judgement and affect towards Knowles. In order to do such an analysis, the study considers the different Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) levels of meaning (interpersonal, textual and experiential metafunctions). Several questions become pertinent: What kinds of interpersonal relations and identities are implicated on the message boards? (Interpersonal metafunction). How are these expressed textually? (Textual metafunction). What kinds of experiences/fields are implicated in the messages? (<b>Experiential</b> <b>metafunction).</b> The research concludes {{that in terms of}} identity, fans tend to latch onto a Hip-Hop culture in order to create and maintain a connection to Knowles. Fans display this linguistically by writing certain words out phonetically as they would be pronounced orally. Gender boundaries are transgressed irrespective of the fans' gender. Posts also demonstrate colourful expressive responses in relation to Knowles. Whether the fan is male or female, both feel comfortable in using emotive language to demonstrate the impact which she has on their lives. In terms of appreciation fans tend to express that she has inspired and changed their lives. Attitudes explored demonstrated that a number of Knowles' fans hold positive viewpoints and therefore they would align themselves positively towards her. The element of judgement was explored from different perspectives in relation to Knowles. One, being a website which suggested that Knowles had undergone an evil transformation. For evidence, these fans used her lyrics, gestures and images selectively as a way to "prove" their arguments. As a contribution to knowledge, this research is useful in the sense that when individuals log online and leave their posts on message boards, they do not always realise the impact of the message that they leave behind. Using SFL and the appraisal theory, one is able to establish the attitudes: judgements, appreciation and affect individuals hold towards a particular topic or person (in this case towards Knowles). Through linguistically analysing message boards, one is able to connect individuals to possible identity options. In essence, the letters and words which individuals have strung together create a greater picture than what was possibly intended. Linguistically, it opens more avenues for exploration...|$|E

Summary and conclusion. For {{the past two}} decades, great efforts {{have been made in}} the systemic functional description of English and many other languages including Chinese at the clause level. However, very few descriptive work has been done at the group/phrase level. As an attempt to fill in the gap, this thesis extends the lexicogrammatical study to the level of nominal groups, focusing on Mandarin Chinese in particular. Drawing upon a corpus of 180 quality texts of different text types, the investigation is heavily text-based: the nominal groups are observed in the environment of clauses, sentences, paragraphs and texts in contexts. The description of Chinese nominal groups is unfolded on the basis of Halliday’s metafunctional model, exploring the metafunctional resources that Chinese nominal groups provide in realising the three strands of meaning: ideational (including logical and experiential), interpersonal and textual meanings. Through the investigation of each metafunction, some important systems within the nominal group are presented, which provide selections in realising the metafunctional meanings. In terms of logical metafunction, the system of MODIFICATION is presented. In terms of <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction,</b> the systems presented include THING TYPE, CLASSIFICATION, EPITHESIS, QUALIFICATION, and MEASURE. In terms of interpersonal metafunction, the system of PERSON is introduced. And finally, in terms of textual metafunction, the exploration includes the system of NAMING, the system of IDENTIFICATION, and the system of NUMERATION. Major selections on each of these systems are discussed in detail, with examples demonstrating the potential lexicogrammatical choices. Apart from the exploration of the systems, another focus of the study is on the potential application of the findings to other areas. For this purpose, at the end of each metafunctional exploration, a case study involving different types of texts is presented, demonstrating the significance of nominal groups in their contributions to the metafunctional meanings. The case studies are designed to explore different issues in relation to the use of nominal groups, including the modification structure of the nominal groups and its relation with text types (in the logical exploration), the experiential environment of Thing type choices in different types of texts (in the experiential exploration), the choice of nominal groups in enacting different attitudes (in the interpersonal exploration), and challenges of cohesion and coherence in machine translation presented by nominal groups (in the textual exploration). Through in-depth metafunctional exploration of the nominal gorups, as well as illustrative case studies, this research is expected to contribute to the development of language typology in Systemic Functional Linguistics, as well as other areas including delicate discourse analysis, the study of Chinese language, and machine translation research.

40|$|Use of the Internet {{has opened}} countless {{possibilities}} to access {{information and to}} connect with other people. In earlier days, contact was limited {{to people in the}} immediate surroundings. New media, like paper, radio or telephones, have opened new channels for communication, and so has the Internet. We no longer need to move our physical bodies in order to see and speak to people who live elsewhere. Physical borders are not relevant for Internet communication. What impact does this have on the language people use? Can we still find differences in the use of two closely related languages, English and German, even though Internet communication may have blurred boundaries? As the language model against which to compare English and German the author chose Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG). The main assumption in SFG is that any option in a language system serves a certain function for the language user. SFG speaks of three broad functions in human communication, called metafunctions: the experiential, the interpersonal and the textual metafunction. With the <b>experiential</b> <b>metafunction,</b> we describe the world around us and inside us; this is realized by the system of transitivity, i. e. process types and participant roles. With the interpersonal metafunction, we establish a relationship between us and our listeners or readers. This is realized by the two systems of modality and negation. Finally, the textual metafunction serves to produce cohesion and is represented by the theme-rheme structure. The aim of this contrastive study is to show the similarities and differences of language use in a bilingual corpus of computer-mediated communication (CMC). The Englische und deutsche Newsgroup Texte – Annotiertes Korpus (EDNA) holds 2 x 10, 000 words of newsgroup texts in which people write about either eating disorders or relationship problems. The entire EDNA cor-pus is manually annotated; the annotation was carried out {{with the help of the}} UAM corpus tool. The manual annotation covers all four systems representing the three metafunctions. The analysis is twofold: the first part is a qualitative analysis of transitivity, modality, negation and theme-rheme structure, including a test for statistical significance. The second part is an analysis of the lexical items which are most frequently used to express the systems described in the first part. The results suggest that the German writers use significantly more modality and negation than the English writers. Relational processes (processes of being and having) are the most frequent ones in both sub-corpora. Following these, German writers prefer action processes (processes of doing) to mental processes (processes of thinking, feeling and perceiving), whereas English writers use more mental than action processes. The first and main participant roles, usually serving as the subject, are almost exclusively realized by pronouns, most commonly I / ich, and thus say little about the content of the text. In the newsgroup texts by German writers, there are more marked topical themes, i. e. constituents other than subjects stand in the first position of a declarative clause. In the English texts, these marked topical themes are mainly temporal circumstances, while in the German texts, writers refer to themselves with words like mir, mich, für mich. The present study is a comprehensive contrastive analysis of a new register, CMC, in English and in German. It does not limit itself to selected grammatical or lexical features but gives an extensive description and comparison of the language systems and language use in a corpus of CMC by using SFG as linguistic model.
