25|$|Sergeant Jay Landsman {{walks into}} the {{homicide}} unit office humming a carol. His Christmas spirit is rapidly dispelled when he sees several red names being added to the case board. He quizzes Detective Ed Norris about the board; Norris tells him that Lester Freamon is responsible, having received the go-ahead to search vacant houses for concealed bodies. Landsman is angry at the sudden drop in his squad clearance rate and calls Freamon a Hun, a Vandal and a Visigoth. Landsman next asks what Norris is working on and is dismayed {{to find out that}} he is also working a new case: that of a deliberate killing using poisoned narcotics. Landsman is somewhat forgiving when Norris tells him that he has the perpetrator in custody as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> voluntarily confessed to the crime.|$|E

500|$|Sheen's {{most notable}} film {{appearance}} of 2011 was {{a supporting role}} in Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris. Allen noted that [...] "Michael {{had to do the}} pseudo-intellectual, the genuine intellectual, the pedant, and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> nailed it from the start". Sheen enjoyed playing [...] "someone who's just absolutely got no sense that he's overstepping the mark or that he's being a bore." [...] The film opened the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and became Allen's highest-grossing film to date. Also in 2011, Sheen starred in Beautiful Boy, an independent drama focusing on the aftermath of a school shooting, voiced the enigmatic and mysterious villain House in the Doctor Who episode [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] written by his friend Neil Gaiman and made cameo appearances in [...] and Resistance.

500|$|Nelson's {{body was}} placed in a cask of brandy mixed with camphor and myrrh, which was then lashed to the Victory's {{mainmast}} and placed under guard. Victory was towed to Gibraltar after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with spirits of wine. Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard , and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton. She later recalled, They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. [...] "Show him in directly", I said. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, [...] "We have gained a great Victory." [...] – [...] "Never mind your Victory", I said. [...] "My letters – give me my letters" [...] – Captain Whitby was unable to speak – tears in his eyes and a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him. I believe I gave a scream and fell back, and for ten hours I could neither speak nor shed a tear.|$|E
500|$|... "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" [...] emulates {{the style}} of Ben Folds. According to music critic Nathan Rabin, the song [...] "amplifies the noxious {{self-absorption}} of the American character to hilarious extremes" [...] by describing a narrator who, upon hearing {{about a number of}} horrible tragedies, only complains about the (minor) inconveniences that affect him. [...] Folds himself plays piano on the track. Yankovic later told The A.V. Club: [...] "Ben and I are old friends at this point, and of course I sought his keyboard work for that song. So <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> knocked it out. I think that’s an F-Sharp, so he was kind of mad at me for that." [...] "Bob" [...] is a style parody of Bob Dylan, composed entirely of palindromes (for instance, the song's first line is [...] "I, man, am regal—a German am I", which reads the same when reversed). Rabin argues that the song's lyrics [...] "sound cryptic enough to be genuine Dylanesque, but are in fact palindromes deliver in an uncanny re-creation of Dylan's nasal whine." [...] The album's closer, [...] "Genius in France", emulates the idiosyncratic style of Frank Zappa. Zappa's son, Dweezil performed the song's intro guitar solo. Lyrically, the song describes a person who, although rejected elsewhere, finds acceptance in France.|$|E

500|$|The Giants {{made the}} {{decision}} to hire a General Manager {{for the first time in}} team history following the 1978 season. [...] However, disagreements during the search caused severe friction and discord between owners Wellington and Tim Mara. At one point they had tried to hire Jan Van Duser, a league executive, but he declined the offer due to the ownership squabbles. Finally, the Maras asked NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to step in with a recommendation. Rozelle recommended George Young,Pervin. pg. 73 who worked in personnel for the Miami Dolphins and had been an assistant coach for the Baltimore Colts. Rozelle had discussed the hiring before hand with former Giants Frank Gifford and Tom Scott, who recommended hiring Young. They had already recommended Young to Wellington and his son John, but felt if Rozelle presented the recommendation as his own idea the brothers would be more likely to accept the pick. Young was hired and he was instrumental in turning around the fortunes of the franchise. [...] "Oh, there is no question he helped save the franchise", John Mara later said. [...] "It looked like a no-win situation. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> overhauled everything we did in a more professional way."

500|$|By April 2010, Joss Whedon {{was close}} to {{completing}} a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script, and was officially announced in July 2010. When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not [...] "have anything" [...] and they should [...] "pretend this draft never happened". Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline [...] "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the [...] "Avengers Assemble" [...] slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the movie done for its May 2012 release. On the hiring, Arad stated: [...] "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's {{part of his life}} so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better". Feige added, [...] "I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> met on it... we want to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is." [...] Whedon stated at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, that what drew him to the film is that he loves how [...] "these people shouldn't {{be in the same room}} let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family".|$|E

500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to support what Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E
500|$|Gough and Millar {{had five}} months for casting, but their primary {{focus was on}} finding an actor to play Clark Kent. They {{received}} Kristin Kreuk's audition tape {{for the role of}} Lana Lang and liked it so much that they immediately showed her to the network. Tom Welling, after twice turning down the producers' attempts to get him to audition for the role of Clark Kent, eventually accepted the opportunity {{to be part of the}} show. It was David Nutter who finally convinced Welling to read the script for the pilot, after finding Welling's picture in a photo album at the casting director's office. Welling's manager did not want him to take the role because it could hurt his feature film career, but Welling liked the script and agreed to come in for an audition. Welling's reason for turning down the role was because the producers were keeping quiet on what the show was really about, which left him with the impression the show was going to be [...] "Superman in high school", something he did not want to do. Nutter promised to let Welling read the script if <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> auditioned. After auditioning, Welling was given the script to read, which he thought was [...] "amazing". For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene, from the pilot, with Kristin Kreuk; the network thought they had [...] "great chemistry". No one could agree on which actors had the best audition for Lex Luthor. Michael Rosenbaum auditioned twice, and, believing he did not take his first audition seriously, outlined a two-and-a-half-page scene from the pilot. He indicated all the places to be funny, charismatic, or menacing, and performed so well that everyone agreed he was [...] "the guy".|$|E

While editing, Phillips cut the scene that immediately followed Neeson's cameo, meaning it {{no longer had the}} information necessary to logically get the main characters to the situation in the next scene. Three weeks later, Phillips decided to reshoot the scene, but with Neeson in London filming Wrath of the Titans, the actor was no longer available. Phillips explained, [...] "We were in a complete time crunch so I called up Nick and asked if he would do the part. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> crushed it and that is the scene that you will ultimately see in the film.

2500|$|Save Rock and Roll was {{recorded}} primarily at Rubyred Recordings in Santa Monica, California from October 2012 to March 2013. The band's main {{goal was to}} reinvent {{the sound of the}} group from scratch, creating what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band", which focuses more on pop. Sessions were not without their difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material. Walker had doubts about the band's volatility, feeling the record would not be made following [...] "meltdown after meltdown". When the band members learned that Elton John was a fan of their music, they jokingly suggested that he might want to record with them. John complied, and Stump flew to Atlanta late in production, halting the mixing process, to record with him. He was very positive regarding the album's direction: [...] "He actually spoke up for the album's title. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> was like, 'Love the album title. Love where this is going. This is great, said Stump.|$|E
2500|$|Davis's trumpet and McLaughlin's guitar {{parts were}} heavily overdubbed for the recording. The overdubbing effect {{was created by}} {{superimposing}} part of Davis's trumpet solo onto other parts of it, through something Teo Macero calls a [...] "recording loop". Macero later said of this production technique, [...] "You hear the two parts and it's only two parts, but the two parts become four and they become eight parts. This was done over in the editing room and it just adds something to the music [...] I called [...] in and I said, 'Come in, I think we've got something you'll like. We'll try it on and {{if you like it}} you've got it.' <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> flipped out. He said {{it was one of the}} greatest things he ever heard". DeJohnette's drums were also manipulated by Macero, who used an automatic switcher to have them rattle back and forth between the left and right speakers on the recording. In his book Running the Voodoo Down: The Electric Music of Miles Davis, Davis-biographer Phil Freeman describes this technique as [...] "100 percent Macero" [...] and writes of its significance to the track as a whole, stating: ...|$|E

2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how it goes in the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
