5|$|Other {{complications}} include encephalitis (1 in 500 patients), {{which is}} more common in adults and may cause temporary disability; permanent pitted scars, most notably on the face; and complications involving the eyes (2 percent of all cases). Pustules can form on the eyelid, conjunctiva, and cornea, leading to complications such as conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal ulcer, iritis, iridocyclitis, and optic atrophy. Blindness results in approximately 35 percent to 40 percent of eyes affected with keratitis and corneal ulcer. Hemorrhagic smallpox can cause subconjunctival and retinal hemorrhages. In 2 to 5 percent of young children with smallpox, virions reach the <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> bone, causing osteomyelitis variolosa. Lesions are symmetrical, most common in the elbows, tibia, and fibula, and characteristically cause separation of an epiphysis and marked periosteal reactions. Swollen joints limit movement, and arthritis may lead to limb deformities, ankylosis, malformed bones, flail <b>joints,</b> <b>and</b> stubby fingers.|$|E

5|$|While blank {{variety is}} the {{defining}} demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, {{there are some}} shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or birdseye maple. He used stainless steel <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> delrin butt caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> ivory butt caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57Â½ inches in length.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the <b>joints,</b> <b>and</b> the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified.

5|$|The {{location}} of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces {{make and break}} contact (such as in <b>joints),</b> <b>and</b> heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface {{in contact with the}} liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms as they are very stable.|$|E
30|$|The FlexDex [2] uses a {{flexible}} bending <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> wire drive mechanism [13]. Furthermore, Lee and Chamorro adopted {{a flexible}} bending <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> wire drive mechanism [14]. Hraguchi et al. [15] also proposed a flexible bending <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> wire drive mechanism using a spring for the joint. Bending mechanisms using flexible joints are very simple. The mechanisms of the flexible bending <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> wire are decoupled between the axes. Therefore, many handheld robotic forceps adopt this mechanism. However, since the bending {{radius of the}} flexible joint is large {{with respect to the}} forceps diameter, large motion is required to determine the posture of the end effector. It is difficult to perform procedures in a narrow space when using forceps with a flexible bending joint.|$|R

5|$|The medical {{problems}} of the ancient Egyptians stemmed directly from their environment. Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage. Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat. The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and <b>joints,</b> <b>and</b> traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body. The grit and sand from stone-ground flour abraded teeth, leaving them susceptible to abscesses (though caries were rare).|$|E
5|$|The quatrefoil gunports in {{the lower}} levels {{could have been used}} for both hand cannons and crossbows, with {{overlapping}} fields of fire. The roof was reinforced with large timber <b>joints,</b> <b>and</b> could have supported heavier bombards, possibly on wheeled carriages; the tower's considerable height would have allowed the bombards to reach across the river onto the higher ground overlooking the city. Getting the bombards onto the roof may have required them to be hoisted up on a winch; one such hoist formed part of the accounts for the tower's construction in 1398 and 1399.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of Western Chalukya roof art {{is the use of}} domical ceilings (not {{to be confused with the}} European types that are built of voussoirs with radiating <b>joints)</b> <b>and</b> square ceilings. Both types of ceilings originate from the square formed in the ceiling by the four beams that rest on four pillars. The dome above the four central pillars is normally the most attractive. The dome is constructed of ring upon ring of stones, each horizontally bedded ring smaller than the one below. The top is closed by a single stone slab. The rings are not cemented but held in place by the immense weight of the roofing material above them pressing down on the haunches of the dome. The triangular spaces created when the dome springs from the centre of the square are filled with arabesques. In the case of square ceilings, the ceiling is divided into compartments with images of lotus rosettes or other images from Hindu mythology.|$|E

40|$|Aim To {{determine}} if there are correlations between <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> fascial chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGVHD) with clinical findings, laboratory parameters, and measures of functional capacity. Methods 29 patients were diagnosed with cGVHD based on National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Criteria at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb from October 2013 to October 2015. Physical examination, including functional measures such as 2 -minute walk test and hand grip strength, as well as laboratory tests were performed. The relationship between these evaluations and the severity of <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> fascial cGVHD was tested by logistical regression analysis. Results 12 of 29 patients (41. 3 %) had <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> fascial cGVHD diagnosed according to NIH Consensus Criteria. There was a significant positive correlation of <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> fascial cGVHD and skin cGVHD (P < 0. 001), serum C 3 complement level (P = 0. 045), and leukocytes (P = 0. 032). There was a significant negative correlation between 2 -minute walk test (P = 0. 016), percentage of cytotoxic T cells CD 3 +/ CD 8 + (P = 0. 022), serum albumin (P = 0. 047), and Karnofsky score (P < 0. 001). Binary logistic regression model found that a significant predictor for <b>joint</b> <b>and</b> fascial cGVHD was cGVHD skin involvement (odds ratio, 7. 79; 95 confidence interval 1. 87 - 32. 56; P = 0. 005).

5|$|It {{seemed to}} the besieged Christians as if arrows were {{shot out of}} the sky to strike and humble the pride of the infidels who rapidly died with marks on their bodies and lumps in their <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> several part, {{followed}} by putrid fever; all advice and help of the doctors being of no avail. Whereupon the Tartars, worn out by this pestilential disease, and falling on all sides as if thunderstruck, and seeing that they were perishing hopelessly, ordered the corpses to be placed upon their engines and thrown into the city of Kaffa. Accordingly were the bodies of the dead hurled over the walls, so that the Christians were not able to hide or protect themselves from this danger, although they carried away as many dead as possible and threw them into the sea. But soon the whole air became infected, and the water poisoned, and such a pestilence grew up that scarcely one out of a thousand was able to escape.|$|E
5|$|Paranotal {{hypothesis}}: This hypothesis {{suggests that}} the insect's wings developed from paranotal lobes, a preadaptation found in insect fossils that {{is believed to have}} assisted stabilization while hopping or falling. In favor of this hypothesis is the tendency of most insects, when startled while climbing on branches, to escape by dropping to the ground. Such lobes would have served as parachutes and enable the insect to land more softly. The theory {{suggests that the}}se lobes gradually grew larger and in a later stage developed a joint with the thorax. Even later would appear the muscles to move these crude wings. This model implies a progressive increase in the effectiveness of the wings, starting with parachuting, then gliding and finally active flight. Still, lack of substantial fossil evidence of the development of the wing <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> muscles poses a major difficulty to the theory, as does the seemingly spontaneous development of articulation and venation, and it has been largely rejected by experts in the field.|$|E
5|$|Redbacks usually prey on insects, but {{can capture}} larger animals that become {{entangled}} in the web, including trapdoor spiders, small lizards, and even on rare occasion snakes. One web was recorded as containing a dead mouse. The woodlouse (Porcellio scaber) is a particularly common food item. Developing spiderlings need size-appropriate prey, and laboratory studies {{show that they are}} willing to consume common fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), mealworm larvae (Tenebrio molitor), muscoid flies and early nymphs of cockroaches. Food scraps and lighting attract insect prey to areas of human activity, which brings the redbacks. Once alerted to a creature becoming ensnared in a trap line, the redback advances to around a leg's length from its target, touching it and squirting a liquid glutinous silk over it to immobilise it. It then bites its victim repeatedly on the head, body and leg <b>joints</b> <b>and</b> wraps it in sticky and dry silk. Unlike other spiders, it does not rotate its prey while wrapping in silk, but like other spiders, it then injects a venom that liquefies its victim's innards. Once it has trussed the prey, the redback takes it to its retreat and begins sucking out the liquefied insides, generally 5 to 20 minutes after first attacking it. Redback spiders do not usually drink, except when starved.|$|E
