5|$|<b>Kinematic</b> {{studies of}} {{matter in the}} Milky Way and other galaxies have {{demonstrated}} {{that there is more}} mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined.|$|E
5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically {{solving a}} set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating <b>kinematic</b> dynamo computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. <b>Kinematic</b> dynamo theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a dynamo.|$|E
5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} {{and handling}} {{is difficult to}} quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes <b>kinematic</b> analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{ytterbium}} {{is being}} investigated as a possible replacement for magnesium in high density pyrotechnic payloads for <b>kinematic</b> infrared decoy flares. As ytterbium(III) oxide has a significantly higher emissivity in the infrared range than magnesium oxide, a higher radiant intensity is obtained with ytterbium-based payloads in comparison to those commonly based on magnesium/Teflon/Viton (MTV).|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} (shape) {{of volcanic}} ash {{is controlled by}} a plethora of different eruption and <b>kinematic</b> processes. Eruptions of low-viscosity magmas (e.g., basalt) typically form droplet shaped particles. This droplet shape is, in part, controlled by surface tension, acceleration of the droplets after they leave the vent, and air friction. Shapes range from perfect spheres {{to a variety of}} twisted, elongate droplets with smooth, fluidal surfaces.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} system of units with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for <b>kinematic</b> viscosity.|$|E
5|$|Wells, et al., {{alternately}} {{suggested that}} as a terrane at {{the margin of the}} continent was pushed over the Yellowstone hotspot, it was rifted away from the continent by the upwelling magma, which then formed the Siletzia basalts. This idea was further developed by , who suggested rifting might have been initiated by a change in plate direction, or by <b>kinematic</b> effects as the Kula-Farallon ridge migrated along the continental margin. One such effect is the formation of a slab window (or slab gap) which would allow increased upwelling of magma.|$|E
25|$|In general, a {{building}} model {{is said to}} have similarity with the real object if the two share geometric similarity, <b>kinematic</b> similarity and dynamic similarity. The most vivid and effective type of similarity is the <b>kinematic</b> one. <b>Kinematic</b> similarity exists when the paths and velocities of moving particles of a model and its prototype are similar.|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{level of}} <b>kinematic</b> similarity is <b>kinematic</b> equivalence when, {{in the case}} of earthquake engineering, time-histories of each story lateral displacements of the model and its prototype would be the same.|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} the {{petroleum}} industry relied on measuring <b>kinematic</b> viscosity {{by means of the}} Saybolt viscometer, and expressing <b>kinematic</b> viscosity in units of Saybolt universal seconds (SUS). Other abbreviations such as SSU (Saybolt seconds universal) or SUV (Saybolt universal viscosity) are sometimes used. <b>Kinematic</b> viscosity in centistokes can be converted from SUS according to the arithmetic and the reference table provided in ASTM D 2161.|$|E
25|$|The SI unit of <b>kinematic</b> {{viscosity}} is m2/s.|$|E
25|$|A <b>kinematic</b> {{coupling}} exactly constrains all 6 {{degrees of}} freedom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kinematic</b> {{equations}} involving changing {{rates of}} acceleration are cubic.|$|E
25|$|Water at 20°C has a <b>kinematic</b> {{viscosity}} {{of about}} 10−6m2·s−1 or 1cSt.|$|E
25|$|The stokes, {{a unit of}} <b>kinematic</b> viscosity, {{is named}} after him.|$|E
25|$|NGC 5033, has a Seyfert nucleus {{displaced}} from its <b>kinematic</b> center.|$|E
25|$|A big {{difference}} between classical and quantum mechanics is that they use very different <b>kinematic</b> descriptions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} common {{instruments}} for measuring <b>kinematic</b> viscosity is the glass capillary viscometer.|$|E

25|$|Viscosity {{index is}} a measure for the change of <b>kinematic</b> {{viscosity}} with temperature. It is used to characterise lubricating oil in the automotive industry.|$|E
25|$|The free-surface {{boundary}} conditions for surface gravity waves – using a potential flow description – {{consist of a}} <b>kinematic</b> and a dynamic boundary condition.|$|E
25|$|Basically, {{the motion}} of bodies is {{described}} by their <b>kinematic</b> behavior. The dynamic behavior results from the equilibrium of applied forces {{and the rate of}} change of momentum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kinematic</b> {{constraints}} are {{constraints on}} the movement of components of a mechanical system. <b>Kinematic</b> constraints can be considered to have two basic forms, (i) constraints that arise from hinges, sliders and cam joints that define {{the construction of the}} system, called holonomic constraints, and (ii) constraints imposed on the velocity of the system such as the knife-edge constraint of ice-skates on a flat plane, or rolling without slipping of a disc or sphere in contact with a plane, which are called non-holonomic constraints. The following are some common examples.|$|E
25|$|These {{methods can}} be combined. For example, studies {{frequently}} combine EMG and kinematics to determine motor pattern, {{the series of}} electrical and <b>kinematic</b> events that produce a given movement.|$|E

25|$|This single {{equation}} {{together with}} appropriate boundary conditions describes 2D fluid flow, taking only <b>kinematic</b> viscosity as a parameter. Note that the equation for creeping flow results when {{the left side}} is assumed zero.|$|E
25|$|No Doppelgangers applies in {{both the}} Conversation Theory's <b>kinematic</b> domain (bounded by {{beginnings}} and ends) where times are commensurable and in the eternal kinetic Interactions of Actors domain where times are incommensurable.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kinematic</b> {{redundancy}} {{means that}} for a desired location of the endpoint (e.g. the hand or finger), there are many configurations of the joints that would produce the same endpoint location in space.|$|E
25|$|From joint moments, a biomechanist could infer muscle {{forces that}} would lead to those moments based on a model of bone and muscle attachments, etc., thereby {{estimating}} muscle activation from <b>kinematic</b> motion.|$|E
25|$|The cgs {{physical}} unit for <b>kinematic</b> viscosity is the stokes (St), named after George Gabriel Stokes. It is sometimes {{expressed in terms}} of centistokes (cSt). In U.S. usage, stoke is sometimes used as the singular form.|$|E
25|$|The <b>kinematic</b> {{viscosity}} {{is sometimes}} referred to as diffusivity of momentum, because it is analogous to diffusivity of heat and diffusivity of mass. It is therefore used in dimensionless numbers which compare the ratio of the diffusivities.|$|E
25|$|Because this is {{a linear}} theory, in both free-surface {{boundary}} conditions – the <b>kinematic</b> and the dynamic one, equations (3) and (4) – the value of Φ and ∂Φ/∂z at the fixed mean level z=0 is used.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{engineering}} is {{the design and}} manufacture of physical or mechanical systems, such as power and energy systems, aerospace/aircraft products, weapon systems, transportation products, engines, compressors, powertrains, <b>kinematic</b> chains, vacuum technology, vibration isolation equipment, manufacturing, and mechatronics.|$|E
25|$|For many experiments, it is {{possible}} to think of the initial and final conditions of the system as being a particle. In some cases it appears that there are potentially several spatially distinct pathways or trajectories by which a particle might pass from initial to final condition. It is an important feature of the quantum <b>kinematic</b> description that it does not permit a unique definite statement of which of those pathways is actually followed. Only the initial and final conditions are definite, and, as stated in the foregoing paragraph, they are defined only as precisely as allowed by the configuration space description or its equivalent. In every case for which a quantum <b>kinematic</b> description is needed, there is always a compelling reason for this restriction of <b>kinematic</b> precision. An example of such a reason is that for a particle to be experimentally found in a definite position, it must be held motionless; for it to be experimentally found to have a definite momentum, it must have free motion; these two are logically incompatible.|$|E
25|$|The {{kinematics}} of disk {{galaxies are}} usually determined by Hα or 21-cm emission lines, which are typically {{not present in}} lenticular galaxies due to their general lack of cool gas. Thus <b>kinematic</b> information and rough mass estimates for lenticular galaxies often comes from stellar absorption lines, which are less reliable than emission line measurements. There is also {{a considerable amount of}} difficulty in deriving accurate rotational velocities for lenticular galaxies. This is a combined effect from lenticulars having difficult inclination measurements, projection effects in the bulge-disk interface region, and the random motions of stars affecting the true rotational velocities. These effects make <b>kinematic</b> measurements of lenticular galaxies considerably more difficult compared to normal disk galaxies.|$|E
