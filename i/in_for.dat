5|$|Croyle {{started his}} first home game at Arrowhead Stadium on November 25 against the Oakland Raiders, but injured {{his back in}} the 20–17 loss.

The plan, barring injury, was for Croyle to start the remaining games of the 2007 season, so that coach Herm Edwards and his staff could better evaluate him moving forward into 2008. However, Croyle bruised his hand while trying to stop a defender from running an interception <b>in</b> <b>for</b> a touchdown and Damon Huard, who was the only active quarterback on the Chiefs' roster besides Croyle, filled <b>in</b> <b>for</b> {{the remainder of the}} game.|$|E
