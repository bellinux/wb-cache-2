We demonstrate that the commonly used combination of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>input</b> <b>output</b> and error reduction algorithm is significantly outperformed by an extension of this algorithm based on randomized overrelaxation. In most cases, this extension tremendously enhances the success rate of reconstructions for a fixed number of iterations as compared to reconstructions solely based on the traditional algorithm. The good scaling properties in terms of computational time and memory requirements of the original algorithm are not influenced by this extension. Comment: 14 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

The structured analysis method can employ IDEF (see figure), is process driven, and {{starts with a}} purpose and a viewpoint. This method identifies the overall function and iteratively divides functions into smaller functions, preserving <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs,</b> <b>controls,</b> and mechanisms necessary to optimize processes. Also known as a functional decomposition approach, it focuses on cohesion within functions and coupling between functions leading to structured data.|$|R
40|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} is a challenging {{task in the}} control of Hybrid Systems. In this work we present a methodology for detection and isolation of faults to hybrid control systems using a diagnoser. For this purpose a general framework is proposed. We discuss the notion of diagnosability of Hybrid Systems {{in the framework of}} <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Output</b> Automata (HIOA), imposing the conditions for a Hybrid System to be diagnosable. The diagnoser is designed using hybrid structure hypothesis tests. The states of the Hybrid System model reflect the normal and the failed status of the system components.

40|$|Introduction. A formal {{graphical}} {{model of the}} scientific communication process is presented in this paper. Purpose. The purpose of the model is {{to act as a}} road map for policy discussions and research concerning the process. In comparison to earlier models found in the literature this model is more detailed, hierarchical and includes more modelling constructs (activities, <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs,</b> <b>controls,</b> mechanisms). Method. logy. The modelling methodology used is IDEF 0, a process modelling method, which previously has mainly been used for business process reengineering in the manufacturing industry. The current version of the model consists of thirty-three diagrams, with 113 different activities and over 200 different <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs,</b> <b>controls</b> and mechanisms. Scope. The scope of the model is the whole communication value chain, from initial research to the assimilation of research results to improve every-day life. The model treats both informal and formal communication, as well as the publishing of data, but the major focus is on modelling the publishing and indexing of traditional peer reviewed journal articles, as well as the activities of readers to find out about them and access them. The new business models and parallel functions enabled by the Internet, such as open access journals and e-print repositories, are also in focus...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} IDEFs {{were developed}} {{since the mid-1970s}} {{for the purpose of}} enhancing communication among people who needed to decide how their existing systems were to be integrated. IDEF0 was designed to allow a graceful expansion of the description of a systems' functions through the process of function decomposition and categorization of the relations between functions (i.e., in terms of the <b>Input,</b> <b>Output,</b> <b>Control,</b> and Mechanism classification). IDEF1 was designed to allow the description of the information that an organization deems important to manage in order to accomplish its objectives.|$|R

50|$|Three ideas {{developed}} that enabled {{the reconstruction of}} real space images from diffraction patterns. The first idea was the realization by Sayre in 1952 that Bragg diffraction under-samples diffracted intensity relative to Shannon’s theorem. If the diffraction pattern is sampled at twice the Nyquist frequency (inverse of sample size) or faster it can yield a unique real space image. The second {{was an increase in}} computing power in the 1980s which enabled iterative <b>Hybrid</b> <b>input</b> <b>output</b> (HIO) algorithm for phase retrieval to optimize and extract phase information using adequately sampled intensity data with feedback. This method was introduced by Fienup in the 1980s. Finally, the development of “phase recovery” algorithms led to the first demonstration of CDI in 1999 by Miaousing a secondary image to provide low resolution information. Reconstruction methods were later {{developed that}} could remove the need for a secondary image.|$|R

40|$|The {{criteria}} for complete synchronization of strictly different chaotic systems using feedback control {{are presented in}} this paper. Complete synchronization is achieved when all {{the states in the}} slave system are synchronous with the corresponding state in the master system. We illustrate that using a single <b>input</b> and single <b>output</b> <b>control</b> scheme, the synchronization of a class of strictly different systems is obtained in partial form. To overcome this problem we show that a multiple <b>input</b> and multiple <b>output</b> <b>control</b> scheme with an equal number of <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs</b> than the order system is required in order to obtain the complete synchronization. This procedure is used to synchronize the Rössler and the Chen systems as an example.

40|$|Abstract: Lots of {{diagnosis}} approaches {{proposed in the}} literature are based in the assumption of single faults. This assumption may result to erroneous diagnosis statement in case where multiple faults occurs. Thus multiple fault diagnosis is a challenging field particularly in the control of large scale complex systems that {{can be viewed as}} hybrid systems. The main reason is that multiple faults are hard to detect because their consequences can mask or compensate to each other. The goal is to detect multiple faults as early as possible and provide a timely warning. A key issue is to prevent local faults to be developed into system failures that may cause safety hazards, stop temporarily the production and possible detrimental environment impact. In this paper we discuss the notion of multiple faults diagnosability of Hybrid Systems in the framework of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Output</b> Automata (HIOA). We present a methodology for multiple faults diagnosis imposing the conditions for a Hybrid System to be diagnosable. The proposed approach can be applied to a wide rage of systems since Hybrid Systems involve both continuous and discrete dynamics. The proposed method is tested on a two tank system. 1...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of Malaysian household consumption on the transportation sector regarding CO 2 emissions by using the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Input</b> <b>Output</b> Table from 1991, 2000, 2005 and 2010. Initially, this study calculates CO 2 emissions intensity for every sector. Results show that the sector with the highest CO 2 emission intensity was Transportation at 1. 16 (T- CO 2 /M-MyR). By using the hybrid, I-O table, the average values of the total CO 2 emission intensity caused by energy consumption in Malaysia {{were found to be}} 0. 272 (T- CO 2 /M-MyR). Transportation sector contributed the relatively high level of consumption and produces the highest amount of CO 2 emission in 1991, 2000, 2005 and 2010. Our analysis shows that continuously increasing consumption in the Transportation sector will continue to affect the environment. Thus, through encourage consumers to use hybrid or solar cars and the imposition of a carbon tax on old vehicles, owners will reduce their CO 2 emissions. By imposing a carbon tax, motor vehicle owners will strive to reduce their CO 2 emissions by consuming renewable energy or use energy saving techniques in their everyday lifestyle...|$|R

However, shifting the traditional roles and responsibilities between humans and automation for safety critical tasks must be managed carefully, otherwise the current emergent safety properties of the NAS may be disrupted. In this paper, a verification activity to assess the emergent safety properties of a clearly defined, safety critical, operational scenario that possesses tasks that can be fluidly allocated between human and automated agents is conducted. Task allocation role sets were proposed for a human-automation team performing a contingency maneuver in a reduced crew context.
