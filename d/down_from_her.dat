25|$|Georgi Bliznashki's {{government}} was announced on 5 August and began its two-month mandate {{on the next}} day. On 6 August, {{in accordance with the}} previously made agreement among the main parties, Rosen Plevneliev officially disbanded the National Parliament. On 10 August, in an open letter to the media, Krasimira Medarova stated that she had requested from the president to step <b>down</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> position as minister in charge of the preparation for the early elections in order not to impede the work of the caretaker government after her appointment faced criticism from citizen organizations, protest network and the Reformist Bloc due to a presumed conflict of interest because of her previous affiliations with GERB. Medarova's case also sparked discussions regarding the viability of a separate ministerial post for the organization of the electoral processes and caused some controversy due to creating the impression that protest network was applying undue pressure on the provisional government. BSP has publicly criticized the composition of the caretaker cabinet, viewing it as almost exclusively consisting of figures affiliated with GERB, the Reformist Bloc and protest network. The issue has been the cause of media cross-fires between the two main political parties in Bulgaria. Volen Siderov has also suggested that protest network plays a prominent role in the caretaker government.|$|E
