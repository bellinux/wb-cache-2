40|$|Abstract Background Pre-notification of an {{arriving}} trauma patient, {{given by}} transporting emergency medical unit, {{is needed in}} terms of facilitating the admitting emergency department {{to get ready for}} the patient before the patient actually arrives. In the present study we retrospectively analyzed the pre-hospital information provided by 700 consecutive pre-notification mobile phone calls in terms to asses the response of trauma team activation regard to pre-notified information such as vital signs and level of consciousness, mechanism of injury (MOI), and <b>estimated</b> <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> (EET) from the time of pre-notification phone call to arrival. Results The median EET was 15 minutes (range 0 – 80 min, interquartile range 10 – 20 min). In 11 % of the cases EET was 5 minutes or shorter. 17 % of the patients were intubated and ventilated on scene at the time pre-notification phone call took place. The most commonly notified pre-hospitally diagnosed injuries were thoracic in 75 cases (11 %), followed by unstable long bone (tibia, femur, humerus) fracture in 66 cases (9 %), and abdominal injuries in 32 cases (5 %). Trauma team was activated for 61 % of 700 pre-notified patients. MOI without clinical symptoms was the reason for team activation in 75 % of the cases. In 25 % of the cases there were pre-hospitally observed clinical injuries or abnormalities in vital parameters. Conclusion Pre-notification phone call is of a crucial importance in organizing every day activities at a busy trauma centre, but it should not take place in too much advance. In any case, a pre-notification phone call, even on short notice, gives emergency department personnel some time to prepare for the incoming patient. </p...|$|E

We identified convective system cases from TRMM microwave imagery, classifying each case {{by the system}} minimum 85 -GHz brightness temperature and by the <b>estimated</b> <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> of propagation from high terrain. The speed of the mid-level jet, {{the magnitude of the}} low-level shear, and the surface equivalent potential temperature (theta(sub e)) were greater for the intense cases compared to the non-intense cases, although the differences between the means tended to be small, less than 3 K for surface theta(sub e). Hypothesis testing of a series of commonly used intensity prediction metrics resulted in significant results only for low-level metrics such as convective available potential energy and not for any of the mid- or upper-level metrics such as 700 -hPa theta(sub e). None of the environmental variables or intensity metrics by themselves or in combination appeared to be reliable direct predictors of intensity. In the regional scale analysis, the majority of intense convective systems occurred in the surface baroclinic zone where surface theta(sub e) exceeded 344 K and the 700 -hPa zonal wind speeds were less than - 6 /ms. Fewer intense cases compared to non-intense cases were associated with African easterly wave troughs. Fewer than 25 % of our cases occurred in environments with detectable Saharan dust loads, and the results for intense and non-intense cases were similar. Our results for the regional analysis were consistent with the seasonal movement of the WAM and the intertropical front, regional differences in topography, and AEW energetics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computerized alternative to glottochronology for <b>estimating</b> <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> since parent languages diverged into daughter languages. The method, {{developed by the}} Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP) consortium, is different from glottochronology in four major respects: (1) it is automated and thus is more objective, (2) it applies a uniform analytical approach to a single database of worldwide languages, (3) {{it is based on}} lexical similarity as determined from Levenshtein (edit) distances rather than on cognate percentages, and (4) it provides a formula for date calculation that mathematically recognizes the lexical heterogeneity of individual languages, including parent languages just before their breakup into daughter languages. Automated judgments of lexical similarity for groups of related languages are calibrated with historical, epigraphic, and archaeological divergence dates for 52 language groups. The discrepancies between estimated and calibration dates are found to be on average 29 % as large as the estimated dates themselves, a figure that does not differ significantly among language families.

40|$|Abstract Stable isotope {{analysis}} {{has become an}} impor-tant tool in studies of trophic food webs and animal feeding patterns. When animals undergo rapid dietary shifts due to migration, metamorphosis, or other rea-sons, the isotopic composition of their tissues begins changing to reflect that of their diet. This can occur both {{as a result of}} growth and metabolic turnover of existing tissue. Tissues vary in their rate of isotopic change, with high turnover tissues such as liver changing rapidly, while relatively low turnover tissues such as bone change more slowly. A model is outlined that uses the varying isotopic changes in multiple tissues as a chemical clock to <b>estimate</b> the <b>time</b> <b>elapsed</b> since a diet shift, and the magnitude of the isotopic shift in the tissues at the new equilibrium. This model was tested using published re-sults from controlled feeding experiments on a bird and a mammal. For the model to be effective, the tissues utilized must be sufficiently different in their turnover rates. The model did a reasonable job of <b>estimating</b> <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> and equilibrial isotopic changes, except when the time since the diet shift was less than {{a small fraction of the}} half-life of the slowest turnover tissue or greater than 5 – 10 half-lives of the slowest turnover tis-sue. Sensitivity analyses independently corroborated that model estimates became unstable at extremely short and long sample times due to the effect of random measurement error. Subject to some limitations, the model may be useful for studying the movement and behavior of animals changing isotopic environments, such as anadromous fish, migratory birds, animals undergoing metamorphosis, or animals changing diets because of shifts in food abundance or competitive interactions...|$|R

40|$|Question: How do we {{retrospectively}} estimate durations on {{the order}} of minutes? Sahakyan and Smith (2013) found that mental context change during an interval led to overestimation of that interval’s duration. Hypothesis: To <b>estimate</b> <b>elapsed</b> <b>time,</b> people compare their mental context {{at the start of the}} interval to their mental context at the end of the interval. Time estimates are proportional to the distance between these mental contexts. Approach: We used neural activity patterns as a proxy for mental context (Manns, Howard, Eichenbaum, 2007; Jenkins & Ranganath, 2010), and used the distance between these patterns to predict time judgments. Experiment: 18 subjects listened to a 25 -minute story in the fMRI scanner. After the scan, subjects estimated the duration of 43 intervals from the story.

Evidence is presented indicating that approximately 4 % of STRP loci separated by < 4. 0 cM are in LD.

In this research, development of forensic blow fly, Hemipyrellia ligurriens (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Calliphoridae), based on larval cephalopharyngeal skeleton length, was described for the first time. Development of H. ligurriens was represented by body length and cephalopharyngeal skeleton consisting anterodorsal process to dorsal cornu (ADP-DC), anterodorsal process to ventral cornu (ADP-VC) and dorsal cornu to ventral cornu (DC-VC). The cephalopharyngeal skeletons proportionally developed with larval body development, but periods of plateau existed between 0 and 10  h and 24 – 30  h, suggesting ecdysis periods of larvae. Data measurements were more consistent in cephalopharyngeal skeleton length than in larval body length, and there were strong positive significant correlations, r[*]>[*] 0.85 (p[*]<[*] 0.05).

On the estimate above given, founded on the dates of phases of high excentricity, we shall arrive at about four million years for the Tertiary epoch, and sixteen million years for the <b>time</b> <b>elapsed</b> since the Cambrian, according to Lyell, or sixty millions according to Dana. The estimate arrived at from the rate of denudation and deposition (twenty-eight million years) is nearly midway between these, and it is, at all events, satisfactory that the various measures result in figures of the same order of magnitude, which is all one can expect when discussing so difficult and exceedingly speculative a subject.|$|R
40|$|A recent study, using remote sensing, {{provided}} {{evidence that a}} seafloor shoal influenced the 2010 calving event of the Mertz Ice Tongue (MIT), by partially grounding the MIT several years earlier. In this paper, we start by proposing a method to calculate firn air content (FAC) around Mertz from seafloor-touching icebergs. Our calculations indicate the FAC around Mertz region as 4. 87 [*]±[*] 1. 31  m. We then design an indirect method of using freeboard and sea surface height data extracted from ICESat/GLAS, FAC, and relatively accurate seafloor topography to detect grounding sections of the MIT between 2002 and 2008 and analyze the process of grounding prior to the calving event. By synthesizing remote sensing data, we {{point out that the}} grounding position was localized northeast of the Mertz ice front close to the Mertz Bank. The grounding outlines of the tongue caused by the Mertz Bank are extracted as well. From 2002 to 2008, the grounding area increased and the grounding became more pronounced. Additionally, the ice tongue could not effectively climb over the Mertz Bank in following the upstream ice flow direction and that is why MIT rotated clockwise after late 2002. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the area-increasing trend of the MIT changed little after calving (∼[*]  36  km 2  a − 1), thus allowing us to use remote sensing to <b>estimate</b> the <b>elapsed</b> <b>time</b> until the MIT can reground on and be bent by the shoal. This period is approximately 70  years. Our observations suggest that the calving of the MIT is a cyclical process controlled by the presence of the shallow Mertz Bank location and the flow rate of the tongue. This calving cycle also explains the cyclic variations in sea-surface conditions around the Mertz detected by earlier studies...|$|R
40|$|Anticipatory eye {{movements}} are often evoked by the temporal expectation of an upcoming event. Temporal expectation {{is based on}} implicit timing about when a future event could occur. Implicit timing emerges from observed temporal regularities in a changing stimulus without any voluntary <b>estimate</b> of <b>elapsed</b> <b>time,</b> unlike explicit timing. The neural bases of explicit and implicit timing are likely different. It {{has been shown that}} the basal ganglia (BG) {{play a central role in}} explicit timing. In order to determine the influence of BG in implicit timing, we investigated the influence of early Parkinson’s disease (PD) and aging on the latency of anticipatory eye movements. We hypothesized that a deficit of implicit timing should yield inadequate temporal expectations, and consequently abnormally timed anticipatory eye movements compared with age-matched controls. To test this hypothesis, we used an oculomotor paradigm where anticipation of a salient target event plays a central role. Participants pursued a visual target that moved along a circular path at a constant velocity. After a randomly short (1200 ms) or long (2400 ms) forward path, the target reversed direction, returned to its starting position and stopped. Target motion reversal caused an abrupt "slip" of the pursued target image on the retina and was a particularly salient event evoking anticipatory eye movements. Anticipatory eye movements were less frequent in PD patients. However, the timing of anticipation of target motion reversal was statistically similar in PD patients and control subjects. Other eye movements showed statistically significant differences between PD and controls, but these differences could be attributed to other factors. We conclude that all anticipatory eye {{movements are}} not similarly impaired in PD and that implicit timing of salient events seems largely unaffected by this disease. The results support the hypothesis that implicit and explicit timing are differently affected by BG dysfunction...|$|R
