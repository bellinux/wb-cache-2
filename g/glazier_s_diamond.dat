40|$|Objectives: {{this paper}} aims to {{understand}} the competitiveness determinants of agro-processing industry in Cambodia, to identify areas for policy implications, and to assess the suitability of Porter 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>diamond</b> model in analyzing agroprocessing industry. Literature review: four national competitiveness analytical frameworks are discussed, and Porter 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>diamond</b> model is selected as the main analytical framework. Its determinancy is improved by the variables/indicators from WEF 9 ̆ 2 s global competitiveness report, Hämäläinen 9 ̆ 2 s systemic framework of economic competitiveness and growth, and IPS 9 ̆ 2 s national competitiveness report. Methodology: the study is largely based on cross-sectional secondary data both quantitative and qualitative, which were sourced from WEF 9 ̆ 2 s global competitiveness report, World Bank, ADB, FAO, UN organs, Royal Government of Cambodia, and other national/international organizations. Findings: majority of the determinants negatively affect the competitiveness of Cambodian agro-processing industry. The strengths of this industry were its significance in Cambodian economy, competitive environment and geographical concentration. However, these were hampered by insufficient skilled workers, limited technological readiness, poor physical infrastructure, limited access to finance, weak demand condition, insufficient supporting and related industries, lack of government support, prevalent corruption, and institutional inefficiency. Recommendations: seven policy implications are proposed aiming to improve the availability and quality of human resources, develop more financial products for SMEs, enhance firms 9 ̆ 2 technological readiness, extend vertical integration in agro-processing value chain, increase diversity in primary agricultural production, improve physical infrastructure, undertake significant administrative reforms. Conclusion: the dynamics of Porter 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>diamond</b> model shows that the determinants work together to develop and sustain the competitiveness. Weaknesses in some critical factors may significantly affect the industry, e. g. the lack of human resources and poor physical infrastructure. The study had some limitations in the validity of data and firm-level analysis. This indicates that future studies need to consider {{using a combination of}} both secondary and primary data collection and in-depth analysis at firm level...|$|R

National Development Programme of 2003 mandated the {{cluster approach}} in the development of small and medium industries. Presidential Regulation No. 07 of 2005 states that national industrial development focused on strengthening and growth of the ten priority industrial clusters. The research is aimed to formulated strategy of cashew ind ustry cluster development in East Java. The data used are primary and secondary data, analyzed using Porter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Diamond.</b> The research was conducted in S umenep, Sampang, and Bangkalan, using the survey in March - April 2011. Data analysis was conducted descriptively using Porter 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Diamond</b> Model. The results showed that the cashew industry cluster in East Java has not been going well as expected. The linkage between upstream and downstream industries are still weak, so is the quality of the products produced. Classical problems which have obstructed the development of the cashew industry in this region are crop productivity, product quality, regulatory and policy difficult to implement, still can not fully overcome. Determinant factor is the key to successful development of industrial clusters is the availability of raw cashew nuts, infrastructure, government policy, the interaction between players in the industry, the availability of supporting institutions, upstream and downstream industries, product demand conditions and the availability of foreign investors. Therefore, the handling can not be done spatially, must be supported by all sides and done in an integrated way. Cashew cluster industry development strategy needs to be done by improving government policy (regulation of markets for industrial products cashew, cashew export tax implementation, mandatory SNI nut products, improvement of the domestic market); strengthening the upstream and downstream industries (productivity and quality of cashew, increase the ability of the cashew processing industry); and optimization of the interaction between the core industry by supporting industry and other related institutions (farmers 2 ̆ 7 cashew, cashew industry, food industry and beverage, industrial equipment & machinery, exporters, traders, government agencies, research and development institutes, associations industry, transportation and financial services/banking) ...|$|R

Each model follows a common format utilizing core drama therapy processes (P. Jones, 1996) designed to expand social-emotional competencies (A. Bandura, 1997) through "rehearsals for living" (D. Diamond, 2007). This investigation also highlights interviews with 5 drama therapists who share successes and challenges when working in the school setting. Although drama therapy is perceived as an intervention service, this author advocates for broader applications that would promote drama therapy as prevention. Recommendations for future anti-bullying programs include greater focus on empowering the bystander, assessing underlying causes of maladapted behaviors (including PTSD), and developing whole school approaches that offer ongoing workshops. This research underscores the need for early intervention to help children at-risk (S. Goldbaum, W. M. Craig, D. 1. Pepler & J.
