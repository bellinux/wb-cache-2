In particular, controlling transmissible disease, such as SARS, is deemed <b>important</b> <b>at</b> international airports.

5|$|Paddington was {{extended}} again from 1930 to 1934. Platforms 2 to 11 were extended past the Bishop's Road bridge {{and a new}} parcel depot was built. Suburban services, which had never been considered <b>important</b> <b>at</b> Paddington, were increased as new housing estates in the Home Counties started being built. Bishop's Road station was rebuilt, giving an extra four platforms to Paddington (Nos.13–16) and providing a new ticket office and entrance for suburban services next to the bridge. A public address system was introduced in 1936. By this time, around 22,000 parcels a day were being forwarded from Paddington, with the Royal Mail service processing around 4,500 mailbags and 2,400 parcel bags every day.|$|E
5|$|Significant Roman finds include {{parts of}} shops and houses {{that would have}} fronted onto Ermine Street, down which Roman armies marched {{to and from the}} Legionary Fortress at Lincoln. The city of Lincoln was very <b>important</b> <b>at</b> that time, {{probably}} the capital of the late Roman Province of Flavia Caesariensis. Evidence suggests that Navenby was a significant staging point along Ermine Street. The Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village, and a possible Romano-British temple and burial sites have been unearthed in the area. A 2009 archaeological dig uncovering a road, building foundations and Roman graves along with pottery and coins, showed Navenby to be a Roman Service Station.|$|E

25|$|After the British {{acquisition}} of Hong Kong Island in 1842, the manufacturing industry started to develop. Most factories {{were limited to}} small workshops producing hand-made goods. Primitive methods, techniques and facilities were used for production. The productivity was low and the manufacturing industry was {{not as important as}} the re-exportation industry, which was the most <b>important</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E
25|$|This is an {{essential}} difference. In dimensions higher than 4, fixing {{the scale of the}} gradient term means that the coefficient of the H4 term is less and less <b>important</b> <b>at</b> longer and longer wavelengths. The dimension at which nonquadratic contributions begin to contribute is known as the critical dimension. In the Ising model, the critical dimension is 4.|$|E

25|$|To {{find the}} magnetization, fix the scaling of H so that λ is one. Now the field H has {{dimension}} −d/4, so that H4ddx is dimensionless, and Z has dimension 2nbsp&−nbsp&d/2.

25|$|A {{comparison}} of the lexical content can find more subtle differences between the languages. For example, Occitan has 128 synonyms related to cultivated land, 62 for wetlands, and 75 for sunshine (Géo). The language went through an eclipse during the Industrial Revolution, as the vocabulary of the countryside became less <b>important.</b> <b>At</b> the same time, it was disparaged as a patois. Nevertheless, Occitan has also incorporated new words into its lexicon to describe the modern world. The Occitan word for web is oèb, for example.|$|E
