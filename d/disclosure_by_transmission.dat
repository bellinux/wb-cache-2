The findings show sustainability <b>disclosures</b> <b>by</b> banks that participate in the global reporting initiative (GRI) are significantly higher than <b>disclosures</b> <b>by</b> those banks that have not participated in the GRI. Amongst those banks that {{have participated in the}} GRI there is a higher rate of <b>disclosure</b> <b>by</b> externally assured banks than by non-externally assured banks. Among the GRI participating banks, there was significant variation of disclosures between countries. <b>Disclosures</b> <b>by</b> Australian banks appeared to be significantly higher than <b>disclosures</b> <b>by</b> banks in any other countries under observation. The findings are discussed from a moral legitimacy perspective. Consistent with this view, the banks under study were responsive to the GRI, which is seen as an influential actor that shapes and reflects the expectations of the broader community. However, the role of the GRI in minimising country differences in <b>disclosure</b> <b>by</b> banks is not significant...|$|R

30|$|Despite having {{explored}} significant {{practical implications}} {{in the field}} of nonfinancial <b>disclosure</b> <b>by</b> the banks in India, this study has few limitations also. In the present study the non financial performance <b>disclosure</b> <b>by</b> the banks for FY 2015 to 2017 has been analysed but the finding might change over the period of time. Therefore, longitudinal study may provide more insights into the trends in sustainable reporting practices of Indian banking sector. The Indian banking sector in addition to PSBs, private sector banks also include regional rural banks (RRBs) and foreign banks, which although forms small representation were not considered in the study. Since the sustainability reporting by the banks in India is very low, this study has taken into consideration the broad indicators of various dimensions of sustainability reporting. The study only reflects {{the nature and extent of}} the sustainability <b>disclosure</b> <b>by</b> commercial banks operating in India. The economic indicators of sustainability were also neglected in the present study. These issues could be addressed in future researches.|$|R

Implementing corporate reforms, however, is significantly difficult than framing those reforms. There are many challenges in successful implementation and effective enforcement of reforms such as local inhibitions and comprehensive rules (Afsharipour, 2009), lack of availability of qualified independent directors (Malik and Nehra, 2014), underdeveloped external monitoring systems and weak and multiple regulatory norms (Rajharia and Sharma, 2014 a; Rajharia and Sharma, 2014 b).
