She had been about to board an El Al flight from New York to Tel Aviv via London. The bag had been packed by her Jordanian fiancé Nizar Hindawi, who had said he would join her in Israel where they were to be married.|$|E
25|$|Sampling via deep {{trawling}} {{indicates that}} lanternfish account {{for as much}} as 65% of all deep sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550–660 million metric tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world's oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladders, giving the appearance of a <b>false</b> <b>bottom.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 1941, {{well before}} {{the outcome of the}} war was safely predictable, Spinelli and fellow {{prisoner}} Ernesto Rossi completed the Ventotene Manifesto, eventually entitled Per un’Europa libera e unita ("For a Free and United Europe. A Draft Manifesto"), which argued that, if the fight against the fascist powers was successful, it would be in vain if it merely led to the re-establishment of the old European system of sovereign nation-states in shifting alliances. This would inevitably lead to war again. The document called {{for the establishment of a}} European federation by the democratic powers after the war. Because of a need for secrecy and a lack of proper materials at the time, the Manifesto was written on cigarette papers, concealed in the <b>false</b> <b>bottom</b> of a tin box and smuggled to the mainland by Ursula Hirschmann. It was then circulated through the Italian Resistance, and was later adopted as the programme of the Movimento Federalista Europeo, which Spinelli, Rossi and some 20 others established, as soon as they were able to leave their internment camp. The founding meeting was held in clandestinity in Milan on the 27/28 August 1943.|$|E

500|$|Casting {{director}} Rick Millikan was {{tasked with}} finding a suitable actor {{to play the}} part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for [...] "a small all-Indian man with no legs." [...] Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a <b>false</b> <b>bottom</b> was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct [...] "squeak" [...] that Paul Rabwin described as [...] "creepy". He noted, [...] "There was a squeak that had to let us know that it was him. It had to scare us [...] Finally we came up with what we thought was just the right squeak and John [...] said 'Okay, that's the one.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Lutgendorf, {{a scholar}} at the University of Iowa, has stated that while {{the theme of the}} {{conflict}} between passionate individual love and family duty may be very common in Hindi film making, with endless cinematic permutations, K. Asif's [...] "excessive elaboration of the theme remains in a class by itself." [...] Further, Emperor Akbar struggles between his personal desires and his duties to the nation. Ashis Nandy noted that apart from the conflict between Akbar and his son, there is also an [...] "unwritten alliance" [...] between Akbar and Bahar that compounds the problems of Anarkali. He also thought it highlighted the [...] "idea of justice and the notion of unconditional love" [...] to uphold tradition. The song [...] "Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya" [...] sung by Anarkali was an indication of her defiance of societal norms. A major difference from the original story is that while the earlier Anarakali films based on Imtiaz Ali Taj's story ended as tragedies, K. Asif created a relatively happy ending in that Akbar gives amnesty to Anarkali by allowing her to escape through a secret route of tunnels below a <b>false</b> <b>bottom</b> of her prison wall, although his son is made to suffer in believing her to have perished.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1982, new {{documents}} were found {{hidden in the}} <b>false</b> <b>bottom</b> of a suitcase belonging to Gelli's daughter at Fiumicino airport in Rome. The {{documents were}} [...] entitled [...] "Memorandum sulla situazione italiana" [...] (Memorandum on the Italian situation) [...] "Piano di rinascita democratica" [...] (Plan of Democratic Rebirth) and are seen as the political programme of P2. According to these documents, the main enemies of Italy were the Italian Communist Party (PCI) and the trade unions. These had to be isolated and cooperation with the communists (the second biggest party in Italy {{and one of the}} largest in Europe), which was proposed in the historic compromise by Aldo Moro, needed to be disrupted.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{hypothesised}} that several microbial processes contribute to mucilage formation and transformation. However, to date, {{none of these}} mechanisms have been consistently tested using different types of mucilage. We investigated the biochemical composition and the microbial activities occurring in 9 different types of mucilage aggregates (macroflocs, stringers, cobwebs, ribbons, stringers/cobwebs clouds, big creamy surface layer, <b>false</b> <b>bottoms</b> and anoxic <b>false</b> <b>bottoms)</b> collected during summer 2000, 2002 and 2003 in the Adriatic Sea. Larger and aged aggregates, characterized by the accumulation of carbohydrate and a low lipid fraction, displayed significant biochemical differences when compared with younger aggregates. Prokaryote abundance, C production and extracellular enzymatic activities increased from small to medium-sized aggregates (corresponding approximately to mid life span) while they decreased in larger (and aged) aggregates. The highest prokaryotic C production and enzymatic activities were coupled with highest viral abundance. In mucilage displaying the highest viral abundance a reduced incorporation of enzymatically degraded C into prokaryote biomass was observed. This result suggests a potential involvement of viruses in the impairment of the microbial loop functioning in marine aggregates. Applying a multivariate analysis to the microbial variables, 3 stages of mucilage life span can be identified: (1) an early stage characterized by a large prokaryote colonization of the aggregate and DOM accumulation; (2) a mature stage characterized by a decreased capability of incorporating degraded C into prokaryote biomass and high viral abundance and (3) an aged stage characterized by the decrease in both viral and prokaryote abundance and prokaryote activity. These results provide {{new insights into the}} microbial ecology of marine aggregates and the processes influencing their life span...|$|R

60|$|Before closing this chapter, {{a word or}} two must be said {{descriptive}} of {{that fell}} foe to ships of war, the torpedo, though space demands that our reference should be brief. Almost all modern ships of war are constructed with <b>false</b> <b>bottoms,</b> designed especially to protect them against torpedoes. There are many different forms of torpedoes, employed in a variety of ways. A torpedo may be described as a submarine exploding apparatus. It may contain from thirty to as much as five hundred pounds of gunpowder; and the explosion is effected either by means of electricity, or by a spring and a detonating substance when the engine comes in contact with a ship. Some kinds of torpedoes rest {{on the bottom of the}} sea, while others are anchored and float suspended in the water. If a vessel strikes against one of these terrible engines, she is either at once blown to splinters, or a rent is made in her bottom which causes her rapidly to sink.|$|R

Ryan married Agnes Harding from Solohead, County Tipperary in 1918. In that year they also opened a shop in Parnell Street, Dublin.

During the Irish War of Independence the shop was a haven for members of the Irish Republican Army seeking refuge from British [...] "Black and Tans" [...] and later for Republicans during the post-Treaty conflicts. Among the Irish nationalists harboured within his Parnell Street shop was Seán Treacy who established a workshop where he put <b>false</b> <b>bottoms</b> on butter boxes to conceal dispatches and ammunition for IRA operations. Ryan transported the boxes by horse and cart to Kingsbridge Station. It was said he had [...] "a face of such truly angelic innocence that no one could have guessed the subversive nature of his freight".
