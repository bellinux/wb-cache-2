40|$|The overall energy {{efficiency}} of the production of pure hydrogen using the pyrolysis oil driven steam-iron process is evaluated for different process conditions. The process consists of a two-step process (reduction with pyrolysis oil, oxidation with steam) from which pure hydrogen can be obtained, without purification steps. An optimum {{energy efficiency}} of 53 % is achieved when the equilibrium conversion is obtained in the redox cycle at 800 °C. When assuming chemical equilibrium, increasing the process temperature results in a low process efficiency due to {{a large amount of}} unreacted steam that needs to be condensed to separate the hydrogen product. Using experimental data in the process simulation, a high-energy efficiency is obtained at 920 °C (39 %) compared with the efficiency at 800 °C (29 %). This is caused by the low conversion in the reduction at 800 °C. Improving the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>material</b> to enhance the reduction with pyrolysis oil at 800 °C, is therefore suggested...|$|E

The mixed solution of ferratrane precursor and de-ionized water was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and kept at a constant temperature of 200 °C for 6 h. The as-prepared powder was annealed at 500 °C for 2 h under an ambient atmosphere. The as-prepared and annealed samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The as-prepared powder has a single phase of cubic magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and then can be transformed into rhombohedral hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3) by annealing at 500 °C for 2 h. The electrochemical properties of the resultant α-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge in a three-electrode cell. The α-Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles showed the highest specific capacitance of 532. 80 F/g at the current density of 1 A/g and the highest energy density of 74. 00 Wh/kg at the power density of 0. 50 kW/kg...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} {{performed}} {{to determine if the}} addition of iron oxides throughout biosand filter (BSF) media would increase virus removal due to adsorption. The proposed mechanism is electrostatic adsorption of negatively charged virion particles to positively charged iron oxides formed during the corrosion of zerovalent iron. Initial tests conducted using continuous flow, small-scale glass columns showed high MS 2 bacteriophage removal in an iron-amended sand column (5 -log 10) compared to a sand only column (0. 5 -log 10) over 20 pore volumes. Additionally, two experiments with a column containing iron particles revealed 4 and 5 log 10 removal of rotavirus in the presence of 20 mg/L total organic carbon. Full-scale BSFs with iron particles removed > 4 -log 10 MS 2 {{for the duration of the}} experiment (287 days), while BSF with steel wool removed > 4 -log 10 MS 2 for the first 160 days. Plug flow for the BSF was shown to depend on uniformity between the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>material</b> and sand media grains. The results suggest that the duration of effective virus removal by iron-amended biosand filtration depends on source water conditions and the quantity and composition of iron material added. Overall, this study provides evidence that iron-amended BSFs may advance the field of point-of-use technologies and bring relief to millions of people suffering from waterborne diseases...|$|E

40|$|Uterine fibroids are {{the most}} common tumour of the {{reproductive}} tract in women of reproductive age. Although they are benign tumours that are often asymptomatic, they may cause debilitating symptoms in many women, such as abnormal uterine bleeding, abdominal pain, increased abdominal girth, urinary frequency, constipation, pregnancy loss, dyspareunia, and in some cases infertility. Several approaches are available for the treatment of uterine fibroids. These include pharmacologic options, such as hormonal therapies and gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists; surgical approaches, such as hysterectomy, myomectomy; myolysis, laparoscopic uterine artery occlusion, uterine artery embolisation and magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery. The choice of approach may be dictated by factors such as the patient’s desire to become pregnant in the future, the importance of uterine preservation, symptom severity, and tumour characteristics. There is however, no widely agreed therapeutic strategy. There is a widespread view that hysterectomy is overused in the UK; the Chief Medical Officer in his annual report ‘On the state of public health’ in 2005, highlighted that hysterectomy in younger women is associated with complications, hospital stays, procedure-related interference with normal life and is costly. In addition he outlined the need {{to reduce the number of}} hysterectomies. This, along with the change in cultural attitudes amongst patients, who are becoming increasingly reluctant to undergo these conventional invasive procedures, has increased the need for new treatment options. Ideally new treatment options for uterine fibroids would be minimally invasive, have long-term data demonstrating efficacy and safety, have minimal or no incidence of fibroid recurrence, be easy to perform, preserve fertility, and be cost effective. New treatment approaches are under investigation, with the goals of being effective, safe, and less invasive. MRgFUS is a non-invasive thermo-ablative hybrid technique which uses both MR and ultrasound to destroy tumours. It is an outpatient procedure, which avoids the need for an anaesthetic, has a short recovery period, and is uterine sparing. The main objective of this work was to set out the rationale for using Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) for the treatment of uterine fibroids. In order to achieve this aim, four main bodies of work are necessary; 1) Identifying patient selection criteria and investigating mitigating techniques to increase the pool of women for whom this treatment can be offered. 2) Investigating a method designed to overcome the problem of safely treating women with abdominal scars for whom this treatment can cause potential morbidity. 3) Investigating the potentiality of using MRgFUS to prolong the tumour shrinkage effect of GnRH analogue injections. 4) Investigating the safety of MRgFUS in treating symptomatic women who wish to preserve fertility. Results: the first aim of this project was to identify patient selection criteria and to investigate methods to widen the selection criteria. In our retrospective review it was found that 74 % of women presenting were deemed technically suitable to proceed with treatment and several mitigating techniques that solved current technical difficulties were identified and allowed for less restrictive MRgFUS selection criteria for treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids. These less restrictive criteria are expected to expand the pool of patients for whom MRgFUS is a viable treatment option for uterine fibroid symptoms. The second aim was to identify a method of overcoming the problem of treating women with previous abdominal scars safely. We identified a unique method of highlighting the scar by painting it with a paramagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>material</b> which clearly outlined the scar on MR scanning allowing complete avoidance of the scar using MR guidance. In this small pilot study, all women were treated safely with no skin burns. The third aim of this project looked at the potentiality of prolonging the shrinkage effect of GnRH analogues by following a course of 3 injections with MRgFUS treatment. In this prospective study of fifty women, there was a 50 % reduction in the mean symptoms severity score at 6 months which was maintained for 24 months post treatment. There was an average reduction in target fibroid volume which was maintained for 24 months. The final aim of the project was to investigate the safety of using MRgFUS as a treatment option for those women who wished to preserve their fertility. In this multicentre international study, One hundred and sixteen women were recruited from five centres. There were sixty four reported pregnancies in Sixty one women, with 30 completed deliveries. There were no reported cases of uterine rupture, premature labour, abnormal placentation or placental abruption. Conclusion: There is a growing body of data from clinical trials and more than four years of clinical experience to validate the safety and efficacy of MRgFUS for the treatment of uterine fibroids. MRgFUS is a totally non-invasive outpatient procedure that is not associated with the typical surgical risks of bleeding, infection and has minimal recovery time. Additionally, the procedure allows women to address their symptoms whilst preserving the uterus. Consequently, MRgFUS is an alternative treatment option for suitable patients who have refused other interventions due to concerns about lost productivity, risks of surgical complications or future fertility.

40|$|The need to {{stabilise}} or even {{reduce the}} production of anthropogenic CO 2 makes the capture of CO 2 during energy generation from carbonaceous fuels, e. g. coal or biomass, necessary for the future. For hydrogen, an environmentally-benign energy vector whose sole combustion product is water, to become a major energy source, it must be produced in an efficient, CO 2 -neutral manner. A process, which uses a packed bed of iron and its oxides, viz. Fe, Fe 0 : 947 O, Fe 3 O 4 and Fe 2 O 3, has been formulated to produce separate, pure streams of H 2 and CO 2. The process is exothermic and has the following stages: 1. Reduction of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 0 : 947 O or Fe in syngas (CO + H 2) from gasifying coal or biomass. This stage generates pure CO 2 for sequestration, once the water has been condensed. 2. Subsequent oxidation of Fe or Fe 0 : 947 O to Fe 3 O 4 using steam. This stage generates H 2 of sufficient purity for use in polymeric membrane fuel cells. 3. Further oxidation of Fe 3 O 4 to Fe 2 O 3 using air to return the oxide to step (1). It was shown that reduction to Fe 0 : 947 O in step (1) gave stable yields of H 2 in step (2) after 40 cycles, near those predicted from reaction stoichiometry. By contrast, reduction to Fe, rather than Fe 0 : 947 O, in step (1) gave low levels of H 2 in step (2) after just 10 cycles. This demonstrates that modifying the iron oxide is unnecessary unless reduction to Fe is performed. Wet-impregnation of Fe 2 O 3 was performed with salts of Al, Cr and Mg or with tetraethyl orthosilicate for Si to give loadings of 1 - 30 mol % of the additive element. The addition of Al stabilised the quantity of H 2 produced when the sample was reduced to Fe. Using a sol-gel method, composite particles with diff erent mass ratios of Fe 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 were prepared. For reduction to Fe over 40 cycles, 40 wt. % Al 2 O 3 was required to give stable conversions near 75 % of that expected from reaction stoichiometry. Prior to this research, it had been assumed that the alumina acted as an inert support. However, this was shown to be incorrect since the formation of FeO. Al 2 O 3 was quantitatively confirmed using X-ray diffraction. The presence of the compound, FeO. Al 2 O 3, is significant since it reduces the loss in internal surface area but binds reactive iron, two contradictory e ects for {{the production of}} H 2. The production of separate streams of pure H 2 and CO 2 from solid fuels, lignite and subbituminous coal, was demonstrated. Pure H 2 with [CO] ~< 50 ppmv and [SO 2] ~~ 0 ppmv was produced from a low-rank coal, showing that the process is e cacious with an impure fuel. Contaminants found in syngas which are gaseous above 273 K apparently do not adversely affect the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>material</b> or purity of the hydrogen. Subsequent oxidation of the Fe 3 O 4 with air, step (3), removed sulphurous and carbonaceous contaminants deposited during reduction, generated useful heat and did not lead to a decrease in the H 2 yield in step (2). It is therefore recommended that step (3) be included in the process. Rates of reaction are reported for the reduction of iron oxide particles by a mixture of CO, CO 2 and N 2. Importantly, rates were investigated over multiple cycles. Reduction of either Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 or of Fe 3 O 4 to Fe 0 : 947 O was found to be first-order in CO. With the particle sizes used, the rates of reduction were controlled by intrinsic chemical kinetics. Activation energies and pre-exponential factors are reported. The rates were used to simulate, satisfactorily, the reduction of a packed bed of iron oxide. The rate of reduction was doubled by the addition of 1 mol. % Ce to the granulated iron oxide. The overall rate was shown to be dependent on the active surface area of the iron oxide. A lattice Boltzmann model, which incorporates hydrodynamics, mass transport and reaction, was developed. The composition of the solid changed with time. Quantitative agreement between the model and experiments for the reduction of a single particle of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4 in CO was achieved. Additionally, the model correctly predicted a sharp front in the CO concentration for reduction of a packed bed of Fe 2 O 3 to Fe 3 O 4...|$|E

These ligands were utilized to functionalized nanoparticles with different cores, including metallic (Au), semiconductor (CdSe and CdSe/ZnS), and magnetic (FePt and <b>iron</b> <b>oxide)</b> <b>materials.</b> Using these surface tailored nanoparticle scaffolds, surface binding of nanoparticles with enzyme α-chymotrypsin (ChT) was systematically studied. The ChT-nanoparticle interaction was characterized as electrostatically driven and reversible. Importantly, control over ChT structure and function was demonstrated on three levels: no binding, binding and denaturation, and binding without denaturation, dictated by the nanoparticle surface monolayer composition. The monolayer of nanoparticles can be tailored to not only control protein (ChT) -nanoparticle interactions, but also impact enzyme-substrate interactions, which results in enhanced ChT chemoselectivity towards substrates with different charges. In addition, the PEGylated nanoparticles have been explored to stabilize enzyme to stresses found in real-world bio-catalysis. The combination of the unique attributes of the nanoparticle cores and {{the function of the}} monolayer periphery provides numerous opportunities in creation of multi-functional nano-materials that are useful in biological and material applications. ...|$|R

The platform is a tungsten-based CMOS micro- hotplate that {{has been shown to}} be stable for over two thousand hours at a high temperature (600 °C) in a form of accelerated life test. The tungsten-doped lanthanum <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> was deposited on the micro-hotplate as a slurry with terpineol using a syringe, dried and annealed. Preliminary gas testing was done and the material shows response to ethanol vapour. These results are promising and we believe that this combination of a robust CMOS micro-hotplate and a good sensing material can form the basis for a commercial CMOS gas sensor...|$|R

It was found that pure Fe(3) O(4) exhibited the highest activity with the reaction rate constant at 0. 959 min(- 1). Identified degradation products with lower chlorinated benzenes suggest a stepwise hydrodechlorination was occurring for the degradation of HCB on the synthesized Fe(3) O(4). The characterization of the synthesized <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> after reaction indicates the Fe(3) O(4) phase was partially transformed into alpha-Fe(2) O(3) phase and in return accelerated progress of hydrodechlorination of HCB. The superior performance of as-prepared Fe(3) O(4) {{could be attributed to}} its structural feature such as surface area and pore structure, as well as its phase transformation during HOB degradation...|$|R
40|$|Magnetotactic {{bacteria}} synthesize highly uniform intracellular magnetite nanoparticles {{through the}} action of several key biomineralization proteins. These proteins are present in a unique lipid-bound organelle (the magnetosome) that functions as a nanosized reactor in which the particle is formed. A master regulator protein of nanoparticle formation, magnetosome membrane specific F (MmsF), was recently discovered. This predicted integral membrane protein is essential for controlling the monodispersity of the nanoparticles in Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB- 1. Two MmsF homologs sharing over 60 % sequence identity, but showing no apparent impact on particle formation, were also identified in the same organism. We have cloned, expressed, and used these three purified proteins as additives in synthetic magnetite precipitation reactions. Remarkably, these predominantly α-helical membrane spanning proteins are unusually highly stable and water-soluble because they self-assemble into spherical aggregates with an average diameter of 36 nm. The MmsF assembly appears {{to be responsible for}} a profound level of control over particle size and <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (magnetite) homogeneity in chemical precipitation reactions, consistent with its indicated role in vivo. The assemblies of its two homologous proteins produce imprecise various <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>materials,</b> which is a striking difference for proteins that are so similar to MmsF both in sequence and hierarchical structure. These findings show MmsF is a significant, previously undiscovered, protein additive for precision magnetite nanoparticle production. Furthermore, the self-assembly of these proteins into discrete, soluble, and functional “proteinosome” structures could lead to advances in fields ranging from membrane protein production to drug delivery applications...|$|R
40|$|In these days, {{nanomaterials}} {{are applied}} {{in a variety}} of biomedical applications including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cell imaging, drug delivery, and cell separation. Most MRI contrast agents affect the longitudinal relaxation time (T 1) and transverse relaxation time (T 2) of water protons in the tissue and result in increased positive or negative contrast. Here, we report the optimization of r 1 (1 /T 1) or r 2 (1 /T 2) relaxivity dynamics with diameter controlled gadolinium oxide nanocrystals (2 ~ 22 nm) and iron based magnetic nanocrystals (4 ~ 33 nm). The r 1 and r 2 MR relaxivity values of hydrated nanocrystals were optimized and examined depending on their core diameter, surface coating, and compositions; the high r 1 value of gadolinium oxide was 40 - 60 S- 1 mM- 1, which is 10 - 15 fold higher than that of commercial Gd (III) chelates (4. 3 ~ 4. 6 S- 1 mM- 1). Moreover, in vitro toxicological studies revealed that polymer coated nanocrystals suspensions had no significant effect on human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells even at high concentration. Towards multimodal imaging or multifunctional ability, we developed the iron oxide/QDs complexes, which consist of cores of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> that act as nucleation sites for fluorescent QDs. The choice of variable QDs helped to visualize and remove large <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>materials</b> in a magnetic separation. Additionally, diluted materials concentrated on the magnet could be fluorescently detected even at very low concentration. The designed MRI or multifunctional nanomaterials will give great and powerful uses in biomedical applications...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in the design and use of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>materials</b> with nanoscale dimensions for magnetic, catalytic, biomedical, and electronic applications. The increased manufacture and use of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles (IONPs) in consumer products as well as industrial processes is expected to lead to the unintentional release of IONPs into the environment. The impact of IONPs on the environment and on biological species is not well understood but remains a concern due to the increased chemical reactivity of nanoparticles relative to their bulk counterparts. This review article describes the impact of IONPs on cellular genetic components. The mutagenic impact of IONPs may damage an organism’s ability to develop or reproduce. To date, {{there has been}} experimental evidence of IONPs having mutagenic interactions on human cell lines including lymphoblastoids, fibroblasts, microvascular endothelial cells, bone marrow cells, lung epithelial cells, alveolar type II like epithelial cells, bronchial fibroblasts, skin epithelial cells, hepatocytes, cerebral endothelial cells, fibrosarcoma cells, breast carcinoma cells, lung carcinoma cells, and cervix carcinoma cells. Other cell lines including the Chinese hamster ovary cells, mouse fibroblast cells, murine fibroblast cells, Mytilus galloprovincialis sperm cells, mice lung cells, murine alveolar macrophages, mice hepatic and renal tissue cells, and vero cells have also shown mutagenic effects upon exposure to IONPs. We further show the influence of IONPs on microorganisms in the presence and absence of dissolved organic carbon. The results shed light on the OPEN ACCESS Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2015, 16 23483 transformations IONPs undergo in the environment {{and the nature of the}} potential mutagenic impact on biological cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{high-temperature}} (HT) Water Gas Shift (WGS) reaction has considerable technological {{relevance for}} lowering CO content during {{the conversion of}} natural gas or liquid hydrocarbons to hydrogen. Conventional HT-WGS catalysts based on <b>oxides</b> of <b>iron</b> and chromium are well established industrially. However, {{it is crucial to}} remove any impurities present such as Cr 6 +, S or N during the catalytic process. In particular, Cr 6 + is regarded as a Class I carcinogen and its presence is restricted by EU legislation. Even though Cr 6 + is reduced during the catalytic process, caution must still be taken to eliminate any further impurities. Hence, it is desirable to identify alternative promoters and develop a Cr-free HT-WGS catalyst. This thesis presents results obtained using atomistic simulation techniques to investigate the effect of Cr 3 + and possible alternative dopants in three important <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>materials,</b> Hematite (α-Fe 2 O 3), Maghemite (γ-Fe 2 O 3) and Magnetite (Fe 3 O 4). The starting point is to develop an understanding of the structural properties and distribution of Cr 3 + on the bulk and surface material of hematite. The critical stage of understanding the role of Cr 3 + provides the basis from which criteria for novel dopants can be assessed. Al 3 + and Mn 3 + are proposed as the promising candidates {{on the basis of this}} study. The research has been extended to other complex <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> such as maghemite and magnetite. In summary, the role of chromium in the HT-WGS reaction has been investigated to establish criteria for effective, alternative promoter dopants. This investigation has provided a detailed insight into the atomic level behaviour of Cr 3 +, Mn 3 +, Al 3 + impurities in three major <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> phases. The alternative dopants predicted in this study have been the subject of parallel experimental studies conducted by Johnson Matthey. The results of this study are already benefiting the design of more efficient iron-oxide catalysts for the HT-WGS reaction. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} were {{prepared}} composites of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> and carbonaceous <b>materials</b> {{in two different}} weight proportions (Carbon/Fe 1 / 1 and 1 / 2). The physico-chemical properties of the composites were determined by temperature programmed reduction (TPR), adsorption/dessorption of N 2, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and pulse titration H 2. The XRD and XPS analysis showed a cubic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> phase, identified as maghemite, formed over the carbon surface. The particle size of maghemite showed to be within 10 - 30 nm. Carbon/Fe 1 / 2 was the most active in MB removal kinetics and ESI-MS studies showed that MB removal by both composites leads to oxidized intermediates...|$|R
40|$|The {{hydrated}} iron(III) oxide limonite {{is reported}} {{for the first time}} as a biomineral. In situ laser Raman spectra of the tooth cores from major lateral teeth of the chiton Plaxiphora albida are compared with those of synthetic and mineral iron phosphates and <b>iron</b> <b>oxides.</b> Raman spectra measured on iron phosphate and <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> standard <b>materials</b> are shown to be easily distinguishable from one another. The central tooth cores of mature P. albida teeth do not show any evidence for the presence of a separate iron phosphate mineral. Rather, in each tooth a narrow band of the hydrated iron(III) oxide limonite is shown to separate the magnetite of the tooth surface from a central core region comprising both lepidocrocite and limonite. The high concentration of phosphorus in P. albida tooth cores, previously observed by energy dispersive spectroscopy, is not associated with a separate iron phosphate mineral, indicating that this element may be adsorbed onto the surface of the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> minerals present. The failure to detect a separate iron(III) phosphate is discussed with reference to other chiton species that display high levels of iron and phosphorus in the cores of their mature major lateral teeth...|$|R
