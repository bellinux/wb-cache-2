25|$|On October 27, 1927, {{a meeting}} of representatives from the {{surrounding}} communities were called to the Court House in Neepawa, Manitoba to discuss a proposal to designate the Riding Mountain Forest Reserve a national park. Led by J. N. McFadden, the meeting aimed to <b>highlight</b> <b>to</b> residents the differences between a forest reserve and national park. One major difference is that its natural resources would be completely protected from development. Since 1918 reforestation had proceeded in the park, and it was planned as a destination for tourists to continue to invest money in the local economy. Although some wanted a national park to {{be located in the}} Whiteshell, a majority officially voted in favour of locating it in Riding Mountain. As a consequence of this decision logging operations were halted and the value of Duck Mountain increased.|$|E

500|$|Dota 2 {{includes}} a seasonal Elo rating-based matchmaking system, which {{is measured by}} a numerical value known as [...] "matchmaking rating" [...] (MMR) and separated into different tiers. MMR is updated based on if a player's team won or lost, which will then increase or decrease respectively. The game's servers, known as the [...] "Game Coordinator", attempts to balance both teams based on each player's MMR, with each team having roughly a 50% chance to win in any given game. Ranked game modes with a separately tracked MMR are also available, which primarily differ from unranked games by making MMR publicly visible, as well as requiring the registration of a phone number to their accounts, which help foster a more competitive environment. To ensure that each player's ranking is up to date and accurate, MMR is recalibrated every six months. The highest ranked MMR players are listed by Valve on an online leaderboard, which lists the 200 highest for each region. The game also {{includes a}} report system, which allows players to punish player behavior that intentionally provides a negative experience. Other features include an improved replay system from Defense of the Ancients, in which a completed game can be downloaded in-client and viewed by anyone at a later time, and the [...] "hero builds" [...] feature, which provide integrated guides created by the community that <b>highlight</b> <b>to</b> the player on how to play their hero.|$|E
