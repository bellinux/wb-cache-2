500|$|Final Destination: The Complete Original Motion Picture Score was {{released}} on March 17, 2000. The film's score was conducted by Daytime Emmy Award-winning composer Shirley Walker. Wong and Morgan initially wanted Walker to score the film after having previously worked with her on their sci-fi television series [...] Walker said, [...] " [...] are great believers in melody and having music for the characters and situations they find themselves in. Of course, the atmosphere <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> also, especially for a film with as much suspense building as this film has".|$|E
500|$|From 1940 to 1946, the Bears {{displayed}} their {{dominance in}} the game, playing in five NFL championship games, winning four, and posted a 54–17–3 regular season record. In 1942, the Bears posted a perfect 11–0record and outscored their opponents, 376–84, however they lost the championship game to the Redskins. Although the T-formation had been used many years before Luckman joined the Chicago Bears, he was central to Chicago's successful use of this style of play because of his game-sense and versatility. Perfecting Halas' complex offensive scheme of fakes, men in motion, and quick hitting runs, Luckman added the dimension of accurate downfield throwing. He was instrumental in his team's record-setting 73–0 win over the Washington Redskins in the 1940 NFL championship game. Sportscaster Jimmy Cannon once said in reference to Luckman's years at Columbia, [...] "You <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> to realize how great Sid was." [...] Luckman later became a sought-after tutor and instructor for universities wishing to install the T-formation as an offense.|$|E
2500|$|Buffett {{began calling}} his music [...] "drunken Caribbean rock 'n' roll" [...] {{as he says}} on his 1978 live album You <b>Had</b> <b>To</b> <b>Be</b> <b>There.</b> Later, Buffett himself and others have used the term [...] "gulf and western" [...] to {{describe}} his musical style and that of other similar-sounding performers. The name derives from elements in Buffett's early music including musical influence from country and western, along with folk rock and lyrical themes from the Gulf of Mexico coast. A music critic described Buffett's music as a combination of [...] "tropical languor with country funkiness into what some [...] called the Key West sound, or Gulf-and-western." [...] The term is a play on the form of [...] "Country & Western" [...] {{and the name of}} the former conglomerate Gulf+Western.|$|E

2500|$|William Huskisson {{should not}} have been at the opening event of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. He had been {{diagnosed}} with strangury, a tender inflammation of the kidneys, had undergone surgery, and had been advised by Royal doctor William George Maton to cancel all forthcoming appointments. Huskisson chose to ignore this advice, as he was {{aware of the importance of}} the day and knew he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> So on 15 September 1830, Huskisson was at Edge Hill in Liverpool for his appointment with fate. He rode down the line in a special train constructed for the Duke of Wellington and his guests and dignitaries, pulled by the locomotive Northumbrian which was driven by George Stephenson himself. This train was the only train on the south track, the other seven were in procession on the northern track. [...] At Parkside railway station, near the midpoint of the line, the locomotives made a scheduled stop to take on water. Although the company had implicitly warned passengers to remain on the trains while this took place, around fifty of the dignitaries on board alighted when the Duke of Wellington's special train stopped. One of those who got off was Huskisson, who approached the Duke to take this opportunity to repair their relationship after a great falling out, which resulted in Huskisson leaving the government, and shook his hand.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 February 2016, it was {{confirmed}} that Westbrook would reprise the role {{for a few}} episodes. Her return will coincide with Kemp's return as Sam's brother Grant and Windsor's final appearance as Sam's mother Peggy. Of her return Westbrook said, 'I'm really excited to be going back to EastEnders". Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "It is only right that all of Peggy Mitchell's children would be at her funeral. Danniella is the final piece of the Mitchell jigsaw puzzle, so it will be great for viewers to see Phil, Grant and Sam all back on screen. Sam will only be back for a few episodes, but these scenes are bound to go down in the soap's history." [...] While appearing on an episode of Loose Women on 24 March 2016, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising the role of Sam on a full-time basis. Westbrook returned to filming on 3 May 2016. Letitia Dean who plays Sharon Watts revealed that there would be [...] "fireworks" [...] when Sam returns. Dean revealed: [...] "Sam coming back is a shock. It's obviously {{been a long time since}} anyone has seen her and she is trouble through and through. But Peggy is her mum, so of course she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> for the funeral". She went on to say: [...] "They do have a bit of a run-in with each other and Sharon is caught out which really panics her, especially that Sam has come back and seems to be unhappy that Sharon is so involved with the Mitchells." [...] Westbrook later expressed her disappointment with Sam only appearing in four episodes in an Instagram post. [...] "It's such a shame I won't be going back to the show as I think people would of [...] loved to see Sam as a mum and with a different take on the character… But I don't write the show I just do what they tell me," [...] Westbrook went on to say: [...] "And they've done what they always do use Sam when she's needed & then send her off in a black cab. I wish @bbceastenders would listen to the public more. But either way I'm grateful of the 4 episodes I got to film." [...] Her return scenes aired on 30 June with her final scenes aired on 8 July 2016. In March 2017, Westbrook expressed interest in reprising her role as Sam but feared the show would just use her for publicity. On 11 May 2017, Westbrook claimed during an interview on Loose Women that she would be reprising her role as Sam later in the year, however an EastEnders source denied this, saying, [...] "There are no plans for Danniella to return, it's just not going to happen. It's very odd that she keeps harping on about her return to the soap cause it has plainly never been discussed." ...|$|E

The man had to take the punishment, however painful or disgraceful, without a murmur, or go and starve.
