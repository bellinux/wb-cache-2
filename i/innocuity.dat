40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the <b>innocuity</b> of {{isoflurane}} in rat lung and liver through histopathological examination. Experimental protocol: 20 female Wistar rats were divided intro 4 groups, each consisting of 5 individuals: control group, group I, II and III. Female rats from the control group were not exposed to any anesthetic treatment, while female rats from the other groups (I, II and III) were exposed to isoflurane three times, for 2 hours, every other day. Animals from the control group and group I were sacrificed immediately after the last exposure (0 h). Group II was sacrificed 6 hours after the last exposure and group III 24 hours after the last exposure. Fragments of the lung and liver were collected from the 20 female rats taken into study and then histologically processed (fixed in 10 % buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin). After obtaining 5 µm thick sections, they were stained using Goldner’s Trichrome method. Histopathological examination of the tissue specimens showed no structural changes perceptible through light microscopy, thus showing that isoflurane did not exert a toxic action in these two organs. The present study proved a good <b>innocuity</b> of isoflurane in rat lung and liver...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Besides {{the myth}} of “natural and safe” remedies, the real <b>innocuity</b> of many herbal {{products}} is actually not clearly defined. Medicinal plants have become very popular in complementary and alternative medicine; they are now often used as preventive and/or therapeutic options by patients suffering from serious chronic diseases who are then exposed to possible adverse reactions. As an example, we may consider the "Aristolochia" case, {{which took place in}} Belgium during the ' 90 s; 120 cases of interstitial fibrosis have been related to the ingestion of slimming pills containing aristolochic acids (AA), which caused damages to renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC) and finally led to end-stage renal failure, requiring dialysis and transplantation. Commonly used drugs such as cisplatine (cisPt) or ciclosporine A (CsA) are also responsible for such adverse reactions. Efficient means to precociously detect and avoid such damages and/or to promote kidney regeneration remain to be developed. Aims: To build an in vitro tool able to rapidly detect early signs of nephrotoxicity, and in case of <b>innocuity</b> further investigate if selected herbal products have a protective effect against drug-induced nephrotoxicity. Methods. HK- 2 cells, originating from human RPTEC, were exposed to AA (50 µM), cisPt (50 µM) or CsA (5 µM), or to a methanolic extract of ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) (5 - 50 µg/ml). Nephrotoxicity was evaluated by determining the loss of intracellular β-catenin and secretion of fibronectin in cells supernatants. Effects on proliferation were evaluated according to the ki- 67 index and further investigated by cell cycle analysis. Results. As compared to controls, nephrotoxic compounds induced loss of β-catenin and fibronectin secretion. No similar effects were observed after cell exposure to a methanolic extract of ginseng, suggesting no harmful cytotoxicity in the present model. Instead, ki- 67 expression and cell cycle analysis both supported a proliferative effect of ginseng. Conclusions. These preliminary results indicate this model enables (1) to detect early toxicity on HK- 2 cells, and (2) to highlight an effect on cell proliferation. It therefore may be used to screen herbal extracts susceptible to be nephrotoxic or nephroprotector. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

A biochemical test would therefore be useful, especially as the oculocardiac reflex (OCR) test <b>innocuity</b> is not absolute. AimsTo evaluate urinary excretions of norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine as markers for vagal hyperreactivity. MethodsDuring check-up of 55 infants from 0. 5 to 11 months of age, for discomfort episodes, including OCR and Holter recording, 24 h urinary assays of total norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine were carried out to evaluate sympathetic activity. ResultsEpinephrine and norepinephrine urinary excretions were negatively correlated with VHR intensity, {{as measured by the}} OCR ECG parameters: RRmax, % cardiac deceleration and minimal frequency; dopamine excretion was not. When RRmaxOCR was greater or equal to 800 ms, epinephrine urinary excretion tended to be less or equal to 9 nmol/mmol creatinine and norepinephrine excretion less or equal to 190 nmol/mmol creatinine. ConclusionA delay in maturation of the sympathetic system and/or adrenomedullary glands with low secretion of norepinephrine and epinephrine inducing a desequilibrium of the sympathetic/parasympathetic balance may contribute to the fainting spells observed with VHR.

Based on the abundance and <b>innocuity</b> of the cutaneous resident S. epidermidis, we hypothesized that their PSMs contribute to host defense. Here we show that S. epidermidis delta-toxin (PSMgamma) is normally present in the epidermis and sparsely in the dermis of human skin using immunohistochemistry. Synthetic delta-toxin interacted with neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and colocalized with cathelicidin while also inducing NET formation in human neutrophils. In antimicrobial assays against Group A Streptococcus (GAS), delta-toxin cooperated with CRAMP, hBD 2, and hBD 3. In whole blood, addition of delta-toxin exerted a bacteriostatic effect on GAS, and in NETs, delta-toxin increased their killing capacity against this pathogen. Coimmunoprecipitation and tryptophan spectroscopy demonstrated direct binding of delta-toxin to host antimicrobial peptides LL- 37, CRAMP, hBD 2, and hBD 3. Finally, in a mouse wound model, GAS survival was reduced (along with Mip- 2 cytokine levels) when the wounds were pretreated with delta-toxin. Thus, these data suggest that S. epidermidis-derived delta-toxin cooperates with the host-derived antimicrobial peptides in the innate immune system to reduce survival of an important human bacterial pathogen...|$|E
