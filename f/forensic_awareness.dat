40|$|The goal of {{reaching}} {{a high level}} of security in wirelessand wired communication networks is continuously provendifficult to achieve. The speed at which both keepers and violatorsof secure networks is evolving is relatively close. Nowadaysnetwork infrastructures contain a large number of event logscaptured by Firewalls and Domain Controllers (DCs). However,these logs are increasingly becoming an obstacle for networkadministrators in analyzing networks for malicious activities. Forensic investigators mission to detect malicious activities andreconstruct incident scenarios is very complex considering thenumber as well as the quality of these event logs. In this paper,we present the building blocks of a framework for automatednetwork readiness and awareness. The idea of this frameworkis to utilize the current network security outputs to constructforensically comprehensive evidence. In the proposed framework,we cover the three vital phases of the cybercrime managementchain, which are: 1) Forensics Readiness, 2) Active Forensics, and 3) <b>Forensics</b> <b>Awareness.</b> Keywords: Network <b>Forensics,</b> ForensicsReadiness, Network Security,Active <b>Forensics,</b> Reactive Forensics,Forensics <b>Awareness</b> and Network Security Framework...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{forensics}} {{has been}} established as a new branch in science with the continued reporting of seizures of nuclear material {{and the need for}} identifying its origin. By today, the IAEA recorded more than 1000 illicit incidents involving nuclear or other radioactive materials [1]. Once illicitly trafficked nuclear material has been intercepted, the questions of its intended use and origin are to be addressed. Especially the origin is of prime importance in order to close the gaps and improve the physical protection at the sites where the theft or diversion occurred. To answer the questions, a dedicated nuclear forensics methodology has been developed. In this paper, the latest challenges will be described. Selected examples shall illustrate the complexity associated with this work. In particular, the need for reference data, for comparison samples will be highlighted, moreover the importance of definition of crime scene procedures and agreed protocols will be underlined. Finally, it has to be noted, that <b>forensics</b> <b>awareness</b> and dedicated training of all actors involved are essential for successful forensic analysis and for possible attribution of the nuclear material.

40|$|Purpose Although {{rational}} choice researchers has investigated how offenders successfully commit certain crimes, {{there is a}} lack of research looking at the factors explaining the use - or not - of certain detection avoidance strategies. This study introduces the concept of "forensic awareness" as a detection avoidance strategy, and proposes to examine the effect of disinhibitors, target selection behaviors, and acts that may potentially leave evidence at the crime scene on its use. Methods Factors influencing <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> are tested using logistic regression models on a sample of 222 rape events collected from offenders incarcerated in Canada. Results Offenders exhibit less <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> when under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol. However, offenders who show some form of target selection are more likely to take forensic precautions. Finally, offenders who break and enter in the victim's residence, and undertake specific sexual acts during the crime are also more likely to exhibit <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness.</b> Conclusion Despite the increasing use and knowledge of forensic evidence by law enforcement, offenders are inconsistent in their <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> and they direct most of their efforts toward protecting their identity, neglecting to either destroy or clean up DNA that could be recovered at the crime scene. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} twofold {{analysis}} {{in the domain of}} sex-related homicides. Police profilers often help in criminal investigation of high profile cases, but empirical evidence in the domain is incomplete. We therefore at first apply a structural learning approach and secondly, try explicitly to predict the age of an unknown offender from information obtained from the crime scene. We apply graphical modelling to obtain a factorisation of the probability function which governs the domain. This factorisation allows us to infer dependencies and independencies between the variables and therefore describes the domain. We apply several structure learning algorithms for Bayesian Networks and combine them to a final graphical model. In the second part, we compare several prediction techniques concerning their error rate in predicting the offender's age. The graphical model broadly presents a distinction between an offender and a situation driven crime. A situation driven crime may be characterised by an offender lacking preparation and typically attacking a known victim in familiar surroundings. The offender tends to apply blunt force to gain control over the victim and does not show a high level of <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness.</b> In contrast offender driven crimes may be identified by the high level of <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> demonstrated by the offender and the sophisticated measures applied to control the victim. Furthermore the graphical model indicates that these offenders are more likely to attack an unknown victim in unfamiliar surroundings and prepare their attack. Applying several prediction techniques to the date results in a significant decrease in the root mean square error, if compared with a simple baseline model. However the actual performance of the best model, namely the lasso, is still not applicable in criminal investigation, as it its average error of 8 years is too high...|$|E
40|$|From recent {{calls for}} {{positioning}} forensic scientists within {{the criminal justice}} system, but also policing and intelligence missions, this paper emphasizes {{the need for the}} development of educational and training programs in the area of forensic intelligence, It is argued that an imbalance exists between perceived and actual understanding of forensic intelligence by police and forensic science managers, and that this imbalance can only be overcome through education. The challenge for forensic intelligence education and training is therefore to devise programs that increase <b>forensic</b> intelligence <b>awareness,</b> firstly for managers to help prevent poor decisions on how to develop information processing. Two recent European courses are presented as examples of education offerings, along with lessons learned and suggested paths forward. It is concluded that the new focus on forensic intelligence could restore a pro-active approach to forensic science, better quantify its efficiency and let it get more involved in investigative and managerial decisions. A new educational challenge is opened to forensic science university programs around the world: to refocus criminal trace analysis on a more holistic security problem solving approach...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{advances}} {{in the understanding of}} forensic identification sciences there remain problems with an over-reliance on DNA evidence in trials, concerns about {{the manner in which the}} experts present their evidence, lack of understanding by legal professionals, an consequent comprehension difficulties experienced by jurors. This paper addresses those for lacunae by examining levels of awareness of DNA evidence in criminal trials by both lay and professional participants. It draws on the findings from two recently conducted studies by the authors and their colleagues. One was an experimental design that manipulated the manner in which DNA results were presented to mock- jurors and the other was a case-based survey of law students to gauge their levels of <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness.</b> These studies provide promising findings about ways in which information and educational processes can be enhanced vis-à-vis forensic identification evidence...|$|E
40|$|Forensic {{evidence}} {{has a clear}} {{role to play in}} the successful prosecution of sexual offence cases, and as such, the place of forensic science should be presented to students in the relevant context within a functioning criminal justice system. Mechanisms of transfer and persistence make a good starting point for training in this area, followed by detailed training in search and identification techniques for the various evidence types, and discussion of their limitations. Many sexual offence submissions to the forensic laboratory arrive {{with a great deal of}} supplementary information, often summarised on the submission paperwork by the investigating officer. This information, coupled with that in the complainant's interview often reads like a story. When practitioners are sufficiently experienced in dealing with sexual offence cases, they may wish to develop further by providing <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> training to other audiences with a professional interest in sexual offence casework...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates whether investigative {{awareness}} is a distinctive feature of sadism and examines {{if it is}} possible to identify different types of sadistic offenders based on the severity of an offender’s sadistic behaviour. The study addressed these two research questions through a series of binary logistic regressions and two-step hierarchical cluster analysis utilizing a sample of 350 cases of sexual homicide from Canada. Results from the logistic regression indicate that sadistic offenders are more likely to use <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> strategies at the crime scene, pre-select deserted locations to commit their offense and have an unsolved case in comparison to non-sadists. The cluster analysis show that three groups emerge: 1) a non-sadistic group, 2) a mixed group that show some evidence of sadistic behaviour, and 3) a sadistic group that have high levels of sadistic behaviour. Implications for both clinical and investigative purposes are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{rational}} choice approach, this study compares {{the decision making}} involved in the crime commission process of rapists (n = 30), child molesters (n = 17), and victim-crossover sex offenders (n = 22). Using a mixed-methods framework and following Clarke and Cornish's decision-making model, the authors organized offenders' narratives collected during semistructured interviews into three major areas: (a) offense planning (i. e., premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> of the offender); (b) offense strategies (i. e., use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used; and (c) aftermath (i. e., event leading {{to the end of}} crime and victim release site location choice). Results emphasize the important role of situational factors and age of the victim on the decision-making process of serial sex offenders. Moreover, results show that because of particular choice-structuring properties, the decision making varies across different groups of serial sex offenders. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Although {{the study}} of both offense {{processes}} and implicit theories provides in-depth knowledge about the decision-making of sex offenders, these studies focus solely on the internal psychological processes of the offender leading to the commission of a sexual assault. These studies neglect to look specifically at the offender’s decision-making during the offense in interaction with the immediate situations encountered at the offense scene, such as the choices of behavior while interacting with the victim in a specific context. Based on a rational choice approach, this study investigates the decision-making involved in the offending process of 69 serial sexual offenders who have committed their crimes against stranger victims. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} offenders in order to identify the rationale behind their actions during the pre-crime phase (premeditation of the crime, estimation of risk of apprehension by the offender, and <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> of the offender), crime phase (use of a weapon, use of restraints, use of a vehicle, and level of force used), and the post-crime phase (event leading to the end of crime and victim release site location choice).

40|$|The unique {{decision}} making task entrusted to lay juries in adversarial legal systems has {{attracted the attention}} of legal psychologists for decades, but more recently technological advances in forensic science have highlighted the importance of understanding how jurors perceive this often ambiguous and complicated type of evidence. This thesis begins by investigating the <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> of lay participants, and the ability of mock jurors to discriminate between varying probative values of forensic evidence. The findings suggest that the perception of weak forensic evidence is affected by contextual information, and there was wide disagreement among participants about the probative value of weak evidence. In an effort to explain the variance in perceived evidence strength, a measure of pre-trial attitudes about forensic science was developed (the Forensic Evidence Evaluation Bias Scale – FEEBS) and administered to 446 participants ranging from students, to jury eligible members of the public, to actual jury venire persons. The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified two distinct clusters of attitudes measured by the FEEBS, which correspond conceptually to the hypothesised juror beliefs described in the CSI Effect literature. These attitudes were found to have a significant indirect effect on verdict preference, for trial vignettes describing murder, robbery, and sexual assault scenarios containing weak (or absent) forensic DNA evidence. The implications of these findings for voir dire hearings are discussed, with reference to the cognitive models of juror {{decision making}} and the CSI Effect literature...|$|E

40|$|Virtual reality {{technology}} is {{a powerful tool for}} the development of experimental learning in practical situations. Creation of software packages with some element of virtual learning allows educators to broaden the available experience of students beyond the scope that a standard curriculum provides. This teaching methodology is widely used in the delivery of medical education with many surgical techniques being practised via virtual reality technologies (see Engum et al., 2003). Use has been made of this technology {{for a wide range of}} teaching applications such as virtual field trials for an environmental science course (Ramasundaram et al., 2005), and community nursing visiting education scenarios (Nelson et al., 2005) for example. Nelson et al. (2005) imaged three-dimensional representations of patient living accommodation incorporating views of patient medication in order to deliver care modules via a problem-based learning approach. The use of virtual reality in the teaching of crime scene science was pioneered by the National Institute of Forensic Science in Australia as part of their Science Proficiency Advisory Committee testing programme. A number of scenarios were created using CDROM interfacing, allowing as near as possible normal procedures to be adopted. This package included proficiency testing integrated into the package and serves as a paradigm for the creation of virtual reality crime scene scenarios (Horswell, 2000). The package is commercially available on CD-ROM as part of the series ‘After the Fact’ ([URL] The CD-ROM package is geared to proficiency training of serving scenes of crime officers and thus contains details that may not be needed in the education of other parties with a need for <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness.</b> These include undergraduate students studying towards forensic science degree programmes in the UK as well as serving Police Officers. These groups may need virtual reality crime scene material geared to their specific knowledge requirements. In addition, Prof J Fraser, President of the Forensic Science Society and a former police Scientific Support Manager, speaking to the United Kingdom, House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee in its report ‘Forensic Science on Trial’ (2005) states: ‘The documented evidence in relation to police knowledge of forensic science, in terms of making the best use of forensic science, is consistently clear, that their knowledge needs to improve and therefore their training needs to improve’. This clearly identifies a need for further training of serving police officers in forensic science. It was with this in mind that staff at the University collaborated with the West Midlands Police Service. The aim was to create a virtual reality CD-ROM that could serve as part of the continuing professional development of serving police officers in the area of scene management. Adaptation of the CD-ROM could allow some introductory materials to help undergraduate students of forensic science...|$|E
30|$|Forensic {{science has}} been a key pillar in {{criminal}} justice system {{all over the world}} (Petherick et al., 2010). In Pakistan, forensic has been ignored for a long time. The ongoing terrorism gave a wake-up call to the establishment and untiring efforts were made for the establishing and proper functioning of the forensic laboratory to help criminal investigations (Petherick et al., 2009). Since 2001, authorities have been revamping forensic science infrastructure across the country to aid crime investigation. The National Forensic Science Agency (NFSA) was approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) as an autonomous body in 2002 having departments of crime scene Investigation, trace chemistry, questioned documents and digital forensics (National Forensic Science Agency, n.d.). Its objective was to help establish other forensic science laboratories across the country and to provide teaching and training facilities throughout Pakistan, which is still not achieved. In Punjab province, Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) Act was passed on October 2007 for the establishment of the Forensic Science Agency which ultimately lead to the establishment of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency on 2012 having fourteen departments under one roof. The departments include audio video analysis, computer forensic unit, crime and death scene, DNA and serology, forensic photography, narcotics, toxicology, trace evidence, polygraph, firearm and tool marks, latent fingerprints, pathology and questioned documents (Punjab Forensic Science Agency, n.d.). In Sindh province, Sindh Forensic Science Agency act was passed on August, 2017 but so far no laboratory has been established. DNA testing facility available in Jamshoro, Sindh which provides research as well as forensic DNA testing. Besides this, government of Sindh is making efforts for establishment of Forensic DNA testing laboratory in Karachi University. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police has established Forensic Science Laboratory and Institute of Forensic Science in Peshawar on December, 2017 to provide preliminary forensic facilities and {{to bridge the gap between}} <b>forensic</b> <b>awareness</b> and criminal investigation practices. In Balochistan province of Punjab, an act was passed for the establishment of Balochistan Forensic Science Agency on August, 2015 but no forensic facility has yet been established. At present, NFSA and PFSA are providing many important investigation leads in various hideous crimes. The advent of DNA data base recently at PFSA has proved a major breakthrough in solving crimes through DNA profile comparison, not only exonerating the innocent, but also in catching the real culprit (Punjab Forensic Science Agency, n.d.). Now general public and judiciary of Pakistan are relying heavily on Forensic evidences in trial cases and making decisions. As forensic science popularity increases in the country so does the backlog. More and more cases are being received each day which is causing delay in the case processing and ultimately delayed justice. There is a need to increase the capacity and number of the Forensic laboratories across the country as current facility is insufficient keeping in mind the large number of cases coming from big population of Pakistan (Population Welfare Department, n.d.).|$|E
