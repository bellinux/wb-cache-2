5|$|The goblin shark has a distinctively {{long and}} flat snout, {{resembling}} a sword blade. The proportional {{length of the}} snout decreases with age. The eyes are small and lack protective nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are spiracles. The large mouth is parabolic in shape. The jaws are highly protrusible and can be extended almost {{to the end of}} the snout, though normally they are held <b>flush</b> <b>against</b> the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation in tooth length and width occurs, in whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main cusp, and in the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, with the gill filaments inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the pectoral fins.|$|E
25|$|Panels. Panels are {{sheets of}} pre-profiled copper with lengths up to 4–5meters and {{standard}} widths up to 500mm. They are two-sided cladding elements {{that can be}} with or without an end base. Assembly is performed using the tongue and groove principle or by overlapping. Panels can be assembled vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. There are three basic forms: tongue and groove panels laid vertically as level surface facade cladding; tongue and groove panels laid horizontally as level surface facade cladding; and custom panels laid in different directions with visible or masked fastening, <b>flush</b> <b>against</b> the surface or overlapping. Links to representative photographs of golden-colored and patinated-green panels are available.|$|E
25|$|While it was {{excellently}} {{adapted to}} swimming and diving, Baptornis {{is thought to}} have been clumsy on land, pushing itself along the rocks with its feet rather than actually walking. The natural position of the lower legs was <b>flush</b> <b>against</b> the body, with the feet stretched out sideways and thus it would have been unable to move upright without toppling over. As opposed to Hesperornis which almost certainly had to slide on its belly or galumph like an earless seal, Baptorniss lower leg was not as firmly placed along the body sides. Thus, it would have found it more easy to place its feet under its body with the toes pointing forwards and might have managed small hops or even an awkward waddle, body held low to the ground.|$|E
40|$|A {{sensing device}} {{comprising}} an O 2 sensor, a pump, a compressor, and a heater is provided to quickly sense {{the amount of}} O 2 in a combustion product gas. A sample of the combustion product gas is compressed to a pressure slightly above one atmosphere by the compressor. Next, the heater heats the sample between 800 C and 900 C. Next, the pump causes the sample to be <b>flushed</b> <b>against</b> the electrode located in O 2 sensor 6000 to 10, 000 times per second. Reference air at approximately one atmosphere is provided to the electrode of O 2 sensor. Accordingly, the O 2 sensor produces a voltage which {{is proportional to the}} amount of oxygen in the combustion product gas. This voltage may be used to control the amount of O 2 entering into the combustion chamber which produces the combustion product gas...|$|R
50|$|In North America {{the term}} Spike and Wedge {{is used as}} instead of a clip, a rail spike is driven through a hole set in the metal base plate that is located <b>flush</b> up <b>against</b> the switch rail, holding it in place against the stock rail. The block of wood set in the open gap {{is known as the}} wedge and is {{functionally}} equivalent to a scotch.|$|R
5000|$|London lowball is a {{game played}} almost {{exclusively}} in Europe. It is almost identical to Razz in play with the following exceptions: straights and <b>flushes</b> count <b>against</b> a player for low, so the best possible hand is 6-4-3-2-A, and its canonical version is played at pot limit. Some variations of the game are played at no limit, but the name [...] "London lowball" [...] is typically reserved for the pot-limit version.|$|R
500|$|Feathers on the alula or bastard wing are not {{generally}} considered to be flight feathers in the strict sense; though they are asymmetrical, they lack the length and stiffness of most true flight feathers. [...] However, alula feathers are definitely an aid to slow flight. [...] These feathers—which are attached to the bird's [...] "thumb" [...] and normally lie <b>flush</b> <b>against</b> the anterior edge of the wing—function {{in the same way as}} the slats on an airplane wing, allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal angle of attack– and thus lift– without resulting in a stall. [...] By manipulating its thumb to create a gap between the alula and the rest of the wing, a bird can avoid stalling when flying at low speeds or landing.|$|E
500|$|Also, bastard wing; alular digit; alular quills. A small, freely-moving {{projection}} on {{the anterior}} {{edge of the}} wing of modern birds (and a few non-avian dinosaurs)—a bird's [...] "thumb"—the word is Latin and means [...] "winglet"; it is the diminutive of ala, meaning [...] "wing". Alula typically bears three to five small , with the exact number depending on the species. They normally lie <b>flush</b> <b>against</b> the anterior edge of the wing, and function in similar manner to the slats of an airplane's wing, allowing the wing to achieve a higher than normal angle of attack, thus aiding in lift. By manipulating the alula structure to create a gap {{between it and the}} rest of the wing, a bird can avoid stalling when flying at low speeds or landing. Feathers on the alula or bastard wing are not generally considered to be [...] in the strict sense; though they are asymmetrical, they lack the length and stiffness of most true flight feathers.

6000|$|Moving slowly {{past the}} heaps of bricks rising at {{intervals}} along the road, coasting carefully round the old iron and the broken tiles scattered {{here and there}} in his path, Mr. Bashwood advanced {{from the direction of the}} country toward one of the unfinished streets of the suburb. His personal appearance had been apparently made the object of some special attention. His false teeth were brilliantly white; his wig was carefully brushed; his mourning garments, renewed throughout, gleamed with the hideous and slimy gloss of cheap black cloth. He moved with a nervous jauntiness, and looked about him with a vacant smile. Having reached the first of the skeleton cottages, his watery eyes settled steadily for the first time on the view of the street before him. The next instant he started; his breath quickened; he leaned, trembling and <b>flushing,</b> <b>against</b> the unfinished wall at his side. A lady, still at some distance, was advancing toward him down the length of the street. [...] "She's coming!" [...] he whispered, with a strange mixture of rapture and fear, of alternating color and paleness, showing itself in his haggard face. [...] "I wish I was the ground she treads on! I wish I was the glove she's got on her hand!" [...] He burst ecstatically into those extravagant words, with a concentrated intensity of delight in uttering them that actually shook his feeble figure from head to foot.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the liner}} lock, an [...] "L"-shaped {{split in the}} liner allows part of the liner to move {{sideways}} from its resting position against the handle to {{the centre of the}} knife where it rests against the flat end of the tang. To disengage, this leaf spring is pushed so it again rests <b>flush</b> <b>against</b> the handle allowing the knife to rotate. A frame lock is functionally identical but instead of using a thin liner inside the handle material uses a thicker piece of metal as the handle and the same split in it allows a section of the frame to press against the tang.|$|E
2500|$|For both Orthodox and Eastern Catholics, the Holy Table (altar) is {{normally}} free-standing, although in very small sanctuaries {{it might be}} placed <b>flush</b> <b>against</b> the back wall for reasons of space. They are typically about one meter high, and although they may be made of stone they are generally built out of wood. The exact dimensions may vary, but it is generally square in plan and in reasonable proportion {{to the size of}} the sanctuary. It has five legs: one at each corner plus a central pillar for supporting the relics which are placed in it at its consecration (if, however, the consecration was not performed by a bishop, but by a priest whom he delegated for that purpose, relics are not placed in the Holy Table). A plain linen covering (Greek: Katasarkion, Slavonic: Strachítsa) is bound to the Holy Table with cords; this cover is never removed after the altar is consecrated, and is considered to be the [...] "baptismal garment" [...] of the altar. The linen covering symbolizes the winding sheet in which the body of Christ was wrapped when he was laid in the tomb. Since the altar is never seen uncovered thereafter, the table tends to be constructed more with sturdiness than aesthetics in mind. Above this first cover is a second ornamented altar cloth (Indítia), often in a brocade of a liturgical color that may change with the ecclesiastical season. This outer covering usually comes all the way to the floor and represents the glory of God's Throne. In many churches it is the custom for a dust cover to be placed on the Holy Table between services. This is often a simple red cloth, though it may be made of richer stuff. Sometimes it covers only the Gospel Book or the front half of the Holy Table, but it may be large enough to cover the entire Holy Table and everything on it, including candlesticks and the seven-branch candelabra.|$|E
2500|$|The current hillfort, {{after the}} {{restoration}} of 1874–1878, is substantially different {{but much of the}} old structure remains intact. During the restoration, it was found that parts of the original drystone masonry had been preserved under the collapse. [...] The workers marked, in tar, the undisturbed portions of the cashel and used the collapsed stone to build on this foundation. They supplemented these with other stones from the area to replace those 'removed by King Murdoch O'Brien in 1101'. [...] The internal diameters of the cashel are 23.6 metres north to south and [...] east to west. The lintel-covered entrance is [...] long, [...] wide and [...] metres high. Before the restoration, the gateway's lintel was not in place. It was wide and [...] high. It leads into the fort from the east. Slight recesses {{on either side of the}} entrance way have been filled in. [...] They were probably to allow double leaves of an original doorway to fold <b>flush</b> <b>against</b> the wall. [...] The interior rises in three terraces accessible by stairways which are previously mentioned. The outer wall is a dry-stone construction. On each side of the entranceway, there are [...] "galleries" [...] within the wall. Their precise purpose is not clear and they do not connect with the entrance. These two wall-passages, one on the south and another from the northeast run towards the gateway, but stop short. The south wall passage entrance is [...] wide, [...] high and [...] long. It turns through a right angle where it becomes [...] wide, high and [...] long. Near the north end there is a recess on the west side [...] wide, [...] and [...] deep.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{efficacy}} of a new hemostatic puncture closure device (HPCD) (Angioseal*), 100 patients who underwent coronary angiography (75) or coronary angioplasty (25), using femoral approach, were randomized between HPCD placement (N= 52) or regular compression (C) (manual or mechanical pressure then pressure dressing) (N= 48). Clinical data, anticoagulation regimen, sheath size, delay of sheath removal, aPTT at the removal were not statistically different in both groups. Pts were randomized immediately before the sheath removal. A serial clinical follow-up was done until 24 hours and a systematic vascular ultrasonography (with pulsed and color doppler examination) was performed before hospital discharge. In the HPCD group, device placement was successful in all but one. Hemostasis was immediate in 67 %; in 8 pts (15 %) a light manual pressure was necessary (15 ± 10 min.) to stop the bleeding.
