This means that local voters <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> their local politicians to spend general tax proceeds in a wise and prudent manner.

25|$|Critics, {{such as the}} American Council of the Blind, {{note that}} U.S. bills are {{relatively}} hard to tell apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint secondary color was added), {{and they are all}} the same size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value and/or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use of Braille codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because (1) these markings would only be useful to people who know how to read Braille, and (2) one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is rubbed off. Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in their wallets, they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-reading machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> sighted people or machines each time they receive US banknotes.|$|E

2500|$|New {{cast members}} were told before being hired {{that they would}} be sworn to secrecy about the plot. According to {{producer}} Richard Stokes, some of the new cast were surprised at the requirement. [...] "What was really interesting was the new cast members saying 'what do you mean we won't know'. Some lead actors want to know what happens at the end so they can pitch their performance to it. In this they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> Chris and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> the directors." [...] Cast members swore not to reveal any details of series two, and were required to sign legally binding non-disclosure agreements. (The Daily Mail called them [...] "the most rigorous confidentiality agreements in the industry.") Daily call sheets used pseudonyms for cast members and characters. Scripts were individually watermarked to prevent them from being photocopied, used pseudonyms for characters, and were locked away by security guards when not in use by the actors. Each actor's or crew member's script had the individual's name watermarked across the page as well, so that leaks could {{be traced back to the}} person responsible.|$|E

You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was originally created purely for {{the plot of}} [...] "Silence in the Library". Moffat knew that the team of archaeologists would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> the Doctor, but the Doctor's psychic paper could not explain and convince the team why he had appeared in a sealed-off library. Therefore, Moffat intended for the Doctor to {{know one of the}} archaeologists, but decided that idea was [...] "dull" [...] and instead decided to have one of them know him. When Kingston returned to the show, Moffat explained to her some details about her character's back-story, knowledge which Smith, Gillan and Darvill did not receive until later. Kingston relates that she knows her character cannot be killed off because we saw her death in her introductory episode; each subsequent appearance is set at a different point in her character's personal history. Moffat had planned out that River was Amy and Rory's daughter for [...] "a long time" [...] and used [...] "Pond" [...] as Amy's last name to create a link between the two. For the filming of the sixth series, Kingston was aware of River Song's relationship to Amy and Rory, while the other cast only found out upon reading of the mid-season cliffhanger script for [...] "A Good Man Goes to War".|$|E

2500|$|In [...] "Take Out," [...] Don {{must see}} a {{therapist}} who is {{led to believe}} that he is [...] "trigger happy." [...] His father noted that this may be true, as he often shoots first. Further, Alan recalled how Don would take on others' burdens as a child and told him to get counseling, which he later willingly sought, especially considering that he viewed his life's work as a series of dirty deeds. In [...] "One Hour", Don expressed that he doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> his team, they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> him. [...] The exception to this may be Charlie, whom the therapist identified {{as a member of the}} team to Don's initial confusion. [...] It appears that Don considers Charlie more of an extension of himself than a member of his team, which may be true: [...] Charlie would likely not be involved in the volume of cases that he is if not for Don's continued requests for his assistance, despite the team's respect for Charlie's contributions. He also confessed to his psychiatrist that he [...] "respects the Hell out of" [...] Charlie for all that his brother does for the FBI, and that Charlie has never let them down despite often having the team's and Don's lives in his hands. When the psychiatrist pushes Don about his relationship with Charlie, indicating first that Don resents Charlie's presence at the FBI and then that Don enjoys having his little brother as his 'employee', Don vehemently snaps back and defends Charlie. This shows how far the relationship between the brothers has come, especially since being damaged by the unusual pressures of their childhood and the three months near the end of their mother's life that Charlie spent working on P vs. NP. The therapist reveals that Don has deep-seated fears of losing what he has worked for, together with self-esteem issues from growing up in Charlie's shadow and likely some abandonment issues as well. In [...] "Money for Nothing", he acquiesces to the counselor's request to ask Charlie to come in for a visit. A looming issue was the day Charlie walked all the way home from a camping trip at the age of 8 (taken for Don's 13th birthday) just to get away from Don who did not want him sticking around. During the meeting, he learns that his brother was not as inept as he and his father thought and stated he likes working with Charlie. Both Don's therapist and Edgerton himself bring up the incident in which a suspect was tortured that nearly took Don over the edge ("One Hour" [...] and [...] "Pandora's Box"), but given the fact that it was done to obtain the whereabouts of a missing FBI agent, Don and Ian's superiors appear to be overlooking the matter for now.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the prime}} of his career, Johnson's fastball was {{sometimes}} clocked over , even as high as [...] with a low three-quarters delivery (nearly sidearm). His signature pitch was a slider that broke down and away from left-handed hitters and down and in to right-handed hitters. The effectiveness of the pitch is marked by its velocity being in the low 90s along with tight late break; hitters often believe they were thrown a fastball until the ball breaks just before it crosses home plate. Right-handed hitters have swung through and missed sliders that nearly hit their back foot. [...] Johnson dubbed his slider [...] "Mr. Snappy". [...] In later years, his fastball declined to the [...] range and his slider clocked at around [...] Johnson also threw a split-finger fastball that behaved like a change-up and a sinker to induce ground-ball outs. In a June 27, 2012, appearance on The Dan Patrick Show, Adam Dunn (a left-handed batter) was asked who the best pitcher he faced was. [...] "Honestly, Randy Johnson when he was good. It's hopeless. It's like a hopeless feeling. The first time you face him you feel like he's going to hit you right {{in the back of}} the neck when he throws it, like every pitch is going to hit you {{in the back of the}} neck. And it ends up down and away for a strike and you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>trust</b> it's going to be a strike, and heaven forbid he doesn't lose one out there and heaven forbid, there goes your cheek." ...|$|E
