50|$|The EIO {{contained}} several significant innovations over existing procedures. The EIO {{focuses on}} the <b>investigative</b> <b>measure</b> to be executed, {{rather than on the}} type of evidence to be gathered. The EIO has a broad scope - all investigative measures are covered, except those explicitly excluded. In principle, the issuing authority decides on the type of <b>investigative</b> <b>measure</b> to be used. However, flexibility is introduced by allowing, in a limited number of cases, the executing authority to decide to have recourse to an <b>investigative</b> <b>measure</b> other than that provided for in the EIO. Clear time limits are provided for the recognition and, with more flexibility, for the execution of the EIO. The proposal also innovates by providing the legal obligation to execute the EIO with the same celerity and priority as for a similar national case. The EIO provides for the use of a form that should be used in all cases.|$|E
40|$|U. S. and German courts alike {{long have}} {{struggled}} to find the proper balance between protecting the privacy rights of criminal suspects and granting law enforcement officials the adequate tools to fight crime. The highest courts in each country have produced different paradigms for determining where the public sphere ends and the private sphere begins. In a series of cases, the U. S. Supreme Court has inquired whether a criminal defendant had a reasonable expectation of privacy when the state conducted a warrantless search of the suspect’s person, premises, or belongings. Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court, in contrast, has asked whether an <b>investigative</b> <b>measure</b> has violated a criminal suspect’s dignity, under the premise that every individual {{has the right to}} a personal domain in which to develop his personality freely. Despite the difference in approach, the countries’ highest courts more often than not have reached similar conclusions. In both countries, for example, the home has emerged as the ultimate sanctuary, for different reasons. Under U. S. jurisprudence, it is reasonable to expect that the government will not intrude on an individual’s home. German law, in contrast, recognizes the home as a fundamentally private domain because it is the only space that truly assures the free development of one’s personality and guarantees the preservation of one’s dignity. Nonetheless, this article concludes that the paradigm set forth by Germany’s Federal Constitutional Court may be better equipped to address future privacy concerns arising from new developments in investigative technologies. A key difference between the two regimes is that U. S. law protects the expectation of privacy, whereas German jurisprudence protects privacy itself. By linking privacy to human dignity, the German Federal Constitutional Court has assured that privacy lines are not redrawn simply because investigative technologies get more sophisticated or law enforcement priorities shift...|$|E

The examination of the European legislative act allowed us to identify some dysfunctions in the settlement of some provisions, malfunctions which in the judicial practice of Member States’ competent institutions will cause numerous problems, both of interpretation and application. Among these we only highlight the lack of concrete provisions that oblige the judicial authorities of the countries involved in the issuance and execution of a European investigation order in criminal matters, to provide legal assistance to the persons who are conducting such procedures. In this context, we have formulated a series of critical opinions, complemented by appropriate de lege ferenda proposals, which may be useful to the European legislator from the perspective of amending and supplementing this legislative act.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the proportion of}} patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) mistaken for posterior uveitis and to identify the deleterious consequences. Methods: Charts of 1, 657 patients admitted in the section of inflammatory eye diseases at the Center for Ophthalmic Specialized Care (COS) in Lausanne, Switzerland from 1995 to 2013 were reviewed. CSCR cases misdiagnosed as posterior uveitis or those with superimposed disease due to steroid therapy for uveitis were studied. Delay in diagnosis, specific erroneous uveitis diagnosis and evolution of the disease were also evaluated. Retrospectively, the most useful means for a correct diagnosis of CSCR were the original fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) when available. Results: Out {{of a total of}} 1, 657 patients, 15 (0. 9 %) cases with CSCR were identified. These included 12 subjects misdiagnosed as posterior uveitis and 3 uveitis subjects with superimposed CSCR following corticosteroid therapy for uveitis. The presentation of the disease was largely influenced by improper and continued use of corticosteroids. Conclusion: CSCR is a rare but not negligible misdiagnosis in posterior uveitis representing approximately 1 % of subjects from a collective series of uveitis cases at a referral center. <b>Investigative</b> <b>measures</b> such as FA, ICGA and OCT are crucial for reaching a correct diagnosis and avoiding disease aggravation due to corticosteroid therapy...|$|R

50|$|The Government of Costa Rica {{sustained}} {{law enforcement}} efforts against human trafficking during the reporting period. Article 172 of the penal code, which was amended in April 2009 prescribes penalties {{of six to}} 10 years’ imprisonment for the movement of persons both across borders and within {{the country for the}} purposes of prostitution, sexual or labor servitude, slavery, forced work or services, servile marriage, forced begging, or other forms of compelled service. This statute also prohibits illegal adoption, which does not fall within the international definition of human trafficking. Sentences may be increased to eight to 16 years’ imprisonment under aggravated circumstances, such as the victimization of a child or a trafficker’s use of deception, violence, intimidation, or coercion. The penalties set forth in amended Article 172 are sufficiently stringent and commensurate with those prescribed for other serious crimes, such as rape. Articles 376 and 377 of the penal code additionally prohibit child sex trafficking, prescribing penalties of two to four years’ imprisonment. Law 8754, passed in July 2009, authorized the use of expanded law enforcement and <b>investigative</b> <b>measures,</b> such as wiretapping and the use of anticipated testimonies, when undertaking human trafficking cases. Insufficient familiarity with the new legislation, however, hindered the enforcement of these laws, and the government continued to use other statutes to prosecute trafficking offenders involved in the commercial sexual exploitation of children. During 2008, the latest period for which official statistics are available, the government investigated 18 potential cases of human trafficking and achieved five convictions for trafficking in persons crimes, compared with two convictions in 2007. The government operated a six-person smuggling and trafficking law enforcement unit, and worked closely with foreign governments in cases of transnational human trafficking. No government officials were prosecuted or convicted of trafficking-related corruption, although during the reporting period one government official was suspended and ultimately fired for his involvement in an alleged forced labor scheme involving Chinese youths; authorities were still investigating the case.|$|R

40|$|The cyber {{world is}} an {{extension}} of the real world. It is another dimension where we can work, study and play. But people also tend to lose their inhibitions on the Internet, often while keeping their anonymity. Because of the perceived and real freedoms in the digital environment, people are emboldened to act in ways that they may not normally do in the real world. One recent phenomenon that is steadily becoming a problem in every country {{with a high level of}} electronic connectivity is the act of cyberstalking. The electronic medium is an important factor due to its very nature such as low cost and ease of use, potential anonymity and stealth as well as the insignificance of physical distance to the act of cyberstalking. Hence, cyberspace affords lesser impediments to aggressive behaviour. The borderless nature of electronic communications medium, concomitant jurisdictional concerns and the unique challenges posed to computer forensics such as the collection of evidence and investigations also arise as relevant issues in this context. Cyberstalking has become a concern that has translated into law in larger and more technologically-matured jurisdictions such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan and even in a small country like Singapore. Existing laws relating to harassment or intimidation are often fact- or relationship- specific and are inadequate to meet the needs of modern society, while nascent cyberstalking laws are substantively disparate. I will first use Singapore as a case study and backdrop by presenting the factual experience and judicial developments in Singapore relating to cyberstalking and identify some of the usual problems in its treatment under law. I will then analyse and compare the cyberstalking laws of several key jurisdictions to determine the common elements and treatment amongst them with a view to the formulation of a proposed statutory solution that will take into consideration the different rights and interests of members of society in the use of digital media for social interaction.

40|$|Article 1315 of the Belgian Code of Civil Law and Article 870 of the Belgian Code of Civil Procedure play an {{important}} part in the determination of the factual circumstances of a case. These legal provisions determine which party carries the burden of proof. If a judge still has his doubts about the truth behind a factual allegation {{at the end of a}} legal procedure, he will decide against the party carrying the burden of proof. However, one can imagine situations in which such party encounters difficulties to produce the required evidence, while that party is not to blame for these difficulties. Such situations lead to a state of evidentiary deficiency. Under Belgian law, evidentiary deficiency is a relatively unknown concept that only occasionally makes its appearance in case law and legal scholarship. As far as this concept is concerned, the Belgian legal system stands in stark contrast to other legal systems (e. g. Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland), in which the concept of evidentiary deficiency is more common and even appears in the case law of the supreme court. While evidentiary deficiency can arise in any area of the law, tort law constitutes an especially interesting field of study (inter alia because of the sudden nature of a loss caused by a tortious act and because of the particularity of facts that underlie the assessment of tort liability). The main research question of this PhD thesis is how a Belgian judge should deal with problems of evidentiary deficiency that arise in a tort law context. Considering this question, the study identifies different scenarios leading to evidentiary deficiency (information deficit, evidence asymmetry, situational impossibility to provide evidence, inherent evidence uncertainty). Furthermore, the study examines whether evidentiary deficiency really is a problem from a legal perspective. Subsequently, the research provides for an analysis of the classic evidentiary mechanisms that Belgian judges currently have at their disposal to alleviate the burden of proof. These mechanisms are the duties to collaborate on the administration of evidence, <b>investigative</b> <b>measures</b> and factual presumptions. Based on insights acquired through a comparative law study, the research seeks to reinforce the substance of these mechanisms. Finally, the study discusses two alternative evidentiary mechanisms that do not yet have a firm status under Belgian law: the lowering of the standard of proof and the reversal of the burden of proof. After a conceptualization, delineation and overview of the state of affairs, the study formulates for both mechanisms a proposal for recognition and implementation. status: publishe...|$|R

Past theories and approaches have ignored interactions between genes on cellular level and how processes such as the immune system genetically can influence the development of the disease. HYPOTHESIS Bioinformatics, an evolving form of computational technology, can be used to systematically and methodically collate available information on gene expression and relevant transcription factors with aim of identifying the key players in the disease process. METHODS Genomic/Proteomic information was inputted into software programs such as Ingenuity IPA, GenEvestigator and Opossum. The software was able to produce network maps of biological pathways and meta-analysis plots of genes/proteins differentially expressed during endometriosis. Common regulatory transcription factors were subsequently identified for these up-regulated genes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) work was conducted to validate and analyze the expressional pattern of FOXD 3 in endometrial samples of 20 patients (n= 20). The expression in 10 normal fertile control endometrial samples (n= 10) was compared to 10 endometrial samples from women with active peritoneal endometriosis at two different stages of the menstrual cycle (proliferative phase and window of implantation). The same sets of samples were used to compare any changes in expression of Androgen receptors (AR) and Progesterone receptors (PR), based on findings we obtained from our bioinformatics work. RESULTS We found FOXD 3 to be the most common transcription involved in endometriosis, controlling 16 out of 38 up-regulated genes. SPP 1, PTGS 2, IL- 8, StAR and CXCR 4 were found to be strongly up regulated in patients with endometriosis. The same pattern of up-regulation genes was seen in gastric cancer. AR and PR were seen to interact centrally with other genes/proteins in the Ingenuity IPA network map. From the IHC work, we found FOXD 3 to be expressed in the luminal epithelium and glandular compartments of the normal proliferative endometrium. In patients with endometriosis, there was an increase in expression of FOXD 3 in the luminal epithelium and glands of secretory endometrium. There {{was no significant difference between}} the expressional pattern of AR and PR in the endometrium of normal fertile control women and endometriosis patients. DISCUSSION We concluded FOXD 3 to be a key player in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The transcription factor was able to control up-regulated genes on a cellular level in various pathological processes, which contribute to the development of endometriosis. We propose future work is needed to extend the <b>investigative</b> <b>measures</b> of FOXD 3 in the pathogenesis of endometriosis and elucidate how it can be a therapeutic target for treatment purposes in a clinical setting...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} part of crime investigation is the obtaining of evidence through the search and seizure of persons and things. The South African Constitution recognises that state authorities should not be permitted untrammelled access to search and seize. It is a necessary incident to democracy that citizens must be protected from unjustified intrusions of privacy and property by agents of the state. Otherwise, arbitrary state actions could severely affect the personal freedom and associated fundamental rights that are {{intended to be a}} predominant feature of democratic society. In this article I consider whether or not certain provisions contained in the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 and the South African Police Service Act 68 of 1995 (hereafter the Criminal Procedure Act and the South African Police Service Act respectively) are in conflict with the Constitution. The provisions deal with search and seizure. I will also turn to the laws of foreign jurisdictions, specifically of the United States and Canada, for guidance and comparison. At the outset {{it should be pointed out}} that this article does not argue for the abolition of the search and seizure provisions contained in the Criminal Procedure Act and the South African Police Service Act. It is acknowledged albeit reluctantly, that there may still be a need for some of them.

30|$|One of {{the goals}} of the WFD was to {{harmonise}} the monitoring strategies all over Europe, which differed among countries or even regions with respect to for example parameters recorded or metrics applied for the same endpoint. The WFD distinguishes three different types, in a tiered and cost-effective basic design: surveillance, operational and investigative monitoring. The surveillance monitoring shall be carried out at a sufficient number of sites to provide an assessment of the overall surface water status and aims to monitor the actual status and to assess long-term changes resulting from widespread anthropogenic activity. The operational monitoring should establish the status of those water bodies identified as being at risk of failing to meet the environmental objectives, and to assess any changes in the status of such water bodies that result from the programmes of <b>measures.</b> <b>Investigative</b> monitoring again shall be carried out where the causes of a water body failing to achieve the environmental objectives are unknown. MODELKEY developed innovative environmental assessment tools to support all three monitoring programmes to unravel unknown chemicals that might be responsible for the observed degradation.|$|R
