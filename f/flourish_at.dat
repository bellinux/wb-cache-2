5|$|The fourth {{chapter on}} the {{distribution}} and growth of coral reefs examines {{the conditions in which}} they flourish, their rate of growth and the depths at which the reef building polyps can live, showing that they can only <b>flourish</b> <b>at</b> a very limited depth. In the fifth chapter he sets out his theory as a unified explanation for the findings of the previous chapters, overcoming the difficulties of treating the various kinds of reef as separate and the problem of reliance on the improbable assumption that underwater mountains just happened to be at the exact depth below sea level, by showing how barrier reefs and then atolls form as the land subsides, and fringing reefs are found along with evidence that the land is being elevated. This chapter ends with a summary of his theory illustrated with two woodcuts each showing two different stages of reef formation in relation to sea level.|$|E

25|$|The Indo-Aryan {{languages}} are commonly assigned to three major groups – Old, Middle and New Indo-Aryan. The classification reflects consecutive stages {{in a common}} linguistic development, but {{is not merely a}} matter of chronology: Classical Sanskrit, as a codified derivate of Vedic Sanskrit, remains mostly representative of the Old Indo-Aryan stage, even though it continued to <b>flourish</b> <b>at</b> {{the same time as the}} Middle Indo-Aryan languages. Conversely, a number of the morphophonological and lexical features of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages show that they are not direct continuations of Ṛvedic Sanskrit, the main base of Classical Sanskrit. Instead they descend from other dialects similar to, but in some ways more archaic than Rigvedic.|$|E

500|$|Bewick did not <b>flourish</b> <b>at</b> schoolwork, {{but at a}} {{very early}} age showed a talent for drawing. He had no lessons in art. At the age of 14 he was apprenticed to Ralph Beilby, an {{engraver}} in Newcastle, where he learnt how to engrave on wood and metal, for example marking jewellery and cutlery with family names and coats of arms. In Beilby's workshop Bewick engraved a series of diagrams on wood for Charles Hutton, illustrating a treatise on measurement. He seems thereafter to have devoted himself entirely to engraving on wood, and in 1775 he received a prize from the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce for a wood engraving of the [...] "Huntsman and the Old Hound" [...] from Select Fables by the late Mr Gay, which he was illustrating.|$|E
500|$|Born in London, Holloway {{pursued a}} career as a clerk in his teen years. He made early stage {{appearances}} before infantry service in the First World War, after which he had his first major theatre success starring in Kissing Time when the musical transferred to the West End from Broadway. [...] In 1921, he joined a concert party, The Co-Optimists, and his career began to <b>flourish.</b> <b>At</b> first, he was employed chiefly as a singer, but his skills as an actor and reciter of comic monologues were soon recognised. [...] Characters from his monologues such as Sam Small, invented by Holloway, and Albert Ramsbottom, created for him by Marriott Edgar, were absorbed into popular British culture, and Holloway developed a following for the recordings of his many monologues. By the 1930s, he was in demand to star in variety, pantomime and musical comedy, including several revues.|$|E
500|$|The American {{musician}} Luther Noss {{reviewed the}} piece upon its publication by Boosey & Hawkes in 1952, stating {{that it was}} [...] "well written for the organ" [...] and [...] "remarkably free" [...] {{of some of the}} problems found in other modern organ music. He thought that it gave the impression of having been written with the organ in mind rather adapted from a piece intended for another instrument, unlike some other contemporary organ works. However, he commented that the theme provided little melodic or rhythmic interest and Britten used it, he thought, [...] "not without a suggestion of monotony." [...] Although the theme is [...] "not the stuff of which great music is made", Noss remarked on the [...] "exciting" [...] pedal <b>flourish</b> <b>at</b> the opening of the piece, the attractive use of melody and harmony, and [...] "grand crescendos and lingering diminuendos" [...] to keep the listener interested. Another early reviewer described it as [...] "spacious", with a [...] "by no means academic" [...] fugue and a style that [...] "suggests a modern romantic composer's appreciation of the more austere aspects of the classical organ school." [...] The review also noted that many of the accents marked in the piece [...] "seem incapable of realization by any of the usual methods of suggesting accentuation of the organ." ...|$|E

40|$|Orientation: Retaining {{staff is}} vital to ensure that {{universities}} accomplish their missions. To optimise the potential of staff members and retain staff, {{it is necessary to}} study their flourishing and fit in their jobs and organisations. Research purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between person-environment fit, <b>flourishing</b> <b>at</b> work and intention to leave. Motivation for the study: Research is needed to validate a measure of <b>flourishing</b> <b>at</b> work. Outcome variables such as intention to leave have not been studied in relation to <b>flourishing</b> <b>at</b> work. Moreover, it is necessary to study antecedents of <b>flourishing</b> <b>at</b> work, such as person-environment fit. Research approach, design and method: A cross-sectional survey design was used with a convenience sample of 339 academic employees from three universities of technology in South Africa. Three perceived fit scales, the Flourishing-at-Work Scale (FAWS) and the Turnover Intention Scale were administered. Main findings: Findings supported a three-factor model of <b>flourishing</b> <b>at</b> work, consisting of emotional, psychological and social well-being. The highest mean frequencies on flourishing dimensions were obtained for competence and emotional engagement. The lowest mean frequencies were obtained for relatedness and social well-being. Person-environment fit predicted intention to leave, both directly and indirectly, via flourishing. The findings support the internal consistency and validity of the FAWS. Practical/managerial implications: Managers and human resource practitioners should consider the use of a multidimensional measure to assess <b>flourishing</b> <b>at</b> work. Considering certain dimensions of well-being at work (e. g. work engagement and competence of employees) without considering other dimensions (e. g. job satisfaction, affect balance and meaning at work) will not be sufficient to assess and promote the subjective well-being of employees. Contribution/value-add: This study contributes to knowledge regarding the reliability and validity of a measure of <b>flourishing</b> <b>at</b> work. It confirms that person-environment fit has a strong positive effect on flourishing of employees and a strong negative effect on their intentions to leave. </p...|$|R
500|$|His batting {{continued}} to <b>flourish</b> <b>at</b> Somerset in first-class cricket; between 1999 and 2004, he consistently averaged over 35. His highest batting average came in 2000, when he scored 775 runs at 40.78. He was boosted that season by an early-season tally of 160 against Oxford Universities, {{as part of}} a 305-run partnership with Peter Bowler for the fourth wicket. The partnership was only five runs less than Somerset's record for the fourth wicket, made in 1980 by Peter Denning and Ian Botham. His performances in the County Championship were less impressive than his overall first-class record in 2000; he averaged below thirty in the competition, and only reached a century once, against Lancashire. In 2001, Burns reached his highest first-class score, and only double-century, scoring 221 against Yorkshire at the Recreation Ground in Bath. The total, made on what Wisden described as the [...] "benignest of pitches", included 28 fours and 1 six, and took seven and three-quarter hours. The match finished as a high-scoring draw, with over 1,000 runs being scored. Burns' score is the highest by a Somerset batsman at the Recreation Ground during a first-class match, although three players have scored more playing against Somerset at the ground; Reggie Spooner scored 240 runs in 1906, Mike Gatting got 258 in 1984 and Warwick Armstrong scored an unbeaten 303 for Australia in 1905. Burns also scored his second century in List A cricket during 2001, striking 101 not out against Northamptonshire from 112 balls. When Somerset captain Jamie Cox broke his thumb, Burns took charge of the team for six matches in June and July 2001, a role he reprised for eight matches the following season. In 2001, Somerset recorded one of the best seasons in their history: they finished second in the County Championship, their highest ever position, and won the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy.|$|E
