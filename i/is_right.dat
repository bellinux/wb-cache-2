5|$|Utilitarians {{believe that}} an action <b>is</b> <b>right</b> if it {{produces}} the best possible state of affairs. Traditional utilitarianism treats this as a claim that people should try {{to ensure that their}} actions maximise overall happiness or pleasure.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same}} time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

They have <b>been</b> <b>right</b> {{in killing}} all that grew larger than its kind--beast and plant {{and all manner}} of great things that arose. They <b>were</b> <b>right</b> in trying to {{massacre}} us. They <b>are</b> <b>right</b> now in saying we must not marry our kind. According to their lights they <b>are</b> <b>right.</b> They know--it <b>is</b> time that we also knew--that you cannot have pigmies and giants in one world together. Caterham has said that again and again--clearly--their world or ours." ...|$|R

The only other interchange between there and the terminus is Randall Avenue.|$|E

5|$|For {{many years}} the {{horticulture}} industry focussed on registered selections of Banksia spinulosa, {{but since the}} late 1990s more and more cultivars of Banksia ericifolia have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for their conditions and tastes. Banksia ericifolia is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not {{to the degree that}} the western Australian species such as B.coccinea and B.menziesii are.|$|E

Cleveland is also shown playing the pricing game Plinko. As Stewie and Brian decide to go berry-picking in the forest, actor Don Most slowly rises from the fog nearby as a chorus sings about his role as Ralph on the ABC sitcom Happy Days to the melody of the title song from Brigadoon.|$|E
5|$|Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful {{that his}} {{grandmother}} {{gives him a}} Remembrall, although he cannot remember why.

Despite his timidity, Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and important.|$|E

5000|$|The {{desire to}} <b>be</b> <b>right</b> {{and the desire}} to have <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>are</b> two desires, and the sooner we {{separate}} them the better off we are. The desire to <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>is</b> the thirst for truth. On all counts, both practical and theoretical, there is nothing but good to be said for it. The desire to have <b>been</b> <b>right,</b> on the other hand, is the pride that goeth before a fall. It stands in the way of our seeing we were wrong, and thus blocks the progress of our knowledge. —Willard V Quine and J. S. Ullian ...|$|R

Maria overhears the pair's conversation and chips in saying that she feels that Maddy is perfect. Michael knows Maria <b>is</b> <b>right</b> but Ric thinks he might have made a mistake and he explains to Maddy that he is withdrawing her interview offer. Maddy is devastated.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} network {{version of}} Millionaire {{was directed by}} Mark Gentile, who later served as the syndicated version's consulting producer for its first two seasons, and then {{as the director of}} Duel, which ran on ABC from December 2007 to July 2008. The syndicated version was directed by Matthew Cohen from 2002 to 2010, by Rob George from 2010 to 2013, and by Brian McAloon in the 2013–14 season. Former Price <b>Is</b> <b>Right</b> director Rich DiPirro became Millionaires director in 2014.|$|E

5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge the morality of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E

Simms also announced Weightlifting at the 1996 Summer Olympics and served as a sideline reporter on the NBA on NBC for NBC Sports.

5|$|During {{a costume}} party, Lois {{suggests}} Brian {{to find a}} girlfriend. After going to the bookstore to buy The God Delusion, Brian meets an atheist named Carolyn, {{who happens to be}} looking for the same book. Brian becomes interested in Carolyn, and the two begin to date. When she invites him to her house, Stewie apprehends Brian and tells him that his relationships fail because he has sex with his girlfriends immediately when they meet. Brian realizes that Stewie <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and decides to listen to his advice. However, he finds out that Carolyn has begun to date Cleveland, since Brian did not want to have sex for the three weeks they have dated, and assumed he just wanted to be friends. A heartbroken Brian tries to deal with his loss, but keeps running into Cleveland and Carolyn having sex in various locations. Blaming Stewie for his advice that cost him a relationship with Carolyn, Brian is about ready to give up on love. Apologizing for his botched attempt to help him out, Stewie suggests that he can convince Cleveland's ex-wife, Loretta, to reconcile with him.|$|E

5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster <b>is</b> <b>right</b> in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know the last thing that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero and Rock Band (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Wii), music game franchises {{which used}} {{specially}} designed controllers that mimicked musical instruments and allowed uses {{to play a}} large selection of licensed music, were extremely popular during the seventh generation, with over twenty different title releases across various platforms. Activision's Guitar Hero series sold more than 25 million units with over $2 billion in retail revenue, while Harmonix's Rock Band series has sold over 13 million copies; both series were augmented with a large volume of downloadable content. However, due to {{saturation of the market}} in 2009 along with the economic recess, both series have since ceased publishing, though Harmonix has stated they will bring back Rock Band to the eighth-generation when the time <b>is</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Blair {{promises}} his Chancellor, Gordon Brown {{that he will}} resign {{before the}} next general election, but later changes his mind. Brown subsequently attempts to blackmail him, threatened {{to call for a}} Labour Party inquiry into the 2005 Cash for Honours affair during an argument over pension policy. Brown succeeds Blair as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister in 2007. But while Blair praises Brown as a good Chancellor and a committed public servant, he believes his decision to abandon the New Labour policies of the Blair years leads to the party's 2010 election defeat. However, Brown <b>is</b> <b>right</b> to restructure British banks and introduce an economic stimulus after the financial crisis.|$|E

The other boys were flying around him now, flouting, scornful; and as he {{staggered}} about the deck striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall.
