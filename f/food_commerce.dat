40|$|During {{the past}} years the {{market share of}} trade chains has {{increased}} substantially in Hungarian <b>food</b> <b>commerce.</b> The concentration of <b>food</b> <b>commerce</b> and the increasing presence of international and national trade chains {{can be observed in}} Hungary as well. It is generally true that small and middle-sized food trading enterprises are not competitive compared to large trade chains. However, this fact does not mean that their reason for existence or their support is questionable. The former system of relations between <b>food</b> <b>commerce</b> and food industry has undergone radical changes due to the expansion of food chains. Due to the changes, requirements towards food industry have grown, food industry has to face fundamentally new mentality and concepts. In conclusion we can state that during the many-year presence of trade chains (multinational and Hungarian) food industry has tried to adapt to the transformed competition conditions even so far, and this process is going on. In addition to the fact that producers have to experience fundamental changes in mentality, economic policy has to provide this progress with the necessary background. A system of subsidies and regulations has to be established with the aim to prevent serious distortions by the expansion of trade chains. Economic policy has numerous known and yet unknown tasks in moderating the vulnerability of small and medium-sized enterprises against increasingly concentrating trade chains of large capital power. agricultural and food trade, relationship of producers and traders, supply chain, Industrial Organization, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

In {{the last part of the}} first section are mentioned foreign e-shop targeting Czech e-commerce market. In the third part are advantages of e-shopping summarized. Time saving, opening time, goods comparisons are briefly mentioned. The application part was aimed to Jednota’s future e-shop. That means that existing retail chain was chosen. So the foundation of e-shop is rather easier. Than the assortment of Czech e-shops was described, especially in connection with customers’ preferences. Customers’ shopping behavior was exa­mi­ned. So possible ways out could be founded. Following part takes care of implementation of food e-shop. Supply, logistic solution, payment solution, strategy of gaining and maintenance customers, contracting, information technologies, solutions and investment return were mentioned or solved. Results of the contribution are summarized in the conclusion. Relationship between theory of e-commerce and its application was highlighted as a necessary condition of its functioning in real world...|$|E
40|$|Food {{sovereignty}} {{is an alternative}} agricultural and rural development paradigm advocated by the international peasant movement La Vía Campesina. This investigation analyses food sovereignty through a historical cross-scale analysis focusing on the livelihoods of peasants in the sertão in North-Eastern Brazil. The overall aim is to assess the implementation and local effects of a policy, {{which is based on}} three food sovereignty principles, and determine in what ways and to what extent it promotes food sovereignty in practice. The three food sovereignty principles considered were support of peasants and small-scale family farmers, prioritisation and support of local food systems and commerce and promotion of agroecology. The policy analysed is the Brazilian government’s Food Acquisition Programme (FAP), as implemented in Mirandiba, Pernambuco by the NGO Conviver from 2005 - 2008. The analysis involved an assessment of the production and earnings by 359 participating families from 18 poor rural communities, as well as detailed case studies of the livelihood strategies of 14 families from two communities. A number of policy debates are explored, including rural poverty, food security and sustainable agricultural and rural development, to which this research provides three main contributions. Firstly, a new framework to explain the process of marginalisation of peasants through the influence of five mediating factors. Secondly, this framework helps deconstruct misconceptions about peasants and thereby provides support to La Via Campesina’s defence of ‘peasants’ and their livelihoods. Finally, as the first known indepth study of the implementation of the FAP on a local level, this investigation contributes to fill a gap in the research and literature on the operation and local impacts of both the FAP and governmental food procurement programmes more generally. This thesis argues food sovereignty can be achieved locally even within a context of general globalisation, through policies such as governmental food procurement programmes. The investigation concludes that food {{sovereignty is}} being pursued in areas of Brazil through the FAP and other progressive policies and movements, which are enabling peasants to improve their well-being, food security, self-esteem and to forge an adequate livelihood. The FAP is also contributing to the development of local <b>food</b> <b>commerce</b> systems and the promotion of agroecology both in Mirandiba and Brazi...|$|E
40|$|Historically, {{the people}} of Mozambique have faced oppression and social spatial {{segregation}} and responded {{in a way that}} has reinforced rather than dismantled their traditional values. Since pre-colonial times, the population’s strategy for escaping from environmental and foreign political disruption has been to reinvent tradition, based on the principles of resilience, resistance and self-reliance. The development of decentralised human settlements, involving the appropriation of land for domestic space and the self-organisation of neighbourhoods, were strategies to protect communities from adversity and secure collective self-reliance. Following Mozambique’s conversion to globalization, the post-colonial ‘cement city’ is now the core of neo-liberalism, as a node of the global economy, where foreign donors and international market economy control national political economy, exacerbating the premise of the negation of self-sufficiency that continues to evolve resiliently at its margins. The adoption of a neo-liberal model of development during the 1990 s, completely bypasses the realities of Mozambican society. This paper argues that the strategy of self-production of space regarding the household/Outdoor Domestic Space unit, which existed previously as a resistance strategy, first of all against colonialism and secondly, against the statist definition of socialism, thirdly, has become a successful strategy for survival, as the building block of the decentralised Agrocity, {{in the face of a}} global economy which totally neglects both the people and the land. Outdoor Domestic Space is a multifaceted space that refers to the external space surrounding the built house and which, in the case of Mozambique, is where daily life takes place, involving strong social, ecological and productive functions. Under successive periods of political economy oppression and environmental adversity, the Outdoor Domestic Space has been adapted and refined to ensure collective self-reliance. Shaping a green and ruralised urbanisation at the margins of the Mozambican post-colonial dualistic city, which I call the Agrocity, the Outdoor Domestic Space is resilient because it is able to adjust domestic space as a strategy to secure livelihoods, provide urban <b>food,</b> <b>commerce</b> and services, maintain vital kinship relationships and produce a comfortable and clean microclimate across the spontaneous neighbourhoods. This spatial resilience is the feature underlying the self-organisation of neighbourhoods with a new way of overcoming alienation from nature, which suggest the continuance of an innate relationship between society, the human habitat and natur...|$|E
