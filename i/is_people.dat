5|$|Life <b>Is</b> <b>People</b> is {{the fourth}} studio album by English singer, pianist and {{songwriter}} Bill Fay, released by Dead Oceans in August 2012. Fay had been without a record label after being dropped by Deram Records following the release of his second album, Time of the Last Persecution in 1971, and could not secure a release for his third album Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow. In order to support himself, Fay took various jobs outside of the music industry, while continuing to record music at home. In 1998, Fay's first two albums were reissued on compact disc by British record label See for Miles Records, prompting a revival of interest in his work, and Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow was finally released in 2005.|$|E

25|$|In {{line with}} the {{salience}} hypothesis, there is considerable evidence {{that people who have}} more vivid, intense or unusual dreams show better recall. There is evidence that continuity of consciousness is related to recall. Specifically, people who have vivid and unusual experiences during the day tend to have more memorable dream content and hence better dream recall. People who score high on measures of personality traits associated with creativity, imagination, and fantasy, such as openness to experience, daydreaming, fantasy proneness, absorption, and hypnotic susceptibility, tend to show more frequent dream recall. There is also evidence for continuity between the bizarre aspects of dreaming and waking experience. That <b>is,</b> <b>people</b> who report more bizarre experiences during the day, such as people high in schizotypy (psychosis proneness) have more frequent dream recall and also report more frequent nightmares.|$|E
25|$|As {{effective}} caregiving {{involves a}} great amount of responsibility, as well as the expenditure of cognitive, emotional, and/or tangible resources, caregivers must be sufficiently motivated in order to provide responsive support to their relationship partner. That <b>is,</b> <b>people</b> who do not possess enough motivation to help will be less effective at providing care that is appropriate for their partner's needs. Furthermore, individuals may differ in {{the degree to which they}} hold altruistic versus egoistic motivations for helping. Altruistic motivations are centred on the desire to advance the significant other's welfare, whereas egoistic motivations are centred on the desire to gain benefits for oneself, or to avoid sanctions for not helping and/or other negative consequences to the self. More altruistic and less egoistic motivations for caregiving are linked to better outcomes for the care recipient and enhanced relationship quality.|$|E

500|$|Daniel Paton of musicOMH {{said that}} [...] "Life <b>Is</b> <b>People</b> may not quite be the {{masterpiece}} {{so many people}} dearly want it to be...that being said, there are moments here so sublime and moving that could only have come from Fay." [...] Pitchfork reviewer Grayson Currin remarked that [...] "Life <b>Is</b> <b>People</b> and the tale that accompany it are strong enough...to at last make [...] reputation among many match his legacy among few", saying that [...] "at the risk of overstating the case, Life Is People—the work of a 69-year-old family man, {{and the work of}} a lifetime—confirms its maker's own thesis." [...] Critic Maria Schurr of PopMatters wrote that [...] "one half of Fay's Life <b>Is</b> <b>People</b> proves worthy of such a long wait...those who Life <b>Is</b> <b>People</b> touches are unlikely to hear a more inspiring album this year." [...] Prefix magazine's Matthew Fiander stated that while it [...] "does have its missteps...Life <b>is</b> <b>People</b> {{may not be the best}} Bill Fay, but hearing this there is no doubt about one thing: it's great to have him back.

500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Life <b>Is</b> <b>People</b> received an average score of 86, based on 21reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek stated that [...] "Fay performs these songs {{as if they}} were living things, independent of his inner world. His reverence for them makes the listening experience one of great emotional depth. Life <b>Is</b> <b>People</b> brims with compassion, vulnerability, and tenderness. It is not a comeback record but a late continuation, a great work of art." [...] Drew Litowitz of Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "little has changed. Fay's songs sound as if they've simply been hanging out in the ether for all these years, just waiting to be put to tape...Life <b>Is</b> <b>People</b> makes a strong argument for why Fay deserves recognition, and not just by those in the know." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick called the album a [...] "belated triumph" [...] which [...] "unfolds with the assurance of an old master still burning with the desire to tell his tales", saying that it was [...] "so much stronger than the latter-day works of many of Fay's contemporaries." [...] Critic Tom Hughes of The Guardian was less complimentary, noting that the album was [...] "not without a few syrupy moments, {{and it would be a}} push to recommend it over the old records" [...] but concluded that [...] "there are some fine songs here." [...] Andy Gill, writing for The Independent, said that [...] "Fay has finally created the masterpiece that will secure his reputation" [...] and added that Life <b>is</b> <b>People</b> was [...] "truly, the album of a lifetime." ...|$|E
