He criticized the indoors movement system, calling it unnecessarily complex to have two sets of commands for movement depending on where the player is and illogical to enter commands for walking backwards to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction.|$|E
500|$|On 2 February, Benfica {{played host to}} Boavista. They {{had several}} {{opportunities}} to beat William, but Boavista prevented them all. The match ended in a goalless draw, leaving Benfica one point away from the Estádio da Luz. Santos accepted the draw, saying, [...] "I {{do not like to}} speak about luck or misfortune. The ball just would not <b>go</b> <b>in.</b> <b>That</b> is it." [...] Eight days later, Benfica travelled to Estádio do Varzim to play the sixth round of the Portuguese Cup against Segunda Liga-side Varzim. The hosts opened the score with an own goal from Nélson in the 13th minute, but Benfica equalizer with a goal from Simão at the half-hour mark. In the second half, Varzim pressed again and António Mendonça scored a match-winning 77th-minute goal. Benfica's elimination at the hands of Varzim was the third time in Santos' career he was knocked-out of the Portuguese Cup by a team from lower divisions, the other clubs being Porto and Sporting.|$|E
500|$|The {{third season}} of the show {{saw some of the}} biggest changes; in {{addition}} to Richie's superhero powers and a new opening, Static changed his costume. Cowan stated that the change was done to give his clothes a [...] "feel of the comic book", while McDuffie said it represented a growth that Virgil was passing through. This maturation made possible to [...] "explore some of the darker places in his world," [...] to have more varied conflicts, as the villains have also become more mature. He described it is as [...] "a natural outgrowth of all that, as is the new, more naturalistic look of the show." [...] This change was followed by the second season premiere—"The Big Leagues"—when Static meets Batman and Robin. Burnett said, [...] "after that show, everybody went, 'Let's <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction.'" [...] Writer John Semper, Jr. commented, [...] "of course, I always lean toward the dramatic ... But the same old light-hearted Static spirit is still there." [...] Richie gains superhero powers because it was becoming hard to fit him into the story and the producers wanted to keep the [...] "chemistry" [...] between voice actors LaMarr and Marsden. There was also a positive response from children in focus groups so [...] "he answer seemed pretty obvious." ...|$|E

500|$|During September and October, Sherman and Hood played cat-and-mouse {{in north}} Georgia (and Alabama) as Hood {{threatened}} Sherman's communications to the north. [...] Eventually, Sherman won approval from his superiors for {{a plan to}} cut loose from his communications and march south, having advised Grant that he could [...] "make Georgia howl". [...] This created the threat that Hood would move north into Tennessee. [...] Trivializing that threat, Sherman reportedly {{said that he would}} [...] "give [...] his rations" [...] to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction as [...] "my business is down south". However, Sherman left forces under Maj. Gens. George H. Thomas and John M. Schofield to deal with Hood; their forces eventually smashed Hood's army in the battles of Franklin (November 30) and Nashville (December 15–16). Meanwhile, after the November elections, Sherman began a march with 62,000 men to the port of Savannah, Georgia, living off the land and causing, by his own estimate, more than $100 million in property damage. Sherman called this harsh tactic of material war [...] "hard war," [...] often seen as a species of total war. [...] At the end of this campaign, known as Sherman's March to the Sea, his troops captured Savannah on December 21, 1864. Sherman then dispatched a famous message to Lincoln, offering him the city as a Christmas present.|$|E

2500|$|Tales {{from other}} parts of Germany make mine kobolds {{beneficial}} creatures, at least if they are treated respectfully. Nineteenth-century miners in Bohemia and Hungary reported hearing knocking in the mines. They interpreted such noises as warnings from the kobolds to not <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction. Other miners claimed that the knocks indicated where veins of metal could be found: the more knocks, the richer the vein. In 1884, spiritualist Emma Hardinge Britten reported a story from a Madame Kalodzy, who claimed to have heard mine kobolds while visiting a peasant named Michael Engelbrecht: [...] "On the three first days after our arrival, we only heard a few dull knocks, sounding in and about the mouth of the mine, as if produced by some vibrations or very distant blows..." [...] Kobolds are sometimes portrayed as being indifferent to human miners, so long as they are left alone. In these depictions, they are content to simply mine ore themselves, collect it, and haul it away by windlass.|$|E

2500|$|Randel's {{surveying}} in 1808 {{had nothing}} to do with laying out the grid, which had not yet been determined as the final result of the Commission's work. [...] Instead, he was determining the topography and ground cover of the land and the placement of natural features such as hills, rocks, swamps, marshes, streams, and ponds, as well as man-made features such as houses, barns, stables, fences, foot paths, cleared fields and gardens. He was also carefully noting the locations of the three north-south roads that Goerck had laid down as part of his survey of the Common Lands. Goerck had not placed the lots and roads in the Common Lands in the context of the overall island, and this Randel did, thus allowing the Commissioners to know where, exactly, Goerck's Common Lands grid was. This was important, because it could serve as a template for a grid for the entire island, should the Commission decide to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction.|$|E

There was much speculation that Chandler Massey's Will Horton would be the character {{who turned out to be}} gay. Despite fan speculation about a romance, Chad and Will develop a great friendship. Deidrick revealed that [...] "Chill" [...] (Chad and Will) actually started off as a joke between himself and Massey. Deidrick admitted he would be open to the potential pairing if the writers were to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction. However, the characters remain friends even after Will comes out about his sexuality. Deidrick revealed to Soaps In Depth that he was open to the story, if the writers were truly willing to take his character in that direction. Chad also develops a friendship with openly gay character, Sonny Kiriakis (Freddie Smith). Their relationship is so unique, not only because of Deidrick and Smith's real-life friendship, but also because Daytime rarely showcased a [...] "best friend" [...] type relationship between gay and straight characters. Deidrick stated that [...] "Chad doesn't care" [...] about Sonny's sexuality.|$|E
2500|$|Boat 13 was {{partially}} filled from the Boat Deck and partially from A Deck {{after it had}} been lowered to that level when it was launched {{under the supervision of}} Murdoch and Moody at 1:40a.m. Again, it was heavily occupied, with 65 people aboard and Leading Fireman Frederick Barrett in charge. The occupants were mainly Second and Third Class women and children. Among the men aboard was Lawrence Beesley, who subsequently wrote a popular book about the disaster. Dr. Washington Dodge was also aboard, having earlier seen his wife and young son aboard Boat 5. He owed his presence aboard the boat to the apparent guilty feelings of Steward F. Dent Ray, who had urged the Dodges to sail on Titanic in the first place. Just before Boat 5 was lowered, Ray bundled Dodge aboard. 12-year-old Second Class passenger Ruth Becker was placed in this boat by Moody after being prevented from entering the heavily overloaded lifeboat number 11 which her mother and two siblings had boarded. She {{was one of the few}} passengers who brought blankets from her stateroom into a boat, which were later used to keep stokers, who were wearing sleeveless shirts, warm while rowing. Others did not want to board at all. A woman on deck became hysterical, crying, [...] "Don't put me in that boat! I don't want to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> boat!

2500|$|For Kierkegaard's author, Vigilius Haufniensis, anxiety/dread/angst (depending on the {{translation}} and context) is unfocused fear. Haufniensis uses {{the example of}} a man standing {{on the edge of a}} tall building or cliff. From this height he can see all the possibilities of life. He's reflecting on what he could become if he only threw himself into the power of his own choice. As long as he stands there he stands at the crossroads of life, unable to make a decision and live within its boundaries. The mere fact that one has the possibility and freedom to do something, even the most terrifying of possibilities, triggers immense feelings of dread. Haufniensis called this our [...] "dizziness of freedom."Anxiety may be compared with dizziness. He whose eye happens to look down into the yawning abyss becomes dizzy. But what is the reason for this? It is just as much in his own eye as in the abyss, for suppose he had not looked down. Hence, anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to [...] the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness. Further than this, psychology cannot and will not <b>go.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> very moment everything is changed, and freedom, when it again rises, sees that it is guilty. Between these two moments lies the leap, which no science has explained and which no science can explain. He who becomes guilty in anxiety becomes as ambiguously guilty as it is possible to become.

2500|$|Prior to the {{announcement}} about the gay storyline fans and critics alike {{pushed for a}} romantic pairing between Chad and Will due to the chemistry between the actors. Errol Lewis of Soap Opera Network explained that the two would have great potential as a romantic pairing, due to their heritage alone; with Chad being a DiMera, and Will being a Brady, would solidify the pairing as [...] "star-crossed lovers" [...] because of the long-standing feud between their families being staple within the series for so long. Despite both characters being involved in romantic pairings with females at the time, the pairing had already established a large fan base. The two, however, remain friends even when Will does {{turn out to be}} gay. The pairing is referred to by fans by their portmanteau [...] "Chill." [...] Despite the joke between costars, fans immediately began pushing for the pairing. Deidrick said he would be open to the potential pairing if the writers were to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> direction. In June 2011, the duo ranked at #2 in the [...] "Top Dream Couples" [...] category on TV Guide Canadas [...] "Soapgeist". Critics praised the writers for maintaining Chad and Will's friendship, and developing his friendship with Sonny despite both characters being gay. However, fans also pushed for a Sonny/Chad pairing after Chad defends him to a gay bully in September 2011. In response Smith jokingly shot down the idea and said that Chad is a little too tall for Sonny. Greg Hernandez said it was Chad's friendship with Will and Sonny that endeared him to the character. Fans also spoke out when Chad's friendship with Will and Sonny started taking a back seat to other storylines.|$|E
