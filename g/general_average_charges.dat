40|$|The <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> {{states of}} Pb- 188 and No- 252,No- 254 ions in dilute helium gas were {{measured}} at the gas-filled recoil separator TASCA. Hydrogen gas was also used as a filling gas for measurements of the <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> state of No- 254. Helium and hydrogen gases at pressures from 0. 2 mbar to 2. 0 mbar were used. A strong dependence of the <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> state on {{the pressure of the}} filling gases was observed for both, helium and hydrogen. The influence of this dependence, classically attributed to the so-called "density effect", on the performance of TASCA was investigated. The <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> states of No- 254 ions were also measured in mixtures of helium and hydrogen gases at low gas pressures around 1. 0 mbar. From the experimental results simple expressions for the prediction of <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> states of heavy ions moving in rarefied helium gas, hydrogen gas, and in their mixture were derived.

40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of copper ions and atoms in high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HIPIMS) discharges was determined by (i) measuring the ion current to electrostatic probes and (ii) measuring the film thickness by profilometry. A set of electrostatic and collection probes were placed at different angular positions and distances from the target surface. The angular distribution of the deposition rate and the <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> state of the copper species (including ions and neutrals) were deduced. The discharge showed a distinct transition to a high current mode dominated by copper self-sputtering when the applied voltage exceeded the threshold of 535 V. For a lower voltage, the deposition rate was very low and the <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> state {{was found to be}} less than 0. 4. For higher voltage (and average power), the absolute deposition rates were much higher, but they were smaller than the corresponding direct current (DC) rates if normalized to the same average power.

40|$|We {{have used}} the {{mechanical}} motion of a carbon nanotube (CNT) as a probe of the <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> on a quantum dot. Variations of the resonance frequency and the quality factor {{are determined by the}} change in <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> on the quantum dot during a mechanical oscillation. The <b>average</b> <b>charge,</b> in turn, is influenced by the gate voltage, the bias voltage, and the tunnel rates of the barriers to the leads. At bias voltages that exceed the broadening due to tunnel coupling, the resonance frequency and quality factor show a double dip as a function of gate voltage. We find that increasing the current flowing through the CNT at the Coulomb peak does not increase the damping, but in fact decreases damping. Using a model with energy-dependent tunnel rates, we obtain quantitative agreement between the experimental observations and the model. We theoretically compare different contributions to the single-electron induced nonlinearity, and show that only one term is significant for both the Duffing parameter and the mode coupling parameter. We also present additional measurements which support the model we develop: Tuning the tunnel barriers of the quantum dot to the leads gives a 200 -fold decrease of the quality factor. Single-electron tunneling through an excited state of the CNT quantum dot also changes the <b>average</b> <b>charge</b> on the quantum dot, bringing about a decrease in the resonance frequency. In the Fabry-Pérot regime, the absence of charge quantization results in a spring behavior without resonance frequency dips, which could be used, for example, to probe the transition from quantized to continuous charge with a nanomechanical resonator.
