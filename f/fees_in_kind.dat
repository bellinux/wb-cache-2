50|$|BBB made a {{lifestyle}} {{of being a}} coffee-house writer sitting in libraries, archives, and at café tables. He collected data, which he later organized in large, cultural-historical monographs. He made shorter essays and thick volumes, and he probably had his <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> from butchers, beer brewers, and café owners alike. Themes of essays and monographs from BBB’s early years covered {{the history of the}} malaria epidemic in Montenegro, Arthur Görgey’s Frauenhoffer and Dollond telescopes, and the keys of castle gates. He {{was also one of the}} apostles of Hungarian puppetry art, and identified historic artifacts in the royal graves at Székesfehérvár. Here can be found the Castle Károlyi, which was built from the castle of the Perényi family by Heinrich Koch Wiener architect in 1884.|$|E

50|$|Each {{county was}} the {{responsibility}} of a county head, whose seat was a castle - a quasi-capital of the county. The county head was {{the representative of the}} king, the judge, and the supreme law observance supervisor on his respective territory. He collected the <b>fees</b> and payments <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> made by the subjects for the king, gave two thirds of them to the king and kept the rest. His castle had special fortification and was able to withstand even long-term besieges. The sources mention deputy county heads in the 12th century for the first time.|$|R
50|$|It is {{worthwhile}} mentioning the first self-sacrificing mentors {{of the school}} - the lates Mr. Juan Raquel, Mr. Faustino Tamargo, Mr. Jesus Tobias and Miss Petra Bumatay. On {{the onset of the}} 1950s came Mrs. Caridad Villafuerte, Miss Carolina Tagorda, Mrs. Concepcion T. Briones, Mrs. Guadalupe J. Dumag, and Miss Consolacion Pacis (sister of Fr. Mariano F. Pacis). A lot of belt-tightening and patience were incurred by these early teachers, for salaries were drawn more from parish funds rather than from tuition fees of the students. The students' fees weren't enough to subsidize the teachers' compensations and other school needs. Often, tuition <b>fees</b> were paid <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> like eggs, rice, chicken, goat etc. which were then accepted by the director. As a matter of fact, teachers were paid only three times a year at those times, first upon enrollment, second on All Souls' Day, and third at the closing of the school year with a salary ranging from P100 to P150 a month. The teachers, who were more on service rather than monetary rewards, didn't complain for they have full knowledge and understanding on the financial situation of the school.|$|R

40|$|Existing {{literature}} on audit industry specialization in Anglo-American countries often measures industry specialization using firms' {{market share in}} specific industries from market recognition perspective. This paper contributes to the audit industry specialization research by distinguishing between market recognition specialization and resource allocation specialization, and tests their different effects on audit <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> the Chinese audit market. The results support the hypotheses that market recognition specialization is {{likely to lead to}} higher audit <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> the whole audit market, resource allocation specialization is likely to lead to lower audit <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> 'top-ten' audit firms, and there is likely to be no effect of resource allocation specialization on audit <b>fees</b> <b>in</b> 'non-top-ten' audit firms. The findings have implications for the regulators both in China and globally in designing strategies to enhance the functioning of audit firms. Importantly, the findings suggest that economic, political and social contexts of a country cannot be ignored in examining audit industry specialization. 16 page(s...|$|R
