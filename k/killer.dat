5|$|At a church, the <b>killer</b> {{is searching}} through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs {{a profile of the}} man, and deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing that the <b>killer</b> has suffered a devastating loss which has caused him to lose his own faith. As the manhunt for the <b>killer</b> tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the <b>killer</b> has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the <b>killer</b> as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Competition with {{fishermen}} {{also led}} to <b>killer</b> whales being regarded as pests. In {{the waters of the}} Pacific Northwest and Iceland, the shooting of <b>killer</b> whales was accepted and even encouraged by governments. As an indication of the intensity of shooting that occurred until fairly recently, about 25% of the <b>killer</b> whales captured in Puget Sound for aquarium through 1970 bore bullet scars. The U.S. Navy claimed to have deliberately killed hundreds of <b>killer</b> whales in Icelandic waters in 1956 with machine-guns, rockets, and depth charges.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, <b>killer</b> whales are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as <b>killer</b> whales in summer. <b>Killer</b> whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. <b>Killer</b> whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing reindeer to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E

5|$|<b>Killer</b> whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. <b>Killer</b> whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but {{this is likely to}} be the result of scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One <b>killer</b> whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident <b>killer</b> whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E

5000|$|By 2004, <b>Killers</b> had disbanded.

The {{number of staff}} members increased from 84 to 250, and Rare moved out from their headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse. Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game, <b>Killer</b> Instinct, on their own custom-built arcade machine. <b>Killer</b> Instinct was set to be released for Nintendo's own 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64 in 1995, but was forced to release the game for the 16-bit SNES system, and had to downgrade the game's graphics. <b>Killer</b> Instinct sold 3.2 million copies, and {{was followed by a}} sequel, <b>Killer</b> Instinct 2. <b>Killer</b> Instinct Gold, the console version of <b>Killer</b> Instinct 2, suffered from a graphical downgrade due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the very}} few {{confirmed}} attacks on humans by wild <b>killer</b> whales, none have been fatal. In one instance, <b>killer</b> whales tried to tip ice floes on which a dog team and photographer of the Terra Nova Expedition were standing. The sled dogs' barking is speculated to have sounded enough like seal calls to trigger the <b>killer</b> whale's hunting curiosity. In the 1970s, a surfer in California was bitten, and in 2005, a boy in Alaska who was splashing in a region frequented by harbor seals was bumped by a <b>killer</b> whale that apparently misidentified him as prey. Unlike wild <b>killer</b> whales, captive <b>killer</b> whales are reported to have made nearly two dozen attacks on humans since the 1970s, {{some of which have}} been fatal.|$|E

50|$|Juvenile serial <b>killers</b> are uncommon.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Pacific Northwest Coast feature <b>killer</b> whales throughout their art, history, spirituality and religion. The Haida regarded <b>killer</b> whales {{as the most powerful}} animals in the ocean, and their mythology tells of <b>killer</b> whales living in houses and towns under the sea. According to these myths, they took on human form when submerged, and humans who drowned went to live with them. For the Kwakwaka'wakw, the <b>killer</b> whale was regarded as the ruler of the undersea world, with sea lions for slaves and dolphins for warriors. In Nuu-chah-nulth and Kwakwaka'wakw mythology, <b>killer</b> whales may embody the souls of deceased chiefs. The Tlingit of southeastern Alaska regarded the <b>killer</b> whale as custodian of the sea and a benefactor of humans.|$|E
5|$|The <b>killer</b> whale {{is one of}} 35 {{species in}} the oceanic dolphin family, which first {{appeared}} about 11 million years ago. The <b>killer</b> whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the pygmy <b>killer</b> whale, the false <b>killer</b> whale and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella.|$|E

5000|$|The racial {{demographics}} regarding serial <b>killers</b> {{are often}} subject to debate. In the United States, {{the majority of}} reported and investigated serial <b>killers</b> are white males, from a lower-to-middle-class background, usually in their late twenties to early thirties. However, there are African American, Asian, and Hispanic (of any race) serial <b>killers</b> as well, and, according to the FBI, based on percentages of the U.S. population, whites are not more likely than other races to be serial <b>killers.</b> Criminal profiler Pat Brown says serial <b>killers</b> are usually reported as white because serial <b>killers</b> usually target victims of their own race, and the media typically focuses on [...] "All-American" [...] white and pretty female victims who were the targets of white male offenders; that crimes among minority offenders in urban communities, where crime rates are higher, are under-investigated; and that minority serial <b>killers</b> likely exist at the same ratios as white serial <b>killers</b> for the population. She believes that the myth that serial <b>killers</b> are always white might have become [...] "truth" [...] in some research fields due to the over-reporting of white serial <b>killers</b> in the media.|$|R

5|$|Underwater {{noise from}} shipping, drilling, {{and other human}} {{activities}} is a significant concern in some key <b>killer</b> whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. <b>Killer</b> whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs <b>killer</b> whales along with other marine mammals. <b>Killer</b> whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.|$|E
