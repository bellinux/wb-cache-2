5000|$|Bernard Wendall Doyle (1873 - December 26, 1949) was an American {{industrialist}} and philanthropist. In 1901, Doyle cofounded the Viscoloid Company in Leominster, Massachusetts. [...] Doyle helped pioneer {{the use of}} pyroxylin plastic {{for making}} hair combs and accessories. [...] Soon the Viscoloid Company would expand into a range of products {{and became one of}} the leading pyroxlyin plastic manufactures in the country. [...] Doyle would also help found the Merchants National Bank of Leominster in 1912. [...] By 1923, Doyle had become chief executive of the entire Viscoloid Company and by that same year, the company had a capital of three million dollars and employed over 60% of the Leominster workforce. In 1925, he sold his interest of the Viscoloid Company to Dupont de Nemours. Bernard Doyle remained on as vice-president of the renamed Dupont Viscoloid Company until his retirement. The Leominster complex was also renamed the “Doyle Works” of the Dupont Viscoloid Company. Throughout his life Bernard Doyle {{was one of the most}} prominent and philanthropic citizens Central Massachusetts has ever seen. He served as the second Leominster city mayor from 1920-1924, as well as donating the entire Doyle Field athletic complex to the city in 1931. He also contributed generously to Leominster Hospital, the Notown Reservoir, St. Leo’s Church in Leominster and countless other ventures throughout north central Massachusetts. At the time of his death, Doyle was a director of the Merchants National Bank of Boston, Boston Edison Company, Boston and Maine Railroad, Massachusetts Life Insurance Company of Springfield, member of the Finance Committee of the United States Rubber Company, directory of the Safety Fund National Bank of Fitchburg, and vice-president of the <b>Independent</b> <b>Lock</b> Company of Fitchburg. [...] Doyle was also a trustee of both Northeastern University and Cushing Academy. [...] Bernard Doyle first married Elizabeth Haley, together they had two daughters: Marjorie Doyle Rockwell and Louise Doyle. [...] After his wife’s death, Doyle remarried in 1949 to Rachel Butler. Bernard Doyle died on December 26, 1949.|$|E

40|$|Theories {{based upon}} strong real space (r-space) {{electron}} electron interactions have long predicted that unidirectional charge density modulations (CDM) with four unit cell (4 a_ 0) periodicity should {{occur in the}} hole doped cuprate Mott insulator (MI).

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. January 2015. Major: Computer Science. Advisor: Antonia Zhai. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 122 pages. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) {{are becoming increasingly}} popular not only across various scientific communities, but also as integrated data-parallel accelerators on existing multicore processors. Support for massive fine-grained parallelism in contemporary GPUs provides {{a tremendous amount of}} computing power. GPUs support thousands of lightweight threads to deliver high computational throughput. Popularity of GPUs is facilitated by easy-to-adopt programming models such as CUDA and OpenCL that aim to ease programmers' efforts while developing parallel GPU applications. However, designing and implementing correct and efficient GPU programs is still challenging since programmers must consider interaction between thousands of parallel threads. Therefore, addressing these challenges is essential for improving programmers' productivity as well as software reliability. Towards this end, this dissertation proposes mechanisms for improving programmability of irregular applications and ensuring correctness of compute kernels. Some applications possess abundant data-level parallelism, but are unable to take advantage of GPU's parallelism. They exhibit irregular memory access patterns to the shared data structures. Programming such applications on GPUs requires synchronization mechanisms such as locks, which significantly increase the programming complexity. Coarse-grained locking, where a single lock controls all the shared resources, although reduces programming efforts, can substantially serialize GPU threads. On the other hand, fine-grained locking, where each data element is protected by an <b>independent</b> <b>lock,</b> although facilitates maximum parallelism, requires significant programming efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose transactional memory (TM) on GPU that is able to achieve performance comparable to fine-grained locking, while requiring minimal programming efforts. Transactional execution can incur runtime overheads due to activities such as detecting conflicts across thousands of GPU threads and managing a consistent memory state. Thus, in this dissertation we illustrate lightweight TM designs that are capable of scaling to a large number of GPU threads. In our system, programmers simply mark the critical sections in the applications, and the underlying TM support is able to achieve performance comparable to fine-grained locking. Ensuring functional correctness on GPUs that are capable of supporting thousands of concurrent threads is crucial for achieving high performance. However, GPUs provide relatively little guarantee with respect to the coherence and consistency of the memory system. Thus, they are prone to a multitude of concurrency bugs related to inconsistent memory states. Many such bugs manifest as some form of data race condition at runtime. It is critical to identify such race conditions, and mechanisms that aid their detection at runtime can form the basis for powerful tools for enhancing GPU software correctness. However, relatively little attention has been given to explore such runtime monitors. Most prior works focus on the software-based approaches that incur significant overhead. We believe that minimal hardware support can enable efficient data race detection for GPUs. In this dissertation, we propose a hardware-accelerated data race detection mechanism for efficient and accurate data race detection in GPUs. Our evaluation shows that the proposed mechanism can accurately detect data race bugs in GPU programs with moderate runtime overheads...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{one such}} proposal. It {{is based on}} a hardware mechanism called Transactional Lock Removal [2] (TLR), which was originally designed to support the atomic execution of critical sections by a lock-based multithreaded program in a lock-free manner. In this paper, we explain the mechanism and suggest how it could be used to control the atomic execution of transactions in a database system. The TLR hardware identifies, at runtime, lock-protected critical sections in the program and executes these sections without acquiring the lock. TLR maintains correct semantics of the program in the absence of locks by executing and committing all operations in the now lock-free critical section "atomically". Any updates performed during the critical section execution are locally buffered in processor caches. They are made visible to other threads instantaneously {{at the end of the}} critical section.

Problems of optical feedback, modulation waveform errors, mechanical support and isolation of the reference cavity, thermal stabilization of the environment, etc. are considered, and interim solutions are discussed.

40|$|Hierarchical {{scheduling}} frameworks (HSFs) {{have been}} extensively investigated as a paradigm for facilitating temporal isolation between components {{that need to}} be integrated on a single shared processor. In the presence of shared resources, however, temporal isolation may break when one of the accessing components executes longer than specified during global resource access. The ability to confine such temporal faults makes the HSF more dependable. As a solution we propose a stack-resource-policy (SRP) -based synchronization protocol for HSFs, named Hierarchical Synchronization protocol with Temporal Protection (HSTP). When a component exceeds its specified critical-section length, HSTP enforces a component to self-donate its own budget to accelerate the resource release. In addition, a component that blocks on a locked resource may donate budget. The schedulability of those components that are <b>independent</b> of the <b>locked</b> resource is unaffected. HSTP efficiently limits the propagation of temporal faults to resource-sharing components by disabling local preemptions in a component during resource access.

This work expands existing numerical and analytical investigations on a model riser with constant curvature in shear flow condition. The results indicate that for a flexible model riser displaced in non-uniform shear flow when VIV occurred, the curvature shows substantial effects on lock-in response and multi-mode non-lock-in response. The modal coupling effect on lock-in response repeats the same effect on the structure in air, which indicates that modal coupling effect seems <b>independent</b> to the <b>locking</b> phenomenon.

Diffraction effects, atmospheric transmission efficiency, adaptive compensation for atmospheric turbulence effects, including the servo bandwidth requirements for this correction, and the adaptive compensation for thermal blooming were examined. To evaluate possible HEL sources, atmospheric investigations were performed for the CO 2, (C- 12) (O- 18) 2 isotope, CO and DF wavelengths using output antenna locations of both sea level and mountain top. Results indicate that both excellent atmospheric and adaption efficiency can be obtained for mountain top operation with a micron isotope laser operating at 9. 1 um, or a CO laser operating single line (P 10) at about 5. 0 (C- 12) (O- 18) 2 um, which was a close second in the evaluation.

50|$|The {{most common}} active {{mode-locking}} technique places a standing wave electro-optic modulator into the laser cavity. When driven with an electrical signal, this produces a sinusoidal amplitude modulation {{of the light}} in the cavity. Considering this in the frequency domain, if a mode has optical frequency ν, and is amplitude-modulated at a frequency f, the resulting signal has sidebands at optical frequencies ν &minus; f and ν + f. If the modulator is driven at the same frequency as the cavity-mode spacing Δν, then these sidebands correspond to the two cavity modes adjacent to the original mode. Since the sidebands are driven in-phase, the central mode and the adjacent modes will be phase-locked together. Further operation of the modulator on the sidebands produces phase-locking of the ν &minus; 2f and ν + 2f modes, and so on until all modes in the gain bandwidth are locked. As said above, typical lasers are multi-mode and not seeded by a root mode. So multiple modes need to work out which phase to use. In a passive cavity with this locking applied {{there is no way to}} dump the entropy given by the original <b>independent</b> phases. This <b>locking</b> is better described as a coupling, leading to a complicated behavior and not clean pulses. The coupling is only dissipative because of the dissipative nature of the amplitude modulation. Otherwise, the phase modulation would not work.|$|R
40|$|Fault creep, {{depending}} on its rate and spatial extent, {{is thought to}} reduce earthquake hazard by releasing tectonic strain aseismically. We use Bayesian inversion and a newly expanded GPS data set to infer the deep slip rates below assigned locking depths on the San Andreas, Maacama, and Bartlett Springs Faults of Northern California and, for the latter two, the spatially variable interseismic creep rate above the locking depth. We estimate deep slip rates of 21. 5 ± 0. 5, 13. 1 ± 0. 8, and 7. 5 ± 0. 7 mm/yr below 16 km, 9 km, and 13 km on the San Andreas, Maacama, and Bartlett Springs Faults, respectively. We infer that on average the Bartlett Springs fault creeps from the Earth's surface to 13 km depth, and below 5 km the creep rate approaches the deep slip rate. This implies that microseismicity may extend below the locking depth; however, we cannot rule out the presence of locked patches in the seismogenic zone that could generate moderate earthquakes. Our estimated Maacama creep rate, while comparable to the inferred deep slip rate at the Earth's surface, decreases with depth, implying a slip deficit exists. The Maacama deep slip rate estimate, 13. 1 mm/yr, exceeds long-term geologic slip rate estimates, perhaps due to distributed off-fault strain or the presence of multiple active fault strands. While our creep rate estimates are relatively insensitive to choice of model <b>locking</b> depth, insufficient <b>independent</b> information regarding <b>locking</b> depths {{is a source of}} epistemic uncertainty that impacts deep slip rate estimates...|$|R
40|$|U radu se analiziraju izvorni fragmenti portretne stele otkrivene godine 1826. na zapadnoj salonitanskoj nekropoli te se uspoređuju s prikazima u crtežima, napose onim kojeg je izradio dubrovački slikar Rafael Martini. Temeljem oblikovnih i strukturalnih karakteristika utvrđuje se tipološka pripadnost stele i definira njezina grupa u Saloni i bližoj okolici. Zaključuje se kako je riječ o grupi od pet stela s tzv. prekinutim zabatom i portretnom školjkom, nastaloj prihvaćanjem italskoga oblika koji je vrlo rano uveden u repertoar salonitanskih radionica, a potom je postupno doživio značajne transformacije i na kraju drukčiju tipizaciju. Na taj je način nastala prepoznatljiva lokalna shema u funkciji skupne prezentacije. Za vrijeme izrade predmetne stele predlaže se razdoblje od kraja Tiberijeva do početka Klaudijeva doba. In 1826, at the Salona 2 ̆ 7 s western necropolis, {{next to the}} Lollius family mausoleum, K. Lanza {{discovered}} a funerary stele showing portraits of five diseased persons (Archaeological Museum in Split inventory number D 2). It was published by his son, Frane (Francesco), in 1856, in the book Monumenti Salonitani inediti. Its publishing brought no details on the circumstances {{and the state of}} the find. It is only stated that the stele is made of lime stone, that it shows five busts in low relief, below lions, and that it is of a medium quality. Presented is also a drawing made by an unknown author, but of quite generalised details (Fig. 1). There is another, much better, drawing of the stele (Fig. 2), kept in the Archaeological Museum in Split. It is made by the painter of Dubrovnik, Nikola Rafael Martini (1771 - 1846), one of the best known representatives of the Neo-Classicistic painting in Dalmatia and a renowned portraitist of his time. The drawing is a superb document of development of technical (graphic) documentation of the time, but also of Martini 2 ̆ 7 s activities in general, because not many of his works have been preserved. The quality of the drawing is allowing us to watch details of the monument that have been destroyed almost out of recognition in the meantime. Namely, due to numerous relocations of the Museum and its collections and their inadequate storing, occasionally even in former salt warehouses, the stele was heavily damaged already {{in the first half of}} the 19 th century. This is why it has not been placed in the newly built Museum 2 ̆ 7 s lapidary, but its remains have been placed, and then even lost, in its back courtyard. In the early 1970 s, a photograph was made showing its upper part (Fig. 3), and during the recent arranging of the courtyard both it parts were {{discovered a}}gain (Figs. 4, 5). They have never been analysed or published. The smaller (upper) part (Fig. 4) demonstrates two original dimensions of the stele: 0. 82 m in width, and 0. 40 m in thickness. Traces of the monument 2 ̆ 7 s original structure are better visible in the 1970 s photograph (Fig. 3). Autopsy, however, shows the portraits to be made of about a half life size of an adult person, wherefore there is no doubt that the figures shown are of a boy and a girl, their heads slightly turned towards each other. Comparison with the drawings (Figs. 1, 2) shows the external form and all elements of internal composition of the upper part of the stele to be presented exactly and in adequate format. The details seen in the drawings - especially the one by Martini - that are not preserved on the very monument, are lateral acroteria, shaped like lions, and the base of the central one, a smaller figure of a winged erot in the area below the gable and the shell, a beam with two fascias and peak profile, and architectural apparatus presented at both sides. Preserved is only a remain of the central base shaped like a smaller canal for the metal clamp that fixed the element that was placed here (Fig. 6). The distribution of the figures by sex corresponds to that in the lower field. The girl is undoubtedly shown palliata, and the boy, depending on the status, could be wearing both a pallium and a toga, probably the latter (toga praetexta?). The larger fragment shows in traces preserved half-figures of three adult deceased, and belonges to the former lower part of the stele (Fig. 5). If now the amorphous piece is compared with the drawings (Fig. 1, 2), it is noticed that it is structurally well positioned into the monument as a whole, particularly well being presented the deceased persons portraits and habitus. The drawings in the centre show a middle aged man (Martini 2 ̆ 7 s drawing), to his right side being a younger woman, and far left a younger man. In the Martini 2 ̆ 7 s drawing the men 2 ̆ 7 s heads are presented slightly turned towards the woman, this posture also being marked by shading the eyes. The rest of the relief is supporting such posture. It is reasonable to assume that on the right are shown portraits of spouses and parents to at least some of other figures. The woman is shown palliata (Fundilia or Eumachia type). The men wear identically draped cloaks over tunics, however here too a certain identification of the toga is lacking the umbus. Mild bending of the drapes above the central man 2 ̆ 7 s arm may indicate that this element was envisaged but, due to the height of the image, not made. If this is so, this would be the most frequent early imperial type of toga, with balteus, umbus and sinus, but covering the right shoulder. In the Martini 2 ̆ 7 s drawing, between the two fields, clearly visible is a deeper cut in which there are two plates by their position appearing like consoles (Fig. 2). Such details not being known of in the portrait stelai of Salona, but also wider, this is probably a hidden indication that at the moment the drawing was made the stele was already broken into two pieces. It is possible that it was discovered in this condition. This supports the assumption that the different ways of showing the frame also result from a reconstruction made in a typically romantic-neo-classicistic way. Anyway, the Martini 2 ̆ 7 s drawing is presenting a more complete situation, the other one already showing deterioration of some parts (central and left acroteria, seated erot). According to the external form and the internal composition, this Salonitan stele belongs to the architectonic type, and the variant thereof known as the aedicula-form stelai with interrupted (open) gable. It is conceived as a flat imitation of large tomb aediculae and similar structures without an architrave. Its distant origin is in the Hellenistic east, whereas the origin of the type with integrated shell within the niche canopy is certainly in the northern Italy. It was developed with the only intention to carry the portraits of the deceased, because it has not been noticed among plain, inscription, stelai. The aedicula-form stelai with interrupted gable appear in two variants in Dalmatia. In the first variant, in the gable area inserted is a niche canopy sheltering one portrait of half-figure height. The transition from the niche into the canopy is usually marked with a moulded beam, whereas the very niche can be added a moulded arch in front. In the other variant, in the niche and gable space integrated is a portrait shell. It is also found in single portrait stelai (Fig. 7), but much more often as representative background of a pair of portraits. So far, four such stelai are known of, as many as three of them certainly from Salona: the fragment with the head of an older man from the last decades of the 1 st century BC (here no. 1, Fig. 8), the stele of the Attius family of the late Claudian or Neronian periods (no. 2, Fig. 10), and the stele that is being discussed here (no. 5). Possibly of Salnitan origin is also the stele shown in the drawing kept in the State Archives in Turin from the mid 1 st century (no. 3, Fig. 9), whereas the stele of Marco Pytha, a soldier of the 2 nd cohort Cyrrhestarum, and his freedman, Felix, dated to the early Flavian period, was discovered in Gornji Rakićani near Gardun (no. 4, Fig. 11). The above listed stelai make a homogenous and by their origin almost closed group of monuments, created in the period from the very end of the 1 st century BC till the Flavian period. It is reasonable to claim that this visual expression appeared and developed in Dalmatia within the Salonitan workshop circle. The portrait shell motif will appears occasionally also later, in the 2 nd and the 3 rd centuries, but obviously as a retardation of this, at that time already outmoded, element, often within a newly designed composition and with a changed role or orientation of the shell. The assumed north-Italic origin of the stele type with interrupted gable and portrait shell can be proved by the facts that the actual architectural characterisation of Hellenistic stelai in Dalmatia is practically unknown of, and that they do not practice the interrupted gable. Hence the conclusion that the interrupted gable with the inserted niche and shell was introduced as a significant novelty in the beginning of the Roman provincial style. Since in the northern Italy (especially in Altinum) relatively numerous exact typological comparisons have been found, a reasonable assumption is that this was the source of this form. A more detailed analysis shows that Italic samples and solutions were not automatically adopted in the Salonitan workshops repertoire, but that they underwent significant modifications. The links between the stelai of the two Adriatic shores are evident in the overall proportions, interior structure of the aedicula, function of the shell and distribution of the human figures. The differences are in designing of the architectural apparatus, the way in which the gable is positioned on top of it, orientation of the shell and appearance of the inscription field. In the north-Italic stelai, the load bearing architectonic apparatus is formed of pilasters or columns, but most often of pilasters, sometimes with vegetative decoration. In Dalmatia, however, these are helical columns (the only exception is the stele dealt with here!). Furthermore, stelai in Dalmatia have only one tier of supports, whereas in Italy they often have a second (back) tier. In the north-Italic stelai, the gable is laid directly on capitals, whereas in the Dalmatian ones between the capital and the gable normally visible are ends of an interrupted architrave, manifested as one or two straight stripes. Only in the stele of M. Pytha, that is the youngest one, the architrave ends remained hidden behind the capitols. On the Apennine side of the Adriatic, the shell is almost always positioned with its back side (heart) upwards, whereas all the stelai of the Dalmatian group and the stele of M. Pytha are characterised by the shell being turned with its back side down. It is to be pointed out that the Salonitan stelai too show this practice of the opposite side of the Adriatic, but only where this is about individual presentation! Finally, in the Dalmatian stelai the inscription field is conceived as a separate field that supports the aedicule, whereas in the Italic ones the inscription seldom has a moulded edge and is subordinate to the architecture! This makes it evident that Salonitan workshops developed a recognisable style of their own, aimed to group presentation. Although at the first sight they apear very much like the north-Italic stelai (especially those from Altina and Aquilea) and obviously are making a branch of the same developmental tree, the Salonitan, architecturally designed, stelai with interrupted gable and shell - including the stele of M. Pytha - are of a different make and typology. Male portraits with short hair falling to the forehead indicate general fashion characteristics of the Julian-Claudian period, but have nothing in common with the Neronian period fashion. Hairstyle of the girl in the upper field (Mittelscheitelfrisur) and the similar but more sumptuous hairstyle of the woman in the lower field, with the hair waves reaching down half the ears (Wallenfrisur) and the spirally formed locks (presented as long braids) make characteristics of women fashion of the Tiberian period. However, in the Salonitanian sculptural heritage they are also reflected in monuments until and including the Claudius 2 ̆ 7 principate. Since their promoters, Antonia Minor and Agripina Minor, were honoured also during the Caligula 2 ̆ 7 s and the Caludius 2 ̆ 7 principates, and since with the older woman in the stele 2 ̆ 7 s lower field two such massive locks can be recognised on each side of the neck, of the length and direction comparable to the Claudian creations, it appears reasonable dating the stele to the period from the end of the Tiberian to the early Claudian principates. In Dalmatia, however, numerous female heads with this hairstyle type are known, dated from the 20 s to the 50 s AD. This proposed dating is supported also by the possibility of noticing some worn out <b>independent</b> <b>locks</b> above the woman 2 ̆ 7 s left ear, but this is not perfectly certain. Important is also the fact that leaf-shaped decoration of columns in the Salonitan sculptural heritage appears most rarely, and one of such examples, potentially directly comparable, is the stele of Q. Fabius Pacatus, a soldier of the 11 th legion C. p. f., obviously created after the year 42 AD...|$|R
