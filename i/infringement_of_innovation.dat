40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the risk}} of intellectual property (IP) infringements by competitors from abroad and in particular whether this risk is higher for international innovating firms. We distinguish three different types <b>of</b> IP <b>infringements</b> from abroad: the usage of firms' technical inventions, product piracy and copying of corporate names and designs. Our analysis rests on the German data from the Europe-wide Community Innovation Survey (CIS). We use a unique data set of about 900 observations which are retrieved from two survey waves. While the earlier wave contains information about international and domestic innovation activities the later wave reports IP infringements. In a second analysis, the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> from <b>innovation</b> host countries and no innovation host countries abroad is examined. Before the empirical analysis, an explorative study {{has been carried out}} in China with interviews of German firms with innovation activities in China and with a legal advisor for small and medium sized German enterprises. The results show that firms with international R&D activities are increasing their chances to lose technological knowledge to their local competitors abroad. R&D activities in countries with weak intellectual property rights increase the risk for all types <b>of</b> <b>infringement.</b> Infringements by competitors from the host country are driven by the production <b>of</b> <b>innovations</b> in this country. Export intensity is the major driver <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> from no <b>innovation</b> host countries. R&D activities in China and North America also increase the risk <b>of</b> an <b>infringement.</b> However, firms that innovate only in their home country experience significantly more product piracy cases than internationally innovating firms...|$|R
40|$|Using {{data from}} the German Community Innovation Survey (CIS) from 2008, we analyze whether {{innovation}} partnering increases the risk <b>of</b> experiencing <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> intellectual property (IP). The results show that depending on types <b>of</b> IP <b>innovation,</b> partnerships increase the risk <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> by up to 37 % compared with the average risk in the sample. The results suggest that this massive increase can be reduced by IP rights and contracts to govern the partnerships. Yet, we show that formal protection mechanisms do not eliminate the sources <b>of</b> opportunistic <b>infringement,</b> because that infringement in innovation partnerships more commonly relates to the <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> formally unprotected IP, such as tacit knowledge and know-how...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the notion of danger in {{criminal}} law, which forms a basis for the legislator to construct dogmatic figures that serve the purpose of penalization of behaviour which is preliminary to <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> intangible assets. Danger is a phenomenon that exists in objective reality (there is or there is not a certain phenomenon). However, for full characteristics of danger, a subject’s assessment of the phenomenon is indispensable, which leads to a conclusion that danger is a subjective phenomenon. Danger is a phenomenon connected with existing probability <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> intangible assets. This probability must exceed a certain threshold of intensification (e. g. it must be substantial or high). It is not important for the existence of danger whether there has been an <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> an intangible asset or not (an infringement can occur, but does not have to). <b>Infringement</b> <b>of</b> an intangible asset does not have to follow previous danger, and danger does not have to result in <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> an intangible asset...|$|R

40|$|International audiencePiracy as <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> {{intellectual}} property {{is considered a}} major issue in innovation processes. The assessment of what piracy is mainly bases on legal criteria and is done from an organisational perspective. Current innovation processes particularly with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises are characterised by nonlinear collaboration forms which involve different stakeholders from various origins. Within such communities intense knowledge exchange across firms’ boundaries is inevitably and {{can be seen as a}} source for idea development. In this paper, the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>innovation</b> and knowledge processes are therefore discussed from a practice-based and process perspective. It is argued that current assessments of piracy do not meet practice demands <b>of</b> open <b>innovation</b> processes and rather restrain idea development. An example case from a SME type firm illustrates practice of innovation-based collaboration...|$|R
