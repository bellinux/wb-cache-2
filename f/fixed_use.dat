40|$|We {{present the}} {{strategy}} {{which has been}} used recently to optimize integrated luminosity at the Fermilab Tevatron proton-antiproton collider. We use a relatively simple model where we keep the proton intensity <b>fixed,</b> <b>use</b> parameters from fits to the luminosity decay of recent stores {{as a function of}} initial antiproton intensity (stash size), and vary the stash size to optimize the integrated luminosity per week. The model assumes a fixed rate of antiproton production, that a store is terminated as soon as the target stash size for the next store is reached, and that the only downtime is due to store turn-around time. An optimal range of stash sizes is predicted. Since the start of Tevatron operations based on this procedure, we have seen an improvement of approximately 35 % in integrated luminosity. Other recent operational improvements have been achieved by decreasing the shot-setup time and by reducing beam-beam effects by making the proton and antiproton brightnesses more compatible, for example by scraping protons to smaller emittances.

40|$|The Easy Path Wavelet Transform is an {{adaptive}} transform for bivariate functions (in particular natural images) {{which has been}} proposed in [1]. It provides a sparse representation by finding a path {{in the domain of}} the function leveraging the local correlations of the function values. It then applies a one dimensional wavelet transform to the obtained vector, decimates the points and iterates the procedure. The main drawback of such method is the need to store, for each level of the transform, the path which vectorizes the two dimensional data. Here we propose a variation on the method which consists of firstly applying a segmentation procedure to the function domain, partitioning it into regions where the variation in the function values is low; in a second step, inside each such region, a path is found in some deterministic way, i. e. not data-dependent. This circumvents the need to store the paths at each level, while still obtaining good quality lossy compression. This method is particularly well suited to encode a Region of Interest in the image with different quality {{than the rest of the}} image. [1] Gerlind Plonka.

40|$|When Paul {{wrote his}} First Letter to the Corinthians {{he did so}} as their father in Christ, {{continuing}} his founding mission through his letter. Thus, his missionary zeal to be “all things to all men” directed the form and content of what he wrote. It follows then that {{he referred to the}} Spirit mainly in the past tense recalling the events of his original mission. In 1 Corinthians {{there is no mention of}} the idea that the Spirit performs any activity, either present or future, within the believer. This is probably not due to lack of development in Paul’s thinking or to the expectation of an imminent parousia, but to deliberate omissions for pastoral reasons. The believers at Corinth, in a spirit of pride and divisiveness, had over emphasised the Spirit’s indwelling and his miraculous manifestations and at the same time had severed their thinking about the Spirit from Christ crucified and from God. Thus, Paul purposely omitted any mention of the Spirit’s present activities within the believer to direct their allegiance and attention back to Christ and God. Hence, the ethical motivation given by him in 1 Corinthians is basically the injunction to obey the Lord who is coming in judgment rather than to follow the guidance of the indwelling Spirit. Paul does not have a <b>fixed</b> <b>use</b> of πυευμδ for Spirit of God. For example, πυευμδ in 1 Cor. 2 : 4 has little theological content for it is simply used here in a general historic way.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{wireless}} communications have visualized {{an exponential growth}} due to rapidly expanding market of wireless broadband and multimedia users and applications. Indeed, the demand for more radio spectrum increased {{in order to support}} this growth which highlighted on the scarcity and under-utilization problems of the radio spectrum resources. To this end, Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has received an enormous attention as an emerging solution to the spectrum shortage problem for the next generation wireless communication systems. For the CR to operate efficiently and to provide the required improvement in spectrum efficiency, it must be able to effectively identify the spectrum holes. Thus, Spectrum Sensing (SS) is the key element and critical component of the CR technology. In CR networks, Spectrum Sensing (SS) is the task of obtaining awareness about the spectrum usage. Mainly it concerns two scenarios of detection: (i) detecting the absence of the Primary User (PU) in a licensed spectrum in order to use it and (ii) detecting the presence of the PU to avoid interference. Several SS techniques were proposed in the literature. Among these, Eigenvalue Based Detector (EBD) has been proposed as a precious totally-blind detector that exploits the spacial diversity, overcome noise uncertainty challenges andperforms adequately even in low SNR conditions. However, the complexity of the distributions of decision metrics of the EBD is one of the important challenges. Moreover, the use massive MIMO technology in SS is still not explored. The first part of this study concerns the Standard Condition Number (SCN) detector and the Scaled Largest Eigenvalue (SLE) detector. The focus is on the complexity of the statistical distributions of the SCN and the SLE decision metrics since this will imply a complicated expressions for the performance probabilities as well as the decision threshold if it could be derived. We derive exact expressions for the Probability Density Function (PDF) andthe Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the SCN using results from finite Random Matrix Theory (RMT). In addition, we derived exact expressions for the moments of the SCN and we proposed a new approximation based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Moreover, using results from the asymptotic RMT we further provide a simple forms for the central moments of the SCN and we end up with a simple and accurate expression for the CDF, PDF, Probability of False-Alarm (Pfa), Probability of Detection (Pd), Probability of Miss-Detection (Pmd) and the decision threshold that could be computed on the y and hence provide a dynamic SCN detector that could dynamically change the threshold value depending on target performance and environmental conditions. On the other hand, we proved that the SLE decision metric could be modelled using Gaussian function and hence we derived its PDF, CDF, Pfa, Pd and decision threshold. In addition, we also considered the correlation between the largest eigenvalue and the trace in the SLE study. The second part of this study concerns the massive MIMO technology and how to exploit the large number of antennas for SS and CRs. Two antenna exploitation scenarios are studied: (i) Full antenna exploitation and (ii) Partial antenna exploitation in which we have two options: (i) <b>Fixed</b> <b>use</b> or (ii) Dynamic use of the antennas. We considered the Largest Eigenvalue (LE) detector if noise power is perfectly known and the SCN and SLE detectors when noise uncertainty exists. For fixed approach, we derived the optimal threshold which minimizes the error probabilities. For the dynamic approach, we derived the equation from which one can compute the minimum requirements of the system. For full exploitation, asymptotic approximation of the threshold is considered using the GEV distribution. Finally, a comparisons between these scenarios and different detectors are provided in terms of system performance and minimum requirements. This work presents a novel study in the field of SS applications in CR with massive MIMO technology.
