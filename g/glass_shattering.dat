Before test firing local house owners were warned to open windows to avoid the <b>glass</b> <b>shattering.</b> Greenhouses in the area collapsed or lost many panes of glass every time the guns were fired. By 29 June, all four guns were in operation, and were ready for manual operation.|$|E
50|$|While Benchamma’s {{central focus}} is drawing, he {{develops}} ideas into sculpture, furthering his conceptual questioning of reality. In ‘Sculpture, More or Less’, a wooden parquet floor breaks {{with all the}} material properties of a sheet of <b>glass,</b> <b>shattering</b> {{in a way that}} the viewer only notices when standing up close to the work. The technical behavior of the natural materials, wood and glass, are manipulated and decontextualized to create a surreal and spectacular illusion.|$|E
5000|$|Opening {{with the}} sound of <b>glass</b> <b>shattering,</b> Glass Houses has more of a hard rock feel than Joel's {{previous}} albums. The cover shows Joel poised to throw a rock through the two-story window of his real-life waterfront glass house in Cove Neck. On some versions, the back cover shows Joel looking through the hole that the rock made in the glass. This alludes to the adage that [...] "people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones".|$|E

50|$|Glass break {{detectors}} usually use a microphone, which monitors any noise or vibrations {{coming from}} the glass. If the vibrations exceed a certain threshold (that is sometimes user selectable) they are analyzed by detector circuitry. Simpler detectors simply use narrowband microphones tuned to frequencies typical of <b>glass</b> <b>shattering,</b> and react to sound above certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis {{to one or more}} glass-break profiles using signal transforms similar to DCT and FFT and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity threshold are breached.|$|E
5000|$|Using the gauze projection-screen, Phillips, Reznor, and Sheridan {{devised a}} [...] "gag" [...] where they {{projected}} [...] "a sheet of <b>glass</b> <b>shattering</b> onto a downstage kabuki scrim that would drop as the glass shatters fell. ... We settled on Trent swinging his guitar at the gauze and shattering it, {{but with all}} the pieces falling up as the screen flew out".

In contrast to the lighting of previous tours, Performance 2007 featured minimal lighting that was designed to shadow Reznor and the band.|$|E
50|$|Toughened glass must be {{cut to size}} or {{pressed to}} shape before toughening, and cannot be re-worked once toughened. Polishing the edges or {{drilling}} holes in the glass is carried out before the toughening process starts. Because of the balanced stresses in the glass, damage to any portion will eventually result in the <b>glass</b> <b>shattering</b> into thumbnail-sized pieces. The glass is most susceptible to breakage due to damage {{to the edge of}} the glass, where the tensile stress is the greatest, but shattering can also occur in the event of a hard impact in the middle of the glass pane or if the impact is concentrated (for example, striking the glass with a hardened point).|$|E
50|$|In June 2005 {{three of}} these plates of <b>glass</b> <b>shattered.</b> In {{the first three weeks}} of July 2005, three more of these plates shattered, an average of one {{breakage}} per week. Metal barricades and canopies were used to secure the areas until the problem was corrected.|$|R

5000|$|Roy Bennett and Martin Phillips were {{responsible}} for the lighting design and stage design respectively. Bennett explained in a 2005 interview that much of the lighting was done using a series of LED lights arranged in [...] "stalactites or stalagmites formations to tie in to the album artwork". DLP projectors were also used to project images onto a gauze screen in front of the stage. Using the gauze projection-screen, Phillips, Trent Reznor, and Rob Sheridan devised a [...] "gag" [...] where they projected [...] "a sheet of <b>glass</b> <b>shattering</b> onto a downstage kabuki scrim that would drop as the glass shatters fell. ... We settled on Trent swinging his guitar at the gauze and shattering it, but with all the pieces falling up as the screen flew out".|$|E
5000|$|In {{a montage}} {{the first two}} takes (both broken down) are {{followed}} by a completed alternative version (Take 5), included on Anthology 2. Lennon counts off the song then stops to readjust his guitar pickup ("I'm just going to raise this so that it's nearer to the bass strings than the top string"). This {{is followed by the}} sound of a <b>glass</b> <b>shattering</b> on the floor, prompting John to teasingly sing: [...] "Paul's broken a glass, broken a glass. Paul's broken a glass. A glass, a glass he's broke today". (In the background, Ringo plays the snare drum with wire brush drumsticks, keeping time with John's cadence). John also addresses Paul as [...] "Macca," [...] a nickname in England for someone who is of Irish descent or has [...] "Mc" [...] in their last name. [...] "Oh, you ready, Macca?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{flash powder}} {{in an open}} lamp was {{replaced}} by flashbulbs; magnesium filaments were contained in bulbs filled with oxygen gas, and electrically ignited by a contact in the camera shutter. [...] Manufactured flashbulbs were first produced commercially in Germany in 1929. [...] Such a bulb could only be used once, and was too hot to handle immediately after use, but the confinement of what would otherwise have amounted to a small explosion was an important advance. A later innovation was the coating of flashbulbs with a plastic film to maintain bulb integrity {{in the event of}} the <b>glass</b> <b>shattering</b> during the flash. A blue plastic film was introduced as an option to match the spectral quality of the flash to daylight-balanced colour film. Subsequently, the magnesium was replaced by zirconium, which produced a brighter flash.|$|E

The video had a significantly low budget, and was later scrapped after Sparro's deal with Island Records.|$|R
60|$|He {{thrust his}} hand up and reached the gas-jet.

5000|$|The show {{begins with}} a ten-second {{countdown}} clock, after that futuristic begins music begins to play. Hill and McGraw begin to say a speech which ends with, [...] "face to face, heart to heart, and soul to soul." [...] Then two black boxes rise up onto the b-stage, as the boxes descends both Hill and McGraw appear, and perform Aretha Franklin and George Michael's [...] "I Knew You Were Waiting For Me". During [...] "Break Free" [...] (a new pop centric song from the couple), the video screens displays fragments of <b>glass</b> <b>shattering</b> behind them. When McGraw performs [...] "Angry All the Time", Hill plays the acoustic guitar while singing background vocals. The show lasts for two hours and fifteen minutes with a setlist of thirty songs. They {{go back and forth}} singing with each other and alone during solos. McGraw and Hill perform their past hits and songs off their upcoming album. They close with [...] "I Need You".|$|E
5000|$|The stable {{was created}} when WWE aired vignettes of two arrogant [...] "Frenchmen" [...] (Sylvain Grenier and René Duprée, {{who are both}} {{actually}} French-Canadians) attacking the United States and its policy from a French news studio.Grenier and Duprée made their first appearance on the April 28, 2003 edition of Raw as La Résistance by attacking then-babyface, Scott Steiner. Steiner had made remarks two weeks earlier comparing France to hell and Grenier and Duprée were offended. La Résistance went on to feud with Scott Steiner and Test who was forced to be Steiner's tag team partner by Stacy Keibler, La Résistance ended up defeating Steiner and Test at Judgment Day on May 18, 2003 in the team's pay-per-view debut. Their most notorious insult to the United States came on Memorial Day in 2003 when they interrupted Raw announcer Lilian Garcia as she was singing America the Beautiful. After several minutes of Grenier calling America barbarians and saying that France would not allow the US to be the police force of the world, the sound of <b>glass</b> <b>shattering</b> suddenly filled the arena when Steve Austin cleared the ring of La Résistance and said some unflattering remarks about the French nation.|$|E
