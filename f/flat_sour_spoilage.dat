Three typing methods were tested and applied to differentiate strains at intra-species level: panC sequence analysis, REP-PCR and M 13 -PCR. panC gene was highly conserved within the studied strains, suggesting a low intra-specific diversity. This was supported by REP-PCR primary assays and M 13 -PCR results. M 13 -PCR profile analysis succeeded in differentiating six closely related groups (at 79 % threshold similarity) among 127 strains {{from a range of}} spoiled canned food products and from different canneries. Phenotypic traits were investigated among 20 selected strains representing groups and origins. Ranges of growth under different temperatures (from 40 °C to 70 °C), pH (from 5. 0 to 6. 5), NaCl concentrations (from 1 to 5 %) and sporulation conditions poorly differed between strains, but wet heat resistance of spores showed a 20 -fold variation between strains. Furthermore, in this study, strains that belonged to the same M 13 -PCR genetic group did not share phenotypic characteristics or common origin. The work emphasizes a low diversity within the G. stearothermophilus species but data from this study may contribute to a better control of G. stearothermophilus spoilage in canned food...|$|E
40|$|Estimating {{the shelf}} life {{and safety of}} any food product is an {{important}} part of food product development. Predictive food microbiology reduces the time and expense associated with conventional challenge and shelf life testing. The purpose of this study was to characterize and model germination, outgrowth, and lag (GOL) time and the exponential growth rate (EGR) of Bacillus stearothermophilus in salty carrot medium (SCM) as a function of pH, temperature, and NaCl concentration. B. stearothermophilus is a spore-forming thermophilic organism associated with <b>flat</b> <b>sour</b> <b>spoilage</b> of canned foods. A split-split plot design was used to measure the effects and interactions of pH (5. 5 to 7. 0), temperature (45 to 60 &C), and NaCl (0 to 1 %) on the growth kinetics of B. stearothermophilus in SCM. A total of 96 experiments were analyzed, with individual curve parameters determined by using the Gompertz equation. Quadratic polynomial models for GOL time and EGR of B. stearothermophilus in terms of temperature, pH, and NaCl were generated by response surface analysis. The r 2 values for the GOL time and EGR models were 0. 917 and 0. 916, respectively. These models provide an estimate of bacterial growth in response to combinations of the variables studied within the specified ranges. The models were used to predict GOL times and EGRs for additional experimental conditions. The accuracy of these predictions validated the model’s predictive ability in SCM. Bacillus stearothermophilus is a gram-positive, facultativel...|$|E
40|$|Pediocin PA- 1 is {{a member}} of the class IIa bacteriocins, which show {{antimicrobial}} effects against lactic acid bacteria. To develop an improved version of pediocin PA- 1, reciprocal chimeras between pediocin PA- 1 and enterocin A, another class IIa bacteriocin, were constructed. Chimera EP, which consisted of the C-terminal half of pediocin PA- 1 fused to the N-terminal half of enterocin A, showed increased activity against a strain of Leuconostoc lactis isolated from a sour-spoiled dairy product. To develop an even more effective version of this chimera, a DNA-shuffling library was constructed, wherein four specific regions within the N-terminal half of pediocin PA- 1 were shuffled with the corresponding sequences from 10 other class IIa bacteriocins. Activity screening indicated that 63 out of 280 shuffled mutants had antimicrobial activity. A colony overlay activity assay showed that one of the mutants (designated B 1) produced a > 7. 8 -mm growth inhibition circle on L. lactis, whereas the parent pediocin PA- 1 did not produce any circle. Furthermore, the active shuffled mutants showed increased activity against various species of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Carnobacterium. Sequence analysis revealed that the active mutants had novel N-terminal sequences; in active mutant B 1, for example, the parental pediocin PA- 1 sequence (KYYGNGVTCGKHSC) was changed to TKYYGNGVSCTKSGC. These new and improved DNA-shuffled bacteriocins could prove useful as food additives for inhibiting <b>sour</b> <b>spoilage</b> of dairy products...|$|R

2500|$|Pasteurization is a {{sanitation}} {{process in}} which milk is heated briefly to a temperature high enough to kill pathogens, followed by rapid cooling. While different times and temperatures may be used by different processors, pasteurization is most commonly achieved with heating to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.7 degrees Celsius) for 15 seconds. Milk is tested following pasteurization to confirm that bacteria have been killed to an acceptable level. Pasteurization kills pathogenic bacteria which occasionally may be present in milk, including those causing tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis), listeriosis (Listeria monocytogenes), Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), brucellosis (Brucella), campylobacteriosis (Campylobacter), salmonellosis (Salmonella), and several other foodborne illnesses (e.g., [...] ). Pasteurization may not kill some resistant bacteria, which can eventually cause <b>souring</b> and <b>spoilage</b> of fresh milk. UHT pasteurization (Ultra High Temperature) is a more extreme form of pasteurization heating milk to a temperature high enough to kill spoilage organisms also.|$|R
