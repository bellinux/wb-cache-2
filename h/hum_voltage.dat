25|$|The new {{generation}} Zero-Hum P-90 Hx by Kinman has an authentic P-90 sound and appearance but {{is far more}} complex with some 202 individual parts. Sonically destructive magnetic coupling between the coils is negated by highly efficient magnetic shields around the upper coil. The lower coil is wound with much thicker wire and far fewer turns onto a unique laminated steel bobbin which imparts ultra high efficiency; thus, the <b>hum</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is the same as}} the upper coil and cancels hum perfectly. Kinman advertise their P-90 Hx as having a sonically transparent 600-Ohm hum sensor which is remarkable considering the large amount of hum that P-90s put out.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 Kinman {{embarked}} on development of technology specifically for Telecaster guitars {{that was not}} introduced until circa 2001. The technology centers around a patented laminated steel H-core bobbin that functions as a noise sensing coil. It is made of 150 separate pieces of steel. The H-core is interesting because it performs far more efficiently than conventional noise sensing bobbins using steel core pins, requiring less turns of copper wire to produce the required <b>hum</b> <b>voltage.</b> There is {{a strong correlation between}} sonic signature of a hum canceling pickup and the number of turns and diameter of copper wire contained in the hum sensor.|$|E

40|$|Correct {{aircraft}} operation, {{depends upon}} the proper functioning of airport lighting circuits. The failure of even a single lamp, may well imply, {{the loss of the}} visual aid for the pilot and it can result in sabotages while landing. This project deals with the individual detection of any open circuit between two successive fittings. This is achieved by placing a simple non contact AC voltage detector over the insulated 5 kV line and transmitting the output logic to the control room through GSM technology. The voltage detector picks up the <b>hum</b> of AC <b>voltage,</b> which is sufficient to clock CMOS decade counter. During open circuit, absence of line voltage makes the last count to be stable, which is picked up by a microcontroller, which in turn activates GSM transmitter to transmit the desired message to the control room GSM receiver. This system has as a major advantage that it needs no extra under lying of cables near runway and GSM frequency which doesn’t affect RADAR and other communication frequencies and also independent of distance. Also it requires no physical connection between CCR and also to high voltage cables. And over all, it is the most cost efficient system introduced so far...|$|R
