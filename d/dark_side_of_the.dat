5|$|Filling {{the void}} left by Barrett's {{departure}} in March 1968, Waters began to chart Pink Floyd's artistic direction. He became the principal songwriter, lyricist and co-lead vocalist (along with Gilmour, and at times, Wright), and would remain the band's dominant creative figure until his departure in 1985. He wrote {{the lyrics to}} the five Pink Floyd albums preceding his own departure, starting with The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon (1973) and ending with The Final Cut (1983), while exerting progressively more creative control over the band and its music. Every Waters studio album since The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon has been a concept album. With lyrics written entirely by Waters, The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{was one of the}} most commercially successful rock albums ever. It spent 736 straight weeks on the Billboard 200 chart—until July 1988—and sold over 40 million copies worldwide. It was continuing to sell over 8,000 units every week as of 2005. According to Pink Floyd biographer Glen Povey, <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon is the world's second best-selling album, and the United States' 21st best-selling album of all time.|$|E

5|$|Pink Floyd {{were founded}} by {{students}} Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. They gained popularity performing in London's underground music scene {{during the late}} 1960s, and under Barrett's leadership released two charting singles and a successful debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967; Barrett left in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the band's primary lyricist and conceptual leader, devising the concepts behind their albums The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon (1973), Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977), The Wall (1979) and The Final Cut (1983). The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon and The Wall became two of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, a bootleg {{containing}} rare {{singles and}} B-sides entitled The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moo appeared, {{with a similar}} cover. Like Atom Heart Mother, the cover had no writing on it, although {{in this case it}} was to protect the bootlegger's anonymity rather than any artistic statement. The album cover to The KLF's concept album Chill Out was also inspired by Atom Heart Mother.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{assistant}} engineers {{working on the}} album was a 19-year-old Alan Parsons. He went on to engineer Pink Floyd's landmark album The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon and produce many popular albums himself with the Alan Parsons Project. Kurlander also assisted {{on many of the}} sessions, and {{went on to become a}} successful engineer and producer, most noteworthy for his success on the scores for The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{spent more}} than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost {{identical}} road crew to that used for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon in its entirety.

5|$|Pratchett had {{his writing}} {{breakthrough}} in 1968 when he interviewed Peter Bander van Duren, co-director {{of a small}} publishing company, Colin Smythe Ltd. During the meeting, Pratchett mentioned he had written a manuscript, The Carpet People. Colin Smythe Ltd published the book in 1971, with illustrations by the author. The book received strong, if few, reviews and {{was followed by the}} science fiction novels The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun (10 May 1976) and Strata (15 June 1981).|$|E
5|$|Richard William Wright (28 July 1943– 15 September 2008) was an English musician, composer, singer, and songwriter. He was {{a founder}} member, keyboardist, and vocalist of the {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, performing on {{all but one of}} the group's albums including The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Division Bell, and playing on all of their tours.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} piracy cropped up when a news article {{published}} in The Indian Express exposed the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film market. Hardly into weeks of the film's release, CDs were being sold at as low as Rs. 40. Another blemish was that Soumitra Dasgupta, a writer and close associate of Sarkar alleged that the film's story had {{a striking resemblance to}} his parallel work on the novella.|$|E

5|$|The main footage in {{and around}} the amphitheatre was filmed over four days in October 1971, using the band's regular touring equipment, {{including}} studio-quality 16-track tape recorders. Additional footage filmed in a Paris television studio the following December was added for the original 1972 release. The film was then re-released in 1974 with additional studio material of the band working on The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, and interviews at Abbey Road Studios.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{achieved}} international {{success with}} the concept albums The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall. By the early 1980s, they {{had become one of}} the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful groups in the history of popular music; by 2013, they had sold more than 250 million albums worldwide. Amid creative differences, Waters left in 1985 and began a legal dispute with the remaining members over their use of the band's name and material. They settled out of court in 1987, and nearly eighteen years passed before he performed with them again.|$|E
5|$|Pratchett's {{first two}} adult novels, The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun (1976) and Strata (1981), were both science-fiction, the latter taking place partly on a {{disc-shaped}} world. Subsequent to these, Pratchett mostly concentrated on his Discworld series and novels for children, with two exceptions: Good Omens (1990), a collaboration with Neil Gaiman (which {{was nominated for}} both Locus and World Fantasy Awards in 1991), a humorous story about the Apocalypse set on Earth, and Nation (2008), a book for young adults.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon is {{the eighth}} album by English rock band Pink Floyd, {{released}} on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records. The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions following {{the departure of}} founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett, in 1968, that characterised their earlier work. It thematically explores conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon {{was also}} re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and {{included}} slightly {{different versions of}} the original posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th anniversary poster. In 2007 the album was included in Oh, by the Way, a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd, and a DRM-free version was released on the iTunes Store. In 2011 the album was re-released as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? campaign, featuring a remastered version of the album along with various other material.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work has been overlooked in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E

5|$|The album's cover was, like {{several other}} Pink Floyd albums, {{designed}} by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell of Hipgnosis. It {{consists of a}} photograph of a man sitting in a tree which has been taken out of focus to the point of complete distortion. Hipgnosis viewed a number of stills from the film on a 35mm projector, and liked the visual effect when the slide jammed. Schroeder later said the band did not want to make the cover particularly good as The <b>Dark</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon would have to compete with it, but Thorgerson insisted it was given proper consideration like any other Floyd album.|$|E
5|$|Though {{outwardly}} {{appearing to}} be a well-intentioned public servant and supporter of democracy prior to becoming Emperor, he is actually Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith – a cult of practitioners of the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Force previously {{thought to have been}} extinct in the Star Wars galaxy for a millennium. As Sidious, he instigates the Clone Wars, nearly destroys the Jedi, and transforms the Republic into the Empire. He also manipulates Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into turning to the dark side and serving at his side as Darth Vader. Palpatine's reign is brought to an end when Vader kills him to save his son, Luke Skywalker.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the project's conception, {{newspapers}} were reporting a rumor that the Soviet Union was planning to detonate a hydrogen bomb on the Moon. According to press reports in late 1957, an anonymous source had divulged to a United States Secret Service agent that the Soviets planned to commemorate the anniversary of the October Revolution by causing a nuclear explosion on the Moon to coincide with a lunar eclipse on 7 November. News reports of the rumored launch included mention of targeting the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terminator—Project A119 would also consider this boundary as the target for an explosion. It was also reported that a failure to hit the Moon would likely result in the missile returning to Earth.|$|E
