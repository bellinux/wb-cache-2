50|$|<b>English</b> <b>sole</b> {{were the}} first species {{monitored}} in the Toxics in Biota program. They live up to 21 years and are demersal, living close to sediments. Because their movement within Puget Sound is limited {{and they are in}} contact with contaminated sediments, bioaccumulation of toxicants is reflective of contamination in regions where they are collected. From 1989 to 1999 <b>English</b> <b>Sole</b> were monitored annually for contaminant bioaccumulation and liver lesions. Since then bi-annual monitoring has occurred throughout Puget Sound, particularly in urban regions like Tacoma and Seattle.|$|E

50|$|The <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> is a right-eyed {{flatfish}} with a compressed, diamond-shaped {{body and}} a small head with a pointed snout and small, asymmetric mouth. The upper surface is covered in rough scales and is usually uniformly brown, but occasionally speckled; the lower surface is smooth, and white to pale yellow in colour. The dorsal and ventral fin edges are dark. The lateral line is mostly straight, but curves slightly around the pectoral fin.|$|E
50|$|The <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> (Parophrys vetulus) is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. It is a demersal fish that lives on sandy and muddy bottoms in estuaries and near shore areas, at depths of up to 550 m. It reaches up to 57 cm in length, and can weigh up to 1.5 kg.

Two of the most famous intergeneric hybrids are between the European plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) and European flounder (Platichthys flesus) in the Baltic Sea, and between the <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> (Parophrys vetulus) and starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) in Puget Sound. The offspring of the latter species pair is popularly known as the hybrid sole and was initially believed to be a valid species in its own right.|$|E
50|$|In subtidal areas, {{marine mammals}} such as harbor seals and California sea lions are {{sometimes}} present in Yaquina Bay. Sea lions in the estuary are mostly male. They {{move through the}} estuary, but {{spend a lot of}} time near the Bayfront or hauled out on docks, perhaps due to the additional food or safety. Some fish species present in Yaquina Bay include <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> and sculpin, in addition to river lamprey, lingcod, anchovies, Pacific herring, sturgeon, flounder, and salmon. Clams and Dungeness crabs are also present within the bay and make up a resource for recreational fishers.|$|E
50|$|Yaquina Bay {{has been}} shown to be a site for {{spawning}} and development of many species. Pacific Herring and bay goby larvae are abundant, but other larval fishes such as sculpin, anchovy, smelt, clingfishes, cod, stickleback, pipefish, prickleback, gunnels, sandlance, rockfish, greenlings, lumpfish, and flounder are present in the estuary. Although there are larval fish present in the estuary, the Pacific herring was found to be the only commercial species that relies on the estuary for spawning and development. Yaquina Bay also provides a nursery environment for <b>English</b> <b>sole.</b> Multiple species of juvenile salmon, including chum, coho, and chinook, also pass through Yaquina Bay during their life cycle, often transitioning from shallower to deeper waters as they grow.|$|E

50|$|Fish are an {{important}} component of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s (WDFW) Toxics in Biota Program, part of the Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program (PSEMP, recently renamed from PSAMP). Since 1989 fish indicator species have been used to monitor contamination of Puget Sound by chemicals such as poly-chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and metals. <b>English</b> <b>Sole,</b> the first species studied for the Toxics in Biota Program, have been used for monitoring by WDFW since 1989. As of 2015 the program also monitors copper rockfish, quillback rockfish, brown rockfish, coho salmon, chinook salmon, Pacific herring, and Pacific staghorn sculpin. Exposure and effects of each contaminant are monitored for each species, and more in-depth studies of specific regions are performed if monitoring indicates a contamination problem.|$|E
50|$|Estrogenic {{substances}} {{in the environment}} can disrupt the sexual development of fish, inhibiting testicular growth and sperm production. Biomarkers are often used to monitor concentrations of these endocrine disruptors in the environment. Vitellogenin, a sex-specific protein, is synthesized in the liver of fish in response to estrogen, a female hormone. This protein is produced when males have high concentrations of estrogens circulating in their bodies, indicating endocrine disruption. Quantification of vitellogenin is performed by measuring competitive binding to an enzyme {{in the presence of}} another identifiable protein, usually one that fluoresces. Liver disease is examined in <b>English</b> <b>Sole</b> as an indicator of PAH contaminated sediments by removing liver samples and searching for lesions under a microscope. Spawning success is determined by analysis of reproductive organs under a microscope and is compared with bioaccumulation of contaminants for correlation.|$|E
5000|$|The Pillar Point Harbor at the {{northern}} edge of Half Moon Bay offers a protected landing for boats and provides other marine infrastructure. In the late 1980s a new master plan was developed for the Harbor. [...] A variety of fish species have been identified in the harbor area. The most abundant fish include flatfish, particularly the speckled sanddab (Citharichthys stigmaeus) and the commercially important <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> (Parophrys vetulus), several species of rockfish (Sebastes sp.) with boccacio (S. paucispinis) most abundant, many members of the surfperch family, the most abundant being shiner (Cymanogaster aggregata) and dwarf surfperches (Micrometrus minimus), and the commercially important Pacific herring (Clupea harengus). Smaller populations of many other species, including significant commercial or sport species such as various surfperch, flatfish including halibut (Paralichthys californicus), lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus), and cabezon (Scoraenichthys marmotarus) also are found in the harbor during the summer. Abundant winter species include starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus) and topsmelt (Atherinops affinis). At Pillar Point Harbor, fishermen sell crab and fish catches straight off their boats at discount prices directly to the public, and restaurants will fillet the fish for purchasers.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2002 Trawl {{surveys of}} four West Coast {{estuaries}} {{were conducted to}} determine the spatial and temporal patterns of juvenile <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> residence during 1998 [...] 2000. Additional data from 1983 [...] 1988 was also analyzed. Juvenile <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> were present in both June and August with densities {{in the range of}} 1000 [...] 2000 fish*ha- 1 across all estuaries. The occurrence of interannual variability in juvenile <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> abundance and the appearance of multiple cohorts in nursery estuaries were addressed by examining transport in the California Current. The larval trajectories for <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> demonstrated that passive larval drift does not account for the patterns in sole distribution in estuaries. In most cases cohorts of <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> larvae were transported north or south off the Oregon-Washington shelf prior to the conclusion of development. However, based on model trajectories, egg stage was carried offshore before hatching in only 6 of 19 cases, and it is suspected that spawn timing occurs during periods of onshore transport to insure that eggs move inshore where they may be retained in local hydrographic features. The relationship of large (TL > 50 -mm) and small (TL < 50 -mm) <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> cohorts to estuarine habitat were also examined. Both small and large cohort <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> utilized lower side channel locations at significantly higher densities than other estuarine areas. Small <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> also showed significant relationships with both bottom temperature and depth. These patterns in habitat use were consistent across all estuaries and indicate that <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> utilized shallow depth areas where temperatures were optimal for growth, and more extensive tidal flats were available. The analysis also indicated a carrying capacity may exist for large <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> in nursery estuaries. The distribution of additional flatfish species was analyzed to examine spatial partitioning of nursery estuaries. The analysis of density anomalies indicated that the four flatfish species were exploiting different sections of each estuary. Densities of sanddab and sand sole were higher in lower main channel sites close to the estuary mouth, that were more oceanic than other parts of the estuary, while starry flounder were more common in the upper sections of the estuary where salinity was typically lower and temperature warmer...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} field studies was {{conducted}} between 1979 and 1985 in Puget Sound, Washington State, to investigate etiological relationships between prevalences of hepatic neoplasms in bottom-dwelling marine fish species, {{with emphasis on}} <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> (Parophrys vetulus), and concentrations of toxic chemicals in sediments and affected fish. Statistically significant (p {{less than or equal}} to 0. 05) correlations have been found between the prevalences of hepatic neoplasms in <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> and the following parameters: sediment concentrations of aromatic hydrocarbons, and concentrations of the metabolites of aromatic compounds in the bile of affected sole. A significant difference (p less than 0. 001) was also found between the relative concentrations of aromatic free radicals in the liver microsomes of <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> with liver lesions compared to sole without liver lesions. Laboratory studies designed to evaluate the etiology of the liver neoplasms in <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> have also yielded evidence that is consistent with the view that high molecular weight aromatic hydrocarbons, e. g., benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), are hepatocarcinogens in <b>English</b> <b>sole.</b> The current status of a series of long-term (up to 18 months) exposures of <b>English</b> <b>sole</b> and rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) to selected fractions of Puget Sound sediment extracts, enriched with aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds, and to individual carcinogens (e. g., BaP) is discussed...|$|E
