5|$|By custom {{there were}} seven {{conditions}} where a man could divorce his wife. These were: (1) disobedience to parents-in-law, (2) barrenness (unable to continue family line), (3) adultery (mixing another clan's blood into the family), (4) jealousy (of concubines), (5) incurable disease (unable to continue family line), (6) loquacity (not <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> with brothers-in-law or sisters-in-law), and (7) theft. However, a husband {{was not allowed to}} divorce his wife if she had completed three years of mourning for one of his deceased parents, if there were no living relatives in her father's family to return to, or if the husband's family was originally poor but became rich after marriage. Sometimes women were also able to initiate the divorce and remarry if the husband's family was in poverty, he was diseased, or his in-laws were too abusive. Although remarriage was frowned upon (especially since divorce meant a wife took away her dowry wealth from her ex-husband's family), it was nonetheless common amongst divorcees and widowers in all social groups.|$|E
5|$|Film {{director}} Barry Levinson {{sought to}} create a police drama television series based on , a 1991 non-fiction book by David Simon based on one year he spent with Baltimore Police Department homicide detectives. In addition to the book's being set in Levinson's home city of Baltimore, the director was attracted to the realistic way Simon portrayed police work and the detectives. The book contradicted many popular myths that had been built into past police dramas: it portrayed the detectives as not always <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> {{with each other and}} told stories of criminals who were not always caught or punished. It also portrayed detectives as solving cases primarily through physical evidence, witnesses and confessions, not by investigating motives like on many other police shows. Simon also sought to dispel the popular television perception that all detectives take their cases very personally and identify with their victims: in Simon's experience, homicide cases were primarily a job to the detectives, not personal. Levinson and Tom Fontana, who had past television experience as executive producer on the drama series St. Elsewhere, hired screenwriter Paul Attanasio to adapt elements of the book into the teleplay for the first episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.|$|E

5|$|The {{second and}} more {{important}} friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind. Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck {{out on her own}} in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady's companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing the drawbacks of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, 1787). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).|$|E

The aim was to help the Thais block any Communist Chinese incursions through the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Lair's part in this was an assignment to train the Royal Thai Police. He used an old Imperial Japanese training camp in Hua Hin to train a select crew of Thai police in guerrilla warfare, including parachuting. In the process, Lair discovered he had a knack for <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> with the Thais. His bashfulness, his aversion to eye contact, and quiet courteous demeanor were so congruent with ideal Thai manners that his policemen bonded with him, even though he spoke broken Thai with a Texas twang.

25|$|The storyline {{rivalry between}} Rey Escorpión and Último Guerrero {{that led to}} the main event match began back in the summer of 2011. While working under the ring name Escorpión he was teamed up with Último Guerrero for the 2011 Gran Alternativa tournament, a tag team tournament where a rookie (Escorpión) would team up with an {{experienced}} wrestler (Guerrero) for the tournament. The duo defeated the teams of Magnus and Brazo de Plata, Mortiz]and El Terrible, and Diamante and La Sombra to earn a spot in the final match. On April 8, 2011 Escorpión and Guerrero defeated Máscara Dorada and Metal Blanco to win the 2011 Gran Alternativa tournament. Shortly after the Gran Alternativa victory Escorpión changed his name to Rey Escorpión ("Scorpion King") and joined Último Guerrero's Los Guerreros del Infierno group that also included Dragón Rojo, Jr. at the time. In the summer of 2012 Rey Escorpión began having problems with other members of Los Guerreros, especially with the new Guerrero associates Euforia and Niebla Roja. The tension let to Escorpión being kicked out of the group, although the confrontations never turned to an actual fight, leading to Último Guerrero introducing both Euforia and Niebla Roja as full fledge members. On August 31, 2012, during CMLL's weekly Super Viernes show Rey Escorpión teamed with his former Los Guerreros team mates for a Trios tournament, actually winning the tournament despite not <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> with his team mates. Two weeks later the team were unsuccessful in their challenge for the CMLL World Trios Championship, which only furthered the issues between Rey Escorpión and Los Guerreros. The tension finally erupted into a physical encounter as Dragón Rojo, Jr. turned on Los Guerreros, siding with Rey Escorpión as they attacked Euforia after a match on the October 5th Super Viernes show. Afterward Escorpión and Dragón Rojo, Jr. announced that they were forming their own group, targeting Los Guerreros del Infierno. The team of Rey Escorpión, Dragón Rojo, Jr., and Pólvora was unveiled as Los Revolucionarios del Terror ("The Revolutionaries of Terror"). Following the formation of Los Revolucionarios the two factions faced off on several shows, but at the time the storyline never developed further.|$|E
25|$|On February 21, 2013 CMLL held a {{press conference}} to officially {{announce}} that the Homena a Dos Leyendas would pay tribute to Rayo de Jalisco ("The Lighting from Jalisco") and brought out Rayo's son, Rayo de Jalisco Jr., as part of the announcement. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. had not worked for CMLL since 2010 but made a special appearance due to the company honoring his father. During the press conference Rayo de Jalisco Jr.'s long time rival Universo 2000 interrupted Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and the two ended up challenging each other to a match that would take place at the 2013 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas, although the exact nature of the match was not announced at the time. The rivalry between the two wrestlers hailed back to at least 1997 where Universo 2000 defeated both Cien Caras and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. Universo 2000 defended the title three times during his reign: against Brazo de Plata, Máscara Sagrada, and Rayo de Jalisco Jr., before losing the championship to Rayo de Jalisco Jr. on September 13, 1998. Universo 2000 regained the title on December 10, 1999 Universo 2000's second reign became a recordbreaking reign in several areas, it was the longest to date as it lasted 1,225 days. He also became the champion with most successful title defenses in one reign including eight defenses against Rayo de Jalisco Jr. during their long running rivalry. After being masked since his debut in 1985 Universo 2000 lost a Lucha de Apuesta match to El Canek in the main event of the 71st Anniversary Show, on September 17, 2004, the match also included Rayo de Jalisco Jr. and Dr. Wagner Jr. and originally came about due to the Universo 2000/Rayo de Jalisco Jr. rivalry. Following his unmasking Universo 2000 won the 2004 Leyenda de Azul (Blue legend tournament). In subsequent years both Universo 2000 and Rayo de Jalisco Jr. left CMLL. In 2005 Rayo de Jalisco Jr. suffered another serious injury, he injured both his knees in a match against Universo 2000's brother Máscara Año 2000, where his legs got caught on the ropes as he jumped out of the ring and he tore ligaments in both knees. The injury kept him out of the ring for almost half a year but in the end Rayo de Jalisco Jr. was able to make a full recovery and return to the ring. The incident was used by several promoters as well as Rayo de Jalisco Jr. himself to create more interest in matches between himself and Universo 2000, Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. made his return to CMLL in May, 2010, siding with the CMLL loyalists in their feud with Los Invasores, especially Invasore members Universo 2000 and Máscara Año 2000, reiginting the long running storyline between them. But Rayo, Universo and Cien Caras only worked a select few dates for CMLL before leaving again. The official match between the long time rivals saw each team up with participants of the 2013 Torneo Parejas Increibles, only in this case they were on opposite sides instead of teaming up. Rayo de Jalisco Jr. would team up with Shocker and Rush while Universo 2000 would team up with Shocker's rival Mr. Niebla and Rush's rival El Terrible. Shocker and Mr. Niebla had a long backstory between then, having actually worked together as a regular tag team in the late 1990s. In 1998 the two defeated Dr. Wagner Jr. and Emilio Charles Jr. to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship and would subsequently defend the tag team championship against teams such as Blue Panther and Black Warrior, Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. and the Hermanas Dinamita (Cien Caras and Universo 2000). In October, 1998 Mr. Niebla suffered an injury during a match, an injury that was so severe that Mr. Niebla was forced to vacate the Tag Team title. Upon his return Mr. Niebla continued to team with Shocker but the team were not able to win the Tag Team title back. On September 24, 1999, at the CMLL 66th Anniversary Show, the team of Nr. Niebla and Shocker faced Atlantis and Villano III in a Relevos suicida match, a match where the losing team would fight each other for their mask. In the main event match of CMLL's 66th Anniversary show, Atlantis and Villano III defeated the much less experienced team, afterwards Mr. Niebla defeated Shocker to unmask him. In the years since Shocker's unmasking the two have wrestled each other on numerous occasions, both in CMLL and other promotions. The two teamed up for the Parejas Increibles tournament and made it to the semi-final but lost to La Sombra and Volador Jr. when the tension between the two became a distraction in the match. The rivalry between Rush and El Terrible started when El Terrible defeated Rush in the finals of a tournament to determine a holder of the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship on January 1, 2012. The two were also paired up for the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles, and in {{the weeks leading up to}} the tournament Rush stated that he was willing to put his differences with El Terrible aside as he wanted to win the Parejas Increibles tournament, despite the two having developed a heated rivalry over the last number of months. After <b>getting</b> <b>along</b> and qualifying for the final match Rush and El Terrible's miscommunication and dissension allowed their opponents to win the match and the tournament. Following the match Rush took a microphone and berated both El Terrible and the fans for their actions that night and then followed it up by challenging El Terrible to a Luchas de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match at a later date. El Terrible did not accept the challenge at that point in time. The two faced off in the main event of the CMLL 79th Anniversary Show in a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match that was won by Rush. The storyline continued to develop in the months following the anniversary event and included El Terrible successfully defending the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship against Rush on January 22, 2013. The two rivals were simply unable to get along from the beginning, causing them to be eliminated in the first round of the Parejas Increibles tournament by Dragón Rojo Jr. and Niebla Roja.|$|E
