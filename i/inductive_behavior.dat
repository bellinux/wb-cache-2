40|$|The electro-oxidation of {{formic acid}} catalyzed by Fe 20 Pt 80 {{nanoparticles}} was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) where the particles were deposited onto a gold electrode surface by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique at varied film thickness/coverage. It {{was found that}} the particle assembly thickness strongly affected the electrocatalytic activity for HCOOH oxidation. For a single monolayer and two layers of FePt particles, extensive CO adsorption (poisoning) was observed in CV measurements, whereas with a four-layer assembly of the FePt particles, the tolerance to CO poisoning improved drastically. Furthermore, from the current density for formic acid oxidation, the electrodes functionalized with LB layers of nanoparticles exhibited higher activities than those with dropcast films of similar thickness, suggesting the importance of the ordering of the particle layers in the electrocatalytic performance. The reaction kinetics in the HCOOH oxidation on the three kinds of particle film-modified electrodes was then examined by EIS measurements. It was found that except within the potential range for CO oxidation, the impedance spectra behaved normally with the responses shown in the first quadrant for all three nanoparticle assemblies under study, indicative of only resistive and capacitive components in the electrochemical cell. In contrast, at potentials of CO electro-oxidation, the impedance spectra were found to migrate from the first quadrant to the second quadrant and then back to the first quadrant with increasing electrode potential, which suggests that the reaction kinetics evolve from resistive to pseudoinductive and then to <b>inductive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The different EIS behaviors are ascribed to the different degree of tolerance to CO poisoning, consistent with the voltammetric results. 1...|$|R

This conceptual paper argues that there exists an apparently powerful model in health behavior domain that may readily be brought into organic food purchase behavior research. The paper argues for domain relevance and proposes that Montano and Kasprzyk’s integrated behavior model may readily be used in organic food behavior studies with some relevant modification. Design/methodology/approach – The paper follows an exploratory approach and shows how variables used in the past may be aggregated to the model in question. The challenge is addressed by following both the inductive and the deductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning calls for investigating whether such behavior may be classified as health <b>behavior.</b> <b>Inductive</b> reasoning calls for proving relevance of all the variables in the aforesaid model to the organic food research context. Findings – The paper concludes that the Montano and Kasprzyk’s model is theoretically relevant to the organic food behavior domain.

Research limitations/implications – Since the model was rarely tested empirically in predicting organic food purchase intention, the variable-specific relevance may not warrant the relevance of the whole model with intertwined relationships at the same time.

40|$|Cultural artifacts, such as language, {{survive and}} {{replicate}} by passing from mind to mind. Cultural evolution always proceeds by an <b>inductive</b> process, where <b>behaviors</b> are never directly copied, but reverse engineered by the cognitive mechanisms involved in learning and production. I will {{refer to this}} type of evolutionary change as inductive evolution and explain how this represents a broader class of evolutionary processes that can include both neutral and selective evolution. This thesis takes a mechanistic approach to understanding the forces of evolution underlying change in culture over time, where the mechanisms of change are sought within human cognition. I define culture as anything that replicates by passing through a cognitive system and take language as a premier example of culture, because of the wealth of knowledge about linguistic behaviors (external language) and its cognitive processing mechanisms (internal language). Mainstream cultural evolution theories related to social learning and social transmission of information define culture ideationally, as the subset of socially-acquired information in cognition that affects behaviors. Their goal is to explain behaviors with culture and avoid circularity by defining behaviors as markedly not part of culture. I take a reductionistic approach and argue that all there is to culture is brain states and behaviors, and further, that a complete explanation of the forces of cultural change can not be explained by a subset of cognition related to social learning, but necessarily involves domain-general mechanisms, because cognition is an integrated system. Such an approach should decompose culture into its constituent parts and explore 1) how brains states effect behavior, 2) how behavior effects brain states, and 3) how brain states and behaviors change over time when they are linked up in a process of cultural transmission, where one person's behavior is the input to another. I conduct several psychological experiments on frequency learning with adult learners and describe the behavioral biases that alter the frequencies of linguistic variants over time. I also fit probabilistic models of cognition to participant data to understand the inductive biases at play during linguistic frequency learning. Using these inductive and behavioral biases, I infer a Markov model over my empirical data to extrapolate participants' behavior forward in cultural evolutionary time and determine equivalences (and divergences) between inductive evolution and standard models from population genetics. As a key divergence point, I introduce the concept of non-binomial cultural drift, argue that this is a rampant form of neutral evolution in culture, and empirically demonstrate that probability matching is one such inductive mechanism that results in non-binomial cultural drift. I argue further that all inductive problems involving representativeness are potential drivers of neutral evolution unique to cultural systems. I also explore deviations from probability matching and describe non-neutral evolution due to inductive regularization biases in a linguistic and non-linguistic domain. Here, I offer a new take on an old debate about the domain-specificity vs -generality of the cognitive mechanisms involved in language processing, and show that the evolution of regularity in language cannot be predicted in isolation from the general cognitive mechanisms involved in frequency learning. Using my empirical data on regularization vs probability matching, I demonstrate how the use of appropriate non-binomial null hypotheses offers us greater precision in determining the strength of selective forces in cultural evolution...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. ThesisInductive {{inference}} is {{a process}} of hypothesizing a general rule from examples. As a successful inference criterion for inductive inference of formal languages and models of logic programming, we have mainly used Gold 2 ̆ 7 s identification in the limit. An inference machine M is said to infer a concept L in the limit, if the sequence of guesses from M which is successively fed a sequence of examples of L converges to a correct expression of L, that is, all guesses from M become a unique expression in a finite time and that the expression is a correct one. A class, or a hypothesis space, is said to be inferable in the limit, if there is an inference machine M which infers every concept in the class. In the present thesis, we mainly investigate three criteria related to the identification in the limit. As we will see, they are necessary for practical applications of machine learning or machine discovery. The first criterion requires an inference machine to produce a unique guess. That is, we apply so-called finite identification to concept learning. As stated above, ordinary inductive inference is an infinite process. Thus we can not decide in general whether a sequence of guesses from an inference machine has converged or not at a certain time. To the contrary, in the criterion of finite identification, if an inference machine produces a guess, then it is a conclusive answer. The second criterion requires an inference machine to refute a hypothesis space in question, if a target concept is not in the hypothesis space. In the ordinary <b>inductive</b> inference, the <b>behavior</b> of an inference machine is not specified, when we feed examples of a target concept not belonging to the hypothesis space. That is, we implicitly assume that every target concept belongs to the hypothesis space. As far as data or facts are presented according to a concept that is unknown but guaranteed to be in the hypothesis space, the machine will eventually identify the hypothesis. However this assumption is not appropriate, if we want an inference machine to infer or to discover an unknown rule which explains examples or data obtained from scientific experiments. Thus we propose a successful inference criterion where, if there is no concept in the hypothesis space which coincides with a target concept, then an inference machine explicitly tells us this and stops in a finite time. The third criterion requires an inference machine to infer a minimal concept within the hypothesis space concerned. In actual applications of inductive inference, there are many cases where we want an inference machine to infer an approximate concept within the hypothesis space, even when there is no concept which exactly coincides with the target concept. Here we take a minimal concept as an approximate concept within the hypothesis space, and discuss inferability of a minimal concept of the target concept which may not belong to the hypothesis space. That is, we force an inference machine to converge to an expression of a minimal concept of the target concept, if there is a minimal concept of the target concept within the hypothesis space. In the present thesis, we discuss inferability of recursive concepts under the above three criteria, and show some necessary and sufficient conditions for inferability and some comparisons between inferable classes. Furthermore as practical and concrete hypothesis spaces, we take the classes definable by so-called lengt h-bounded elementary formal systems (EFS 2 ̆ 7 s, for short) and discuss their inferability in the above three criteria. In 1990, Shinohara showed that the classes definable by length-bounded EFS 2 ̆ 7 s with at most n axioms are inferable in the limit from positive data for any n 2 : 1. In the present thesis, we show that the above classes are also refutably inferable from complete data, i. e. positive and negative data, as well as minimally inferable from positive data. This means that there are rich hypothesis spaces that are refutably inferable from complete data or minimally inferable from positive data...|$|R
