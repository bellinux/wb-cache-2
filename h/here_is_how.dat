25|$|The scene changed {{every hour}} as the coup progressed. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> it {{unfolded}} {{after the first}} tanks rolled in {{according to the observations}} of Manik Sethisuwan. Manik was one of a few citizens who was forced to spend the night on the street as his car had run out of gas. According to government laws as of September 2006, it was mandatory for all gas and petrol stations in the city to close-down from 22:00–05:00 as a cost-saving measure. Hence he was forced to seek refuge near the international press personnel until it was possible for him to move out, as a result of which he was able to capture most of the event as it unfolded.|$|E

Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B+" [...] grade, explaining that [...] "the trick <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> perfectly Thompson and Hanks portray the gradual thaw in their characters' frosty alliance, empathizing with each other's equally miserable upbringings in a beautiful three-hankie scene late in the film." [...] Kenneth Turan of Los Angeles Times wrote that the film [...] "does not strictly hew to the historical record where the eventual resolution of this conflict is concerned," [...] but admitted that it [...] "is easy to accept this fictionalizing {{as part of the}} price to be paid for Thompson's engaging performance." ...|$|E

Rich Juzwiak of Stylus Magazine gave the album an A rating, stating [...] "Her adventurous and, yes, massive, persona {{is allowed to}} wander wherever it wants on The Cookbook, be it avant or common." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote, [...] "The Cookbook is a convincing return to form.... Sounding as unique and startling and formidable as ever, Missy Elliott is clearly not a woman to be messed with." [...] John Bush of AllMusic noted that [...] "Elliott forces a few rhymes, plays to type with her themes, and uses those outside producers to follow trends in hip-hop.... What's different <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> relaxed Elliott is, how willing she seems to simply go with what comes naturally and sounds best." [...] Q stated [...] "If not Elliott's most inventive album, The Cookbook is certainly her most colourful and entertaining".|$|E
