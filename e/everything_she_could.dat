25|$|In June, {{after the}} last of the {{primaries}} had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States. For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to help him get elected.|$|E
25|$|Kanin {{longed to}} move to Los Angeles to get into {{pictures}} and her parents indulged her. Her father moved to California first to secure a job, then {{she and her mother}} packed everything and followed by train. Kanin spent her senior year at the University of Southern California where she became active in college radio. After graduating with a bachelor's degree, she wangled an interview with Sam Marx who thought she was much too young to hire; but her next interview was with story editor Bob Sparks at RKO who sent her to producer Al Lewis, who then hired her as a story editor at $75 a week. RKO released Lewis, but Sparks kept Fay on as scriptreader to write one-page summaries for $25 a week. Kanin proceeded to teach herself <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> about the movie industry at RKO's expense. During the lunch hour, she talked to anyone she happened to find – whether they were art directors, editors, or cinematographers.|$|E
500|$|She {{followed}} her same [...] "writing ritual" [...] {{that she had}} followed for years and used in writing all of her books and poetry: she rented a hotel room, closeted herself there from the early morning to the afternoon, and wrote on legal pads. After deciding upon the theme [...] "America", she wrote down <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think of about the country, which she then [...] "pushed and squeezed into a poetic form". Angelou recited the poem on January 20, 1993.|$|E
60|$|The banker said {{he would}} leave us to the {{discussion}} of that question, but Mrs. Makely could count upon him in <b>everything</b> if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only get the man to talk. At {{the end of our}} conference we decided to interview the Altrurian together.|$|R

500|$|James Boomgard, {{regional}} director for Development Alternatives Inc. (the company employing Norgrove {{when she was}} kidnapped), released a statement: [...] "We are saddened beyond words {{by the death of}} a wonderful woman whose sole purpose in Afghanistan was to do good – to help the Afghan people achieve a measure of prosperity and stability in their everyday lives as they set about rebuilding their country". United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Robert Watkins praised Norgrove: [...] "She was a true advocate for the people of Afghanistan and was dedicated to bringing improvements to their lives", and [...] "her spirit and compassion will be greatly missed". First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said: [...] "Ms Norgrove was a dedicated aid worker who was doing <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to help people in Afghanistan—hopefully that legacy of service in a humanitarian cause can be of some comfort to her loved ones in their time of grief".|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1950, Fonda married Susan Blanchard, {{with whom}} he had been having an affair since {{sometime}} in 1948. [...] She was 21 years old, the daughter of Australian-born interior designer Dorothy Hammerstein, and the step-daughter of Oscar Hammerstein II. Together, they adopted a daughter, Amy Fishman (born 1953). They divorced three years later. Blanchard was in awe of Fonda, and she described her role in the marriage as [...] "a geisha", doing <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to please him, dealing with and solving problems he would not acknowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Ashton's Sylvia is {{much more}} contemporary, and while {{retaining}} a classic feel, it has been modernized. In the 1952 choreography, Sylvia incorporated new and interesting techniques such as the blending of mime and dance and more intricate footwork, as are typical of Ashton's works. As writer Arnold Haskell said, [...] "he accepts the challenge in Sylvia of coping with period music without descending to pastiche; and never once does the movement he provides strike us as modern or as 'old world'". Gillian Murphy, the lead rôle in the 2005 ABT production, noted this choreography was very challenging. Ashton designed the ballet specifically around Margot Fonteyn's talent and skill. Thus, any who play the part {{must be able to}} do <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> and at the time [...] "the range of her dancing [...] unequalled"(Barnes).|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her across the {{blueberry}} bushes. His gay speech meant <b>everything</b> or nothing. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> parry it with a jest, {{and then it would}} mean nothing. She let her head droop over her work, and made no answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wasn't {{that what}} you came for?" [...] she asked, {{by one of the}} efforts she was making with <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> said.

60|$|Then {{he asked}} her about the Ford, and Bostil, and the ranches and villages north, and the riders and horses. Lucy told him <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> knew and <b>could</b> think of, and, lastly, after waxing eloquent on the horses of the uplands, {{particularly}} Bostil's, {{she gave him a}} graphic account of Cordts and Dick Sears.|$|R
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} Summer, {{a second}} airshow took place. It was called the All-Russia Aeronautics Festival, and it opened on then the new Commandant's {{airfield}} (...) [...] The air tricks that were performed by Lebedev, Utotchkin, and Mikhail Efimov, military pilots Gorshkov, Rudnev, and others took the city by storm. After attending that festival, [...] "Molly" [...] began reading <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find about flying, and met up with the many pilots who were all young and {{the same age as}} her. In Fall 1910, Golanchikova finally got acquainted with , a former electrician from Odessa, who took her on a flight as a passenger, and from then on, she decided she would learn to fly. For that, she began to collect money through the winter to attend school the next Spring.|$|E
2500|$|Roger Spooner, the farmer, said on CNN that Sherrod {{is not a}} racist, {{that she}} did <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> for his family; more than 20 years later, he and Sherrod remain friends. [...] The Spooners credit Sherrod with helping them save their farm: [...] "If it hadn't been for her, we would've never known who to see or what to do", Roger Spooner said. [...] "She led us right to our success." [...] His wife, Eloise Spooner, said that [...] "after things kind of settled down, she brought Sherrod some {{tomatoes}} out of her garden, {{and they had a}} good visit." [...] Eloise Spooner recalled Sherrod as [...] "nice-mannered, thoughtful, friendly; a good person." [...] The couple were surprised by the controversy. [...] "I don't know what brought up the racist mess", Roger Spooner said. [...] "They just want to stir up some trouble, it sounds to me in my opinion." [...] Eloise Spooner said that on seeing the story of Sherrod's resignation, [...] "I said, 'That ain't right. They have not treated her right.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Aroldo {{enters with}} Godvino. The two men {{sit down to}} talk and Aroldo asks his rival {{what he would do}} if Mina were free. Mina is then summoned and Godvino is {{instructed}} to conceal himself and listen to the couple's conversation. [...] Aroldo explains to Mina that they need to talk since he will be leaving that evening and that they must part (Opposto è il calle che in avvenire / [...] "In the future, our lives must follow opposite paths"). [...] He adds that she can redeem herself from dishonour by marrying the man who has captured her heart, and he presents her with a divorce paper to sign. She does so, declaring that they are free of each other. [...] But she states that, in spite of <b>everything,</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be another man's wife and that she will always love Aroldo. [...] Questioning her, he asks if she had been tricked into entering into the relationship by Godvino. When the answer is [...] "yes", Aroldo swears that Godvino must die, indicating that her seducer is in the next room. Just then, Egberto bursts in, his sword covered in blood, and he declares that Godvino is dead. [...] Briano leads Aroldo off to church while Mina cries out there has been no forgiveness for her sin.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{think your}} staying and feeling bad {{would make her}} better? Don't go back," [...] he repeated; and {{he went out to}} his ugly rawboned horse, and, {{mounting}} his shabby wagon, rattled away. She lingered, indescribably put to shame by the brutal common sense which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not impeach, but which she still felt was no measure of the case. It was true that she had not told him <b>everything,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not complain that he had mocked her appeal for sympathy if she had trifled with him by a partial confession. But she indignantly denied to herself that she had wished to appeal to him for sympathy.|$|R
50|$|Kolkata 2013. Abby Sen is a 30-year-old {{television}} producer. He is academically brilliant, has {{a strong}} background in science and watching science fiction films is his greatest passion. But his programmes on television are never popular and fail to make a mark on the TRP ratings. And that is perhaps the only reason why Abby has lost no less than seven jobs. Every time he is fired, his wife Somy gets hysterical and throws down <b>everything</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> lay her hands on. So Abby has not disclosed his last dismissal to her.|$|R
2500|$|Meyer {{decided to}} include the {{pregnancy}} in her story while she was researching vampires, early in 2003, and came across {{the legend of the}} incubus, a demon who could father children. Bella's insistence to not let her child die was inspired by Meyer's reaction when asked if she would let one of her children die so she could live, which was to deliver the child no matter what the consequences were. Meyer {{said in an interview with}} Shannon Hale, published in , that the birth scene published is a little less grotesque than the one she wrote before editing due to her editor, agent and publisher's requests to [...] "tone down the violence a little". She stated that Bella's pregnancy and childbirth, for her, were [...] "a way to kind of explore that concept of what childbirth used to be" [...] in the past and acknowledged that they were [...] "taking Bella in a new direction that wasn't [...] relatable for a lot of people." [...] Concerning the subject of the relatability of Bella, Meyer admitted that she lost some of her relatability to the character when she became a vampire and said, [...] "every point up until that point in the story [...] I would say I could step into this story right here and I could do <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> do which made it really fun." [...] Meyer wanted to experience Bella's vampiric experiences and [...] "enjoyed very much" [...] writing about them and wanted to end the book from her perspective, but still thought it was [...] "a little bit harder" [...] as she couldn't step in into the story anymore.|$|E
6000|$|... "But yet {{she tried}} <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> And when I {{told her about}} that meeting up at Lord Grex's, she was so shocked! Do you {{remember}} that?" ...|$|E

But whatever Marzinne might say Rozennik smiled and nodded to him as before, and would often turn her head as she passed, and sing snatches of old songs over her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|The letter which Phoebe brought was a {{long and}} cordial one, in which Dora begged that Miriam would come and make her a visit of a few days. She said, moreover, that her brother was {{intending}} to call on Mr. Haverley and urge {{him to come to}} their house as frequently as he could during his sister's visit. Dora said that she would enjoy having Miriam with her so very, very much; and although the life at the dear old farm must be always charming, she believed that Miriam would like a little change, and <b>she</b> would do <b>everything</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> to make the days pass pleasantly.|$|R
60|$|How simple <b>everything</b> was now! <b>She</b> <b>could</b> go to Kirk and, as she {{had said}} to Sybil, start again. The golden barrier between them had vanished.

60|$|Bella {{shook her}} head. Didn't know. Couldn't say. All {{she was able}} to report was, that she was most handsomely {{supplied}} with <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> possibly want, and that whenever she hinted at leaving Mr and Mrs Boffin, they wouldn't hear of it.|$|E
6000|$|Charley dried {{her eyes}} and entered on her functions, going in her {{matronly}} little way about and about the room and folding up <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> lay her hands upon.

60|$|Rosa’s {{room was}} airy, clean, comfortable, almost gay.

50|$|It {{turns out}} that Regina is {{planning}} to put a sleeping spell on herself so Henry will find her one-day and embrace her again, after lowering the protection spell. Regina then freezes Robin so she can {{go through with it}} and does lower the protection spell, but just as she is about to take the spell, she is interrupted by Zelena, who then takes the potion pin from Regina and reveals to Regina that they both have one thing in common, besides magic and the fact that Rumplestiltskin trained them, that Cora is their mother and they are half-sisters. Zelena, who is furious that Cora gave Regina <b>everything</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never have, tells her younger sibling that she plans to take <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> had away from her as revenge. After Zelena flies off on her broom, Regina returns to the crypt and unfreezes Robin, where she tells him that she now has something to live for: someone to destroy.|$|R
60|$|It {{appeared}} that since his expedition to Scotland the estate in Dorset had been seized, so that Harry Merrycourt could send him no more remittances, and, as {{the question about}} the Ribaumont property in Picardy was by no means decided, he had been reduced to sad straits. His Dutch hostess was not courteous, and complained very much that all the English cavaliers in exile professed to have rich kindred who would make up for <b>everything,</b> but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not see that anything came of it. However, she did give him house-room, and, though grumbling, had provided him with many comforts and good fare, such as he was sure could not be purchased out of the very small sum he could give her by the week.|$|R
60|$|After this, {{evening of}} gay welcome in Dan's family, and those moments of {{tenderness}} with him, {{her heart was}} troubled. She now realised her engagement as something exterior to herself and her own family, and confronted {{for the first time}} its responsibilities, its ties, and its claims. It was not enough to be <b>everything</b> to Dan; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not be that unless she were something to his family. She did not realise this vividly, but with the remoteness which all verities except those of sensation have for youth.|$|R
60|$|Weeks passed on, {{the leaves}} turned {{red and yellow}} upon the trees, the evenings and mornings grew colder and colder, and Mrs. Cliff did <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> towards the {{accomplishment}} of what now appeared {{to her in the}} light of a great duty in her life,--the proper expenditure of her income and appropriation of her great fortune.|$|E
60|$|Moreover, the negroes came in {{for their}} share, being {{regarded}} all along by her with an unspeakable repugnance, which showed itself at first in hiding from them whenever she could, and, afterwards, in throwing at them <b>everything</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> lay hands on, till the poor Quashies, in danger of their lives, complained to Amyas, and got rest for awhile.|$|E

60|$|Pretty little Unda {{only knew}} that her old husband was a fool who <b>could</b> be managed. <b>She</b> took no {{interest}} in the collieries except in so far as they swallowed up Kundoo five days out of the seven, and covered him with coal-dust. Kundoo was a great workman, and did his best not to get drunk, because, when he had saved forty rupees, Unda was to steal <b>everything</b> that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> find in Janki's house and run with Kundoo to a land where there were no mines, and every one kept three fat bullocks and a milch-buffalo. While this scheme ripened it was his custom to drop in upon Janki and worry him about the oil savings. Unda sat in a corner and nodded approval. On the night when Kundoo had quoted that objectionable proverb about weavers, Janki grew angry.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{will be a}} jolly old frog,' shouted Fergus, {{finding the}} {{ordinance}} of silence broken and {{making the most of}} it, on the presumption that the whole family were invited. However, the tone, rather than the uncomprehended words of his mother's answer, 'Nobody asked you, sir,' she said, reduced him to silence, and it became understood, through Fly's inquiries, that the invitation included Lady Merrifield must make her acceptance doubtful. And besides, the question which three were to go was the unspoken drawback to full bliss, and yet the delight was exceedingly great in the prospect, great enough to make the contrast of gloom in poor Dolores's spirit all the darker, as she sat, left out of <b>everything,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not now say, with absolute injustice, though she still clung to the belief that there was more misfortune than fault in her disgrace.|$|R

To think that she actually had caught Peter Rabbit and then lost him was too provoking! It was more than her temper, never of the best, could stand. In her anger she dug up the leaves and earth with her hind feet, and all the time her tongue fairly flew as she called Prickly Porky, Jimmy Skunk, and Unc' Billy Possum <b>everything</b> bad <b>she</b> <b>could</b> think of. Her yellow eyes snapped so that it seemed almost as if sparks of fire flew from them. It made Peter shiver just to look at her.|$|R
