5|$|Notably, {{terrestrial}} mammals, including horses (Equus ferus caballus), goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), cats (Felis catus), {{and brown}} rats (Rattus norvegicus), are fairly common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> contents of tiger sharks around {{the coasts of}} Hawaii. In one case, remains of two flying foxes were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> of this shark. Because of its aggressive and indiscriminate feeding style, it often mistakenly eats inedible objects, such as automobile license plates, oil cans, tires, and baseballs.|$|E

5|$|Chloride (Cl−) and {{hydrogen}} (H+) ions are secreted separately <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> fundus region {{at the top}} of the stomach by parietal cells of the gastric mucosa into a secretory network called canaliculi before it enters the stomach lumen.|$|E
5|$|Oats are {{the most}} popular grain for horses. Oats have a lower {{digestible}} energy value and higher fiber content than most other grains. They form a loose mass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> that is well suited to the equine digestive system. They are also more palatable and digestible than other grains.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that nonpathogenic strains of H. pylori may be beneficial, e.g., by normalizing stomach acid secretion, and {{may play a role}} in regulating appetite, since its presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> results in a persistent but reversible reduction in the level of ghrelin.|$|E
5|$|Rick, Shane, and Rick's son Carl (Chandler Riggs) {{go hunting}} for food, and spot a deer nearby. As Carl goes up closer, a gunshot rings out, and Carl finds {{he has been}} shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> falling over to Rick's shock.|$|E

40|$|Mytilus edulis, Cerastoderma edule and Aequipecten opercularis {{were found}} to ingest {{zooplankton}} when susp-ended in mesh cages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water column <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Firth of Clyde. Zooplankters were also found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomachs</b> of bivalves that had been taken directly from their natural habitat. The bivalves consumed {{a wide range of}} zooplankton species, but selectively consumed smaller categories of zooplankton present. Condition of zooplankton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomachs</b> of <b>the</b> bivalves varied with zooplankton species. A degree of larviphagy was evident, particularly in Mytilus edulis...|$|R
50|$|Gastropexy is a {{surgical}} operation <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> is sutured to the abdominal wall or <b>the</b> diaphragm. Gastropexys <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> is sutured to the diaphragm are sometimes performed {{as a treatment}} of GERD to prevent <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> from moving up into the chest.|$|R

5|$|A lone Japanese {{soldier was}} able to fire off three mortar rounds toward the main gate. Although members of F Company quickly located the soldier and killed him, several Rangers, Scouts, and POWs were wounded in the attack. Battalion surgeon Capt. James Fisher was mortally injured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> and was carried to the nearby village of Balincari. Scout Alfred Alfonso had a {{shrapnel}} wound to his abdomen. Scout Lt. Tom Rounsaville and Ranger Pvt. 1st Class Jack Peters were also wounded by the barrage.|$|E
5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the small intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E
50|$|Quillfishes {{have been}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomachs</b> of {{juvenile}} Coho salmon, Oncorhynchus kisutch, and Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. The longest quillfish was nearly as long (82%) as its predator.|$|R

50|$|C. allmani {{primarily}} eats crustaceans and ringworms (Annelida). Occasionally, it eats mollusks, Foraminifera, {{and brittle}} stars (Ophiuroidea). Scales of Merlangius (whiting) {{have been found}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomachs</b> of some individuals.|$|R
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a fly might see them. Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied {{on the idea that}} DNA could be preserved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E
5|$|Helicobacter pylori, {{previously}} Campylobacter pylori, is a gram-negative, microaerophilic bacterium found usually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach.</b> It {{was identified}} in 1982 by Australian scientists Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, {{who found that}} it was present in a person with chronic gastritis and gastric ulcers, conditions not previously believed to have a microbial cause. It is also linked to the development of duodenal ulcers and stomach cancer. However, over 80% of individuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic, and it may {{play an important role in}} the natural stomach ecology.|$|E

5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach,</b> food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the digestive tract. The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
5|$|Kim races after Edward, while Jim obtains {{a handgun}} and follows Kim. In the mansion, Jim ambushes Edward and fights with him; Edward refuses {{to fight back}} until he sees Jim slap Kim as she {{attempts}} to intervene. Enraged, Edward stabs Jim <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> and pushes him from a window of the mansion, killing him. Kim confesses her love to Edward and kisses him before departing. As the police and neighbors gather, Kim leads them to believe that Jim and Edward killed each other.|$|E
5|$|So far, no fossil of Plateosaurus {{has been}} found with gastroliths (gizzard stones) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>stomach</b> area. The old, widely cited idea that all large dinosaurs, implicitly also Plateosaurus, {{swallowed}} gastroliths to digest food because of their relatively limited {{ability to deal with}} food orally has been refuted by a study on gastrolith abundance, weight, and surface structure in fossils compared to alligators and ostriches by Oliver Wings. The use of gastroliths for digestion seems to have developed on the line from basal theropods to birds, with a parallel development in Psittacosaurus.|$|E
50|$|The species' {{scientific}} epithet commemorates Carl Peter Holbøll, a Danish {{civil servant}} and early explorer of the fauna of Greenland.
