5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and working memory tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Working memory manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired <b>interference</b> <b>suppression)....</b> Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in working memory and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
25|$|Often, {{more than}} one {{capacitor}} family is employed for these applications, e.g. <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> can use ceramic capacitors or film capacitors.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors, {{including}} film types, {{designed for}} continuous operation at low-frequency (50 or 60nbsp&Hz) mains voltage, typically between line and neutral or line and ground for <b>interference</b> <b>suppression,</b> {{are required to}} meet standard safety ratings; e.g., X2 is designed to operate between line and neutral at 200-240nbsp&VAC, and Y2 between line and ground. These types are designed for reliability, and, in case of failure, to fail safely (open-, rather than short-circuit). A non-catastrophic failure mode in this application {{is due to the}} corona effect: the air enclosed in the winding element becomes ionized and consequently more conductive, allowing partial discharges on the metallized surface of the film, which causes local vaporization of the metallization. This occurs repeatedly, and can cause significant loss of capacitance (C-decay) over one or two years. International standard IEC60384-14 specifies a limit of 10% C-decay per 1,000 test hours (41 days of permanent connection). Some capacitors are designed to minimise this effect. One method, at the expense of increased size and cost, is for a capacitor operating at 200-240VAC to consist internally of two parts in series, each at a voltage of 100-120VAC, insufficient to cause ionisation. Manufacturers also adopt cheaper and smaller construction intended to avoid corona effect without series-connected sections, for example minimising enclosed air.|$|E

2500|$|Cognitive {{control and}} {{stimulus}} control, which {{is associated with}} operant and classical conditioning, represent opposite processes (i.e., internal vs external or environmental, respectively) that compete over the control of an individual's elicited behaviors. Cognitive control, and particularly inhibitory control over behavior, is impaired in both addiction and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.EFs can be improved (Diamond & Lee 2011, Klingberg 2010).... At any age across the life cycle EFs can be improved, including in the elderly and in infants. There has been much work with excellent results on improving EFs in the elderly by improving physical fitness (Erickson & Kramer 2009, Voss et al. 2011)... Inhibitory control (one of the core EFs) involves being able to control one's attention, behavior, thoughts, and/or emotions to override a strong internal predisposition or external lure, and instead do what's more appropriate or needed. Without inhibitory control we {{would be at the}} mercy of impulses, old habits of thought or action (conditioned responses), and/or stimuli in the environment that pull us this way or that. Thus, inhibitory control makes it possible for us to change and for us to choose how we react and how we behave rather than being unthinking creatures of habit. It doesn’t make it easy. Indeed, we usually are creatures of habit and our behavior is under the control of environmental stimuli far more than we usually realize, but having the ability to exercise inhibitory control creates the possibility of change and choice.... The subthalamic nucleus appears to {{play a critical role in}} preventing such impulsive or premature responding (Frank 2006).}} Working memory is a short-term, capacity-limited cognitive buffer that stores information and permits its manipulation to guide decision-making and behavior....These diverse inputs and back projections to both cortical and subcortical structures put the prefrontal cortex in a position to exert what is often called [...] "top-down" [...] control or cognitive control of behavior....

The distinction in neural response between monolinguals and bilinguals indicates not only that <b>interference</b> <b>suppression</b> and response inhibition are cognitively distinct from one another, but also supports the idea that bilingualism provides an advantage in the cognitive control of inhibition concerning conscious attention (manual key pressing), but doesn't not seem to have a significant effect regarding the control of more instantaneous motor responses (inhibition of eye movements).|$|E

40|$|Response {{inhibition}} and <b>interference</b> {{monitoring and}} <b>suppression</b> are two {{important aspects of}} cognitive control. Previous functional imaging studies have suggested a common network of brain regions underlying these cognitive processes; the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), the dorsal cingulate (dACC), and the parietal cortex (PC). The relative contribution of these regions to these cognitive subprocesses, however, has not been determined. Based on previous findings supporting a role for dACC in the monitoring of conflicting information within a stimulus, we hypothesized greater activity in this cortical region during <b>interference</b> monitoring and <b>suppression</b> relative to response inhibition. On the other hand, as response inhibition is characterized by differential cognitive processes such as control implementation, top down modulation of the response, expectancy, and inhibition of behavioural response, we hypothesized increased activity in the other cortical nodes of the cognitive control network relative to <b>interference</b> monitoring and <b>suppression.</b> To this end, we conducted an event-related {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) study in 57 healthy volunteers using a task preferentially involving either <b>interference</b> monitoring and <b>suppression</b> or response inhibition. Accuracy for response inhibition was lower than for <b>interference</b> monitoring and <b>suppression.</b> Imaging data showed activation in DLPFC, dACC, VLPFC, PC for both conditions. Comparisons between the two conditions indicated greater activation bilaterally in DLPFC, VLPFC and PC during response inhibition, and greater activation in the dACC during <b>interference</b> monitoring and <b>suppression.</b> These results extend previous findings by suggesting regional functional specialization within a cortical network supporting cognitive control...|$|R

30|$|In the RSNs, {{the radar}} members {{interfere}} {{with each other}} if their waveforms are nonorthogonal and this introduces degradation to the detection and estimation performance of the RSNs. In this paper, we introduce the polarization information rather than the waveform design for RSNs, and discuss the feasibility when using the proposed oblique projection polarization filtering (OPPF)-based scheme to suppress the interferences in a cooperative RSN where all the polarization information of the radar member are shared. The analysis shows that the Doppler-shift and its uncertainty are independent of the polarization information, which contributes that the interferences can be suppressed without the utilization of the spatial, the temporal, the frequency, the time-delay, and the Doppler-shift information. Theoretical analysis and the mathematical deduction show that the proposed scheme is a valid and simple implementation to the <b>interference</b> <b>suppressions</b> problems for RSNs.
