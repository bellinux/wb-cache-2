40|$|A {{biotoxin}} is {{a poisonous}} substance {{that is a}} specific product of the metabolic activities of a living organism (plant, animal, fungus, bacteria). Unlike most other biohazards, biotoxins do not replicate and, in some senses, are more analogous to chemical toxins. Proper handling and disposal of biotoxins pose special challenges but yet are vital steps toward the protection of laboratory and service personnel. Solubilization of Biotoxins Biotoxins are frequently lyophilized or otherwise concentrated into the powdered form as the final preparation stage. Commercial preparations typically are shipped in crimped vials that are topped by a rubber stopper, while the individual laboratory may package and store the powder in vials or microcentrifuge tubes. Solubilizing the powder to formulate a stock solution presents a risk to the researcher because {{of the possibility of}} dispersal of the powder into the air.

It has more than 3 -fold reduced overall assay duration than the commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, it has a wide detection range i. e. 0. 3 pg/mL- 20 ng/mL and 125 -fold better analytical sensitivity than the commercial ELISA kit. The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored in 0. 1 M PBS without any significant loss of functional activity. The developed HFA CIA is multisubstrate-compatible and can be employed for immunoassays {{on a wide range of}} commercially-relevant substrates that are being used in various biosensors/point-of-care diagnostics. ### Introduction The development of a robust, rapid and highly-sensitive immunoassay format for the precise detection of HFA is an absolute requirement for clinical disease diagnosis. HFA is a highly specific biomarker for atherosclerosis (1) and hepatocellular carcinoma (2), which is also involved in diabetes (3), cardiovascular diseases (4), arthritis, metabolism-associated syndrome (5), and malaria 6. It is a liver-derived protein that is secreted into the bloodstream in the concentration range of 450 - 600 µg/mL. The concentration of HFA changes significantly in various pathophysiological conditions (1, 7 - 9). Several immunoassay formats have been developed till date for HFA detection, which were mainly based on ELISA (10 - 11), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (12), microarray (13), and electrochemical luminescence (6). However, ELISA is still the most widely used format and the accepted clinical standard for HFA detection. But in recent years, several highly-sensitive chemiluminescent substrates, having wide detection range and improved analytical sensitivity, have been developed (14). The developed CIA (15), being the most sensitive immunoassay format for HFA detection in comparison to ELISA and SPR, can have potential applications in clinical diagnostics. APTES has been widely used for the leach-proof immobilization of biomolecules (16 - 19) as it enables high immobilization density, long-term stability, high reproducibility, and less biofouling. It has been extensively employed for the development of continuous glucose monitoring systems (20 - 22). In the present study, the covalent crosslinking of antibodies in a leach-proof manner on APTES-functionalized bioanalytical platform leads to higher functional antibody immobilization density that results in highly sensitive analyte detection. ### Reagents 1.

The limit of detection (LOD) and analytical sensitivity were 0. 3 pg/mL and 5 pg/mL, respectively. The various experimental controls demonstrated the highly specific detection of HFA and non-interference of BSA with any of the assay components (Figure 2 B). The inter- and intra-day variability were in the range of 2. 1 - 6. 3 % and 3 - 8. 2 %, respectively, while the half-effective concentration (EC 50) was 52 pg/mL. The intra- and inter-day variability were calculated from five assay repeats (in triplicate) on a single and five different days, respectively. The developed HFA CIA significantly decreased the overall assay duration by more than 3 -fold i. e. from 20 h (commercial HFA sandwich ELISA) to about 5. 5 h. It has better analytical performance as its analytical sensitivity (5 pg/mL) was 125 -fold better than that of the commercial HFA ELISA (625 pg/mL). Moreover, it has lower limit of detection (LOD) with better analytical sensitivity in comparison to our previously developed HFA immunoassay formats based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (12) and sandwich ELISA (10 - 11). The higher sensitivity of CIA is mainly due to the high functional antibody immobilization density on APTES-functionalized MTP and the higher sensitivity of chemiluminescent substrate (luminol/enhancer and stable peroxide solution). The enhancer in chemiluminescent substrate (14) results in rapid and highly intensified signal for a longer time, which enables wider detection range and low background. The anti-HFA antibody-bound MTPs can be effectively stored at 4 °C in 0. 1 M PBS for many weeks without any significant decrease in functional activity (15), which is useful for rapid analyte detection in mass-use applications such as clinical diagnosis. However, as the developed procedure takes only 1. 5 h for antibody immobilization, it will completely obviate the need of storing antibody-bound MTPs in industries, where they are usually stored for about two weeks. Our previously developed modified MTP format (23), which was specifically designed to perform immunoassays on different substrate platforms, was employed to demonstrate the multisubstrate-compatibility of developed HFA CIA that was mainly due to the generic nature of APTES-functionalization step. Various commercially-relevant substrates, i. e. PS, PC, PMMA, CA, Zeonex™ and Zeonor™, were used as they are being employed extensively for various biosensors, diagnostics, lab-on-a-chip technologies, and other bioanalytical applications (Figure 3). ### References 1.

Luong ### Abstract A rapid {{one-step}} kinetics-based sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) procedure {{has been}} developed for highly-sensitive detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) in less than 30 min. With minimal process steps, the procedure is highly simplified and cost-effective. The analysis only involves sequentially {{the formation of a}} sandwich immune complex on capture anti-CRP antibody (Ab) -bound Dynabeads, followed by two magnet-assisted washings and an enzymatic reaction. The developed immunoassay (IA) detected CRP in the dynamic range of 0. 3 - 81 ng mL- 1 with a limit of detection and analytical sensitivity of 0. 4 ng mL- 1 and 0. 7 ng mL- 1. Its analytical precision for analysis of CRP spiked in diluted human serum, whole blood, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) plasma samples of patients was validated by conventional ELISA, unravelling its immense potential for in vitro diagnostics (IVD). ### Introduction As the gold standard for the detection of CRP in clinical diagnostics, ELISA exhibits high-throughput, excellent reproducibility, high precision and remarkable sensitivity. Last five decades have accumulated over 300, 000 peer-reviewed articles related to ELISA. In particular, the last decade has also witnessed considerable advances in diversified CRP assay formats (1 - 22), lateral flow (20), immunoturbidimetry (1, 11), surface plasmon resonance (14), piezoresistive cantilever-based IA (10), chemiluminescent IA (3), impedimetry (23), electrochemistry 17, reflectometric interference spectroscopy 19, microfluidics (7) and homogenous bead-based IA (24). In general, most of these assay formats are based on a complex procedure comprising of many process steps with a lengthy analysis time (25 - 28). Therefore, there is uttermost importance for the development of rapid and cost-effective IA procedures with high precision and minimal process steps to guide healthcare professionals to decide on the desired intervention at an early stage. CRP, a pentameric protein with a molecular weight of 118 kDa, is a member of a class of acute-phase reactants indicating activation of innate and adaptive immunity (13, 29, 30). It {{plays an important role in}} host defense by binding to phosphocholine and related microbial molecules. As an early indicator of infectious or inflammatory conditions (31, 32), CRP is usually elevated in patients with neonatal sepsis (33 - 35), meningitis, pancreatitis, pneumonia and pelvic inflammatory disease and occult bacteremia. The significantly elevated serum CRP levels are associated with malignant diseases, bacterial infections and correlate with increased 30 -day mortality rates in hospitalized patients (36). The monomeric CRP binds to the surface of damaged cells and platelets, thereby activating the complement cascade that plays an important role in inflammation. The American Heart Association/Center for Disease Control has considered CRP as the best inflammatory marker for clinical diagnosis (37). The precise and rapid determination of human C-reactive protein (CRP) is essential for diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis (33 - 35, 38, 39), cardiovascular diseases (40 - 44), infectious/inflammatory conditions (31) and diabetes (45 - 47). The ability for repeated CRP measurements with high precision in an acute setting provides clinicians with the valuable information to assess disease diagnosis and circumvent any unnecessary administration of antibiotics. The normal CRP levels in human serum are usually below 10 µg mL- 1 30 but up to 350 - 400 µg mL- 1 in several disease states. The CRP levels in the ranges of 10 - 40 µg mL- 1, 40 - 200 µg mL- 1, and > 200 µg mL- 1 are the indicators of mild or chronic inflammation and viral infections; acute inflammation and bacterial infections; and severe bacterial infections and burns, respectively (30). The CRP levels beyond the cut-off point of 5 µg mL- 1 are indicative of neonatal sepsis, which is diagnosed based on the determination of two CRP concentration ranges normal (0. 2 - 480 µg mL- 1) and high sensitivity (0. 08 - 80 µg mL- 1) 30. The high sensitivity CRP assay is performed first, but the normal CRP assay is also performed if the CRP levels are > 80 µg mL- 1. The existing analytical techniques for the determination of CRP have limitations in terms of prolonged IA duration and lower analytical sensitivity, as reviewed recently by Algarra et al. (22). The clinical laboratory-based CRP assays, based on latex agglutination or nephelometry, and phosphocholine and O-phosphorylethanolamine based immunoassays can detect CRP only in the detection range of µg mL- 1. On the other hand, the recently developed immunoassay formats, based on electrochemical techniques, nanoparticles, nanocomposites, chemiluminescence, total internal reflection and micromosiac immunoassays, have higher sensitivities in the range of ng mL- 1 to µg mL- 1. Similarly, the surface plasmon resonance based real-time and label-free immunoassay formats have sensitivity between ng mL- 1 to g mL- 1. Therefore, there is a critical need for a highly simplified, cost-effective, precise and highly sensitive IA format for the rapid detection of CRP. We have developed a rapid one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure (48) (Figure 1) to detect CRP in human whole blood and serum in less than 30 min. It has critically reduced the IA duration by more than 12 -fold and the analysis cost by 2. 5 -fold in comparison to the conventional procedure. This novel ELISA format required also significantly reduced number of process steps and only two washing steps in comparison to the conventional counterpart (Table S 1). Moreover, the high analytical precision of the developed procedure implies its tremendous potential for rapid analyte detection in clinical and bioanalytical settings. ### Materials 1.

As a result, the concentration of biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab used was 0. 17 µg mL- 1, while SA-HRP dilution employed was 1 : 3000. ### Equipment 1. - 70 °C freezer (operating range - 60 to - 86 °C) (New Brunswick) - 2 - 8 °C refrigerator (Future, UK) - Direct-Q® 3 water purification system (Millipore, USA) - Tecan Infinite M 200 Pro microplate reader (Tecan, Austria GmBH) - Mini incubator (Labnet Inc., UK) - Quadermagnet magnetic holder (Supermagnete, Germany) - PVC fume cupboard Chemflow range (CSC Ltd.) ### Procedure **Preblocking TIMING ~ 30 min** 1. Block the MTP wells by incubating with 300 μL of 5 % (w/v) BSA for 30 min a 37 °C and wash with 300 μL of wash buffer five times. Washing can also be performed with an automatic plate washer. The preblocking is essential to prevent non-specific binding of IA reagents to the MTP wells (49). CRITICAL STEP Use filtered BSA or filter the BSA solution prior to use to remove any microbial or other contaminants. ?TROUBLESHOOTING **One-step kinetics-based CRP sandwich ELISA TIMING 30 min** - 2. Dispense in the BSA-blocked MTP wells sequentially 2 µL of the diluted stock solution of anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® (diluted 1 : 10 in binding buffer), 38 µL of the binding buffer and 40 µL of biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab (0. 17 µg mL- 1) pre-conjugated to SA-HRP (diluted 1 : 3000). Finally, dispense 40 µL of CRP (varying concentrations; 0. 3 - 81 ng mL- 1) in the respective MTP wells in triplicate. Place the MTP on the magnetic holder and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min so that the magnets capture the Dynabead®-bound sandwich immune complex. Take out the excess reagents by sucking back the solution using a 300 µL multi-channel pipette. ?TROUBLESHOOTING - 3. Wash the magnetically-captured sandwich immune complex-bound Dynabeads® twice by dispensing and sucking back 300 µL of the washing buffer using a 300 µL multi-channel pipette. Thereafter, suspend the washed magnetically-captured sandwich immune complex-bound Dynabeads® in 50 µL of the binding buffer. - 4. Add 100 µL of the TMB-H 2 O 2 mixture to each MTP well and incubate at RT for 4 min to allow the enzymatic reaction to develop color. ?TROUBLESHOOTING - 5. Stop the enzymatic reaction by adding 50 µL of 2 N H 2 SO 4 to each MTP well. - 6. Measure the absorbance at a primary wavelength of 450 nm and 540 nm as the reference wavelength in the Tecan Infinite M 200 Pro microplate reader. CRITICAL STEP Determine the absorbance within 10 min of stopping the enzymatic reaction. ### Troubleshooting ![TABLE 1]([URL] "TABLE 1 ") ### Anticipated Results The developed CRP sandwich ELISA critically reduced the IA assay duration by 12 -fold, from 6 h (commercial CRP sandwich ELISA) to just 30 min, based on the use of Ab-bound Dynabeads®/MTPs. The developed ELISA is cost-effective and highly-simplified as attested by the minimal process steps and 2. 5 -fold reduced IA components in comparison to the conventional ELISA procedure (Tables S 1, S 2). It detects 0. 3 - 81. 0 ng mL- 1 of CRP with linearity in the range of 1 - 81 ng mL- 1 (Figure 2 A). LOD, analytical sensitivity and correlation coefficient (R 2) are determined to be 0. 4 ng mL- 1, 0. 7 ng mL- 1, and 0. 998, respectively (Table S 2). The intraday and interday variability determined from five assay repeats (in triplicate) in a single day and five consecutive days, respectively, are in the ranges of 0. 7 - 10. 8 and 1. 6 - 11. 2, respectively. The developed ELISA can detect the entire pathophysiological range of hsCRP from 3 - 80 µg mL- 1 in human whole blood and serum after appropriate dilution, as demonstrated by the detection of CRP spiked in diluted whole blood and plasma (Figure 2 A). It has high specificity for CRP, as demonstrated by the use of various experimental process controls (Figure 2 B) that shows no detectable interference with the immunological reagents. The optimum duration for the formation of the sandwich immune complex by the one-step kinetics-based procedure is 15 min, while the optimum number of magnet-assisted washings thereafter is only two (Figure S 1). The developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs have the same analytical precision for the detection of CRP in diluted whole blood and serum as the results are in agreement with each other (Table 2). The percentage recovery for the CRP-spiked diluted human whole blood is in the range of 93. 3 - 107. 0 and 94. 0 - 103. 3 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. Similarly, the percentage recovery for CRP-spiked diluted human serum ranges from 103. 3 - 108. 0, compared to 93. 3 - 113. 0 for the developed and conventional sandwich ELISAs, respectively. The results obtained for the detection of CRP in the EDTA plasma samples of patients by the developed ELISA are also in good agreement with those obtained by the conventional ELISA (Table 3). The anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® can be stored for more than 4 months at 4 ºC without compromising the CRP detection response (Figure 2 C). The production variability for the preparation of anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads®, using the same lots of Dynabeads® and anti-CRP capture Ab, is less than 3 percent (Figure 2 D). Moreover, the developed ELISA using SA-HRP/biotinylated anti-CRP Ab conjugate is similar to the variant of the developed ELISA procedure that employs the two-step binding of biotinylated anti-CRP Ab and SA-HRP (Figure S 2 A). The one-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA solution (comprising anti-CRP capture Ab-bound Dynabeads® and biotinylated anti-CRP detection Ab preconjugated to SA-HRP, stored at 4 ºC in BSA-preblocked MTPs) exhibited no noticeable decrease in its functional activity for up to 4 weeks (Figure S 2 B). Therefore, taking into account the attributes of the developed generic sandwich ELISA procedure, it can be reliably employed in clinical and bioanalytical settings. Moreover, it has immense potential for the development of novel and fully automated rapid IVD kits in combination with lab-on-a-chip technologies, microfluidics, nanotechnology and smart system integration. ### Figures **Figure 1 : Schematic of the protocol** ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") One-step kinetics-based sandwich ELISA procedure for the rapid detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) (48).

Norberg, consisted of a main and an art building and a boys' gym. The new facility followed the architectural model of Henry VIII's Hampton Court in England. On November 10, {{the first anniversary of}} the laying of the cornerstone, the new T-shaped main building was dedicated and featured the state's most complete science departments with experimental switchboards, <b>fume</b> <b>cabinets,</b> and a greenhouse over the biology rooms; a print shop that handled printing for both high schools and the junior college (now College of San Mateo); a Tudor design library; and a dumbwaiter for fast communication between the principal's office and the superintendent's office on the second floor. A clock tower looming above the main entrance boasted the only set of chimes in a high school in the state. The $115,000 chimes were presented by Mrs. Charles S. Howard in memory of her son. With San Mateo and Burlingame high schools officially separated, students in the two cities were committed to attend their respective schools. The school was structurally reinforced for earthquake safety measures in 1934-1935 and then was entirely renovated for earthquake safety in 2005.|$|R
30|$|Different {{methods have}} been {{reported}} for the processing of developing latent fingermarks using cyanoacrylate fuming. Simple homemade system consisting of a chamber, such as a glass aquarium, {{can be used to}} develop cyanoacrylate vapors by suitable heat source like hot plate, heater etc. and fumed the articles bearing latent impression at minimal cost. Articles to be processed are suspended in chamber and small amount of liquid cyanoacrylate is heated to around 80 to 100  °C to produce sufficient vapor. A container of water must also be placed in the tank to provide sufficient humidity for the development of prints. Low humidity causes the appearance of weakly developed prints with poor contrast. Development process should be regularly inspected to avoid over-development. Temperature control, proper vapor circulation and automatic removal of the cyanoacrylate vapor are some of the added advantages of commercial fuming chamber over home-made chamber. Some systems also have humidity control (Champod et al. 2004). Stokes and Brennan (1995) developed a reliable, robust and easy to use free standing cabinet for the automatic development of latent fingermarks using cyanoacrylate fuming. Some authors used cyanoacrylate treated neutral filter paper to develop latent fingermarks on cadavers, living skin, currency, kraft paper, leather, wood and silk fabric. The neutral filter paper was brushed or sprayed with cyanoacrylate ester or cyanoacrylate ether solution allowed to dry for several minutes. The treated paper was then put on the surface bearing latent fingermarks. This paper should be left on the surface for 5 to 60  min depending upon the nature of surface (Jian and Dao-an 1991). Almog and Gabay (1986) used glass desiccators and polythene bag as a <b>fuming</b> <b>cabinet</b> to develop latent fingermarks on different kinds of porous surfaces using cyanoacrylate fuming method.|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{innovations}} {{and modernization}} has greatly {{contributed to the}} development in automobile industry. Automobile has become a huge luxury for everyone in all the countries. All modern automobiles like cars are equipped with air conditioner and heater units. An air conditioner alters the properties of air (temperature and humidity) to more comfortable conditions in building, house or automobile. But despite having various advantages, there are few drawbacks as well. Earlier the external pollution was the main concern but nowadays due to use of air conditioner in the car the fumes like carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide etc. enters inside the cabinet through the inlets of the AC {{if there is any}} leakage. Heater may also produce <b>fumes</b> inside the <b>cabinet</b> if running for long time and ventilation is not there. Fumes like Carbon monoxide is lackluster, unscented, weak and exceptionally lethal and some harmful effects of this gas are cerebral pain, tipsiness, shortcoming, queasiness, regurgitating, midsection agony, and disarray. So a prototype is designed which detects the presence of gas inside the cabinet then alert the user by an alert system and automatically open the window to let the fresh air come inside the vehicle. If the level of CO increases continuously then it will automatically send an alert message with location to the concerned person related to the victim through GSM and GPS...|$|R
