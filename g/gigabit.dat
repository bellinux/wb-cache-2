5|$|For the unibody {{polycarbonate}} MacBook (2009), {{the ports}} {{from left to}} right are the MagSafe power connector, <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet, Mini DisplayPort, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.|$|E
5|$|The main {{features}} of the class are its stealth characteristics and land-attack capability. The ships incorporate structural, thermal and acoustic stealth features. The vessels use 10 <b>gigabit</b> LAN for their network.|$|E
5|$|The ports {{are all on}} {{the left}} edge; on early models, from left to right, they are the MagSafe power connector, <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet, mini-DVI, FireWire 400, 2 USB 2.0 ports, audio in, audio out and Kensington Security Slot.|$|E
50|$|The {{solid state}} {{recorders}} are constructed from 16 Mbit IBM Luna-C DRAMs. One recorder has 1.1 <b>gigabits</b> of storage, {{the other has}} 0.67 <b>gigabits.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{commissioned}} in 2002 and built by Tyco Submarine Systems of the United States {{with an initial}} capacity of 10 <b>Gigabits</b> per second, and current capacity of 440 <b>Gigabits</b> per second. It has four fiber strands, using Erbium-doped fiber amplifier repeaters and wavelength division multiplexing.|$|R
50|$|TeraGrid uses a 10 <b>Gigabits</b> {{per second}} {{dedicated}} fiber-optical backbone network, with hubs in Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. All resource provider sites connect to a backbone node at 10 <b>Gigabits</b> per second. Users accessed the facility through national research networks {{such as the}} Internet2 Abilene backbone and National LambdaRail.|$|R
5|$|It was {{reported}} that 3GB of RAM would be reserved for the operating system and utility software, leaving 5GB for games. With DirectX 11.2 as the console's API, the graphics processing unit (GPU) {{is based on an}} AMD GCN architecture with 12 compute units, which have a total of 768 cores, running at 853MHz providing an estimated peak theoretical power of 1.31 TFLOPS. For networking, Xbox One supports <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet, 802.11n wireless, and Wi-Fi Direct.|$|E
5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a high bandwidth and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet.|$|E
5|$|Cray had {{intended}} to use gallium arsenide circuitry in the Cray-2, which would not only offer much higher switching speeds but also used less energy and thus ran cooler as well. At the time the Cray-2 was being designed, the state of GaAs manufacturing simply was {{not up to the}} task of supplying a supercomputer. By the mid-1980s, things had changed and Cray decided {{it was the only way}} forward. Given a lack of investment on the part of large chip makers, Cray decided to invest in a GaAs chipmaking startup, <b>GigaBit</b> Logic, and use them as an internal supplier.|$|E
50|$|The {{satellite}} {{was equipped}} with onboard tape recorder with storage capacity of 62 <b>Gigabits.</b>|$|R
50|$|In January 2014, Nokia Solutions and Networks {{indicated}} that it had completed {{a series of tests}} of voice over LTE (VoLTE) calls on China Mobile's TD-LTE network. The next month, Nokia Solutions and Networks and Sprint announced that they had demonstrated throughput speeds of 2.6 <b>gigabits</b> per second throughput using a LTE-TDD network, surpassing the previous record of 1.6 <b>gigabits</b> per second.|$|R
50|$|In December 2009, Micron Technology {{announced}} an SSD using a 6 <b>gigabits</b> per second (Gbit/s) SATA interface.|$|R

The Links {{are seen as a}} model for future city builds as part of smart city data pools and infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{original}} 15- and 17-inch model MacBook Pros come with ExpressCard/34 slots, which replace the PC Card slots {{found in the}} PowerBook G4. All first generation 15-inch models have two USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port, while the 17-inch models have three USB 2.0 ports {{as well as one}} FireWire 400 port. When first introduced, the MacBook Pro did not come with FireWire 800 or S-Video ports, although FireWire 800 was added in the next 15-inch model revision and is present in every version of the 17-inch design. S-Video capability can be attained {{through the use of a}} DVI to S-Video adapter. External displays with up to a 2,560×1,600 pixel resolution are supported through a dual-link DVI port. All models include a built-in <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet port, Bluetooth 2.0, and 802.11a/b/g. Later models include support for the draft 2.0 specification of 802.11n and Bluetooth 2.1.|$|E
5|$|For {{external}} connectivity, the Mac Pro included five USB 2.0 ports, two FireWire 400 and two FireWire 800 (Late 2006 until Early 2008), respectively four FireWire 800 (Early 2009 until Mid 2012) ports. Networking {{was supported}} with two built-in <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet ports. 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support (AirPort Extreme) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, {{whereas in the}} 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. Bluetooth also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more PCIe graphics cards. More recent cards featured two Mini DisplayPort connectors and one dual-link Digital Visual Interface (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card graphics memory available.|$|E
40|$|The Yottabyte NetStorage(TM) Company, today {{announced}} a new world record for TCP disk-to-disk data transfer using the company's NetStorager(R) System. The record-breaking demonstration transferred 5 terabytes of data between Chicago, Il. to Vancouver, BC and Ottawa, ON, at a sustained average throughput of 11. 1 <b>gigabits</b> per second. Peak throughput exceeded 11. 6 <b>gigabits</b> per second, more than 15 -times faster than previous records for TCP transfer from disk-to-disk (1 page) ...|$|R

5|$|The second {{generation}} Mac Pro has a redesigned configuration of ports. It has a HDMI 1.4 port, dual <b>Gigabit</b> Ethernet ports, six Thunderbolt 2 ports, four USB 3 ports, and combined digital Mini-TOSlink optical / analog 3.5mm stereo mini jack for audio output. It {{also has a}} headphones mini jack (the two are distinctly selectable within the Sound System Preference panel, Output tab). There is no dedicated port for inputting audio. The system has a low-fidelity internal mono speaker. The Thunderbolt 2 ports support up to thirty-six Thunderbolt devices (six per port) and can concurrently support up to three 4K displays. This design requires two GPUs to support the seven display outputs (HDMI and six Thunderbolt). The I/O panel illuminates itself when the unit senses it has been moved {{to make it easier}} for the user to see the ports. Unlike the previous model, it has no FireWire 800 ports, dedicated digital audio in/out ports, a SuperDrive, DVI port, 3.5-inch drive bays for replaceable storage drives, or changeable internal PCIe slots. Instead, there are six Thunderbolt 2 ports to connect high-speed external peripherals, including enclosures for internal PCIe cards.|$|E

25|$|Given {{the nature}} of MIMO, it {{is not limited to}} {{wireless}} communication. It can be used for wire line communication as well. For example, a new type of DSL technology (<b>gigabit</b> DSL) has been proposed based on binder MIMO channels.|$|E
50|$|RESOURCESAT-1 {{also carries}} a solid state {{recorder}} with {{a capacity of}} 120 <b>GigaBits</b> to store the images taken by its cameras which can be read out later to the ground stations.|$|R
25|$|The eighty <b>gigabits</b> {{per second}} of {{bandwidth}} each Ka band satellites offers is an improvement {{on the four}} to six <b>gigabits</b> per second capacity available from earlier interim satellites. The satellites bounce signals from a satellite dish on the premises to an earth station, known as a 'gateway'; the gateway is then connected to a POI via a fibre backhaul. The satellite design was 'not easy', because the required coverage is about 'five per cent of the world's land mass' containing 'at least 200,000 premises' spread across 'over 7,000 kilometres' of area between Cocos Islands and Norfolk Island.|$|R
