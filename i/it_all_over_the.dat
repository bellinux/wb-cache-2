25|$|Not {{only have}} {{employees}} {{lost their jobs}} in the United States, but it has happened with social network users internationally. In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation to hers. In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her job because she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers. The photo went viral exposing <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Internet. In November 2009, a woman working for IBM in Quebec, Canada, lost her company's health insurance benefits because she posted photos displaying her mental health problem. The company decided to cut her benefits because it was costing them additional funds.|$|E

500|$|This lila is a {{constant}} theme in the legends of Krishna's childhood and youth. Even when he is battling with a serpent to protect others, he is described in Hindu texts {{as if he were}} playing a game. This quality of playfulness in Krishna is celebrated during festivals as Rasa-lila and Janmashtami, where Hindus in some regions such as Maharashtra playfully mimic his legends, such as by making human gymnastic pyramids to break open handis (clay pots) hung high in the air to [...] "steal" [...] butter or buttermilk, spilling <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> group.|$|E

The crew called out several times, but after receiving no response, they entered and found Hendrix alone in bed. Dannemann was nowhere to be found. According to Jones: [...] "Well, we had to get the police, we only had [...] and an empty flat, so John ran up and radioed, and got the aspirator... It was horrific. He was covered in vomit. There was tons of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> pillow—black and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down... We felt his pulse... showed a light in his eyes. But there was no response at all." [...] At 11:30a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: [...] "Once the police arrived, which seemed like no time at all, we got [...] off to hospital as quick as we could." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1891 the Great Northern Railway {{crossed the}} Continental Divide at Marias Pass , which is along the {{southern}} boundary of the park. In an effort to stimulate use of the railroad, the Great Northern soon advertised the splendors of the region to the public. The company lobbied the United States Congress. In 1897 the park was designated as a forest preserve. Under the forest designation, mining was still allowed but was not commercially successful. Meanwhile, proponents of protecting the region kept up their efforts. In 1910, {{under the influence of}} the Boone and Crockett Club, spearheaded by Club members George Bird Grinnell, Henry L. Stimson, and the railroad, a bill was introduced into the U.S. Congress which redesignated the region from a forest reserve to a national park. This bill was signed into law by President William Howard Taft on May 11, 1910. In 1910 George Bird Grinnell wrote, [...] "This Park, the country owes to the Boone and Crockett Club, whose members discovered the region, suggested it being set aside, caused the bill to be introduced into congress and awakened interest in <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> country".|$|E

500|$|While {{establishing}} {{herself as}} an artist and working her way up through the New York underground club scene, Gaga released her debut studio album, The Fame. Speaking about the title and concept of the album, Gaga explained: [...] "The Fame is about how anyone can feel famous. [...] Pop culture is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>The</b> Fame. But, it's a sharable fame. I want to invite you all to the party. I want people to feel a part of this lifestyle." [...] Gaga stated in an interview with MTV UK that she had been working on the album {{for two and a half}} years and completed half of it during the first week of January 2008. As well as writing the lyrics, Gaga worked on the melodies and synth work of the album, with record producer RedOne. According to Gaga, the first track [...] "Just Dance" [...] is a joyous, heart-themed song, which appeals to people going through tough times in their life. [...] "LoveGame", the second track, was inspired by Gaga's sexual crush on a stranger in a night club to whom she said, [...] "I wanna ride on your disco stick". It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick hook. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with About.com, that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love. Essentially a love song, [...] "Paparazzi" [...] dealt with enticing the media and asked the question, whether one can have both fame and love.|$|E
500|$|The episode [...] "What Was Missing" [...] became {{controversial}} {{because of}} an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum. The controversy largely began after an accompanying [...] "Mathematical" [...] recap—a studio-endorsed behind the scenes video series implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans. This incident was addressed by the show's producer, Fred Seibert, who said that [...] "in {{trying to get the}} show’s audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far." [...] Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although [...] "What Was Missing" [...] still airs during reruns. Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; Bitch magazine later wrote an article about how the episode [...] "handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way", but that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television. Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said that, because there were [...] "so many extreme positions taken on <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> Internet", he did not [...] "really want to comment on it [...] it was a big hullaballoo." [...] In August 2014, Olson commented on the controversy, telling a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from The Adventure Time Encyclopedia, that, according to Ward, Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show {{has not been able to}} officially make clear the relationship in the series itself.|$|E

He explained how he did this with one of the two volumes of his prosopographical study of the Russian elite in the early modern period. [...] "Shortly after I sent the book for review", he writes, [...] "a very worried journal editor contacted me. He was upset that I hadn't included a copyright page on the e-book I sent him. Without a copyright page, he explained, any reader could copy my book, send <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world, or use it in the classroom [...] all without my permission.

2500|$|As head groundsman at Taunton from 1946, Buttle {{was also}} called on {{when there were}} {{problems}} with other cricket pitches in Somerset: in 1953, he was forced into emergency action after the newly-relaid pitch at the Recreation Ground, Bath produced a farcical one-day result {{on the first day}} of what was meant to be a three-match festival of three-day games– the match, against Lancashire, was Bertie Buse's benefit match and was finished before six o'clock on the opening day. Buttle told Foot: [...] "I had to take drastic action, and I decided on plenty of liquid marl and cow manure. We used a watering can to spread it across the wicket. The problem was knowing how to camouflage what we'd done. Then I hit on the use of cut grass. I sprinkled <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> top and gave it a good roll."

2500|$|The New York Times called Helmet [...] "a {{band that}} made {{important}} connections between indie-rock and metal." [...] They {{have had a}} large impact on many nu/alternative metal, post-hardcore and heavy metal acts, with bands such as Tool, Snapcase, Pantera, Mastodon, Converge, Meshuggah, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Queens of the Stone Age, Godsmack, Sepultura, At the Drive-In, System of a Down, Nine Inch Nails, Rammstein, Korn, Marilyn Manson, Reuben, Silverchair, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Lostprophets, Papa Roach, Slipknot, Staind, Three Days Grace, Static-X, L7, Chevelle, Deftones, Grinspoon, Killswitch Engage, The Devil Wears Prada, Shuvel, Primer 55, Pressure 4-5 and Norma Jean all having been inspired by Helmet's sound. Music artist Mike Patton has also cited Helmet as having a significant influence on his solo career; with original drummer John Stanier and Patton actually having played in the music project Tomahawk together. Regarding Helmet's influence on the heavy rock world, Hamilton remarked [...] "I hear <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> place. I've heard Helmet riffs in Evanescence. Kids today have no idea at this point, because they [...] got into, say, Korn or System of a Down. Bands like Mastodon and Norma Jean tell me, 'Oh, we ripped you guys off with this,' or 'We got turned on by that.'
