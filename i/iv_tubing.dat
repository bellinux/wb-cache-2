25|$|In late 2007, Tania {{became friends}} with Joey Henderson during the 'Ferndale Strangler' storyline and became dangerously close to {{becoming}} one of his victims after she told Alice Piper {{that he was just}} a 'boy' and she wasn't interested in dating him. When Joey overheard this, he was revealed to be the Ferndale Strangler in the 2007 Christmas cliffhanger with him preparing to strangle Tania with <b>IV</b> <b>tubing</b> inside her apartment. When Tania cut her finger with a knife, Joey panicked and put the IV line away, with her narrowly avoiding death without even knowing it. After this he stalked her in a shopping mall and hoped to kidnap her by offering her a lift but Yvonne picked her up and took her up north for Christmas. Joey missed his chance, and once again Tania avoided death unknowingly. Tania dated both Kip Denton (Will Hall) and Hone Ropata (Temuera Morrison) before she began an abusive relationship with gang member Kingi Te Wake (Te Kohe Tuhaka). Kingi left her and Tania dated Ben Goodall (Shaun Edwards-Brown), only to lose him to her mother. Ben was assaulted by a small gang of hoodlums and later it was discovered he had a brain hemorrhage. He fell brain dead and after several arguments between Yvonne and his sister Anita (Lara Fischel-Chisholm) as to whether he would come back alive or not, his life support was turned off a week later. Tania was very upset over his death and she and Yvonne reunited. She rebounded with Isaac Worthington (Matt Minto) but left him when he cheated on her. In late 2010 {{she fell in love with}} Rafe Durville (Simon London) and left the country with him to Australia to start a clinic. She returned briefly in 2012 for Yvonne's birthday. In 2013, Bella Durville (Amelia Reid-Meredith) visited Tania and Rafe.|$|E

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{is known}} to be a potent {{inhibitor}} of platelet activation and adhesion. NO released by macrophages or other inflammatory cells also serves as a natural antimicrobial agent in the immune system. Therefore, polymeric materials that are capable of stable and long-term NO release should exhibit similar antithrombotic and antimicrobial properties. In this dissertation, novel polymeric materials that can release NO at physiological relevant levels for extended time periods were examined and evaluated for their potential biomedical applications. S-Nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), the NO donor compound, exhibits unprecedented shelf stability when incorporated into low water uptake polymer CarboSil 20 80 A, a tri-copolymer of polyurethane, poly(dimethylsiloxane) and polycarbonate. Solid-state analysis demonstrated that SNAP can partially dissolve in CarboSil polymer (ca. 3. 4 - 4. 0 wt%) and the SNAP molecules exceeding the solubility limit crystalize via hydrogen bonding within the polymer phase to form a stable polymer-crystal composite material. The slow dissolution of the crystals ultimately contributes to the long-term NO release upon solution contact (Chapter 2). The unique NO release mechanism also directly correlates with the polymer surface area that is exposed to the aqueous solution, suggesting that a water rich layer in the outermost surfaces of the polymer material is the likely site where most of the NO is liberated from the soluble SNAP within the polymer (Chapter 3). An optimized solvent impregnation process was also developed to transform off-the-shelf medical devices, such as intravascular (IV) catheters, to NO releasing catheters (Chapter 4). For example, dip-coated CarboSil <b>IV</b> catheter <b>tubing</b> can be impregnated with up to 15 wt% SNAP loading in methanol/methyl ethyl ketone (30 / 70 v/v) within 2 h. Both SNAP-doped and SNAP-impregnated CarboSil catheters exhibit significantly less bacterial biofilm formation in vitro and reduced clotting in vivo when compared to the controls. Further, dual-functional antibacterial biomaterial surfaces that combine the physical modification (e. g., topographical texture) and chemical modification (e. g., NO release) were developed, with the aim of achieving a synergistic and/or additive effect on the inhibition of bacterial adhesion. Textured CarboSil surfaces bearing ordered pillar topographies (400 / 400 / 600, 500 / 500 / 600 and 700 / 700 / 300 nm) were fabricated via a soft lithography two-stage replication process. The NO release concept was introduced either by spin-coating SNAP-doped CarboSil sub-layer {{in the middle of the}} polymer film (Chapter 5) or by impregnating SNAP into the bulk of the polymer via solvent impregnation (Chapter 6). The antibacterial results demonstrated that the dual functional polymer surfaces provide a synergistic effect in reducing bacteria adhesion of S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa. Overall, the stable and long-term delivery of NO from biomedical polymers provides an attractive approach to improve the hemocompatibility and antibacterial properties of a wide variety of medical devices that face biocompatibility/microbial infection challenges within the hospital setting...|$|R

No study has quantified the binding effect of nesiritide to intravenous tubing, tested binding properties of different materials, or analyzed binding effect of central lines, where priming cannot occur. Furthermore, prescribing information states that nesiritide must not be administered through a central heparin-coated catheter, since it may bind to heparin. However, no study quantified this binding effect. Methods 1. 5 mg vials of nesiritide were reconstituted into 250 mL 0. 9 % NS bags. A 23. 3 mL bolus, followed by 7 mL/h 2 - hour infusion (2 ug/kg bolus, 0. 01 ug/kg/min infusion for a 70 kg pt) were run, in duplicate, through 5 separate experimental tubing systems: 1) Standard PVC peripheral <b>IV</b> <b>tubing</b> primed with a 25 mL of nesiritide; 2) Standard non-primed PVC peripheral IV tubing; 3) Non-primed polyethylene peripheral <b>IV</b> <b>tubing,</b> commonly used for NTG infusion; 4) Non-primed PVC peripheral <b>IV</b> <b>tubing,</b> connected distally to a central IV polyurethane catheter; 5) Non-primed PVC peripheral <b>IV</b> <b>tubing,</b> connected distally to a heparin-coated pulmonary artery PVC catheter.

30|$|As {{evidenced}} {{in a recent}} review by Schein et al. on PCA medication errors, at least 4.5 % of patients in the US each year are affected by IV PCA errors linked to medical prescriptions, drug choice/combinations, dose titrations, pump programming, and modifiable operator/patient dosing of analgesic opioid (Schein et al., 2009; Hicks et al., 2008). In our patient population the use of Zalviso® contributed to reduce such risks altogether, by eliminating possible sources of operator or patient manipulation —thanks to the single-dosed nanotablets and pre-programmed lockout interval set by the manufacturer which did not require any further operator-dosing interventions. Moreover, the device’s programmed lockout period system also eliminates the risk of opioid overdose by preventing patients from accessing tablets too close in time from one another, while the sublingual formulation maximized absorption and reduced the risk for analgesic gaps. One last advantage of Zalviso® with sublingual tablets is that it avoided {{the need for the}} physical connection to a PCA pump or IV pole, which generally reduce mobility and involve the classic risks of infection, analgesic gaps due to IV catheter infiltration or <b>IV</b> <b>tubing</b> obstruction (Panchal et al., 2007; Palmer & Miller, 2010).|$|E

We then developed an “AMI team” approach which included ER physicians, ER nurses, ECG technicians, and pharmacists. The diagnostic approach of the AMI team was based on two pocket cards that contained information on the following: 1) indications/contraindications of thrombolytic treatment in AMI; 2) thrombolytic treatment drug selection guidelines (tPA versus SK); 3) ancillary therapy drugs and dosages; and 4) ancillary therapy indications/contraindications. Treatment by the AMI team centered around an AMI kit-a tackle box that contained both thrombolytic drugs, all necessary ancillary treatments (ASA, heparin, beta blockers, nitrates, MS, and magnesium) and <b>IV</b> <b>tubing</b> plus drug compatibility charts.
