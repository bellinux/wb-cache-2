5|$|Born on August 9, 1982 in Lexington, Kentucky, Tyson Gay is {{the only}} son of Daisy Gay and Greg Mitchell. Athletic prowess {{was part of his}} family life; Gay's {{grandmother}} ran for Eastern Kentucky University and his mother Daisy also competed in her youth, though she was pregnant with her first child by her early teens. Gay's older sister, Tiffany, was a keen sprinter and had a successful high school career. Tiffany and Tyson Gay, encouraged by their mother, raced at every opportunity, training hard at school and on the hills <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> There was strong competition between the two, and Gay later said that his sister's quick reaction time inspired him to improve.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1991, a {{local group}} in Albany, New York, fought the government's {{plan to create}} a nuclear waste dump <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> It was staged by Citizens Against Radioactive Dumping (CARD) at the monthly meeting of the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission in Albany. Here four {{children}} dressed up as Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, and presented a three-eyed fabric fish, which looked like Blinky, to the commission. In addition to that they performed a rap song, which explained {{the plot of the}} episode.|$|E
5|$|CG {{was also}} used to {{recreate}} the San Francisco neighborhood at Washington and Cherry Streets where cab driver Paul Stine was killed. The area had changed significantly {{over the years and}} residents didn't want the murder to be re-created <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> so Fincher shot the six-minute sequence on a bluescreen stage. Production designer Donald Burt gave the visual effects team detailed drawings of the intersection as it was in 1969. Photographs of every possible angle of the area were shot with a high-resolution digital camera, allowing the effects crew to build computer-based geometric models of homes that were then textured with period facades. 3-D vintage police motorcycles, squad cars, a firetruck and street lights were added to the final shot.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of Antoinists: desservants who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors. As its {{aim is to}} heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people. The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion. After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on {{the decline in the}} country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful; for example, in 2003, Human Rights Without Frontiers counted less than 150 worshipers in the country. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members. Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000. The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism suffers from a lack of social visibility and many people are unaware even of Antoinist temples <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and desservants are often old-age retired people.|$|E
25|$|From January 1, 2011, through February 26, 2012, {{police were}} called to The Retreat at Twin Lakes 402 times. Crimes {{committed}} at The Retreat in the year prior to Martin's death had included eight burglaries, nine thefts, and one shooting. Twin Lakes residents said {{there were dozens of}} reports of attempted break-ins, which had created an atmosphere of fear <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Initially Indecision played {{mostly in}} local clubs. Over time, {{a lot of}} the venues <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> closed down, which {{prompted}} them to take a larger step and lead to the bands integration into the New York City hardcore scene. In the early days, the band would often show up to gigs all in one car, with their equipment tied to the roof with Bungee cords.|$|E

25|$|The church built several temples {{based on}} the two {{ordinance}} room plan, but added more square footage to accommodate an additional sealing room. These temples vary in size and style, although some look similar to the original design. Often plans were modified because local residents balked {{at the idea of}} such a large temple <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> For example, the Sacramento temple was originally designed to be a much larger structure, but because of opposition, the design was changed to model the Newport Beach temple design.|$|E
25|$|Lercher et al. (2002) {{pointed to}} some {{weaknesses}} in Caron’s approach. Clusters of genes {{in close proximity}} and high transcription levels can easily been generated by tandem duplicates. Genes can generate duplicates of themselves which are incorporated <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> These duplicates can either became a functional part of the pathway of their parent gene, or (because {{they are no longer}} favored by natural selection) gain deleterious mutations and turn into pseudogenes. Because these duplicates are false positives in the search for gene clusters they have to be excluded. Lercher excluded neighboring genes with high resemblance to each other, after that he searched with a sliding window for regions with 15 neighboring genes.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 2000, Gi Ha-myeong (Lee Jongsuk) {{is leading a}} happy life with his parents and older brother Jae-myeong, until his father Gi Ho-sang, {{the captain of the}} {{firefighting}} squad, dies in a factory explosion during a rescue attempt along with several of his men. When Ho-sang's body is initially missing, the media sensationalizes the case by scapegoating him. In a battle for ratings, cold and calculating MSC reporter Song Cha-Ok alleges that Ho-sang survived the blast, and is currently in hiding because he was {{responsible for the deaths of}} his men. This causes the Gi family to become outcasts <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and objects of national scorn. Gi Ho-sang's wife kills herself and her younger son (Ha-myeong) by jumping off a cliff, and Jae-myeong blames their deaths on the media, particularly Cha-ok.|$|E

50|$|Upon retaking {{the capital}} Damascus after the Battle of Damascus (2012), the Syrian {{government}} began {{a campaign of}} collective punishment against Sunni suburbs in-and-around the capital which had supported FSA presence <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhoods.</b>|$|R
25|$|The mob {{went after}} conversos, denouncing them as heretics, killing them, and burning their houses. To stop the excesses, the highly {{respected}} D. Alonso Fernandez de Aguilar, whose {{wife was a}} member of the converso family of Pacheco, together with his brother D. Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba ("El Gran Capitán"), and a troop of soldiers, hastened to protect the New Christians. D. Alonso called upon the mob to retire. Its leader insulted the count, who immediately felled him with his lance. Aroused, the people considered him a martyr. Incited by Alonso de Aguilar's enemy, they again attacked the conversos. The rioting lasted three days. Those who escaped sought refuge in the castle, where their protectors also took shelter. The government decreed that Jews and Conversos should remain <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> or leave the city.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example of}} this {{approach}} is the slum upgrade in Tondo slum near Manila, Philippines. The project was anticipated to be complete in four years, but it took nine. There was a large increase in cost, numerous delays, re-engineering of details to address political disputes, and other complications after the project. Despite these failures, the project reaffirmed the core assumption and Tondo families did build their own houses of far better quality than originally assumed. Tondo residents became property owners with a stake <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> A more recent example of slum-upgrading approach is PRIMED initiative in Medellin, Colombia, where streets, Metrocable transportation and other public infrastructure has been added. These slum infrastructure upgrades were combined with city infrastructure upgrade such as addition of metro, paved roads and highways to empower all city residents including the poor with reliable access throughout city.|$|E
25|$|Paul Bert Rahasimanana {{was born}} in 1960 to a working-class family. At the age of seven, he was given an {{accordion}} as a gift and began teaching himself to play. In the early 1970s, Rahasimanana {{and a group of}} friends formed an a capella group called Hazo Midoroboka and began singing traditional consolatory songs (mamonjy jaobany) for those grieving at wakes held <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of Ampamarinana in the Mahamasina district of Antananarivo. Mourners paid the members of the group in the form of free cups of coffee and fritters. Like many other urban youth from working class and poor neighborhoods, Rossy also performed soava and vakisova, contemporary and typically a capella urban genres that expressed incisive social critique through slang-laden, rapped lyrics with complex hand-clapping accompaniment. While a high school student in 1981 he formed his first band, using African percussion rather than a Western drum kit to set the rhythm. In 1983, Rossy gave his first public performance of a song he had composed in the lively vakisôva genre. The performance occurred in the courtyard of the historic Ecole Sainte Famille located in Mahamasina and was attended by local television host Tsilavina Ralaindimby, who recognized the young man's talent. Ralaindimby brought him {{to the attention of the}} director of the Centre Germano-Malgache, who was sufficiently impressed to collaborate with WDR (the predecessor of Radio France Internationale) to organize a four-month series of performances for Rossy in Germany.|$|E

500|$|Some people {{stated that}} the Links {{could also be used}} for {{loitering}} and illicit phone calls. One Hell's Kitchen bar owner cited concerns about the users of a Link located right outside his bar, including a homeless man who a patron complained was a [...] "creeper" [...] watching animal pornography, as well as several people who made drug deals using the Link's phone capabilities while families were nearby. In Greenpoint, locals alleged that after Links were activated <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood</b> in July 2017, these particular kiosks became locations for drug deals; however, that particular Link was installed near a known drug den.|$|E
500|$|Peter Hayden Dinklage {{was born}} on June 11, 1969, in Morristown, New Jersey, to John Carl Dinklage (1931–2004), an {{insurance}} salesman, and Diane Dinklage (b. 1943), an elementary-school music teacher. He was born with achondroplasia, a common form of dwarfism. Dinklage grew up as the only dwarf in his family in Brookside, New Jersey, with his parents and older brother, Jonathan. He is of German and Irish descent. As a child, Dinklage and his brother performed puppet musicals for people <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> Dinklage has described his brother, who is a violinist, as being the [...] "real performer of the family", saying that his brother's passion for the violin {{was the only thing}} that kept him from pursuing acting.|$|E
500|$|Suspicious {{as to why}} Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd {{are living}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> Stewie and Brian {{investigate}} the house and discover a secret underground military facility, eventually learning that the two actors were made real spies by Ronald Reagan after he saw their film Spies Like Us. Chase and Aykroyd explain that during the Cold War, the Soviet Union turned dozens of American citizens into sleeper agents who would fall into a trance and do the bidding of the KGB upon hearing the phrase, [...] "Gosh, that Italian family {{at the next table}} sure is quiet" [...] – a phrase no one would normally use. They later explain that one of the sleeper agents resides in Quahog, and they are looking for him/her. Chase and Aykroyd ask Brian and Stewie to help them in their mission, noting that they know several people acting very strangely in Quahog. Brian and Stewie accept the offer.|$|E

500|$|The site {{chosen for}} the {{monument}} changed several times throughout the planning process. [...] Suggested locations included the intersection of Florida Avenue and Massachusetts Avenue NW, Sheridan Circle (current site of the General Philip Sheridan statue) and the intersection of N Street and Connecticut Avenue NW (current site of the Doctor John Witherspoon statue). [...] In 1906, residents of the Kalorama Triangle neighborhood, then called Washington Heights, represented by cartoonist Clifford K. Berryman and Rear Admiral Thomas Oliver Selfridge, Jr., asked the statue commission to consider placing the monument <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood.</b> [...] The commission, then led by Secretary of War and future President William Howard Taft, Senator Wetmore and General Horatio Collins King, approved the suggested site {{at the intersection of}} Connecticut Avenue and Columbia Road NW, describing it as a [...] "more satisfactory and imposing" [...] location. [...] An additional factor that led to the site's approval was that the area had been a Union camp during the summer of 1861 when McClellan arrived in Washington, D.C.|$|E
500|$|The Victoria Park Community Association {{fought the}} bid {{to build the}} arena <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> {{threatening}} to oppose the city's Olympic bid if necessary. [...] City Council voted on March 3, 1981 to build the proposed 20,000 seat arena on the Stampede grounds, immediately east of the Corral and south of Victoria Park. The community continued to fight the city over rezoning the land {{to allow for the}} new arena amidst fears of traffic congestion in their neighbourhood which resulted in numerous costly delays to the start of construction. In a bid to end the battle, Mayor Ralph Klein asked the provincial government in July 1981 to take over the land designated for the arena to bypass the appeals process and force approval. The province supported the city amidst protests by community associations and invoked rarely used powers to overrule planning regulations, allowing construction to begin. The following day, on July 29, 1981, builders began construction of the arena. The International Olympic Committee was impressed that the project was underway, as noted in the XV Olympic Winter Games official report which stated [...] "The fact that this facility was already being built added credibility to (Calgary's) bid and proved to be a positive factor in demonstrating Calgary's commitment to hosting the Games".|$|E
