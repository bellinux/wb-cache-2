500|$|In a May 2015 interview, Frusciante {{said that}} he was {{finished}} with making music for public consumption, that he currently has no audience and {{in the past few years}} recorded music with no intention of ever releasing it. Frusciante said [...] "For the last year and a half I made the decision to stop making music for anybody and with no intention of releasing it, which is what I was doing between 2008 and 2012. I felt that if I took the public into consideration at all, I wasn’t going to grow and I wasn’t going to learn. Being an electronic musician meant I had to woodshed for a while, so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> few years worth of material from that period that’s never been released… At this point, I have no audience. I make tracks and I don’t finish them or send them to anybody, and consequently I get to live with the music. The music becomes the atmosphere that I’m living in. I either make really beautiful music that comes from classical, or I make music where the tempo is moving the whole time, and there’s no melodic or rhythmic center.” ...|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E

She {{qualified}} for the women's individual archery tournament after receiving a wildcard from the Tripitate Commission in June 2016 based on her results at the 2015 Asian Archery Championships and the 2016 Archery World Cup qualification event in Antalya. In an interview with Kuensel before the Games, Karma said: [...] "I’m very excited and nervous at the same time.
