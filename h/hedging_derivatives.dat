40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} use of, and {{interaction}} between reinsurance and derivative hedging for {{property and casualty}} insurance companies in the United States. To investigate an insurer’s operation on investment, underwriting and derivative hedging simultaneously, a dynamic theoretical model is constructed to study the impact of reinsurance on investment <b>hedging</b> <b>derivatives</b> and underwriting <b>hedging</b> <b>derivatives</b> separately. The main predictions made by the model are as follows. (1) Underwriting <b>hedging</b> <b>derivatives</b> serve as a substitute to reinsurance. (2) The relationship between investment <b>hedging</b> <b>derivatives</b> and reinsurance depends on the hedging cost function and the correlation between an insurer’s investment and underwriting business. (3) Investment <b>hedging</b> <b>derivatives</b> are positively correlated {{with the amount of}} risky investments. The theoretical predictions are supported by empirical evidence taken from derivative transactions reported by U. S. individual property and casualty insurance companies in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) annual statutory financial statements from 2001 - 2010. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of <b>hedging</b> <b>derivatives</b> under temporary market impact. We are going to examine the problem of <b>hedging</b> <b>derivatives</b> in an optimal control setting similar to [14] and [10]. By considering specific combinations of volatility and liquidity specifications, we are able to obtain analytic solutions. Under the optimal control, the holdings in the stock exhibit a mean reverting behavior. While the reversion-speed is similar to the results in the literature, we are able to find a new characterization of the target portfolio as weighted average of future Δ-hedge portfolios. If the stock-price process is given by a Brownian motion, this characterization collapses to the Δ-hedge. In that case, the final hedging error is proportional to the variance of the Δ-hedge. Further, we extend the analysis by including drift using asymptotic expansions. We find that under the optimal control, the wealth process is mean-reverting towards the expectation of the derivative. The hedging portfolio adjusts more to the inclusion of drift if future hedging is less aggressive. The comparison with numerical solutions suggests that the approximations perform reasonably well...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test several risk {{management}} models for computing expected shortfall for one-period hedge errors of <b>hedged</b> <b>derivatives</b> positions. Contrary to value-at-risk, expected shortfall cannot be tested using the standard binomial test, since we need information {{of the distribution}} in the tail. As derivatives positions change characteristics and thereby the size of risk exposures over time one cannot apply the standard tests based on stationarity. To overcome this problem, we present a transformation procedure. For comparison purposes the tests are also performed for value-at-risk. ...|$|R

The contingent claim is hedged by one illiquid risky asset and the hedging error is measured by a quadratic criterion.

40|$|To {{mitigate}} systemic risk, some {{regulators have}} advocated the {{greater use of}} centralized counterparties (CCPs) to clear Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives trades. Regulators should be cognizant that large banks active in the OTC derivatives market do not hold collateral against all the positions in their trading book and the paper proves an estimate of this under-collateralization. Whatever collateral is held by banks is allowed to be rehypothecated (or re-used) to others. Since CCPs would require all positions to have collateral against them, off-loading {{a significant portion of}} OTC derivatives transactions to central counterparties (CCPs) would require large increases in posted collateral, possibly requiring large banks to raise more capital. These costs suggest that most large banks will be reluctant to offload their positions to CCPs, and the paper proposes an appropriate capital levy on remaining positions to encourage the transition.

Our results indicate that use of credit derivatives does not pose a substantial threat to financial sector stability in the United Kingdom.
