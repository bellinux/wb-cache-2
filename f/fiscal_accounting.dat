Today the Long-Term Investors Club gathers 18 financial institutions and institutional investors mainly from G20 countries, representing a combined balance sheet total of USD 5.4 trillion.Also in 2011, Caisse des Dépôts and other institutional investors held a national summit on long-term investment in France. From the summit a Report was drafted and it gained momentum in the financial establishment. This {{led to the creation of}} the “task force of the Paris stock exchange on long term investment” under the guidance of former financial director of AXA insurance company Gerard de la Martiniere. Still active today, the task force is dedicated to the promotion of the model of long term investment to the institutions of the European Union on a regulatory, <b>fiscal,</b> <b>accounting</b> and prudential level. After the publication of the European Commission Green Paper on the long-term financing of the economy, in July 2013, Caisse des Dépôts, together with the European members of the Long Term Investors Club, cofounded the European Long Term Investors Association. This association allows for the undertaking of joint actions in order to highlight this specific investor model with public stakeholders and the European Union.The Eltia gathers 27 European long-term financial institutions. With a combined balance sheet of €2.45 trillion, ELTIA’s goal is to promote long-term investment in alignment with the objectives and initiatives developed by the European Union.Caisse des Dépôts also contributes to the work of the European Parliament Intergroup on long term investment and reindustrialisation which was implemented at the start of the election of the European Parliament in 2014.|$|E
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{tested in}} this paper is that land transport is a sector that is oversized in Tenerife. To demonstrate this, an exercise based on a <b>fiscal</b> <b>accounting</b> procedure is applied to land transport using an ecological economics approach. This <b>fiscal</b> <b>accounting</b> exercise is intended to demonstrate the differences between government revenue and the expenditure through the entire cycle of the transport sector. The results show that: a) expenditure surpasses revenue by nearly 21 million; b) road transport is indirectly subsidised (despite claims from the automotive sector); c) investments in the private transport sector are much larger than in public transport (despite claims from the government). The main limitation detected concerns data collection difficulties.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} some {{policy issues}} under a currency board arrangement (CBA), {{focusing on the}} conduct of fiscal policy {{which is the only}} policy instrument at the disposal of the authorities as the CBA precludes an independent monetary policy. It is argued that the loss in degrees of freedom under a CBA restrains considerably the room for fiscal policy manoeuvre, especially in cases of external disturbances or shocks. Within this framework the paper analyses some of the policy challenges that policy makers in Bulgaria have been facing since 1997. It is argued that despite the macroeconomic stabilization and the fiscal consolidation achieved after the introduction of the CBA, some serious economic problems still remain and new ones have emerged; among them are the deterioration in competitiveness and the large losses that SOEs continue to generate. The paper addresses also some more general issues related to <b>fiscal</b> <b>accounting</b> during the transition {{in the context of the}} intertemporal budget constraint of the public sector.

40|$|Assessing the {{sustainability}} of a given fiscal policy {{is especially important for}} countries that depend on income from exhaustible resources. Political and growth pressures may push governments to raise expenditure when revenue from exhaustible resources rises, but cutting outlays when price swings reduce income is often difficult.

This paper argues that for countries in which a significant proportion of government revenue is derived from the exploitation of an exhaustible natural resource, fiscal policy sustainability can best be assessed within a permanent income framework that takes into account total government wealth, including the imputed wealth from reserves of natural resources. Using this framework, the paper takes a sample of six countries where government revenue from petroleum extraction is significant and draws conclusions about {{the sustainability}} of their fiscal policies during 1980 - 92. ...|$|E

The reversal ofbalance of payments to moderate levels of the current account deficit, combined withsome adjustment in the fiscal accounts and a small increase in the private savings, mayraise the investment ratio to 25 % of GDP up to 2010, expanding the growth potential ofthe economy.
