5|$|Ahimsa's precept of 'cause no injury' {{includes}} one's deeds, words, and thoughts. Classical {{literature of}} Hinduism such as Mahabharata and Ramayana, {{as well as}} modern scholars debate principles of Ahimsa when one is faced with war and situations requiring self-defence. The historic literature from India and modern discussions have contributed to theories of <b>Just</b> <b>War,</b> and theories of appropriate self-defence.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} {{texts of}} Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice {{the virtue of}} Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of <b>just</b> <b>war,</b> theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} was highly {{supportive of the}} war efforts. The political left supported the war (unlike World War I, which Socialists opposed.) The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a <b>just</b> <b>war</b> because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as a <b>just</b> <b>war</b> and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but {{the federal government was}} much less hostile than before. The churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although the young women pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.|$|E

5000|$|Realism - The core {{proposition}} {{of realism}} is a skepticism {{as to whether}} moral concepts such as justice {{can be applied to}} the conduct of international affairs. Proponents of realism believe that moral concepts should never prescribe, nor circumscribe, a state's behaviour. Instead, a state should place an emphasis on state security and self-interest. One form of realism - descriptive realism - proposes that states cannot act morally, while another form - prescriptive realism - argues that the motivating factor for a state is self-interest. <b>Just</b> <b>wars</b> that violate <b>Just</b> <b>Wars</b> principles effectively constitute a branch of realism.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on pacifism among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of <b>just</b> <b>war</b> prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, as being an allegory, wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.|$|E
5|$|Alternate {{theories}} of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to {{theories of}} <b>just</b> <b>war.</b> Aikido, pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. Morihei Ueshiba, {{the founder of}} Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa. According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume {{that the world is}} free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{do not possess}} an {{intrinsic}} interest in freedom. Therefore, owning or using nonhuman animals is not, in itself, unjust. This aspect of his thought has generated responses by others, including the political theorist Robert Garner and the philosopher John Hadley, who argue {{that there may be}} reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do possess an interest in freedom. Cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's picture of a political animal rights, explicated in their 2011 book Zoopolis. Though Donaldson and Kymlicka have defended their account against Cochrane's criticism, they have said that they welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own. Cochrane's other research focusses variously on bioethics, punishment, <b>just</b> <b>war</b> and human rights.|$|E

5|$|Europe was {{immersed}} in power struggles on many different fronts. The Christian Church split along Latin Orthodox lines in 1054 after centuries of disagreement {{leading to a}} permanent division called the Eastâ€“West Schism. Following the Gregorian Reform, an assertive, reformist papacy attempted to increase its power and influence over the laity. Beginning around 1075 and continuing during the First Crusade, the Investiture Controversy was a power struggle between Church and state in medieval Europe over whether the Catholic Church or the Holy Roman Empire held the right to appoint church officials and other clerics. Antipope Clement III was an alternative pope {{for most of this}} period, and Pope Urban spent much of his early pontificate in exile from Rome. The result was intense piety and an increased interest in religious affairs amongst the general population in Catholic Europe and religious propaganda by the Papacy advocating a <b>just</b> <b>war</b> to reclaim Palestine from the Muslims. Participation in a crusade was seen as a form of penance that could counterbalance sin.|$|E
5|$|The above {{passage from}} Mahabharata emphasises the {{cardinal}} importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa {{is the highest}} virtue, Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching. Some other examples where the phrase Ahimsa Paramo Dharma are discussed include Adi Parva, Vana Parva and Anushasana Parva. The Bhagavad Gita, among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the theories of <b>just</b> <b>war.</b> However, {{there is no consensus}} on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.|$|E
25|$|Tocqueville {{argued that}} {{domination}} via violent means, though unpleasant, {{is necessary for}} colonization and justified {{by the laws of}} war. Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with <b>Just</b> <b>war</b> theory's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause. Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with <b>Just</b> <b>War</b> Theory's jus in bello criteria of proportionality and discrimination.|$|E

[...] Starr responded [...] "Why don't you write an anti-glacier novel?". This underlined Vonnegut's belief that wars were, unfortunately, inevitable, {{but that it was}} important to ensure the wars one fought were <b>just</b> <b>wars.</b>|$|R

Guthrie considers the song as relevant today as in 1965.|$|R
25|$|Other {{scholars}} such as Steven Rosen, Laurie L.

25|$|Pacifism may {{be based}} on moral {{principles}} (a deontological view) or pragmatism (a consequentialist view). Principled pacifism holds {{that at some point}} along the spectrum from war to interpersonal physical violence, such violence becomes morally wrong. Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and interpersonal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists generally reject theories of <b>Just</b> <b>War.</b>|$|E

25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{leveled at}} this justification {{is that it}} does not fulfill one of the requirements of a <b>just</b> <b>war</b> and that in waging war preemptively, the United States undermined international law and the authority of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Security Council. On this ground, by invading a country that did not pose an imminent threat without UN support, the U.S. violated international law, including the UN Charter and the Nuremberg principles, therefore committing a war of aggression, which is considered a war crime. Additional criticism raised the point that the United States might have set a precedent, under the premise of which any nation could justify the invasion of other states.|$|E
25|$|St. Augustine (354â€“430), Bishop of Hippo (modern Annaba), {{was born}} at Tagaste in Numidia (modern Souk Ahras), his mother being St. Monica (who evidently was of Berber heritage).

Following his conversion to Christianity he returned to Africa, where he became a church leader {{and the author of}} many works.

5000|$|Nonetheless, he asserted, peacefulness in {{the face}} of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by {{violence}} would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority:They who have waged war in obedience to the divine command, or in conformity with His laws, have represented in their persons the public justice or the wisdom of government, and in this capacity have put to death wicked men; such persons have by no means violated the commandment, [...] "Thou shalt not kill."While not breaking down the conditions necessary for <b>war</b> to be <b>just,</b> Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase itself in his work The City of God:But, say they, the wise man will wage <b>Just</b> <b>Wars.</b> As if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of <b>just</b> <b>wars,</b> if he remembers that he is a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be delivered from all wars.J. Mark Mattox writes that, for the individual Christian under the rule of a government engaged in an immoral war, Augustine admonished that Christians, [...] "by divine edict, have no choice but to subject themselves to their political masters and should seek to ensure that they execute their war-fighting duty as justly as possible." ...|$|R
