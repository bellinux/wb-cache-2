40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the impact of engaging frontal-mediated working memory processes on implicit and <b>explicit</b> category <b>learning.</b> Two stimulus dimensions were relevant to categorization, but in some conditions, a third, irrelevant dimension was also presented. Results indicated that in both implicit and explicit conditions, {{the inclusion of the}} irrelevant dimension impaired performance by increasing the reliance on suboptimal unidimensional strategies. With three-dimensional stimuli, a striking dissociation was observed between implicit and <b>explicit</b> category <b>learning</b> when participants performed a sequential working memory task. With <b>explicit</b> category <b>learning,</b> performance was impaired further, and there was an increased use of suboptimal unidimensional strategies. However, with implicit category learning, the performance impairment decreased, and there was an increased use of optimal strategies.

50|$|AGL {{is used in}} {{many studies}} {{as a measure of}} {{implicit}} learning or memory along with a separate test for <b>explicit</b> <b>learning</b> or memory in response to a certain variable. One study investigated the relationship between age and learning style, i.e. explicit versus implicit. An AGL task was used because of its ability to measure both implicit and <b>explicit</b> <b>learning.</b> One group of participants was given strings made from a complex grammar, with no mention in the instructions about the underlying rules. This was thought {{to increase the amount of}} implicit learning, as more complex rules are harder to perceive and participants were not attempting to find them. Another group was given strings made from a simple grammar, with instructions to try to figure out the rules. This was thought to increase the amount of <b>explicit</b> <b>learning,</b> as participants were consciously attempting to find rules that were easy to perceive. The results showed that aged adults performed poorly on the task that emphasized <b>explicit</b> <b>learning</b> compared to young adults; however, both groups performed similarly on the task that emphasized implicit learning. This demonstrates that the aging effects seen with explicit memory do not have an effect on implicit memory.|$|E
50|$|Some psychologists {{argue that}} {{implicit}} learning is {{more stable than}} <b>explicit</b> <b>learning</b> because the unconscious mind developed earlier than the conscious mind on the evolutionary timeline. Furthermore, some studies show the robustness of implicit learning through the evidence that other factors that are unique to each individual (i.e. intelligence quotient) as well as multitasking {{is less likely to}} affect implicit learning than <b>explicit</b> <b>learning.</b> Reber says that implicit learning should in all likelihood be more resilient when it comes to injury.|$|E
50|$|Examples from daily life, like {{learning}} how to ride a bicycle or how to swim, are cited as demonstrations {{of the nature of}} implicit learning and its mechanism. It has been claimed that implicit learning differs from <b>explicit</b> <b>learning</b> by the absence of consciously accessible knowledge. Evidence supports a clear distinction between implicit and explicit learning; for instance, research on amnesia often shows intact implicit learning but impaired <b>explicit</b> <b>learning.</b> Another difference is that brain areas involved in working memory and attention are often more active during explicit than implicit learning.|$|E

In {{a study conducted by}} Matthew Kirkhart [...] undergraduate participants underwent implicit and explicit artificial-grammar learning tasks to see how declarative learning functioned in each. For the Implicit task participants where told that they would see a series of letter strings, a group of letters that appear in a word, and had to judge if the string were well formed or not well formed. For the Explicit task participants were told they had to reproduce letter strings according to a set of rules, which they had to determine and would be tested on later. The participants where then shown a series of letter strings and asked if they followed the rules or not. The results showed that declarative learning was not required for implicit learning but was related to the consistency in performance. It was seen, however, that declarative learning is required for <b>explicit</b> <b>learning</b> and consistency of performance. This shows that adults are using declarative learning when undergoing explicit tasks, such as memorizing formulas for statistics class. This research provides more evidence of the importance of declarative learning in education for not just children but for adults as well.|$|E

40|$|Cerebellar {{contributions}} to motor learning are well documented. For example, under some conditions, patients with cerebellar damage are impaired at visuomotor adaptation and at acquiring new action sequences. Moreover, cerebellar activation {{has been observed}} in functional MRI investigations of various motor learning tasks. The early phases of motor learning are cognitively demanding, relying on processes such as working memory, which {{have been linked to}} the cerebellum as well. Here, we investigated cerebellar {{contributions to}} motor learning using activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis. This allowed us to determine, across studies and tasks, whether or not the location of cerebellar activation is constant across differing motor learning tasks, and whether or not cerebellar activation in early learning overlaps with that observed for working memory. We found that different regions of the anterior cerebellum are engaged for implicit and <b>explicit</b> sequence <b>learning</b> and visuomotor adaptation, providing additional evidence for the modularity of cerebellar function. Furthermore, we found that lobule VI of the cerebellum, which has been implicated in working memory, is activated during the early stages of <b>explicit</b> motor sequence <b>learning.</b> This provides evidence for a potential role for the cerebellum in the cognitive processing associated with motor learning. However, though lobule VI was activated across both early <b>explicit</b> sequence <b>learning</b> and working memory studies, there was no spatial overlap between these two regions. Together, our results support the idea of modularity in the formation of internal representations of new motor tasks in the cerebellum, and highlight the cognitive processing relied upon during the early phases of motor skill learning...|$|R
