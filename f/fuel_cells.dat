Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils.

5|$|Later {{variants}} of the Z model were developed. The Z-6 {{was to be}} a reconnaissance aircraft, although it was only built as a prototype. During the war only a few were converted from existing combat variants. The type was selected for weather check flights. It was identical to the Z-1/Z-2 variants, but offensive armament was omitted and extra <b>fuel</b> <b>cells</b> fitted. This increased the fuel load to 2,890 l (578 Imperial Gallons). As flights required higher altitude, the oxygen supply was increased from 20 to 24 bottles. For long-range flights over water, the larger dinghy of the Z-5 with its updated emergency escape equipment was mandatory during operations. The Z-6s were also used for night fighter operations. Some of the few converted Z-6s had the Ju 88C-6 nose installed and were equipped with machine guns and cannons. The nose proved to be unsatisfactory, and it was redesigned. In the tip of the new nose was an infrared spotlight which was soon made redundant after the introduction of Lichtenstein radar which was fitted to some of the Z-6.|$|E

Only recently have improvements in the technological readiness of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powerplants enabled the first aviation applications of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> technology. Based {{on the results of}} conceptual design studies and a few technology demonstration projects, there has emerged a widespread understanding of the importance of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powerplants for near-term and future aviation applications. Despite this, many aspects of the performance, design and construction of robust and optimized <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powered aircraft have not been fully explored. This goal of this research then is to develop an improved understanding of the performance, design characteristics, design tradeoffs and viability of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powerplants for aviation applications. To accomplish these goals, new modeling, design, and experimental tools are developed, validated and applied to the design of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powered unmanned aerial vehicles. First, a general sub-system model of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powerplant performance, mass and geometry is derived from experimental and theoretical investigations of a <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powerplant that is developed in hardware. These validated <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> subsystem models are then incorporated into a computer-based, application-integrated, parametric, and optimizeable design environment that allows for the concurrent design of the aircraft and <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powerplant. These tools and methods are then applied to the analysis and design of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powered aircraft in a series of case studies and design experiments. Based on the results of the integrated <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system and aircraft analyses, we gain a new understanding of the interaction between powerplant and application for <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> aircraft. Specifically, the system-level design criteria of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> powerplants for aircraft can be derived.

This paper investigates the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> internal behaviour variation at different operating condition, with characterization test data taken at predefined inspection times, and uses the determined internal behaviour evolution to predict the future PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance. For this purpose, a PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> behaviour model is used, which can be related to various <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> losses. By matching the model to the collected polarization curves from the PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> system, the variation of <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> internal behaviour can be obtained through the determined model parameters. From the results, the source of PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> degradation during its lifetime at different conditions can be better understood. Moreover, with determined <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> internal behaviour, the future <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance can be obtained by predicting the future model parameters. By comparing with prognostic results using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), the proposed prognostic analysis can provide better predictions for PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance at dynamic condition, and with the understanding of variation in PEM <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> internal behaviour, mitigation strategies can be designed to extend the <b>fuel</b> <b>cell</b> performance...|$|R
