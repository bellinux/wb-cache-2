25|$|In 1992, Islamist militants {{gunned down}} Egyptian secularist and sharia law {{opponent}} Farag Foda. Before his death {{he had been}} declared an apostate and foe of Islam by the ulama at Al Azhar. During {{the trial of the}} murderers, Al-Azhar scholar Mohammed al-Ghazali testified that when the state fails to punish apostates, somebody <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do it.|$|E
500|$|At one point, The Samuel Goldwyn Company {{was about}} to release A New Generation, but lost the {{distribution}} rights after turning down demands from the producers. Eventually, Nelvana went into negotiations with the Hollywood studio Columbia Pictures, which acquired worldwide theatrical rights in early 1986. [...] This led founder Samuel Goldwyn, Jr. to remark: [...] "The fact that Columbia is distributing the Care Bears sequel {{is typical of the}} greed of the big studios. Someone <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go in and prove something works, then a studio will charge in." [...] By contrast, Goldwyn acquired the rights to the original film after major U.S. studios passed on it; they did not see the financial potential in a movie aimed strictly for children.|$|E
500|$|The {{museum is}} open {{every day and}} by July 2011 was {{attracting}} up to 11,000 visitors annually. Sixty percent of the museum's visitors are reported to be women, though according to {{the authors of the}} Rough Guide to Iceland, mentioning the museum [...] "causes the staff at the tourist office to blush with embarrassment." [...] The museum's guest book includes comments such as, [...] "I've never seen so many penises–and I went to boarding school!" [...] (from a New Zealand visitor), [...] "They're bigger in the USA," [...] (from someone from Wisconsin) and [...] "Is there a vagina museum?" [...] On this point, Sigurður has said, [...] "I'm only collecting the male organ. Somebody <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do the other job. I'd be interested in how they would preserve it. I think vaginas are better alive." [...] (There used to be a pop-up museum called [...] "Museum of Vaginal Imagination" [...] in Rotterdam in the Netherlands.) ...|$|E
60|$|These {{speeches of}} Mr. Davis were not long in {{reaching}} Sherman. He {{took advantage of}} the information they gave, and made all the preparation possible for him to make to meet what now became expected, attempts to break his communications. Something <b>else</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be done: and to Sherman's sensible and soldierly mind the idea was not long in dawning upon him, not only that something <b>else</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be done, but what that something else should be.|$|R

2500|$|If unions {{succeed in}} wage hikes, and {{employers}} raise the prices they charge consumers {{to maintain their}} own profit margins, and the supply of money remains the same, then something <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> [...] "give." [...] Either the prices {{of goods and services}} in nonunion sectors have to fall and offset the union sector hikes, or people's cash balances need to fall, in terms of their purchasing power.|$|E
2500|$|That same year, bassist Alec John Such {{was fired}} from the band, the first lineup change since Bon Jovi began. Hugh McDonald who was the bassist on [...] "Runaway," [...] unofficially {{replaced}} Such as bassist. Jon Bon Jovi said, regarding the departure of Such: [...] "Of course it hurts. But I learned to accept and respect it. The fact that I'm a workaholic, studio in, studio out, stage on, stage off, want {{to be dealing with}} music day and night, doesn't mean everyone <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> adjust to that pace. Alec wanted to quit for a while now, so it didn't come as a complete surprise." ...|$|E
2500|$|I've {{given up}} {{speaking}} to them. I've said basically everything that possibly {{can be said}} to this bunch. I'm basically leaving it up to them now. They are going to show me if they really want to play for Australia and whether they really want to play under me. I'll find out over the next three games and my decision will be made as to my future as a captain and a player after that... I don't think it's my captaincy... but if we continue to lose, you've just got to start saying: [...] "Right, someone <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> come in and see if they can do something different." [...] It just gets as simple as that. That's the way I see it. The fellows are not responding to me and that's that. I'll find out over the next three games if that's the case or not.|$|E
50|$|Michael's Words: In a {{confession}} aired {{during the final}} computer test, Michael described his disdain for eliminations {{not in terms of}} fear of being eliminated, but only in terms of dreading watching someone <b>else</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> leave. This is because Michael knew all along that he {{was never going to be}} eliminated.|$|R

2500|$|From 1824 onwards, {{several books}} were published, {{analyzing}} animal rights issues, rather than protection alone. Lewis Gompertz (1783/4–1865), {{one of the}} men who attended the first meeting of the SPCA, published Moral Inquiries on the Situation of Man and of Brutes (1824), arguing that every living creature, human and nonhuman, has more right to the use of its own body than anyone <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> use it, and that our duty to promote happiness applies equally to all beings. Edward Nicholson (1849–1912), head of the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford, argued in Rights of an Animal (1879) that animals have the same natural right to life and liberty that human beings do, disregarding Descartes' mechanistic view—or what he called the [...] "Neo-Cartesian snake"—that they lack consciousness. Other writers of the time who explored whether animals might have natural (or moral) rights were Edward Payson Evans (1831–1917), John Muir (1838–1914), and J. Howard Moore (1862–1916), an American zoologist and author of The Universal Kinship (1906) and The New Ethics (1907).|$|E

Well, what happens, then? Someone <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do the job instead of you. Isn't that true? The job has to be done, your job has to be done.

Everyone <b>else</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do theirs as homework, but I {{finished}} mine before class ended using Wikipedia." ...|$|R
50|$|Jung's {{thought was}} that evil is not the absence of anything, but the active and {{dramatically}} impressive presence of something, personified and named the Devil. Evil ought {{to be considered a}} real force, not written-off as an opposite. For Jung a dogma could not be valid unless backed by empirical evidence, showing that it is prime, anything <b>else</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a dodge.|$|R

60|$|But {{underneath}} the spick and span {{there is something}} more dreadful than the servitude of the servants. This dreadful thing is {{the philosophy of the}} spick and span. In Korea the national costume is white. Nobleman and coolie dress alike in white. It is hell on the women who do the washing, but there is more in it than that. The coolie cannot keep his white clothes clean. He toils and they get dirty. The dirty white of his costume is the token of his inferiority. The nobleman's dress is always spotless white. It means that he doesn't have to work. But it means, further, that somebody <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> work for him. His superiority is not based upon song-craft nor state-craft, upon the foot-races he has run nor the wrestlers he has thrown. His superiority is based upon the fact that he doesn't have to work, and that others are compelled to work for him. And so the Korean drone flaunts his clean white clothes, {{for the same reason that}} the Chinese flaunts his monstrous finger-nails, and the white man and woman flaunt the spick-and-spanness of their spotless houses.|$|E
60|$|It is to {{the general}} problem arising out of this consideration, that this and the three {{following}} essays will be addressed; the question: What <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> go if war is {{to go out of}} human life? and the problem of {{what has to be done}} if it is to be banished and barred out for ever from the future experiences of our race. For let us face the truth in this matter; the abolition of war is no casting of ancient, barbaric, and now obsolete traditions, no easy and natural progressive step; the abolition of war, if it can be brought about, will be a reversal not only of the general method of human life hitherto but of the general method of nature, the method, that is, of conflict and survival. It will be a new phase in the history of life, and not simply an incident in the history of man. These brief essays will attempt to present something like the true dimensions of the task before mankind if war is indeed to be superseded, and to show that the project of abolishing war by the occasional meeting of some Council of a League of Nations or the like, is, in itself, about as likely to succeed as a proposal to abolish thirst, hunger, and death by a short legislative act.|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "Papenveer" [...] means [...] "Catholics' ferry". When the Catholic Church in Korteraar {{closed in}} 1822, churchgoers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> cross the river De Aar {{to go to}} the church in Langeraar. A ferry was opened that was free for Catholics; {{everyone}} <b>else</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pay. The village of Papenveer grew around this ferry. Currently, there is a bridge, the Papenveerse Brug, at the location of the former ferry.|$|R

50|$|Carroll {{served as}} {{governor}} of Tennessee longer than anyone <b>else</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> this point, even fellow six-term governor Sevier.

50|$|Juxtaposition and {{contrasting}} {{images are}} used highly effectively in stanza four. Emily uses a metaphor of Augusta’s heart ‘sinking’ when the morning ‘rose’.
