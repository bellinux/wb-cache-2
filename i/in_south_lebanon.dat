25|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{creation}} of the state of Israel in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians became refugees <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Lebanon.</b> A few Palestinians with skills and capital were allowed to reside in cities and live dignified lives; the majority, however were destitute peasants who could only offer their unskilled work force to the Lebanese economy, were kept in squalid refugee camps near the main cities.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{this being}} {{considered}} {{the end of}} the war, conflict would continue. Hezbollah continued to fight the IDF and SLA <b>in</b> the <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> conflict until Israel's final withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000.|$|R
25|$|In Israel, it was {{increasingly}} debated whether {{the presence of}} Israeli forces in southern Lebanon was working, since {{it was clear that}} the 'security zone' could not stop Hezbollah rockets reaching into Israel. After heavy Israeli casualties <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>lebanon,</b> some Israeli politicians argued that the conflict would only end if Israel withdrew from Lebanon. In 2000 Ehud Barak finally withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon. Following the Israeli withdrawal, the South Lebanon Army, which was supported by Israel, was quickly overrun by Hezbollah. Some SLA members escaped to Israel, but many were captured by Hezbollah. This success against Israel greatly increased Hezbollah's popularity within Lebanon and the Islamic world.|$|E
25|$|For {{many years}} after the war's {{official}} end, and throughout Israeli presence in Lebanon, the IAF continued to mount attacks on Hezbollah and PLO positions <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Lebanon.</b> On October 1, 1985, In response to a PLO terrorist attack which murdered three Israeli civilians in Cyprus, the Israeli air force carried out Operation Wooden Leg. The strike involved the bombing of PLO Headquarters in Tunis, by F-15 Eagles. This was the longest combat mission ever undertaken by the IAF, a stretch of 2,300 kilometers, involving in-flight refueling by an IAF Boeing 707. As a result, PLO headquarters and barracks were either destroyed or damaged.|$|E
25|$|Richard Gabriel {{estimated}} that roughly 2,400 PLO fighters were {{killed during the}} war, of whom about 1,400 were killed throughout southern Lebanon and another 1,000 killed during the Siege of Beirut. Gabriel also {{estimated that}} between 5,000 and 8,000 civilians died during the war. Some later estimates have put the total figure at 18–19,000 killed and more than 30,000 wounded, most of them civilians. 80% of villages <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> were damaged, with some completely destroyed. The Israeli government maintained that about 1,000 Palestinian fighters and 800 Lebanese civilians died during the invasion, excluding the siege of Beirut. Kenneth Pollack estimated that 1,200 Syrian soldiers were killed and about 3,000 wounded during the war.|$|E

25|$|The Lebanese {{infrastructure}} {{has been}} badly scarred by the 1975–90 Civil War. After the war {{the water and}} sanitation infrastructure was rebuilt with substantial external financial assistance. <b>In</b> <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon,</b> which remained under Israeli occupation until 2000, the infrastructure was gradually rebuilt as the Israeli army withdrew. Compared to the substantial investment in infrastructure, little effort was made at building the capacity of sector institutions and at establishing policies that favor the sustainability and {{improve the quality of}} services provided. Also, wastewater treatment was neglected in terms of investments compared to water supply and sewerage. Untreated wastewater was thus discharged to the sea and to rivers. No efforts were made to conserve water. Still today, Lebanon {{is one of the few}} countries in the Middle East that has almost no water meters.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{this were}} the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) and the more radical and {{independent}} Communist Action Organization (COA). Another notable example was the pan-Syrian Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), which promoted the concept of Greater Syria, in contrast to Pan-Arab or Lebanese nationalism. The SSNP was generally aligned with the Syrian government, although it did not ideologically approve of the Ba'athist government (however, this has changed recently, under Bashar Al-Assad, the SSNP having been allowed to exert political activity in Syria as well). The multi-confessional SSNP was led by Inaam Raad, a Catholic and Abdallah Saadeh, a Greek Orthodox. It was active in North Lebanon (Koura and Akkar), West Beirut (around Hamra Street), in Mount Lebanon (High Metn, Baabda, Aley and Chouf), <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> (Zahrani, Nabatieh, Marjayoun and Hasbaya) and the Beqqa Valley (Baalbeck, Hermel and Rashaya).|$|E
25|$|Ehud Olmert {{was elected}} Prime Minister after his party, Kadima, won the most seats (29) in the Israeli {{legislative}} election, 2006. In 2005 Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was officially {{elected president of}} Iran; since then, Iranian policy towards Israel has grown more confrontational. Israeli analysts believe Ahmadinejad has worked to undermine the peace process with arms supplies and aid to Hezbullah <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> and Hamas in Gaza, and is developing nuclear weapons, possibly for use against Israel. Iranian support for Hezbollah and its nuclear arms program are in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions 1559 and 1747. Iran also encourages Holocaust denial. Following the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, Hezbollah had mounted periodic attacks on Israel, which {{did not lead to}} Israeli retaliation. Similarly, the withdrawal from Gaza led to incessant shelling of towns around the Gaza area with only minimal Israeli response. The failure to react led to criticism from the Israeli right and undermined the government.|$|E

25|$|Since {{that war}} most of Israel's {{military}} aircraft {{have been obtained}} from the United States. Among these are the F-4 Phantom II, A-4 Skyhawk, F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Israeli Air Force has also operated a number of domestically produced types such as the IAI Nesher, and later, the more advanced IAI Kfir. On June 7, 1981, eight IAF F-16A fighters covered by six F-15A jets carried out Operation Opera to destroy the Iraqi nuclear facilities at Osiraq. On June 9, 1982, the Israeli Air Force carried out Operation Mole Cricket 19, crippling the Syrian air defence array. The IAF continued to mount attacks on Hezbollah and PLO positions <b>in</b> <b>south</b> <b>Lebanon.</b> On October 1, 1985, In response to a PLO terrorist attack which murdered three Israeli civilians in Cyprus, the Israeli air force carried out Operation Wooden Leg. The strike involved the bombing of PLO Headquarters in Tunis, by F-15 Eagles. In 1991, the IAF carried out Operation Solomon which brought Ethiopian Jews to Israel. In 1993 and 1996, the IAF participated in Operation Accountability and Operation Grapes of Wrath, respectively. It took part in many missions since, including during the 2006 Lebanon War, Operation Cast Lead, Operation Pillar of Cloud and Operation Protective Edge. On September 6, 2007, the Israeli Air Force successfully bombed an alleged Syrian nuclear reactor in Operation Orchard.|$|E
500|$|Hezbollah emerged <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> {{during a}} {{consolidation}} of Shia militias as a rival {{to the older}} Amal Movement. Hezbollah {{played a significant role}} in the Lebanese civil war, opposing American forces in 1982–83 and opposing Amal and Syria during the 1985–88 War of the Camps. However, Hezbollah's early primary focus was ending Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon following Israel's 1982 invasion and siege of Beirut. Amal, the main Lebanese Shia political group, initiated guerrilla warfare. In 2006, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak stated, [...] "When we entered Lebanon … there was no Hezbollah. We were accepted with perfumed rice and flowers by the Shia in the south. It was our presence there that created Hezbollah".|$|E
500|$|Hezbollah waged a guerilla {{campaign}} <b>in</b> <b>South</b> <b>Lebanon</b> {{and as a}} result, Israel [...] from Lebanon on 24 May 2000, and SLA {{collapsed and}} surrendered. Backed by Iran, Hezbollah fighters fought against Serbian forces during the Bosnian War. Hezbollah's military strength has grown so significantly that its paramilitary wing is considered {{more powerful than the}} Lebanese Army. Hezbollah {{has been described as a}} [...] "state within a state", and has grown into an organization with seats in the Lebanese government, a radio and a satellite TV station, social services and large-scale military deployment of fighters beyond Lebanon's borders. Hezbollah is part of the March 8 Alliance within Lebanon, in opposition to the March 14 Alliance. Hezbollah maintains strong support among Lebanon's Shi'a population, while Sunnis have disagreed with the group's agenda. Hezbollah also finds support from within some Christian areas of Lebanon that are Hezbollah strongholds. Hezbollah receives military training, weapons, and financial support from Iran, and political support from Syria. Hezbollah and Israel fought each other in the 2006 Lebanon War.|$|E
