5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was deeply {{suspicious of the}} UN, and was loath to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> benefit the country's Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz {{for the establishment of}} a UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.|$|E
25|$|United Democratic Front (UDF) {{candidate}} N. A. Muhammed in {{an interview}} to The Hindu {{said he would not}} <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> distort or topple a bill favouring the implementation of the Mahajan Commission report. He also said that he would not press for implementation of the Mahajan Commission report but would certainly not act against it if such a bill was moved in the Parliament.|$|E

6000|$|Sewell laughed. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "for one thing, if you {{had been}} in love with her, you could {{scarcely}} have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have made the fact clearer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have vexed my master so much, even for a kingdom, or to please you, though I think you are as {{beautiful}} as the sun." ...|$|R
500|$|Bangalter {{stated that}} [...] "to be free, {{we had to}} be in control. To be in control, we had to finance what we were doing ourselves. The main idea was to be free." [...] Daft Punk {{discussed}} their method with Spike Jonze, director of the [...] "Da Funk" [...] music video. He noted that [...] "they were doing everything based on how they wanted to do it. As opposed to, 'oh we got signed to this record company, we gotta use their plan.' They wanted to make sure they never had to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make them feel bummed on making music." [...] Although Virgin Records holds exclusive distribution rights over Daft Punk's material, the duo still owns their master recordings through their Daft Trax label.|$|E
500|$|Johnston had a {{reputation}} as a poor batsman, averaging less than 13 in Tests and first-class matches without making a half century. He headed the averages in England in 1953, being not out 16 times out of 17 and averaging 102.00. He attributed this to [...] "a lot of application, concentration and dedication", stating that [...] "class always tells". When Hassett realised that Johnston was atop the batting averages, he told Johnston to tell the opposing captain of this fact and ask them to refrain from dismissing him. In the last match against T. N. Pearce's XI at Scarborough, English Test paceman Alec Bedser bowled wide of the stumps and advised Johnston not to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> lose him his wicket. In 1954â€“55 he made 39 for the last wicket with Neil Harvey as they chased 78 for victory before he edged Frank Tyson to the wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans.|$|E
500|$|The {{veterans}} made {{camp in the}} Anacostia flats {{while they}} awaited the congressional decision {{on whether or not}} to pay the bonus. The motion, known as the Patman bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, in mid-July the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> cost public sympathy. On July 28, army cavalry units led by General Douglas MacArthur dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured and Butler declared himself a [...] "Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican".|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, no {{one could}} expect a high-spirited boy {{to put up with}} such a life as mine. With nothing to desire and no chance of <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> annoy my parents, my days were dreary indeed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must say}} that I am {{astonished}} at the grand master's choice. Sir Gervaise Tresham doubtless distinguished himself greatly some months since, but from that time {{he has not been}} out with the galleys, or, indeed, <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> seem to recommend him for so marked a favour as a separate command." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must never}} think," [...] he said, [...] "to show your love for my memory by <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{not make you}} happy. If I am {{anywhere}} around," [...] he continued with a smile, [...] "it will be your good I shall be watching for, not my own way. You will remember that?" ...|$|R
500|$|A King's or Queen's Serjeant was a Serjeant-at-Law {{appointed}} {{to serve the}} Crown as a legal adviser to the monarch and their government {{in the same way}} as the Attorney-General for England and Wales. The King's Serjeant (who had the postnominal KS, or QS during the reign of a female monarch) would represent the Crown in court, acting as prosecutor in criminal cases and representative in civil ones, and would have higher powers and ranking in the lower courts than the Attorney- or Solicitor General. King's Serjeants also worked as legal advisers in the House of Lords, and were not allowed to act in cases against the Crown or <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> harm it; in 1540 Serjeant Browne was heavily punished for creating a tax avoidance scheme. The King's Serjeants would wear a black Coif with a narrow strip of white, unlike the all-white Coif of a normal Serjeant. The King's Serjeants were required to swear a second oath to serve [...] "The King and his people", rather than [...] "The King's people" [...] as a Serjeant-at-Law would swear. The King's favoured Serjeant would become the King's Premier Serjeant, while the oldest one was known as the King's Ancient Serjeant.|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose not," [...] he said regretfully. [...] "Of course I {{would not}} <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> cause you unpleasantness. But this must not--shall not be our last meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Miss Nugent; [...] "but that isn't {{what you}} were going to say. You need not worry about me; I shall not <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> displease you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{special case}} is a [...] "deep cover" [...] or [...] "sleeper" [...] mole, who may enter a service, {{possibly}} at a young age, but definitely not reporting or <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> attract suspicion, until reaching a senior position. Kim Philby {{is an example of}} an agent actively recruited by Britain while he was already committed to Communism.|$|R
6000|$|He {{restrained}} himself, however, {{from saying}} or <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> entangle {{him in the}} meshes of the law; {{but in order to}} preserve this outward tranquility, he was obliged to ease his mind in some way, which he did by actually glowering at the innocent officer as though he would [...] "wither him with a glance." ...|$|R
50|$|Ironically, this hijack {{has been}} {{engineered}} by Pooja's brother Vijay Varma (Rajat Bedi), {{who is in}} league with the terrorist head Akhmash Jalal. Vijay is unaware {{of the fact that}} his beloved sister is on board the same flight. When he realises this, he is unable to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> as Akhmash forbids him from <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> jeopardise their mission.|$|R
6000|$|... "And if," [...] said Beatrice, in a {{very low}} voice, [...] "if I were false to your ideal of me--if I were to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> destroy your faith in me--something weak or wicked--" ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head. 'I would not venture to offend the {{neighbours}} {{so much as}} that,' said she, 'or <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be so likely to put poor Owlett {{into the hands of}} the excisemen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could ever}} <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{be what you}} call kind--that I could ever be of the {{slightest}} service to you I fear I shall never have the opportunity." [...] Will spoke with fervor.|$|E
60|$|But Uncle Abimelech pinned {{his family}} pride to Roger de Melville. He had the Melville {{coat of arms}} and our family tree, made out by an eminent genealogist, framed and hung up in his library, and he <b>would</b> not have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> not have chimed in with that coat of arms and a conquering {{ancestor}} for the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't {{believe my}} eyes when I asked 'Where is Rose?' and Mac {{pointed to the}} little Amazon pelting down the hill at such a rate. You couldn't have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> please me more, and I'm delighted {{to see how well}} you ride. Now, will you mount again, or shall we turn Mac out and take you in?" [...] asked Dr. Alec, as Aunt Jessie {{proposed}} a start, for the others were beckoning them to follow.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 the Trek deal proved {{painful for}} LeMond {{as he was}} forced by John Burke, the head of Trek, to {{apologize}} for the negative comments about Michele Ferrari, doping, and Lance Armstrong, who was by then a very important marketing force for Trek. LeMond's contract with Trek had a clause prohibiting LeMond from <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> damage Trek. Burke reminded LeMond of this commitment, and strongly argued that LeMond publicly retract his statements. LeMond read a formal apology to Armstrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are looking}} for us, but they won't hear us. I'll run and holler louder, and bring 'em up here," [...] {{answered}} Tommy, glad to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{put an end to}} this dreadful state of things.|$|E
60|$|We {{knew well}} enough that old John {{was not at}} all likely to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> cut off the nice little revenue he was making out of our camp, and so we felt no concern on that score.|$|E
60|$|Anxious to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{stop him}} from being poisoned, the German boy {{clutched}} the dish and took a large spoonful of the jam. But as he gulped it, he gave a gasp, and the tears started down his cheeks.|$|E
50|$|Based on videos {{posted on}} the {{internet}} showing the incident from various angles the supporters were not <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> warrant such an intervention by police. Five days after the game the Slovak police presented a photo as evidence, showing one of the supporters raising his fist to throw a punch, but police officers {{can not be seen}} on the image. Spontaneous demonstrations were held in Budapest at the embassy and the consulate of Slovakia {{on the night of the}} incident. Protesters lit candles to honor the victims and burned a Slovak flag.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{special case}} is a [...] "deep cover" [...] or [...] "sleeper" [...] mole, who may enter a service, {{possibly}} at a young age, but definitely not reporting or <b>doing</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> attract suspicion, until reaching a senior position. Kim Philby {{is an example of}} an agent actively recruited by the British Secret Intelligence Service while he was already committed to Communism. Philby, at first, concentrated on doing a good job for the British, so he could rise in trust and authority. Philby was motivated by ideology before he joined SIS.|$|R
5000|$|McCain {{spoke in}} a press conference the {{following}} day saying, [...] "I'm very disappointed in the article. It's not true." [...] He stated he never showed favoritism for her clients: [...] "At no time have I ever <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> betray the public trust." [...] He went on to characterize Iseman as a friend but no closer than other lobbyists. Both he and his wife strenuously denied any impropriety. He said he wasn't aware of the meeting Weaver had with Iseman nor of any concerns among his staff about his association.|$|R
60|$|Alison sat {{silent in}} tense anxiety. She could not urge Florence to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> clearly be to her husband's detriment, {{and she did}} not see how Hunter could help Thorne without {{neglecting}} his own harvest. Then her companion turned to her again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here. You know I want to. You're the elegantest--I mean you're--Oh, {{you ought}} to know! Can't you see how I feel about you? Why, I'd rather do this than {{anything}} I ever heard of in my life. I just don't want to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> get people to talking about you." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{resolve that}} Gwendolen {{had in her}} mind was that she would ask Deronda whether she ought to accept any of her husband's money--whether she might accept what would enable her to provide for her mother. The poor thing felt strong enough to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> give her a higher place in Deronda's mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I wish I could do--do--I wish I could <b>do</b> something, <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{give you}} peace again {{and make you}} happy; but I know of nothing-- I know of no way. I {{have never heard of}} these awful people before." ...|$|R
5000|$|S.S. Van Dine: The fictional narrator S.S. Van Dine accompanies Vance {{during his}} {{investigations}} and later recounts them to readers. Van Dine, who reveals little about himself {{except that he}} once practiced law, says he is Vance's chief adviser, especially on financial and legal matters. Van Dine is not like most [...] "sidekicks" [...] in mystery stories. John Loughery, the biographer of Willard Huntington Wright, describes Van Dine as a [...] "noncharacter": While {{other people in the}} novels sometimes talk to him or note his presence, he never addresses anyone (or at least <b>does</b> not quote <b>anything</b> he says to them). He also never <b>does</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> influence events.|$|R
6000|$|This was {{too much}} for the doctor; his sternness and {{firmness}} instantly deserted him. [...] "Mary," [...] he said, [...] "I will <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you <b>would</b> have me. If you wish it, I will make arrangements for leaving this place at once." ...|$|R
