5|$|After {{ending his}} playing career, Roy joined the Nathan Hale High School {{as the head}} coach of the boys' {{basketball}} team in 2016. In March 2017, he received the Naismith National <b>High</b> <b>School</b> <b>Coach</b> of the Year award after his team posted a perfect 29–0 record during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|According to Taylor, Russell {{discounted}} {{the fact}} that his career was facilitated by white people who were proven anti-racists, namely his white <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>coach</b> George Powles (the person who encouraged him to play basketball), his white college coach Phil Woolpert (who integrated USF basketball), white Celtics coach Red Auerbach (who is regarded as an anti-racist pioneer and made him the first black NBA coach), and white Celtics owner Walter A. Brown, who gave him a high $24,000 rookie contract, just $1,000 shy of the top earning veteran Bob Cousy.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the players, Brown hired a number of assistant coaches. John Brickels, an Ohio native, was brought in early on to sign players while Brown {{was still in the}} Navy. He later served as a backfield coach. Another hire was Blanton Collier, a <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>coach</b> for 16 years who had been an assistant to Brown at Great Lakes. Collier succeeded Brown in 1963 as the team's head coach. Fritz Heisler was brought in as a guard coach and stayed with the Browns until the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|In the season's {{penultimate}} game, Maryland lost to Penn State, 48–0. Penn State halfback Lydell Mitchell {{had been}} recruited by Lester and {{originally intended to}} go to Maryland before he opted for Penn State instead. Lester was bothered by a similar situation with fullback Franco Harris, whose <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>coach</b> {{was a friend of}} Lester's. Lester attributed Maryland's football woes to the turnover at head coach and lack of depth because of recruitment shortcomings. Maryland won the finale against Virginia to finish the season with a 3–7 record.|$|E
5|$|Rolle {{left the}} LSU program on May 23. LSU coach John Brady claimed {{this was due}} to {{concerns}} over Rolle's development. Darrel Sears, his former <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>coach,</b> said Rolle had been unhappy with LSU since December 2006, and that Brady had been making snide comments about Rolle for a while. After Rolle left LSU, he was courted by Division I schools Wyoming, Marshall, Oral Roberts, Delaware, Louisiana Tech, and South Florida. Although initially interested in South Florida due to its proximity to his Bahamas home, Rolle chose to transfer to Louisiana Tech to play under Kerry Rupp.|$|E
5|$|Saban's <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>coach</b> was an Indiana University alumnus and {{convinced}} him to enroll there. Saban played for the Indiana Hoosiers football team starting in 1940. He {{was used as a}} quarterback in 1941, his sophomore year. He also played as a linebacker and a placekicker. Saban was named to the Associated Press All-Big Ten second team as a quarterback in 1942. He was the captain of Indiana's 1942 team and was selected as its most valuable player. Saban was also a standout shot putter, winning a Big Ten Conference competition at Illinois Institute of Technology in 1943 with a throw of 48 feet and 11 1/2 inches.|$|E

5|$|After graduating, Horvath {{attended}} Ohio State University on a work scholarship, {{but managed}} to make the school's football team in 1940. Horvath was small for a football player – he weighed just 160 pounds – but was a quick runner and had a strong arm. Ohio State's football team was a disappointment in 1940, however, finishing {{the season with a}} 4–4 win–loss record under head coach Francis Schmidt. Schmidt was fired after the season and replaced by Paul Brown, an Ohio <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>coach</b> who had guided Massillon Washington to a series of undefeated records and state championships. Brown simplified Ohio State's offense, but imposed a level of discipline and organization that had been absent under Schmidt. Horvath was a reserve halfback in the Buckeyes' single-wing offense in 1941, when the team posted a 6–1–1 win–loss–tie record and finished second in the Big Ten Conference standings. He played in many games, but senior fullback Jack Graf and senior halfback Tom Kinkade got most of the carries for Ohio State.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Farmer arrived at Kentucky, the roster had been decimated. Standout {{shooting}} guard Rex Chapman entered the 1988 NBA Draft, ending his collegiate eligibility. Sophomore Eric Manuel was held out of basketball activities pending {{the outcome of}} an investigation into his ACT scores. Signees Shawn Kemp and Sean Woods failed to qualify academically, and Chris Mills was {{under investigation by the}} NCAA for cash allegedly sent to his father by assistant coach Dwane Casey in violation of the Association's amateurism rules. A viral illness forced Farmer to miss {{about a third of the}} team's preseason practices. Once he was able to practice, Coach Eddie Sutton related that he lacked the conditioning to finish most practices. The Lexington Herald-Leaders Jerry Tipton later reported that Farmer had to leave practice half an hour early two days a week to attend his American History class. Sutton also opined that Farmer's high school competition was inferior to that of Los Angeles native Mills, but Farmer's <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>coach</b> pointed out that, during Farmer's senior season, 20 of his team's games were against teams ranked in the top 20 in their respective states.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{attended}} Harold L. Richards High School in Oak Lawn. Wade {{quickly found}} {{success as a}} wide receiver on the football team, but he needed to work extremely hard to earn playing time on the varsity basketball team during his junior year. While he did not acquire much playing time during his second year, his stepbrother, Demetris McDaniel, was {{the star of the}} team. Wade grew four inches in the summer before his junior year and saw an increase in playing time, averaging 20.7 points and 7.6 rebounds per game. The following year, Wade averaged 27.0 points and 11.0 rebounds per game while leading his team to a 24–5 record. It advanced to the title game of the Class AA Eisenhower Sectional. During this season he set school records for points (676) and steals (106) in a season. Wade has stated that his <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>coach,</b> Jack Fitzgerald, {{was one of the most}} positive influences in his life during this time. Wade was recruited by only three college basketball teams (Marquette University, Illinois State, and DePaul University) due to academic problems.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{his junior}} season, he {{verbally}} {{committed to the}} University of Michigan where he would play for Michigan Wolverines football as a freshman for the 2015 team via Twitter. At the time, he still attended East Lake High School, where {{he was about to}} play his junior year for the 2013 football team. At the time of his July 27, 2013 verbal commitment, he was ranked as the number one athlete and number three player in the class of 2015 by ESPN. When Scout.com released its first list of 5-star rated football players on August 12, 2013, Campbell was included among the 20 players listed and the only wide receiver included. At the end of that summer prior to his junior year football season, he was one of two juniors selected to the 2013 USA Today preseason All-USA team. He accepted an invitation to participate in the 2015 Under Armour All-America Game in St. Petersburg before the end of October 2013. The November 15 FHSAA Class 7A region quarterfinal that East Lake won 13–12 ended with an alleged punch by a Palmetto <b>High</b> <b>School</b> <b>coach</b> that left Campbell with a cut inside his mouth. Other players were involved in the altercation, which is being investigated by the FHSAA. On November 19, 2013, ESPN moved Campbell up to the number two overall position in the class of 2015. This moved him ahead of Kevin Toliver II, but he remained behind Jashon Cornell. In Campbell's third time in the FHSAA, East Lake finally got past the regional finals (defeating Port Charlotte High School), only to lose the following week on December 6, 2013, in the state semifinals in overtime to Dwyer High School 31–24, despite a 65-yard touchdown reception by Campbell. Following the season, Campbell decommitted from Michigan on December 13.|$|E
