Naturally and <b>fortified</b> milk <b>samples</b> (HCH) were subjected to various food processing techniques, pasteurization (63 ºC for ½ h), sterilization (121 ºC for 15 min) and boiling for 5 min and analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detector using quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe method for multiresidue analysis of pesticides in milk with slight modification. Results: The final mean residual concentration of pesticide in milk after heat processing and percentage of degradation were calculated with respective treatments.

40|$|Total {{phenolics}} (TP), vitamin C, antioxidant {{activity and}} colour of preserved peppers were evaluated at 4, 25 and 50 C storage during 30 -day intervals. Except for 4 C, TP decreased during storage at 25 C and 50 C, being softer for <b>fortified</b> <b>samples</b> with b-CDs. The protective effect was evident, since 50 C samples containing b-CDs exhibited lower TP loss (19 %) than control samples (38 %) for 5 months storage. A {{decrease in the}} vitamin C content was observed for both samples as time and temperature progressed. In samples stored at 50 C the protective effect of b-CD only was evident at the first month, since <b>fortified</b> <b>samples</b> showed lower vitamin C loss (10 %) than control <b>samples.</b> The <b>fortified</b> <b>samples</b> with b-CDs exhibited lowest antioxidant activity loss (40 %) during 90 -day storage at 50 C, than control samples (64 %).

40|$|Background: Iron {{fortification}} {{of bread}} {{often results in}} sub-optimal quality of the final product due to undesirable changes in the physical characteristics and sensory properties of the bread. In this study both the form of iron (soluble, insoluble or encapsulated) {{and the type of}} bread (wheat or gluten-free) were varied in order to investigate the effect of iron and gluten on the product characteristics. Results: The effect of iron on the quality characteristics of the breads investigated depended on iron type, but not on iron solubility. Colour, crust firmness, specific volume, cell number and uniformity as well as aroma were the attributes that were mainly affected in iron-enriched wheat bread. In some cases, specific volume was 30 % lower than that of the control sample, while cell uniformity was significantly lower, as low as 50 % of the control <b>sample</b> in some <b>fortified</b> <b>samples.</b> In gluten-free breads, differences between unfortified and <b>fortified</b> <b>samples</b> included colour, crust firmness, cell number, 'moisture' odour, metallic taste and stickiness. In some cases, the sensory scores were better for <b>fortified</b> <b>samples.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Differences due to iron fortification were less pronounced in gluten-free compared towheat breads. The choice of the appropriate iron compound which will not cause adverse quality changes is still a challenge. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The aims were {{to assess}} the {{bioaccessibility}} and Potential Supply (PS) of Fe and Zn from Commercial Fortified Spaghettis (CFS), {{and the relationship between}} cooking time and losses of solids, Fe and Zn of these <b>samples.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: Four samples of different trades were analyzed. Solid, Fe, and Zn losses were evaluated at to cooking times (optimum cooking time and optimum time plus 10 min overcooking). Fe and Zn bioaccessibility was estimated through mineral dialyzability. Potential Supply (PS) was determined as the product of mineral concentration and dialyzability. Results: Solids losses were lower than 7 %, still with overcooking. Three of the four <b>fortified</b> <b>samples</b> did not meet the declared values of Fe content. There were high losses of Fe and Zn during cooking, which increased when extended cooking time (from 43. 7 % to 64. 7 % for Fe, and from 7. 7 % to 15. 2 % for Zn). Fe losses (fortification mineral), being greater than Zn (endogenous mineral). Fe and Zn bioaccessibility were very low (0. 82 ± 0. 27 % and 0. 90 ± 0. 45 %, respectively) and the PS of 80 g portion of CFS only cover approximately 0. 65 % and 0. 71 % of Fe and Zn requirements, respectively.
