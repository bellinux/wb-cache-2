The system can operate in a pure combustion mode when solar irradiance is weak during some hours in the day or seasons. A thermodynamic model for a hybrid solar <b>gas-turbine</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is presented. The system consists of a micro gas turbine (100 - 110 kW) supported by a solar field to integrate heat for the regeneration and combustion through heat exchangers.

40|$|The growing {{worldwide}} {{energy demand}} and {{the impacts of}} climate change due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions are among the major issues facing humanity. The global energy system, {{responsible for most of}} the greenhouse gases emissions, is therefore at the heart of global concerns. In particular, the search for a reliable, sustainable and environmentally friendly means of generating electricity is a crucial matter, with growing worries about the scarcity of fossil resources, air pollution and water acidification. For these reasons, alternatives for the sustainable production of electricity are to be found. Among the plethora of alternatives available, concentrated solar power (CSP) appears {{as one of the most}} favourable options. The stability and dispatchability of production achievable by the integration of storage and fuel-solar hybridisation are amidst the major advantages of this technology. Nevertheless, conventional CSP plants are based on stream-turbine cycles which consume large amounts of water. In addition to the low thermodynamic efficiency of this type of cycle, the installation of such plants in water-scarce areas is complicated by their reliance on water resources. Thus, the study of new concepts that overcome these drawbacks is necessary for the future of this technology. The availability of high temperature solar receivers for solar tower systems opens the way for the use of gas-turbines in hybrid solar-natural gas configurations. In order to increase the efficiency of the cycle while keeping the water consumption as low as possible, a promising alternative to the recovery of the waste heat in steam-turbines is to use a low-temperature intercooled-recuperated gas-turbine cycle. This work focuses on the analysis and optimisation of the performance of an innovative hybrid solar <b>gas-turbine</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> with an air-based bottoming cycle (ABHSGT). The evaluation considers thermodynamic performance, economic viability and environmental impact as interrelated concerns. With this in mind, detailed steady-state and dynamic models of the power plant have been developed and validated by comparison with existing components. A second model without bottoming cycle has been built for comparison. A multi-objective optimisation using an evolutionary algorithm has then been performed, optimising both capital cost and specific CO 2 emissions and resulting in a Pareto-optimal set of possible designs. The analysis of the trade-off curves resulting from the optimisation reveals promising outcomes. The global minimum for the levelised cost of electricity, found at relatively high solar shares, proves the economic potential of the technology. The integration of the bottoming cycle decreases significantly the levelised cost of electricity and the CO 2 emissions of the system compared to the reference plant, and higher efficiencies are achieved. The optimal design selected for an in-depth thermoeconomic and environmental analysis exhibits a levelised cost of electricity of 109 [USD/MWhe] for a solar share of 20 % and an overall exergetic efficiency 38. 5 %. The specific CO 2 emissions are reduced by 33 % compared to simple gas-fired power plant. The water consumption is kept at very low levels compared to other CSP plants, making the system suitable for the deployment in water-scarce areas. In addition, the environmental impact induced by the land use requirements is considerably lower than that of other renewable energy technologies. The sensitivity analysis performed to assess the consequence of changes in varying financial conditions on the levelised cost of electricity and the net present value reveals that the system studied represents a profitable investment in the presence of feed-in tariffs. In the light of the performance obtained in the three aspects considered (thermodynamic, economic and environmental), it can be concluded that the ABHSGT represents a promising alternative to other renewable energy technologies, especially in water-scarce areas...|$|E

In particular, the social cost of introducing measures to protect power-distribution systems from power-source instability {{and the cost of}} accident-risk response for various power sources must be investigated. To account for these risk factors, an integrated societal risk assessment framework, based on power-uncertainty analysis and accident-consequence analysis, is proposed. In this study, we applied the proposed framework to nuclear <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> solar photovoltaic systems, and wind-turbine generators.

30|$|In an {{industrial}} gas turbine, about 0.04 kg of superalloy {{is used in}} the hot section per kilowatt of power produced. About 2 % of the cost of turbines in such a <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is due to the use of superalloys. For example, we consider a case study of electric power generation whereby one finds that the average cost of the <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> was taken as around 7.5 mills/kW h (0.75 cents/kW h) (Zeren 1982). A fuel cost of 7.5 cents/kW h was found to be reasonable. It is evident from Figure  6 and the cost data that if an increase of 22.5 % in the plant cost permitted this TIT rise (of 56 °C), a break-even condition would exist at these fuel and plant costs. Despite of the increase in the plant cost, the plant is economically feasible and profitable because the operation management of <b>gas-turbine</b> (GT) <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is becoming more competitive and since the energy (fuel) resources are becoming increasingly scarce and limited.|$|R

40|$|Molybdenum {{silicides}} and borosilicides {{are promising}} structural materials for <b>gas-turbine</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> A major challenge, however, is to simultaneously achieve high oxidation resistance and acceptable mechanical properties at high temperatures. For example, molybdenum disilicide (MoSi 2) has excellent oxidation resistance and poor mechanical properties, while Mo-rich silicides such as Mo 5 Si 3 (called T 1) have much better mechanical properties but poor oxidation resistance. One approach {{is based on}} the fabrication of MoSi 2 −T 1 composites that combine high oxidation resistance of MoSi 2 and good mechanical properties of T 1. Another approach involves the addition of boron to Mo-rich silicides for improving their oxidation resistance through the formation of a borosilicate surface layer. In particular, Mo 5 SiB 2 (called T 2) phase is considered as an attractive material. In the thesis, MoSi 2 −T 1 composites and materials based on T 2 phase are obtained by mechanically activated SHS. Use of SHS compaction (quasi-isostatic pressing) significantly improves oxidation resistance of the obtained MoSi 2 −T 1 composites. Combustion of Mo−Si−B mixtures for the formation of T 2 phase becomes possible if the composition is designed for the addition of more exothermic reactions leading to the formation of molybdenum boride. These mixtures exhibit spin combustion, the characteristics of which are in good agreement with the spin combustion theory. Oxidation resistance of the obtained Mo−Si−B materials is independent on the concentration of Mo phase in the products so that the materials with a higher Mo content are preferable because of better mechanical properties. Also, T 2 phase has been obtained by the chemical oven combustion synthesis technique. ...|$|R

The <b>gas-turbine</b> (GT)-based <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is characterized by its relatively low capital cost {{as compared to the}} steam <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> However, conventional industrial GT engines have lower efficiencies, especially at part load, which cause emission and environmental related problems.

The tensile and high-stress creep data obtained for Haynes N- 155 alloy sheet are reported. At rapid strain rates, the high-temperature tensile strengths mere up to 300 per cent higher than those obtained at conventional testing speeds. At high temperatures and high stress levels, however, creep rates were shown to be extremely rapid, and in most cases, the creep strength became a critical factor. The application of rapid-strain-rate tensile data and high-stress creep data in short-life designs is discussed. T is W E L L RECOGNIZED that efficient designs of structures which operate at high temperature must be based on material test data which simulate the actual service conditions. Most of the elevated temperature data reported in the literature today are intended for long life, relatively steady-state conditions such as those encountered in steam and <b>gas-turbine</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> In most missiles and in many "one-mission " type applications, the service life is very short. Therefore materials can be used at much higher temperatures and stresses than those normally con-sidered permissible for prolonged service [1, 2], 2 Where higher stresses can be used, components can of course be made lighter. This is especially desirable in missile applications. Special test equipment [3] has been developed by the Mar-quardt Corporation to evaluate the high-temperature properties of materials used in missile ramjet engines and new testing tech-niques are being used. The universal elevated-temperature machine discussed in [3] can be used for controlled rapid-rate tensile and compression testing (from zero to 0. 2 in/in/sec), creep testing, low-frequency fatigue testing, and thermal-cycling tests.
