40|$|We study {{a unique}} {{microcredit}} model with zero interest rate and voluntary contributions, used by Akhuwat, a microfinance organization operating in Pakistan since 2001. Borrowers {{are encouraged to}} give any amount they wish to the organization every month, {{in addition to the}} instalment for the repayment of principal. These voluntary contributions result in an implicit interest rate of around 4. 5 %. The analysis of monthly data on voluntary contributions provide evidence that the organization is rewarding borrowers for their contributions by giving them repeat loans and that borrowers are strategically timing these voluntary contributions through their loan cycle to maximize impact. In the case of <b>joint</b> liability loans, <b>borrowers</b> in poorly performing groups make on average higher voluntary contributions, and voluntary contributions in a previous loan cycle correlate with borrower discipline in a subsequent loan cycle. Thus, voluntary contributions can signal <b>borrower</b> quality, and <b>joint</b> liability <b>borrowers</b> appear to be using them to signal their quality independently of their group...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} borrower behavior in a microfinance experiment in which subjects are jointly responsible for credit repayment. Although cooperation levels are generally high, moral hazard problems persist among borrowers. Moreover, the path dependency of decisions mitigates the insurance effect of joint liability. We compare two conversion mechanisms from joint to individual liability. First, an active choice of the joint liability contract does not systematically increase cooperation. Second, conversion based on repayment success tends to have a detrimental impact on cooperation among the remaining <b>joint</b> liability <b>borrowers.</b> microfinance, group lending, individual lending, social preferences...|$|R
40|$|We {{conduct a}} {{microfinance}} experiment in which subjects are jointly responsible for credit repayments and decide repeatedly about the effort put into risky investment projects. Although average effort levels are generally high, {{we find that}} moral hazard problems still persist among borrowers. Moreover, the path dependency of effort decisions additionally mitigates the insurance effect of joint liability contracts. We compare two conversion mechanisms from joint to individual liability. First, an active selection of the group lending contract does not systematically increase cooperation relative to a reference treatment. Second, conversion based on repayment success tends to have a detrimental impact on effort levels of the remaining <b>joint</b> liability <b>borrowers...</b>|$|R
40|$|A common {{feature of}} {{financial}} intermediaries {{is that the}} welfare of one borrower is adversely affected by the poor performance of other borrowers. That is, there exists a degree of joint liability among the borrowers of a financial intermediary. This paper provides an explanation for this observation. It demonstrates that in Krasa and Villamil’s [14] formalization of a financial intermediary as a delegated monitor, intermediation with <b>joint</b> liability between <b>borrowers</b> Pareto dominates intermediation without joint liability...|$|R
50|$|The first Danish Mortgage Act {{was passed}} in 1850, {{establishing}} new mortgage credit institutions which were cast as (non-profit) associations. Loans against mortgages on real property are financed by issuing bonds in series. Initially, borrowers were jointly liable for the liabilities of the corresponding pool of mortgages. The system kept evolving thereafter, in particular in the early 1970s, when mortgage financing was simplified and standardized. The last major round of reform took place in 1989, among others authorizing commercial banks to own mortgage credit institutions. After 2001, the majority of mortgage bonds were issued without the <b>joint</b> liability of <b>borrowers.</b>|$|R
40|$|I compare welfare {{generated}} by a credit contract with individual liability and a contract with joint liability. The problem is credit rationing caused by limited liability and unobservable investment decisions. <b>Joint</b> liability induces <b>borrowers</b> to monitor each other, however the lender can also monitor. I show that wealthier borrowers may prefer riskier investments when liability is joint, which causes the lender to offer them smaller loans than he would if liability were individual, even if he cannot monitor the individual-liability loan. Therefore, wealthier borrowers prefer individual-liability loans. The result may explain why small businesses grow larger when funded with individual rather than with joint-liability loans. Poorer borrowers may prefer joint-liability loans, because borrowers monitor more efficiently, even when their monitoring technology {{is the same as}} the lender’s, making joint-liability loans cheaper...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the agency {{problem of a}} bank staff member managing microÞnanc-ing programs, who can abuse his discretion to embezzle borrowers repayments. In this context, we study the optimal lending contract. The fact that most borrowers of microÞnancing programs are illiterate and live in rural areas where transportation costs are very high make staffs embezzlement particularly relevant as is documented by Mknelly and Kevane (2002). We study the trade-off between the optimal rigid contract and the optimal discretionary contract and how joint liability affects the performance of each contract and the trade-off. Our analysis explains rigid repay-ment schedules used by the Grameen bank as an optimal response to the bank staffs agency problem. <b>Joint</b> liability reduces <b>borrowers</b> burden of respecting the rigid repayment schedules by providing them with partial insurance. However, the same insurance can be provided by borrowers themselves under individual liability through a side-contract. We also Þnd that the staffs agency problem creates biases in project selection toward projects of small scale and small risk...|$|R
40|$|As {{the scope}} of Bank work in {{institutional}} development (ID) widens, the design of ID in Bank projects needs to pay increased attention to several emerging problems and inconsistencies : a) without country specific sector ID strategy, there is no long term perspective to guide project design; b) uneven quality of institutional analysis and the limited attention to ID issues in economic and sector work can weaken the design process; c) the focus of ID work on project implementation limits concern for project sustainability; and d) more complex, sectorwide ID components call for more rather than less supervision. The task, the author concludes is not to broaden ID work but to deepen it. He recommends : 1) encourage operational task managers to supplement skills at their command by mobilizing experts within the Bank to help analysis and design; 2) increase Bank expertise in this area; 3) use outside experts, as needsed; 4) expose Bank staff {{to a range of}} analytical frameworks to improve institutional analysis; and 5) make <b>joint</b> (Bank and <b>borrower)</b> institutional diagnosis and design a norm, giving borrowers a greater sense of ownership and creating a solid basis for sustainability.

40|$|These essays {{consider}} {{various aspects}} of the access to finance to micro-entrepreneurs who remain outside the purview of the banking sector primarily due to lack of collateral. An innovative way to provide access to finance - microfinance - originated from Bangladesh and has since then spread to all over the world. Evidence points to micro-enterprises earning returns well above market interest rate. It is therefore puzzling that hardly any study has found a significant impact on various development indicators for households receiving a microcredit loan. This coupled with high indebtedness and defaults by borrowers resulting in the collapse of several microfinance organizations across the world has raised questions about the fundamentals of the microcredit model and led to a rethinking of microfinance at large. In line with this, we look at an alternative model of microcredit with zero interest rate and voluntary contributions being used by Akhuwat, a microfinance organization in Pakistan. Chapter 2 has details about this organization and chapter 3 about a telephone survey of the borrowers of the organization that was conducted to collect information in addition to that in the organization database. In chapter 4, the analysis of monthly data on voluntary contributions provide evidence that the organization is rewarding borrowers for their contributions by giving them repeat loans and that borrowers are strategically timing these voluntary contributions through their loan cycles to maximize impact. In the case of <b>joint</b> liability loans, <b>borrowers</b> in poorly performing groups make on average higher voluntary contributions, and voluntary contributions in a previous loan cycle correlate with borrower discipline in a subsequent loan cycle. Thus, voluntary contributions can signal <b>borrower</b> quality, and <b>joint</b> liability <b>borrowers</b> appear to be using them to signal their quality independently of their group. Microcredit loans were traditionally extended to groups of people who were held jointly liable for the payments of each other. However, there is no clear evidence that joint liability does lead to better borrower performance and recent years have seen a shift towards individual liability lending. In Chapter 5, utilizing the exogenous shift from individual to joint liability lending by a microfinance organization in Pakistan, we find evidence of significant improvement in borrower discipline. We also use the exogenous variation in number of months borrowers had till the expiry of their individual liability loans {{at the time of the}} shift to study the kind of groups they formed. Using this time that borrowers had as an instrument, we find that they are more likely to form groups with people they knew from before and met weekly. The time that borrower had to form group also correlated positively with borrower discipline. Chapter 6 investigates the impact on micro-entrepreneur households of unconditional transfers in a Randomized Control Trial setting. In a situation of no commitment, it looks at the second order effects on the household of an exogenous shock to the enterprise. Even with no repayment for principal or additional interest charge, there is no significant impact on the consumption and education expenditures of these households. We focus on the demographic and labour supply response and find that households of male and female owned enterprises adjust differently. Households of male run enterprises experienced a rise in fertility while those of women saw a decline in the number of other women working in the household and thereby in overall hours worked in the household. For male run enterprise households, there appears to be no substitution away from work towards leisure as the household feels richer. We did not find evidence that the rise in fertility is a pure income effect and so it appears to be associated with different choices made by the two genders when in charge of resources...|$|R
