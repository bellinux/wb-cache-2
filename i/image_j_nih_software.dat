Currently, deformity correction is {{measured in terms of}} posterior parameters (Cobb angles and rib hump), even though the cosmetic concern for most patients is anterior chest wall deformity. In this study, we propose a new measure for assessing anterior chest wall deformity and examine the correlation between rib hump and the new measure. 22 sets of CT scans were retrieved from the QUT/Mater Paediatric Spinal Research Database. The <b>Image</b> <b>J</b> <b>software</b> (<b>NIH)</b> was used to manipulate formatted CT scans into 3 -dimensional anterior chest wall reconstructions. A ‘chest wall angle’ was then measured in relation to the first sacral vertebral body. The chest wall angle was found to be a reliable tool in the analysis of chest wall deformity. No correlation was found between the new measure and rib hump angle. Since rib hump has been shown to correlate with vertebral rotation on CT, this suggests that there maybe no correlation between anterior and posterior deformity measures. While most surgical procedures will adequately address the coronal imbalance & posterior rib hump elements of scoliosis, they do not reliably alter the anterior chest wall shape. This implies that anterior chest wall deformity is to a large degree an intrinsic deformity, not directly related to vertebral rotation...|$|R

40|$|Session - SST 04 : Gastrointestinal (Rectal Cancer: Advanced Imaging) PURPOSE: Diffusion {{weighted}} imaging (DWI) is an emerging, whereas PET/CT {{an established}} tool for tumor assessment. Tumors often demonstrate decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on DWI, and increased standard uptake value (SUV) on FDG-PET/CT. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the relationship between ADC and SUV in primary rectal cancer. METHOD AND MATERIALS: From Nov 08 to Apr 09, 16 consecutive patients (10 men, 6 women; age 55 - 88 years) with pathologically proven rectal cancer and having undergone both MRI and PET/CT were included in this study. All MRs were performed on a 3 T scanner (Achieva, Philips). Routine T 1, T 2, DWI and contrast-enhanced sequences were obtained. Axial pelvic DWI was obtained by single-shot EPI with STIR fat-suppression and slice-selection gradient reversal technique (TR/TE/TI= 7779 / 47 / 260 ms, matrix 188 × 151, FOV 40 × 32 cm, b-value= 0 and 1000 s/mm 2, slice thickness 5 mm). ROIs were manually drawn along contours of the tumor on each slice of ADC maps covering the entire tumor. ADC values were calculated by <b>Image</b> <b>J</b> <b>software</b> (<b>NIH,</b> US). ADCmean was defined as average ADC value for all voxels in each tumor, and ADCmin as the lowest ADC value among all voxels in each tumor. All PET/CT exams (Discovery VCT, GE) were performed within 1 week of MRI. A 3 D ROI was placed over the entire tumor on Advanced Workstation (GE) to calculate SUVmax. Maximum diameter of the tumor was measured on both MRI (M_D) and PET/CT (P_D). Relationship between ADC and SUVmax values was assessed by pearsons correlation test. RESULTS: ADCmean and ADCmin for all tumors were 0. 96 ± 0. 23 and 0. 37 ± 0. 19 (10 - 3 mm 2 /s) respectively. SUVmax values were 10. 55 ± 6. 13. M_D values were 5. 78 ± 2. 19 cm and P_D 6. 11 ± 2. 12 cm. Statistically significant negative correlation was found between ADCmin and SUVmax (r=- 0. 57, p= 0. 02), and ADCmean and SUVmax (r=- 0. 65, p= 0. 006). M_D was significantly correlated with P_D (r= 0. 49, p= 0. 02). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results showed that both ADCmin and ADCmean of the primary rectal cancer are inversely correlated with SUVmax, which has been shown to correlate with tumor aggressiveness and treatment response in many malignancies. CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION: ADC values may be potential surrogate biomarkers for detection, characterization, prognostication and monitoring treatment response of rectal cancer. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{most common}} {{software}} analysis tools available for measuring fluorescence images are for two-dimensional (2 D) data {{that rely on}} manual settings for inclusion and exclusion of data points, and computer-aided pattern recognition to support the interpretation and findings of the analysis. It has become increasingly important {{to be able to}} measure fluorescence images constructed from three-dimensional (3 D) datasets {{in order to be able}} to capture the complexity of cellular dynamics and understand the basis of cellular plasticity within biological systems. Sophisticated microscopy instruments have permitted the visualization of 3 D fluorescence images through the acquisition of multispectral fluorescence images and powerful analytical software that reconstructs the images from confocal stacks that then provide a 3 D representation of the collected 2 D images. Advanced design-based stereology methods have progressed from the approximation and assumptions of the original model-based stereology(1) even in complex tissue sections(2). Despite these scientific advances in microscopy, a need remains for an automated analytic method that fully exploits the intrinsic 3 D data to allow for the analysis and quantification of the complex changes in cell morphology, protein localization and receptor trafficking. Current techniques available to quantify fluorescence images include Meta-Morph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and <b>Image</b> <b>J</b> (<b>NIH)</b> which provide manual analysis. Imaris (Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland) software provides the feature MeasurementPro, which allows the manual creation of measurement points that can be placed in a volume image or drawn on a series of 2 D slices to create a 3 D object. This method is useful for single-click point measurements to measure a line distance between two objects or to create a polygon that encloses a region of interest, but it is difficult to apply to complex cellular network structures. Filament Tracer (Andor) allows automatic detection of the 3 D neuronal filament-like however, this module has been developed to measure defined structures such as neurons, which are comprised of dendrites, axons and spines (tree-like structure). This module has been ingeniously utilized to make morphological measurements to non-neuronal cells(3), however, the output data provide information of an extended cellular network by using a software that depends on a defined cell shape rather than being an amorphous-shaped cellular model. To overcome the issue of analyzing amorphous-shaped cells and making the software more suitable to a biological application, Imaris developed Imaris Cell. This was a scientific project with the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, which has been developed to calculate the relationship between cells and organelles. While the software enables the detection of biological constraints, by forcing one nucleus per cell and using cell membranes to segment cells, it cannot be utilized to analyze fluorescence data that are not continuous because ideally it builds cell surface without void spaces. To our knowledge, at present no user-modifiable automated approach that provides morphometric information from 3 D fluorescence images has been developed that achieves cellular spatial information of an undefined shape (Figure 1). We have developed an analytical platform using the Imaris core software module and Imaris XT interfaced to MATLAB (Mat Works, Inc.). These tools allow the 3 D measurement of cells without a pre-defined shape and with inconsistent fluorescence network components. Furthermore, this method will allow researchers who have extended expertise in biological systems, but not familiarity to computer applications, to perform quantification of morphological changes in cell dynamics...|$|R

Experimental models of cerebral ischemia {{can be used to}} evaluate the cellular response phenomena and possible neurological protection by drugs. Objective: To characterize the cellular changes in the neuronal population and astrocytic response by the effect of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO) on a model of ischemia caused by cerebral embolism. Methods: Twenty Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n = 5). The infarct was induced with ?-bovine thrombin (40 NIH/Unit.). The treated group received 90 mg (100 ?l) of DMSO in saline (1 : 1 v/v) intraperitoneally for 5 days; ischemic controls received only NaCl (placebo) and two non-ischemic groups (simulated) received NaCl and DMSO respectively. We evaluated the neuronal (anti-NeuN) and astrocytic immune-reactivity (anti-GFAP). The results were analyzed by densitometry (NIH Image J-Fiji 1. 45 software) and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Graph pad software (Prism 5). Results: Cerebral embolism induced reproducible and reliable lesions in the cortex and hippocampus (CA 1)., similar to those of focal models. DMSO did not reverse the loss of post-ischemia neuronal immune- reactivity, but prevented the morphological damage of neurons, and significantly reduced astrocytic hyperactivity in the somato-sensory cortex and CA 1 (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The regulatory effect of DMSO on astrocyte hyperreactivity and neuronal-astroglial cytoarchitecture, gives it potential neuroprotective properties for the treatment of thromboembolic cerebral ischemia in the acute phase.
