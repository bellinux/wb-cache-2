40|$|La(OH) 3 -modified <b>exfoliated</b> <b>vermiculites</b> were fabricated, characterized, and {{investigated}} for phosphate removal in batch tests {{for the first}} time. The BET surface area of the La 5 EV adsorbent, which was synthesized in the solution consisting of 5. 00 mmol/g La/exfoliated vermiculite (EV), was significantly increased, accompanied with a larger pore diameter and greater total pore volume, {{as compared with the}} unmodified EV. The phosphate adsorption capacity of La 5 EV was approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of EV. Effects of initial phosphate concentration, contact time, temperature, pH, and co-existing ions on the adsorption capacity of La 5 EV were investigated in detail. The experimental equilibrium data were fitted better by using the Langmuir model (maximum adsorption capacity of 79. 6 mg P/g) than the Dubinin–Radushkevich or the Freundlich model, suggesting that the adsorption feature be monolayer. Meanwhile, the phosphate adsorption kinetics could be well described by the pseudo-second-order model, and the adsorption process might be controlled by boundary layer (film) diffusion. ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° were also determined, in which {{it was found that the}} phosphate adsorption onto La 5 EV was spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The phosphate adsorption of La 5 EV was pH-dependent; that it exhibited a high adsorption capacity in the pH range of 3. 0 – 7. 0. The presence of 0. 1 M CO 2 / 3 caused a reduction in phosphate adsorption capacity by 54. 3 %. On the other side, the addition of F−, Cl−, NO- 3, and SO 2 / 4 had neglectable effects on its phosphate removal capacities. In the synthetic secondary treated wastewater with a low phosphate concentration of 2 mg P/L, 97. 9 % of its final adsorption capacity reached in the first 10 min and the phosphate concentration dramatically decreased below 50 μg P/L. The spent La 5 EV could be regenerated and reused in phosphate adsorption; that could remove more than 70 % phosphate in the 3 rd adsorption–desorption cycle...|$|R

A substantial increase in {{the thickness of the}} oxide layers formed by the interconnect steel is observed with specimen containing talc. The Cr 2 O 3 /(Cr, Mn) (3) O- 4 duplex layer normally formed on the Crofer is replaced by a thicker (factor of 5 - 10) layer of a complex microstructure that is assumed to contain Cr 2 O 3, (Cr, Mn, Mg, Fe) (3) O- 4 and Fe 2 O 3 phases. The modified microstructure is found in the entire air manifold, with an increased thickness up to a distance of 300 mu m from the mica. It is proposed that magnesium is the critical component responsible for the accelerated oxide formation.

40|$|We {{are pleased}} to present the FY 2010 Congressional Justification for the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). This budget request {{includes}} the FY 2008 Annual Performance Plan and the FY 2010 Online Performance Appendix {{as required by the}} Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. ATSDR employs the best science, takes responsive action, and provides trustworthy health information to prevent and mitigate harmful exposures and related disease. ATSDR continues to prevent, determine, and mitigate health effects at sites with toxic exposures, and its successes in doing so across the nation illustrate how funding for ATSDR directly benefits Americans. FY 2008 successes for ATSDR include the following: Helped to protect the health of a high school rifle team from a community near Fairbanks, Alaska. Teenagers from the rifle team were being exposed to unhealthy levels of lead while using the high school rifle range. An investigation by state health officials revealed that members of the rifle team were being exposed to lead dust because of poor ventilation and cleaning practices. Once discovered, health officials working with parents and school officials took actions that included working with the community to correct the problems and minimize the exposures of students and high school staff. Worked with partners to identify potentially harmful levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) inside homes of 25 persons in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. State health department staff worked with local, state, and federal authorities to assist in the installation of home exhaust systems and to provide health education to health care providers and the community. These efforts helped to reduce or eliminate exposures of impacted residents, thereby preventing a number of possible adverse health effects. Ensured that school grounds at Apple Valley Elementary School (Yakima, Washington) were made safe for students and visitors. Through an ATSDR Cooperative Agreement, the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) found potentially harmful levels of arsenate pesticides on the school grounds. State health officials advised state regulatory and school officials on the actions needed to reduce the health threat posed by the contamination and coordinated with both groups as well as students and parents to provide information on ways to keep school yard playgrounds and children safe. Took actions to protect the health of Dayton, Ohio residents impacted by groundwater contamination from the Delphi facility. Contaminant levels in the air within these homes posed a public health hazard and prompted actions by federal, state, and local health and environmental authorities to work with homeowners and private industry to install vapor abatement systems (VAS) in the affected homes. To protect other residential areas from being impacted by the groundwater contamination, Delphi company representatives installed a large-scale soil vapor extraction system on their property. Identified arsenic contaminated soil that posed a hazard to children attending the 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 022 My School Daycare 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 013 in Hampton, Connecticut. Immediate actions were taken to minimize exposures at the daycare. Health officials also engaged the Daycare Licensing Program to evaluate daycares that may be located on or near industrial sites and developed a draft protocol for evaluating new daycares and daycares up for license renewal to ensure that children will not be exposed to contaminants from past industrial use. Collaborated with state health department partners to conduct evaluations of sites that received asbestos-containing vermiculite from a mine in Libby, Montana. The Summary Report: Exposure to asbestos-containing vermiculite from Libby, Montana, at 28 processing sites in the United States offers valuable information about facilities that <b>exfoliated</b> asbestos-containing <b>vermiculite,</b> identifies groups who experienced exposure to asbestos from these sites, and recommends re-evaluating existing data for former exfoliation sites where residual asbestos may be present. The report also proposes important public health activities to increase awareness about this type of asbestos exposure. Provided a comprehensive public health response to widespread flooding that occurred in Southern Wisconsin. Working with the Wisconsin Division of Public Health, ATSDR personnel staffed the Wisconsin Emergency Operations Center; presented on and coordinated daily conference calls for local public health departments; provided technical advice on topics, such as: mosquito control and disease prevention, volunteer health and safety issues, flooded and failed septic systems, beach safety, and surface water contamination and safety. Under its Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) mandate, these examples illustrate ATSDR 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s continuing work in preventing and mitigating exposures and related health effects at sites across the nation. ATSDR monitors its performance through long-term performance measures that evaluate our success in mitigating exposures at the most urgent and hazardous sites. These measures assess and document the impact of ATSDR 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s efforts on the health of people exposed to toxic substances. This FY 2010 Congressional Justification provides more detail of ATSDR 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s successes, highlights current efforts, and describes how the budget request will allow us to continue serving Americans productively through the upcoming fiscal year...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Exfoliated</b> <b>vermiculite</b> is a {{light-weight}} {{and cheap}} product that, {{because of its}} thermal resistance, has become a valuable insulating material. With regard to its use in beekeeping, this research tested whether the box for honey bees constructed with cement-vermiculite mortar (CVM) presents physical characteristics {{similar to those of}} wood. The experiment was carried out at Seropédica, RJ, Brazil, for eight months. The cement-vermiculite mortar was compared with a control material (pinewood), in the construction of Langstroth boxes and boards, in a completely randomized design, with respect to thermal control, thermal conductivity and its capacity to absorb and lose water. The production cost for a CVM box was estimated. There were no internal temperature differences between CVM and wooden boxes. Thermal conductivity values for CVM and pinewood were similar. CVM absorbed more water and lost water faster than pinewood. Since CVM boxes can be easily constructed, at a low cost and with similar characteristics as traditional boxes, made of wood, the material can be recommended for use in non-migratory beekeeping...|$|E
40|$|Pharmaceutical {{residues}} {{presence in}} the environment is among nowadays top emergent environmental issues. For removal of such pollutants, adsorption is a generally efficient process that can be complementary to conventional treatment. Research of cheap, widely available adsorbents may make this process economically attractive. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the capacity of two clay materials (<b>exfoliated</b> <b>vermiculite,</b> LECA) to adsorb gemfibrozil, mefenamic acid and naproxen in lab-scale batch assays. Results show that both adsorbents are able to remove the pharmaceuticals from aqueous medium. Although vermiculite exhibited higher adsorption capacities per unit mass of adsorbent, LECA yielded higher absolute removals of the pharmaceuticals due to the larger mass of adsorbent. Quantum chemistry calculations predicted that the forms of binding of the three molecules to the vermiculite surface are essentially identical, but the adsorption isotherm of naproxen differs substantially from the other two’s. The linear forms of the latter impose limits at lower concentrations to the removal efficiencies of these pharmaceuticals by vermiculite, thereby electing LECA as more efficient. Notwithstanding, vermiculite’s high specific adsorption capacity and also its much faster adsorption kinetics suggest {{that there may be}} some benefits in combining both materials as a composite adsorbent solution...|$|E

The removal of Cu(II) using vermiculite reached 67. 6 %, {{at ambient temperature}} and at the agitation speed of 400 rpm, while it was approximately 42. 5 % at 60 °C with no agitation. The highest removal level {{in the case of}} clinoptilolite use reached the percentage of 37. 3 % at the temperature of 60 °C without agitation; the same removal efficiency was obtained at ambient conditions with an agitation speed of 400 rpm. Clinoptilolite dust is found to be more efficient than granular clinoptilolite under all the conditions that were tested. Agitation and temperature also affect the uptake of the specific ions. Finally, the acidity of the aqueous solution influences the removal of copper by minerals. In column studies, the decrease of the flow rate resulted in the increase of the removal efficiency. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
