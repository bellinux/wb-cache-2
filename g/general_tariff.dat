2500|$|Law's {{chance to}} make his mark came {{with the issue of}} tariff reform. To cover the costs of the Second Boer War, Lord Salisbury's Chancellor of the Exchequer (Michael Hicks Beach) {{suggested}} introducing import taxes or tariffs on foreign metal, flour and grain coming into Britain. Such tariffs had previously existed in Britain, but the last of these had been abolished in the 1870s because of the free trade movement. A duty was now introduced on imported corn. The issue became [...] "explosive", dividing the British political world, and continued even after Salisbury retired and was replaced as Prime Minister by his nephew, Arthur Balfour. Law took advantage of this, making his first major speech on 22 April 1902, in which he argued that while he felt a <b>general</b> <b>tariff</b> was unnecessary, an imperial customs union (which would put tariffs on items from outside the British Empire, instead of on every nation but Britain) was a good idea, particularly since other nations such as Germany and the United States had increasingly high tariffs. Using his business experience, he made a [...] "plausible case" [...] that there was no proof that tariffs led to increases in the cost of living, as the Liberals had argued. Again his memory came into good use– when William Harcourt accused Law of misquoting him, Law was able to precisely give the place in Hansard where Harcourt's speech was to be found.|$|E

Her claim was based upon an alleged entitlement to reasonably continuous electric service to her home, and that the electric company's termination of service for alleged nonpayment, an action allowed by a provision of the company's <b>general</b> <b>tariff</b> approved by the PUC, constituted stated action that deprived her of property in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.|$|E
5000|$|Stanley Baldwin said in December 1930, {{during the}} Great Depression, that the Conservatives were [...] "a {{national}} party {{of all those}} who believe that any improvement in the industrial and economic position of this country can only be achieved by cutting loose from the Cobdenism of the last generation and putting this country on what is and must be a protectionist basis". Two weeks later Baldwin attacked the Labour government's handling of the Imperial Conference: [...] "At that Conference the Government had a splendid opportunity of doing something practical to help British industry and to bind the Empire together in a close partnership of trade. They failed to seize this opportunity because the Dominion proposals could not be reconciled with the ancient and obsolete free-trade theories of Cobdenism". Britain abandoned free trade in 1932 and adopted a <b>general</b> <b>tariff.</b> In 1932 the former Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Snowden said there was never a greater mistake than to say that Cobdenism was dead: [...] "Cobdenism was never more alive throughout the world than it was to-day.... To-day the ideas of Cobden were in revolt against selfish nationalism. The need for the breaking down of trade restrictions, which took various forms, was universally recognized even by those who were unable to throw off those shackles". F. W. Hirst said in 1941, during the Second World War, that Cobden's ideas [...] "stand out in almost complete opposition to the [...] "gospel" [...] according to Marx": ...|$|E

40|$|This paper studies {{commodity}} taxation when firms use two-part tariffs {{in model}} of competition A la Hotelling. Three kinds of taxes are considered: a specific tax, an ad valorem {{one on the}} subscription fee and an ad valorem one on the per usage fee. We first derive the equilibrium tariffs, market shares and profits. We show that the tax on the subscription fee is profit neutral (unlike the other two) but socially costly (like the other two) as it modifies the consumption choice of the consumers. In a context of costly public funds the ad valorem taxation on the variable fee dominates specific taxation. Moreover, the ranking between ad valorem taxation on the fixed fee and an ad valorem taxation on the variable fee depends on the relative magnitude of economic parameters, in particular the degree of differentation. Finally, we show that the government might prefer the use of two-part tariffs rather than the use of more <b>general</b> <b>tariffs.</b> two-parts tariffs, commodity taxation...|$|R
