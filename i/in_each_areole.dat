50|$|This tiny cactus {{may reach}} a maximum size of 55 {{millimeters}} tall by 30 mm wide. It is often smaller, growing {{to the size}} of a US penny. An individual is considered to be an adult when it exceeds 10 mm in diameter. It is spherical or somewhat cylindrical in shape. The areoles are round and covered <b>in</b> hairs. <b>Each</b> <b>areole</b> has up to 26 radial spines which are red, pink, or white in color. The spines are less than 2 mm long. The plant produces a flower up to 35 mm long by 25 mm wide with pinkish tepals, the outer ones sporting brownish midstripes. The fruit is green, ripening reddish, and measures about 4 mm long. According to a genetic analysis, this species probably evolved as a mutation of the larger Pediocactus simpsonii.|$|R
50|$|Acarospora veronensis is {{a medium}} brown to dark brown or black crustose lichen that grows up to 4 cm wide.

50|$|Echinocereus stramineus has various {{stems from}} which a sexual mature plant can {{have a number of}} stems from 10-50 to 100-350. The largest stem {{reported}} was 1 meter in diameter with up to 500 stems. The most unusual feature of this plant is the number of ribs per stem. Normally, it has 11-17 ribs per stem and the average ribs per stem is 12 so it is easier to distinguish this from other Echinocereus. In E. stramineus, the areoles are circular in shape and normally 7-15 mm apart. <b>Each</b> <b>areole</b> contains average 2-4 central spines and 7-10 radial spines in which radial spines are acicular and 2-3 cm in length.|$|R

50|$|The {{status of}} the species of Rebutia is {{currently}} uncertain; indeed the genus as defined by Anderson (2001) {{has been shown to}} be polyphyletic. Anderson describes R. minuscula as consisting of globe-shaped stems with a diameter of up to 5 cm, forming large clusters. The stem has 16-20 ribs with small but distinct tubercles ("bumps"). <b>Each</b> <b>areole</b> produces 25-30 fine whitish spines, 1 - 3 mm long. As in other species of Rebutia, the flowers are not produced at the top of the stem, but from around the base. They are red, up to 4 cm long. Other sources include species such as R. marsoneri with yellow to orange flowers in R. minuscula, giving the species a much broader range of flower colour.|$|R
5000|$|Aspicilia cyanescens (bluish sunken disk lichen) is a rough surfaced, bluish-tinged pale gray rimose to areolate crustose lichen, {{endemic to}} California. It mostly grows on rock.

40|$|Heterobaric leaves show {{heterogeneous}} pigmentation due to {{the occurrence}} {{of a network of}} transparent areas that are created from the bundle sheaths extensions (BSEs). Image analysis showed that the percentage of photosynthetically active leaf area (Ap) of the heterobaric leaves of 31 plant species was species dependent, ranging from 91 % in Malva sylvestris to only 48 % in Gynerium sp. Although {{a significant portion of the}} leaf surface does not correspond to photosynthetic tissue, the photosynthetic capacity of these leaves, expressed per unit of projected area (Pmax), was not considerably affected by the size of their transparent leaf area (At). This means that the photosynthetic capacity expressed per Ap (P*max) should increase with At. Moreover, the expression of P*max could be allowing the interpretation of the photosynthetic performance in relation to some critical anatomical traits. The P*max, irrespective of plant species, correlated with the specific leaf transparent volume (λt), as well as with the transparent leaf area complexity factor (CFAt), parameters indicating the volume per unit leaf area and length/density of the transparent tissues, respectively. Moreover, both parameters increased exponentially with leaf thickness, suggesting an essential functional role of BSEs mainly in thick leaves. The results of the present study suggest that although the Ap of an heterobaric leaf is reduced, the photosynthetic performance of <b>each</b> <b>areole</b> is increased, possibly {{due to the}} light transferring capacity of BSEs. This mechanism may allow a significant increase in leaf thickness and a consequent increase of the photosynthetic capacity per unit (projected) area, offering adaptive advantages in xerothermic environments...|$|R
