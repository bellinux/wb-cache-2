500|$|Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth. While {{the upper}} incisors are absent, the upper canines are either reduced or absent. Instead {{of the upper}} incisors, bovids have a thick and tough layer of tissue, called the <b>dental</b> <b>pad,</b> that {{provides}} a surface to grip grasses and foliage. They are hypsodont and selenodont, since the molars and premolars are low-crowned and crescent-shaped cusps. The lower incisors and canines project forward. The incisors are followed by a long toothless gap, known as the diastema. The general dental formula for bovids is [...] Most {{members of the family}} are herbivorous, but most duikers are omnivorous. Like other ruminants, bovids have four-chambered stomachs, which allow them to digest plant material, such as grass, that cannot be used by many other animals. Ruminants (and some others like kangaroos, rabbits, and termites) are able to use micro-organisms living in their guts to break down cellulose by fermentation.|$|E

50|$|In 1967 Frank Mayfield and George Kees {{develop the}} Mayfield Horseshoe and General Purpose Headrests, based on Mayfield's {{observations}} from a <b>dental</b> chair. The <b>padded</b> headrests {{were designed to}} cradle and stabilize the head {{off the end of}} the operating table and allow the surgeon better access during surgery. Subsequently, in 1973, the Mayfield three-pin skull clamp was designed to rigidly affix a patient's head to the operating table during craniotomy drilling and delicate microneurosurgery. The Mayfield Headrest and Skull Clamp System are the most common and widely used neurosurgical instruments today.|$|R
40|$|One {{innovation}} {{developed by}} a contractor at Ames Research Center was an open cell polymeric foam material with unusual properties. Intended as padding for aircraft seats the material offered better impact protection against accidents, and also enhanced passenger comfort because it distributed body weight evenly over the entire contact area. Called a slow springback foam, it flows to match the contour of the body pressing against it, and returns to its original shape once the pressure is removed. It has many applications including aircraft cushions and <b>padding,</b> <b>dental</b> stools, and athletic equipment. Now it's used by Dynamic Systems, Inc. for medical applications such as wheel chairs for severely disabled people which allow them to sit for 3 - 8 hours where {{they used to be}} uncomfortable in 15 - 30 minutes...|$|R
50|$|The <b>dental</b> <b>pad</b> or {{browsing}} pad is {{a feature}} of ruminant dental anatomy that results {{from a lack of}} upper incisors and helps them gather large quantities of grass and other plant matter. This feature can be found in ruminants such as cattle and sheep. In cattle, the tongue is used to grasp food and pinch it off between the <b>dental</b> <b>pad</b> and the lower incisors. However, since they cannot bite grass off, they are inefficient at grazing more closely than 6 in from the ground.|$|E
50|$|Cattle have thirty-two teeth, {{including}} six incisors or biting teeth and two canines {{in the front}} on the bottom jaw. The canine teeth are not pointed but look like incisors. The incisor teeth meet with the thick hard <b>dental</b> <b>pad</b> of the upper jaw. Cattle have six premolars and six molars on both top and bottom jaws {{for a total of}} twenty-four molars. The teeth of cattle are designed primarily for grinding, and they use their rough tongues to grasp grass and then nip it off between their incisors and the <b>dental</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ruminating {{animals have}} various {{physiological}} features that {{enable them to}} survive in nature. One feature of ruminants is their continuously growing teeth. During grazing, the silica content in forage causes abrasion of the teeth. This abrasion is compensated for by continuous tooth growth throughout the ruminant's life, as opposed to humans or other nonruminants, whose teeth stop growing after a particular age. Most ruminants do not have upper incisors; instead, they have a thick <b>dental</b> <b>pad</b> to thoroughly chew plant-based food.|$|E
40|$|Background: The ideal teeth {{arrangement}} {{is an important}} step for success in complete denture fabrication. There are different methods for determining the posterior denture teeth location. The {{purpose of this study was}} the comparison of posterior mandibular teeth location in the study group with Pound or Misch theory. Material and methods: An alginate mandibular impression of 80 dentate patients was taken and poured with <b>dental</b> stone. Retromolar <b>pad</b> area, mesial of canine and the lingual cusps of each posterior tooth marked on the cast and then transferred to the graded paper. Distance of each lingual cusp from the internal line of Pound triangle was measured. Data were analyzed with SPSS version 16. 0. Result: In the study group, the average distance of lingual mandibular cusp from the internal line of Pound triangle was 1. 69 mm in first premolars, 0. 94 mm in second premolars, 0. 7 mm in first molars and 0. 75 mm in second molars. Conclusion: In most cases, distance of lingual mandibular cusps was within 1 mm of Pound triangle. Results were more similar to the Pound rather than the Misch theory...|$|R
50|$|Some {{ungulates}} completely lack upper incisors {{and instead}} have a <b>dental</b> <b>pad</b> {{to assist in}} browsing. It {{can be found in}} camels, ruminants, and some toothed whales; modern baleen whales are remarkable in that they have baleen instead to filter out the krill from the water. On the other spectrum teeth have been evolved as weapons or sexual display seen in pigs and peccaries, some species of deer, musk deer, hippopotamuses, beaked whales and the Narwhal, with its long canine tooth.|$|E

40|$|Synophthalmia {{is a form}} of cyclopia, {{in which}} some {{elements}} of two eyes are fused and form a single eye in the middle region of the forehead. The head of a Holstein female calf born from a 5 -year-old cow was referred to Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine, Shahrekord University due to multiple congenital anomalies. The calf had been slaughtered immediately after birth due to severe respiratory distress by the owner. The calf showed multiple birth defects, including synophthalmia, holoprosencephaly, absence of optic chiasma, hypoplastic maxilla, curved mandibles, arrhinia and <b>dental</b> <b>pad</b> agenesis.

40|$|Brachygnathia is {{a deficit}} in mandibular length causing the incisor teeth {{to meet the}} upper <b>dental</b> <b>pad</b> behind its {{anterior}} angle. It is a problem to breeders of both red and black Simmental cattle, as wellas other breeds. The condition has been considered inherited as a simple autosomal recessive trait. It has also been observed as {{one part of a}} lethal, multiple-defect syndrome in Simmentals caused by the calf being born with an extra chromosome (Trisomy 17). Intrauterine infectionwith bovine viraldiarrhea-mucosal disease virus (BVD-MD) also can cause the defect, but usually in this case the calf is also born with a variety of additional problems. In Angus cattle, the defect has also been observed accompanying osteopetrosis, an inherited bone defect. Selective culling and breeding practices designed to remove an undesirable genetic trait have been unsuccessful for a number of producers of both red and black Simmentals. For that reason, we have been studying the inheritance of this condition in more detail...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{report on}} an {{outbreak}} of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) among sheep and goats in the Province of Gujarat, India. Clinical signs observed during outbreaks were typical of PPR. Predominant signs were severe diarrhoea, dyspnoea, mucopurulent discharge from the eyes and nose, erosive rhinitis, necrotic ulcers in the mouth, on the <b>dental</b> <b>pad,</b> tongue, upper and lower lips, fever and depression. Common post-mortem findings included congestion, red hepatisation, raised patches of emphysema in the lungs, haemorrhages and froth exudates in the trachea, severe enteritis and streaks of haemorrhages in the intestine, enlargement and petechial haemorrhages in the spleen and oedema and inflammatory lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Spectacular histopathological changes were observed in the lungs, intestine, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and kidneys. Clinical, gross and histopathological lesions and haematological changes were suggestive of PPR, which was further confirmed by detection of PPR viral antigen in clinical samples, as well as post-mortem tissues using the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (s‑ELISA) ...|$|E
