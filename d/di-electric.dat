50|$|When an {{electrical}} transmission line is energized, the air surrounding the conductors {{is subjected to}} <b>di-electric</b> stress. At low voltage, nothing really occurs as the stress is too low to ionize the air outside. But when the voltage gradient around a conductor is higher than some threshold value, the air surrounding it experiences stress high enough to be dissociated into ions, making the atmosphere conducting. This results in electric discharge around the conductors due to the flow of these ions, giving rise to a faint luminescent glow, along with the hissing sound accompanied by the liberation of ozone, which is readily identified due to its characteristic odor. If the voltage across the lines is still increased the glow {{becomes more and more}} intense along with hissing noise, inducing very high power loss into the system.|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method to}} prepare functional oxides is ceramicpowder- based processing typically via solid-state reaction of microcrystalline starting powders at high temperatures. Disadvantages {{of this approach}} include the high temperatures of reaction, limited degree of product chemical homogeneity and difficulties in achieving rapid sintering. Various chemicalbased processing routes {{have been developed to}} prepare powders of more homogeneous composition, improved reactivity and sintering ability at low temperatures. Regardless of the route chosen to synthesise complex oxides, almost all of them require lengthy heat treatment schedules that usually exceed 10 h, as well as multi-stage processing steps. We describe two approaches to address these problems, applied to successful synthesis of both MgAl 2 O 4 and CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 (CCT) oxides exhibiting excellent <b>di-electric</b> properties. One approach employed the novel direct synthesis technique of electric discharge assisted mechanical milling (EDAMM) and the second used the more conventional method of controlled ball milling using the magneto-mechanical method followed by heat treatment of nano-structural products. By using EDAMM, nano-crystalline precursors for transformation into high <b>di-electric</b> constant ceramics could be formed in as little as 0. 1 % of the processing time required for conventional solid-state techniques while ball milling using the magneto method also resulted in nano-structural precursors powders suitable for reaction by heat treatment to form oxide supercapacitor.

The diversity of antimicrobial efficacy or intensity of effects may differ {{with respect to the}} plasma device or set up, and {{it is important to understand}} how these differences occur to advance understanding and successful applications. Thus, plasma treated water (PTW) from a microwave driven plasma source (PTW-MW) and plasma treated water from a <b>di-electric</b> barrier discharge system (PTW-DBD) were compared in terms of long lived reactive species chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. The influence of a post-treatment storage time (PTST), where reactive species in the gas phase were maintained in contact with the liquid was investigated.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} {{study on the}} effect of bottom- and top-oxide thicknesses on the current conduction and the <b>di-electric</b> breakdown of oxide/nitride/oxide (ONO) multi-layer dielectrics. An abrupt reduction in current is observed when the oxide that is contiguous to the anode is thicker than 3 nm. This leads us to conclude that the thick oxide (> 3 nm) im-pedes hole injection from anode into nitride. The injected charge-to-breakdown (QBD) and the time-to-breakdown (TBD) are measured to study the breakdown mechanism. We observe that a substantial increase in TBD occurs in spite of the reduc-tion in QBD when the thick oxide is contiguous to anode. This phenomenon is explained by a hole-induced breakdown model for the ONO structure with thin bottom- and top-oxides (< 3 nm). Hole injection is suppressed by the thick oxide that is contiguous to anode. The increase in TBD is attributed to the reduction in injected holes. We conclude that the <b>di-electric</b> breakdown of the ONO structure with the thin oxides is induced by injected holes. We also observe that the ther-mal activation energy of the TSD changes at 3 nm in bottom-oxide thickness under negative gate bias. Therefore, this value of 3 nm is determined as a threshold thickness for the change ofthe breakdown mechanism.
