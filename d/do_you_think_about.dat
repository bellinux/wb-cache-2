We would talk a little bit until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the {{sessions}} began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.|$|E
25|$|In linguistics, wh-movement (also {{known as}} wh-fronting or wh-extraction or long-distance dependency) {{concerns}} special rules of syntax—rules observed in many languages around the world—involving {{the placement of}} interrogative words. The special interrogatives, whatever the language, are known within linguistics as wh-words (so named because most interrogative words in the English language start with a wh-; for example, who(m), whose, what, which, etc.). Wh-words are used to form questions, and can also occur in relative clauses. In languages exhibiting wh-movement, sentences or clauses containing a wh-word show a special word order that has the wh-word (or phrase containing the wh-word) appearing {{at the front of}} the sentence or clause, e.g. Who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about?,</b> instead of in a more canonical position further to the right, e.g. I think about you. The opposite is called wh in situ.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{himself was}} {{ambiguous}} about his attitudes to late Romantic German music and to nationalism in music. He {{wrote to the}} Dutch composer Julius Röntgen in 1909 [...] "I am surprised by the technical skills of the Germans nowadays, and I cannot help thinking that all this delight in complication must exhaust itself. I foresee a completely new art of pure archaic virtue. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> songs sung in unison? We must go back... to the pure and the clear." [...] On the other hand, he wrote in 1925 [...] "Nothing destroys music more than nationalism does... and {{it is impossible to}} deliver national music on request." ...|$|E

500|$|David is an android {{that acts}} as the ship's butler and {{maintenance}} man. It {{is designed to be}} indistinguishable from humans, and begins to develop [...] "its own ego, insecurities, jealousy and envy". Writer Damon Lindelof stated that the character provides a non-human perspective on the film's events, and said, [...] "what does the movie look like from the robot's point of view? If you were to ask him, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> all of this? What's going on? What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> these humans who are around you?' Wouldn't it be cool if we found a way for that robot to answer those questions?" [...] Fassbender said, [...] "David's views on the human crew are somewhat childlike. He is jealous and arrogant because he realizes that his knowledge is all-encompassing, and therefore he is superior to the humans. David wants to be acknowledged and praised for his brilliance". In developing his character, Fassbender avoided watching the android characters of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), and instead studied the replicants in Scott's 1982 science fiction film Blade Runner, with a focus on Sean Young's character Rachael, whose [...] "vacancy" [...] and longing for a soul interested him. Fassbender drew further inspiration from the voice of the HAL 9000 computer in , the [...] "funny walk and economy of movement" [...] of Olympic diver Greg Louganis, and the performances of David Bowie in The Man Who Fell to Earth, Dirk Bogarde in The Servant, and Peter O'Toole in Lawrence of Arabia. David's blond hair was modeled on that of T. E. Lawrence. Scott favored Fassbender for the role; by January 2011 he was confirmed to have joined the cast, despite earlier reports that his agents had sought too high a fee.|$|E
500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I {{got a call from}} John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had just talked a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives. Because for me, I genuinely missed his friendship, and same with Shaun [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|On 9 December 1980, McCartney {{followed}} {{the news that}} Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was [...] surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: [...] "It's a drag". The press quickly criticised him for {{what appeared to be}} a superficial response. He later explained, [...] "When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, [...] "It's a drag".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make." [...] He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon: ...|$|E

[...] Kelly's reply was, [...] "I thought about it, but only because I knew I'd be asked about it. I didn't worry about it at all. I was underwhelmed by it." ...|$|R

500|$|The film is set {{six months}} after the events of The Avengers. In the film Tony Stark {{experiences}} PTSD-like symptoms following the Battle of New York in The Avengers. Black explained, [...] "that's an anxiety response to feeling inferior to The Avengers, but also to being humbled by sights he cannot possibly begin to understand or reconcile with the realities he's used to... There's a line in the movie about 'ever since that big guy with the hammer fell out of the sky, the rules have changed'. That's what we're dealing with here." [...] Bruce Banner appears in a post-credits scene, with Ruffalo reprising the role. About the scene, Ruffalo said [...] "They were about to wrap the movie and I saw Robert [...] at the Academy Awards... and he said, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> coming and doing a day?' I said, 'Are you kidding me? Bang, lets do it!' We sort of spitballed that scene, then I came in and we shot {{for a couple of hours}} and laughed." ...|$|E
500|$|For an hour De Winter {{continued}} his resistance, with Director holding station off {{the stern of}} Vrijheid and repeatedly raking it. By 15:00, all three masts had been brought down, obstructing the fire of the starboard battery, while De Winter was the only officer who remained uninjured, standing on his wrecked quarterdeck and still refusing to lower his colours. In an attempt to settle the combat, Captain William Bligh of Director closed to within [...] of the Dutch flagship and demanded to know if De Winter surrendered. The Dutch admiral replied [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> it?", and then attempted to personally raise signals demanding reinforcements {{from the rest of}} his fleet, only to find that the halyards had been shot away. De Winter then summoned the ship's carpenter and ordered him to repair his barge, so that the admiral could transfer command to another ship and continue the battle. When British sailors from Director boarded the drifting flagship, De Winter was discovered [...] assisting the carpenter with repairs to the barge. On being informed that he was a prisoner of war, he replied [...] "This is my destiny not foreseen" [...] and, after checking on a mortally wounded officer who lay on the quarterdeck, he followed the boarding party back to their boat for the trip to Venerable.|$|E

As such, he approached his colleagues with the question [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> having this world with 100 guys fighting 100 other guys in 3D?"

They had planned to do another first-person shooter as their next game.

As such, he approached his colleagues with the question [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> having this world with 100 guys fighting 100 other guys in 3D?"

The team agreed with Jones that their new shooter could end up as being very similar to Quake, and, as such, after working on the project for two months, Jones explains [...] "in one day we switched our project from a shooter game that would have had us chasing our competition's tail to what has basically become Myth." ...|$|E
