Both Waugh and Warne denied any suggestions they played with less determination in the matches in question, stating that they were among the leading players in those games.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, the Ministry of Justice {{announced}} plans to close 54 county courts and 103 magistrates' courts in England and Wales, {{in order to save}} £15m in annual running costs and £22m in necessary maintenance. The courts threatened with closure in Wales were Aberdare, Llangefni, Pontypool and Rhyl. In addition, it was proposed that Newport County Court would no longer <b>hold</b> <b>hearings</b> at Chepstow every fortnight (as had been done since the county court there closed in 2002). After consultation, it was decided to keep Llangefni County Court open, but the other closures were confirmed.|$|E

25|$|Days {{after the}} shooting, {{reports in the}} media {{revealed}} that a Joint Terrorism Task Force had been aware {{of a series of}} e-mails between Hasan and the Yemen-based imam Anwar al-Awlaki, who had been monitored by the NSA as a security threat, and that Hasan's colleagues had been aware of his increasing radicalization for several years.

25|$|Stephen Harper had cut $45 {{million from}} arts funding while in office, {{a move that}} drew much {{criticism}} from the other leaders and Quebec citizens, with most leaders seeking to restore the funding. The Conservatives have stated that the money is being reallocated to other arts and cultural programs, including various official languages projects, the 400th anniversary of Quebec City and projects connected with the 2010 Vancouver-Whistler Winter Olympic Games, although the Conservative's refusal to have a parliamentary review of their cuts and for a moratorium on the measures until the House of Commons Heritage Committee {{had a chance to}} <b>hold</b> <b>hearings</b> on culture and arts funding has most opposition members calling foul.|$|E

25|$|Most {{committee}} work {{is performed}} by 16 standing committees, {{each of which}} has jurisdiction over a field such as finance or foreign relations. Each standing committee may consider, amend, and report bills that fall under its jurisdiction. Furthermore, each standing committee considers presidential nominations to offices related to its jurisdiction. (For instance, the Judiciary Committee considers nominees for judgeships, and the Foreign Relations Committee considers nominees for positions in the Department of State.) Committees may block nominees and impede bills from reaching the floor of the Senate. Standing committees also oversee the departments and agencies of the executive branch. In discharging their duties, standing committees have the power to <b>hold</b> <b>hearings</b> and to subpoena witnesses and evidence.|$|E
25|$|Investigations are {{conducted}} {{to gather information}} {{on the need for}} future legislation, to test the effectiveness of laws already passed, and to inquire into the qualifications and performance of members and officials of the other branches. Committees may <b>hold</b> <b>hearings,</b> and, if necessary, compel individuals to testify when investigating issues over which it has the power to legislate by issuing subpoenas. Witnesses who refuse to testify may be cited for contempt of Congress, and those who testify falsely may be charged with perjury. Most committee hearings {{are open to the public}} (the House and Senate intelligence committees are the exception); important hearings are widely reported in the mass media and transcripts published a few months afterwards. Congress, in the course of studying possible laws and investigating matters, generates an incredible amount of information in various forms, and can be described as a publisher. Indeed, it publishes House and Senate reports and maintains databases which are updated irregularly with publications in a variety of electronic formats.|$|E
500|$|On March 1, 1977, the Maine {{delegation}} introduced {{bills to}} extinguish all aboriginal title in Maine without compensation.

500|$|Specter {{was very}} {{critical}} of Bush's wiretapping of U.S. citizens without warrants. When the story first broke, he called the effort [...] "inappropriate" [...] and [...] "clearly and categorically wrong." [...] He said {{that he intended to}} <b>hold</b> <b>hearings</b> into the matter early in 2006, and had Alberto Gonzales appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer for the program. (However, Specter declined to force Gonzales to testify under oath.) On January 15, 2006, Specter mentioned impeachment and criminal prosecution as potential remedies if Bush proved to have broken the law, though he downplayed the likelihood of such an outcome.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{called for}} a bill {{regulating}} toxins {{in the air and}} increasing funding for pollution programs. Edmund Muskie, a Senator from Maine and political environmentalist, praised Johnson's words, pledged to <b>hold</b> <b>hearings</b> on the proposals, and would soon sponsor the Johnson administration's bill, which became the Air Quality Act. Muskie also co-sponsored bills in 1967 for research on non-polluting automobiles using either electric or fuel cell technology. While discussing the research bills on the Senate floor, Muskie said [...] "the serious air pollution situation in New York City [...] dramatically illustrated what our cities may be facing in the future if an alternative to the [...] combustion engine is not developed." ...|$|E
500|$|In late 1982, Congress {{passed a}} law which forbade the United States from funding groups aiming to {{overthrow}} the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. Then, in 1983, Bedell visited Nicaragua and Honduras along with Representative Robert G. Torricelli. During the trip, Bedell spoke with soldiers, generals, governmental officials {{and members of the}} contras. His conclusion {{at the end of the}} trip was that Ronald Reagan was aiding the contras in violation of federal law. He promised to <b>hold</b> <b>hearings</b> after returning to Congress. Bedell would later join other House Democrats in demanding documents from the White House related to the contras, but the Reagan Administration refused to provide them. Bedell became angrier with the Reagan Administration as the decade wore on. He called his Central American policies [...] "sheer lunacy," [...] saying that the mining of harbors was an act of war. Bedell would retire from Congress before Reagan's actions in Central America would culminate with the Iran-Contra Affair.|$|E
50|$|Committees <b>hold</b> {{legislative}} <b>hearings</b> {{on measures}} or policy issues that may become public law.

500|$|The new Congress, which convened on March 4, 1867, {{was not as}} {{aggressive}} in opposing Johnson as Stevens had hoped. [...] It soon adjourned until July, though its Judiciary Committee remained to <b>hold</b> <b>hearings</b> on whether the President should be impeached. [...] Stevens firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio's Benjamin Wade as its president pro tempore, next in line to the presidency {{in the absence of}} a vice president. [...] Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed Karl Marx that he mentioned it in the first German edition of Das Kapital. Also a supporter of women's suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views; the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson's removal more hesitant. [...] Stevens, however, strongly supported the removal of the President, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did. Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the purchase of Alaska and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories to expand into.|$|E
500|$|On December 9, 1993, the United States Congress {{began to}} <b>hold</b> <b>hearings</b> on video game {{violence}} and the marketing of violent video games to children. One of the games {{at the center of}} this controversy was the Sega CD's Night Trap, a full-motion video adventure game by Digital Pictures. Night Trap had been brought to the attention of United States Senator Joe Lieberman, who said of the game, [...] "I looked at that game, too, and there was a classic. It ends with this attack scene on this woman in lingerie, in her bathroom. I know that the creator of the game said it was all meant to be a satire of Dracula; but nonetheless, I thought it sent out the wrong message." [...] Lieberman's research later went on to conclude that the average video game player at the time was between seven and twelve years old and that video game publishers were marketing violence to children. Similar issues were brought up in the United Kingdom, with former Sega of Europe development director Mike Brogan noting that [...] "Night Trap got Sega an awful lot of publicity.... Questions were even raised in the UK Parliament about its suitability. This came at a time when Sega was capitalizing on its image as an edgy company with attitude, and this only served to reinforce that image." [...] Although experiencing increased sales as a result of the hearings, Sega decided to recall Night Trap and re-release it with revisions in 1994. Following these hearings, video game manufacturers came together in 1994 to establish a unified rating system, eventually materializing in the form of the Entertainment Software Rating Board used in North America.|$|E
