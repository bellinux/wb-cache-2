5|$|His <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> usually abstractions of {{the human}} figure, {{typically}} depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire.|$|E
5000|$|Because a {{symplectic}} <b>form</b> <b>is</b> nondegenerate, so is {{the associated}} bilinear form. Moreover, the associated <b>form</b> <b>is</b> preserved by [...] {{if and only if}} the symplectic <b>form</b> <b>is,</b> and if [...] is tamed by [...] then the associated <b>form</b> <b>is</b> positive definite. Thus in this case the associated <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a Hermitian <b>form</b> and [...] <b>is</b> an inner product space.|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} vector calculus and differential topology, {{a closed}} <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a differential <b>form</b> α whose exterior derivative is zero (dα = 0), and an exact <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a differential <b>form</b> that <b>is</b> the exterior derivative of another differential form &beta;. Thus, an exact <b>form</b> <b>is</b> {{in the image}} of d, and a closed <b>form</b> <b>is</b> in the kernel of d.|$|R

5|$|Most verbs {{have six}} inflectional forms. The primary <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> a plain present, {{a third person}} {{singular}} present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund–participle and a past participle. The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is am, the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.|$|E

5000|$|The catalecticant of a quartic <b>form</b> <b>is</b> the {{resultant}} of its second partial derivatives. For binary quartics the catalecticant vanishes when the <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a sum of 2 4th powers. For a ternary quartic the catalecticant vanishes when the <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a sum of 5 4th powers. For quaternary quartics the catalecticant vanishes when the <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a sum of 9 4th powers. For quinary quartics the catalecticant vanishes when the <b>form</b> <b>is</b> a sum of 14 4th powers.|$|R

5000|$|If [...] {{is not a}} unit {{quaternion}} {{then the}} homogeneous <b>form</b> <b>is</b> still a scalar multiple of a rotation matrix, while the inhomogeneous <b>form</b> <b>is</b> in general no longer an orthogonal matrix. This is why in numerical work the homogeneous <b>form</b> <b>is</b> to be preferred if distortion is to be avoided.|$|R

5|$|All the motifs {{can vary}} {{considerably}} in appearance {{according to the}} weaver. Colours, sizes and shapes can all be chosen according to taste and the tradition in a given village or tribe; further, motifs are often combined, as illustrated in the photographs above. To give some idea of this variability, a few alternative <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> shown in the table.|$|E

5|$|Birds from Fair Isle, St Kilda and the Outer Hebrides are {{intermediate}} in size between S. v. zetlandicus and the nominate form, {{and their}} subspecies placement {{varies according to}} the authority. The dark juveniles typical of these island <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> occasionally found in mainland Scotland and elsewhere, indicating some gene flow from faroensis or zetlandicus, subspecies formerly considered to be isolated.|$|E
5|$|Ctenophores {{are found}} in most marine environments: from polar waters to the tropics; near coasts and in mid-ocean; from the surface waters to the ocean depths. The best-understood are the genera Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis, as these planktonic coastal <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> among {{the most likely to}} be {{collected}} near shore. No ctenophores have been found in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Flagella are {{semi-rigid}} cylindrical {{structures that}} are rotated and function {{much like the}} propeller on a ship. Objects as small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> more efficient than the flat, paddle-like, forms appropriate at human-size scale.|$|E

5|$|In both corpora {{there were}} many more monosyllables/single glyphs in running text than in the lexicon. That is, in both a {{relatively}} small number of such <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> very frequent, suggesting that rongorongo is compatible with Rapanui, which has a small number of very frequent monosyllabic grammatical particles. Rongorongo and Rapanui are also almost identical in the proportion of syllables/glyphs found in isolation and in initial, medial, and final position within a word/ligature.|$|E
5|$|Larger species often {{break up}} when stimulated, and the {{fragments}} often grow into full individuals. Some species fragment routinely and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies. All reproduce sexually, and most species are gonochoric (the sexes are separate), {{but all the}} freshwater <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> hermaphroditic.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} butterflies have seasonal {{forms for}} dry and wet seasons. These are switched by the hormone ecdysone. The dry-season <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> usually more cryptic, perhaps offering better camouflage when vegetation is scarce. Dark colours in wet-season forms {{may help to}} absorb solar radiation.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{in usual}} mathematics, [...] "canonical form" [...] and [...] "normal form" [...] are not synonymous in {{computer}} algebra. A canonical <b>form</b> <b>is</b> such that two expressions in canonical <b>form</b> <b>are</b> semantically equal if {{and only if}} they are syntactically equal, while a normal <b>form</b> <b>is</b> such that an expression in normal <b>form</b> <b>is</b> semantically zero only if it is syntactically zero.

5|$|The Australian magpie {{is found}} in the Trans-Fly region of {{southern}} New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and the Princess Mariane Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of Cape York, the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and southwest of Tasmania. Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local Acclimatisation Societies of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington Acclimatisation Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> found in the Hawke's Bay region. Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951. They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the tui and kererū, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings, although studies by Waikato University have cast doubt on this, and much blame on the magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only. Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western Taveuni in Fiji, however.|$|E
5|$|The golden {{everlasting}} {{has proven}} very adaptable to cultivation. It was propagated and developed in Germany in the 1850s, and annual cultivars {{in a host}} of colour forms from white to bronze to purple flowers became available. Many of these are still sold in mixed seed packs. In Australia, many cultivars are perennial shrubs, which have become popular garden plants. Sturdier, long-stemmed <b>forms</b> <b>are</b> used commercially in the cut flower industry.|$|E
