Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA.</b> These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells. Bacteria also contain {{a system that}} uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have {{come into contact with}} in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference. This genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.|$|E
40|$|Digestion of DNA with {{restriction}} endonucleases is {{the first}} step in many gene manipulation projects. Restriction endonucleases (also referred to more generally as restriction enzymes) are isolated from many species of bacteria and recognize specific 4 -base (tetramer), 5 -base (pentamer), 6 -base (hexamer), or 8 -base (octomer) sites and make double-stranded cuts. In vivo, it appears that the main role of restriction endonucleases is to protect cells from invasion by <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA’s,</b> especially bacteriophage DNA...|$|R

REases have originated from the ancestral proteins and evolved new sequence specificities by genetic recombination, gene duplication, replication slippage, and transpositional events. They are also speculated to have evolved from nonspecific endonucleases, attaining {{a high degree}} of sequence specificity through point mutations. We describe here an example of generation of exquisitely site-specific REase from a highly-promiscuous one by a single point mutation...|$|R

25|$|Adenine or {{cytosine}} methylation {{is part of}} {{the restriction}} modification system of many bacteria, in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. A methylase is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. <b>Foreign</b> <b>DNAs</b> (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence-specific restriction enzymes and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by these restriction enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by bacteriophage.|$|R

40|$|We have {{observed}} that plasmids containing certain cloned modification methylase genes of type II restriction-modification systems cannot be transformed into many laboratory strains of Escherichia coli K- 12. The investigation of this phenomenon, reported here, has revealed (i) DNA containing 5 -methylcytosine is biologically restricted by these strains, while DNA containing 6 -methyladenine is not; (ii) restriction is due to two genetically distinct systems that differ in their sequence specificities, which we have named mcrA and mcrB (for modified cytosine restriction). Since 5 -methylcytosine containing DNA is widespread in nature, the Mcr systems probably have a broad biological role. Mcr restriction may seriously interfere with molecular cloning of 5 -methylcytosine-containing <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs.</b> The Mcr phenotypes of some commonly used strains of E. coli K- 12 are reported...|$|R

25|$|A {{more recent}} method for genome editing uses CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) {{sequences}} and the endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9). These components {{are an integral}} part of the immune response for some bacteria. and have been repurposed for genome engineering. In this system, sequences matching foreign bacteriophage or plasmid DNA are incorporated as “spacer” sequences into the bacterial genome located between repeating CRISPR loci. Cas endonucleases are able to initiate double strand breaks within these <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs</b> that are complement to the transcribed CRISPR RNAs (crRNA, or “protospacers”), thus degrading them. A conserved protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM, sequence 5’-NGG-3’) located immediately downstream of the protospacer in the cellular genome is necessary for Cas9 cleavage. Together, this system allows for adaptive immunity to the dynamic viral genetic material.|$|R
40|$|The DNA-dependent {{activator}} of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI), {{also known}} as DLM- 1 /ZBP 1, initiates an innate immune response by binding to <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs</b> in the cytosol. For full activation of the immune response, three DNA binding domains at the N terminus are required: two Z-DNA binding domains (ZBDs), Zα and Zβ, and an adjacent putative B-DNA binding domain. The crystal structure of the Zβ domain of human DAI (hZβDAI) in complex with Z-DNA revealed structural features distinct from other known Z-DNA binding proteins, and it was classified as a group II ZBD. To gain structural insights into the DNA binding mechanism of hZβDAI, the solution structure of the free hZβDAI was solved, and its bindings to B- and Z-DNAs were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Compared to the Z-DNA–bound structure, the conformation of free hZβDAI has notable alterations in the α 3 recognition helix, the “wing,” and Y 145, which are critical in Z-DNA recognition. Unlike some other Zα domains, hZβDAI appears to have conformational flexibility, and structural adaptation is required for Z-DNA binding. Chemical-shift perturbation experiments revealed that hZβDAI also binds weakly to B-DNA via a different binding mode. The C-terminal domain of DAI is reported to undergo a conformational change on B-DNA binding; thus, {{it is possible that}} these changes are correlated. During the innate immune response, hZβDAI is likely to play an active role in binding to DNAs in both B and Z conformations in the recognition of <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Korea (South).

25|$|Modern {{bacterial}} cloning vectors (e.g. pUC19 {{and later}} derivatives including the pGEM vectors) use the blue-white screening system to distinguish colonies (clones) of transgenic cells {{from those that}} contain the parental vector (i.e. vector DNA with no recombinant sequence inserted). In these vectors, <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA</b> is inserted into a sequence that encodes {{an essential part of}} beta-galactosidase, an enzyme whose activity results in formation of a blue-colored colony on the culture medium that is used for this work. Insertion of the <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA</b> into the beta-galactosidase coding sequence disables the function of the enzyme, so that colonies containing transformed DNA remain colorless (white). Therefore, experimentalists are easily able to identify and conduct further studies on transgenic bacterial clones, while ignoring those that do not contain recombinant DNA.|$|E

30|$|As {{mentioned}} above, many DNA sensors {{have been}} defined to mediate recognition of exogenous DNAs. However, {{most of them}} rely on STING to initiate the production of type I IFNs. STING plays {{a central role in}} innate immune responses against <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Structural analysis shows that STING does not have the cavity to bind dsDNAs. Interestingly, STING has a high affinity for cyclic dinucleotides such as c-di-GMP or c-di-AMP. Cyclic dinucleotides are important secondary messenger molecules involved in signaling of bacteria. They are secreted into the cytosol of host during the invasion or replication of bacteria by multidrug efflux pumps (Whiteley et al., 2015). c-di-AMP secreted by L. monocytogenes activates the STING-IRF 3 pathway, leading to elevated type I interferon levels that hinder the clearance of intracellular bacteria (Auerbuch et al., 2004; O’Connell et al., 2004). It is curious that STING has such a high affinity for cyclic dinucleotides which seems irrelevant to exogenous DNA recognition.|$|R

50|$|Protofection is the {{transfection}} of <b>foreign</b> mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> {{into the}} mitochondria of all cells in a tissue to supplement or replace the native mitochondrial DNA already present.

25|$|Transformation is one {{of three}} {{processes}} for horizontal gene transfer, in which exogenous genetic material passes from bacterium to another, the other two being conjugation (transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct contact) and transduction (injection of <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA</b> by a bacteriophage virus into the host bacterium). In transformation, the genetic material passes through the intervening medium, and uptake is completely dependent on the recipient bacterium.|$|E
25|$|Molecular cloning takes {{advantage}} {{of the fact that the}} chemical structure of DNA is fundamentally the same in all living organisms. Therefore, if any segment of DNA from any organism is inserted into a DNA segment containing the molecular sequences required for DNA replication, and the resulting recombinant DNA is introduced into the organism from which the replication sequences were obtained, then the <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA</b> will be replicated along with the host cell's DNA in the transgenic organism.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for distinguishing self from <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA</b> during interference {{is built into}} the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage. RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.|$|E
40|$|Nano vectors {{are useful}} tools to deliver <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs,</b> oligonucleotides, and small interfering {{double-stranded}} RNAs (siRNAs) into mammalian cells with gene transfection and gene regulation. In such experiments {{we have found}} the liposomes with a biosurfacant mannosylerythriol lipid (MEL-A) are useful because of their high transfer efficiency, and their unique mechanism to transfer genes to target cells with the lowest toxicity. In the present review we will describe our current work, which {{may contribute to the}} great advance of gene transfer to target cells and gene regulations. For more than two decades, the liposome technologies have changed dramatically and various methods have been proposed in the fields of biochemistry, cell biology, biotechnology, and so on. In addition, they were towards to pharmaceutics and clinical applications. The liposome technologies were expected to use gene therapy, however, they have not reached a requested goal as of yet. In the present paper we would like to present an approach using a biosurfactant, MEL-A, which is a surface-active compound produced by microorganisms growing on water-insoluble substrates and increases efficiency in gene transfection.

40|$|Bacteria and archaea insert spacer {{sequences}} {{acquired from}} <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs</b> into CRISPR loci to generate immunological memory. The Escherichia coli Cas 1 –Cas 2 complex mediates spacer acquisition in vivo, but the molecular mechanism {{of this process}} is unknown. Here we show that the purified Cas 1 –Cas 2 complex integrates oligonucleotide DNA substrates into acceptor DNA to yield products similar to those generated by retroviral integrases and transposases. Cas 1 is the catalytic subunit, whereas Cas 2 substantially increases integration activity. Protospacer DNA with free 3 '-OH ends and supercoiled target DNA are required, and integration occurs preferentially at the ends of CRISPR repeats and at sequences adjacent to cruciform structures abutting A-T rich regions, similar to the CRISPR leader sequence. Our results demonstrate the Cas 1 –Cas 2 complex to be the minimal machinery that catalyzes spacer DNA acquisition and explain the significance of CRISPR repeats in providing sequence and structural specificity for Cas 1 –Cas 2 -mediated adaptive immunity.

40|$|Argonaute {{proteins}} (Ago) are core {{components of}} the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) that load and utilize small guide nucleic acids to silence mRNAs or cleave <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Despite the essential role of Ago in gene regulation and defense against virus, the molecular mechanism of guide-strand loading into Ago remains unclear. We explore such a mechanism in the bacterium Thermus thermophilus Ago (TtAgo), via a computational approach combining molecular dynamics, bias-exchange metadynamics, and protein-DNA docking. We show that apo TtAgo adopts multiple closed states that are unable to accommodate guide-DNA. Conformations able to accommodate the guide are {{beyond the reach of}} thermal fluctuations from the closed states. These results suggest an induced-fit dominant mechanism for guide-strand loading in TtAgo, drastically different from the two-step mechanism for human Ago 2 (hAgo 2) identified in our previous study. Such a difference between TtAgo and hAgo 2 is found to mainly originate from the distinct rigidity of their L 1 -PAZ hinge. Further comparison among known Ago structures from various species indicates that the L 1 -PAZ hinge may be flexible in general for prokaryotic Agos but rigid for eukaryotic Agos. © 2016 American Chemical Society...|$|R
25|$|A {{restriction}} enzyme is an enzyme that cuts double-stranded or single stranded DNA at specific recognition nucleotide sequences known as restriction sites.

25|$|Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to {{the same}} phage. The {{mechanism}} that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of E. coli. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer. This observation led to {{the hypothesis that the}} acquisition machinery slides along the <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA</b> after priming to find a new protospacer.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{selection}} for genomic imprinting requires genetic variation in a population. A hypothesis for {{the origin of}} this genetic variation states that the host-defense system responsible for silencing <b>foreign</b> <b>DNA</b> elements, such as genes of viral origin, mistakenly silenced genes whose silencing turned out to be beneficial for the organism. There appears to be an over-representation of retrotransposed genes, that is to say genes that are inserted into the genome by viruses, among imprinted genes. It has also been postulated that if the retrotransposed gene is inserted close to another imprinted gene, it may just acquire this imprint.|$|E

40|$|The {{mitochondrial}} genomes {{of normal}} fertile and male-sterile (Owen CMS) cytoplasms of sugar beet are highly rearranged relative {{to each other}} and dozens of inversional recombinations and other reshuffling events must be postulated to interconvert the two genomes. In this paper, a comparative analysis of the entire nucleotide sequences of the two genomes revealed that most of the inversional recombinations involved short repeats present at their endpoints. Attention was also focused on the origin of the Owen CMS-unique mtDNA regions, which occupy 13. 6 % of the Owen genome and are absent from the normal mtDNA. BLAST search was performed to assign the sequences, and as a result, 7. 6 % of the unique regions showed significant homology to previously determined mitochondrial sequences, 17. 9 % to nuclear DNA, 4. 6 % to mitochondrial episomes, and 0. 1 % to plastid DNA. Southern blot analysis revealed that additional sequences of nuclear origin may be included within the unique regions. We also found that the copies of many short repeat families are scattered throughout the unique regions. This suggests that, in addition to the incorporation of <b>foreign</b> <b>DNAs,</b> extensive duplication of short repetitive sequences and continued scrambling of mtDNA sequences may be implicated in the generation of the Owen CMS-unique regions...|$|R
