5|$|Due to the <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ratings agencies, European {{regulators}} obtained {{new powers}} to supervise ratings agencies. With {{the creation of}} the European Supervisory Authority in January 2011 the EU set up a whole range of new financial regulatory institutions, including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), which became the EU's single credit-ratings firm regulator. Credit-ratings companies have to comply with the new standards or will be denied operation on EU territory, says ESMA Chief Steven Maijoor.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the revolt}} was also fuelled by a general feeling of discontent and humiliation at the <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Angeloi, {{especially}} {{in terms of}} foreign policy. This much is evident from the— albeit embellished— account of the eyewitness Nicholas Mesarites, whereby John Komnenos's supporters proclaimed that henceforth everything would go well for Romania, that her enemies would be vanquished, and that the kings of all the earth would come to pay homage to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{emergency}} personnel {{responded to the}} crash site and helped save victims. Many of those who survived were severely injured and required months or years to physically recover. NTSB investigators looked at various factors {{that contributed to the}} crash. The <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flight crew were cited as the probable cause of the crash, but the weather, air traffic controller performances, and FAA traffic management were also cited as contributing to the events that led to the accident. This conclusion was controversial, with disagreement between investigators, passengers, and Avianca as to who was ultimately responsible. Eventually, the U.S. government joined with Avianca and settled to pay for the damages to the victims and their families. The crash was also portrayed in a variety of media.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the time length of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E

5|$|After Zhou and Lin {{negotiated}} Stalin's approval, Peng {{attended a}} conference in Beijing with Mao, Zhou, and Gao Gang on October 18, and they ordered {{the first wave of}} Chinese soldiers—in total more than 260,000 men—to cross into Korea on the night of October 19. On October 25 the PVA had its first confrontation with UN troops at Onjong and Unsan, and pushed the UN forces south of the Chongchon River by November 4 in the aftermath of First Phase Campaign. From November 24 to December 24, Peng directed 380,000 PVA troops to confront UN forces in the Second Phase Campaign, and he successfully recovered the area north of the thirty-eighth parallel. Despite his personal reservations, Peng then began an ambitious campaign to take the area south of the 38th parallel in order to fulfill Mao's political objectives for the war. About 230,000 Chinese soldiers crossed into South Korean territory on December 31 and captured Seoul as part of the Third Phase Campaign, but were forced to evacuate it with heavy losses on March 14, 1951 as the UN forces counterattacked during the course of Fourth Phase Campaign. Peng launched a final Fifth Phase Campaign from April 22 – June 10 to retake Seoul with 548,000 Chinese troops, but it failed, and the Korean War came to a standstill just above the 38th parallel. In the evaluation of Korean War historian Roy Edger Appleman, Peng's performances in the war were unremarkable in terms of military talents despite his aggressiveness and leadership skills. During the Cultural Revolution, Red Guards claimed that Peng's successful campaigns, from October–December 1950, were fought under Mao's direction, but that his unsuccessful campaigns, from January–May 1951, were organized by Peng against Mao's instructions. Modern scholars reject this interpretation, and credit Peng with both the successes and <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

40|$|Relationships to {{determine}} {{the probability that a}} weak link (WL) /strong link (SL) safety system will fail to function as intended in a fire environment are investigated. In the systems under study, <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WL system before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SL system is intended to render the overall system inoperational and thus prevent <b>the</b> possible occurrence <b>of</b> accidents with potentially serious consequences. Formal developments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> probability that the WL system fails to deactivate the overall system before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SL system (i. e., <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> loss of assured safety, PLOAS) are presented for several WWSL configurations: (i) one WL, one SL, (ii) multiple WLs, multiple SLs with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> any SL before any WL constituting <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safety system, (iii) multiple WLs, multiple SLs with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> all SLs before any WL constituting <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safety system, and (iv) multiple WLs, multiple SLs and multiple sublinks in each SL with <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> any sublink constituting <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> associated SL and <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> all SLs before <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> any WL constituting <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safety system. The indicated probabilities derive from time-dependent temperatures in the WL/SL system and variability (i. e., aleatory uncertainty) in the temperatures at which <b>the</b> individual components <b>of</b> this system fail and are formally defined as multidimensional integrals.
