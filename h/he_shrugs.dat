500|$|Although {{the film}} is not {{essentially}} experimental, at several points it undermines the narrative reality. James Bernardoni notes Allen's way of opening the film by facing the camera, which immediately intrudes upon audience involvement in the film. In one famous scene, Allen's character, in line {{to see a movie}} with Annie, listens to a man behind him deliver misinformed pontifications on the significance of Fellini's and Marshall McLuhan's work. Allen pulls McLuhan himself from just off camera to personally correct the man's errors. Later in the film, when we see Annie and Alvy in their first extended talk, [...] "mental subtitles" [...] convey to the audience the characters' nervous inner doubts. An animated scene—with artwork based on the comic strip Inside Woody Allen—depicts Alvy and Annie in the guise of the Wicked Queen from Snow White. Although Allen uses each of these techniques only once, the [...] "fourth wall" [...] is broken several other times when characters address the camera directly. In one, Alvy stops several passers-by to ask questions about love, and in another <b>he</b> <b>shrugs</b> off writing a happy ending to his relationship with Annie in his autobiographical first play as forgivable [...] "wish-fulfillment." [...] Allen chose to have Alvy break the fourth wall, he explained, [...] "because I felt many {{of the people in the}} audience had the same feelings and the same problems. I wanted to talk to them directly and confront them." ...|$|E

6000|$|They say no {{governor}} attends with keys [...] To {{offer his}} submission gracefully.

6000|$|MURRAY. My job {{had nothing}} to do with writing. To write--really write--yes, that's {{something}} worth trying for. That's what I've always meant to have a stab at. I've run across ideas enough for stories--that sounded good to me, anyway. (With a forced, laugh.) But--like everything else--I never got down to it. I started one or two--but--either I thought I didn't have the time or---- (<b>He</b> <b>shrugs</b> his shoulders.) ...|$|E

50|$|Thousands of corpses lay rotting in the fields, but <b>he</b> <b>shrugs</b> it off, {{as part of}} {{the cost}} of war (ln 53 - 54). Wilhelmine says it was a wicked thing, but he contradicts her, no, he says, it was a great victory.|$|E
