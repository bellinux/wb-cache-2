25|$|On 7 June 2009, the European Parliament {{elections}} gave Cohn-Bendit a {{major breakthrough}} in France. In spite of a conservative victory by Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP Party with 27.9% of the votes and an overall conservative victory all over Europe, Europe <b>Écologie,</b> the coalition founded by Cohn-Bendit, won over 16.28% of the votes, trailing the French Socialist Party led by Martine Aubry (16.48%) by only 0.2%. According to official French results, Cohn-Bendit's list thus became the third political force in France, even overtaking the Socialist Party in the Paris region, and, furthermore by adding the votes of an alternative green party also present in the election, giving greens a never yet experienced weight in French politics. His list featured Franco-Norwegian Magistrate Eva Joly, a specialist of anti-corruption struggles, and José Bové, a controversial trade unionist.|$|E

2500|$|In {{continental}} Europe, Georgescu and {{his work}} gained influence from the 1970s. When Georgescu delivered a lecture at the University of Geneva in Switzerland in 1974, he made a lasting impression on the young and newly graduated French historian and philosopher [...] The ensuing cooperation and friendship between the two resulted in the French translation of a selection of Georgescu's articles entitled Demain la décroissance: Entropie – <b>Écologie</b> – Économie ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy – Ecology – Economy'), published in 1979. [...] Similar to his involvement with the Club of Rome (see above), Georgescu's pointed and polemical article on Energy and Economic Myths came to {{play a crucial role}} in the dissemination of his views among the later followers of the degrowth movement. [...] In the 1980s, Georgescu met and befriended Catalan agricultural economist and historian of economic thought Juan Martínez-Alier, who would soon after become a driving force in the formation of both the International Society for Ecological Economics and the degrowth movement. [...] Since the degrowth movement formed in France and Italy in the early 2000s, leading French champion of the movement Serge Latouche has credited Georgescu for being a 'main theoretical source of degrowth.' Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist Mauro Bonaiuti has considered Georgescu's work to be 'one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective.' ...|$|E
