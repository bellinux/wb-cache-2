The contribution of the membrane potential and the transmembrane pH gradient varied depending on the pH of the growth medium. The differential rate of <b>dextransucrase</b> secretion was relatively constant at 1, 040 delta mU/delta mg (dry weight) when cells were grown at pH 6. 0 to 6. 7. Over this pH range, the internal pH was alkaline {{with respect to the}} external pH. When cells were grown at alkaline pH values, <b>dextransucrase</b> secretion was severely inhibited. This inhibition was accompanied by an inversion of the pH gradient as the internal pH became more acidic than the external pH.

Glucose and fructose support equivalent specific growth rates (0. 6 h- 1) under aerobic conditions, but glucose leads to a better biomass yield in anaerobiosis. Both sugars are phosphorylated by specific hexokinases and catabolized through the heterofermentative phosphoketolase pathway. During sucrose-grown cultures, a large fraction of sucrose is converted outside the cell by <b>dextransucrase</b> into dextran and fructose and does not support growth. The other fraction enters the cell, where it is phosphorylated by an inducible sucrose phosphorylase and converted to glucose- 6 -phosphate (G- 6 -P) by a constitutive phosphoglucomutase and to heterofermentative products (lactate, acetate, and ethanol). Sucrose supports a higher growth rate (0. 98 h- 1) than the monosaccharides. When fructose is not consumed simultaneously with G- 1 -P, the biomass yield relative to ATP is high (16. 8 mol of ATP. mol of sucrose- 1), and <b>dextransucrase</b> production is directly proportional to growth.

Based on the results a 2 -DE reference map and a corresponding protein database were constructed for further proteomic approaches on B. megaterium. For the first time it became possible to perform comparative proteomic analysis on B. megaterium in a batch culture grown on glucose with xylose induction for dextrasucrase production. No significant differences were observed in the expression changes of enzymes of the glycolysis and TCA cycle, indicating that <b>dextransucrase</b> production, which amounted to only 2 % of the entire protein production, did not impose notable metabolic or energetic burdens on the central carbon metabolic pathway of the cells. However, a short-term up-regulation of aspartate aminotransferase, an enzyme closely related to <b>dextransucrase</b> production, in the induced culture demonstrated the feasibility to use 2 -DE method for monitoring <b>dextransucrase</b> production. It was also observed that under the cultivation conditions used in this study B. megaterium tended to channel acetyl-CoA into pathways of polyhydroxybutyrate production. No expression increases were found with cytosolic chaperones such as GroEL and DnaK during <b>dextransucrase</b> production and secretion, whereas a strong up-regulation of the oligopeptide-binding protein OppA was observed in correlation with an increased secretion of <b>dextransucrase</b> into the culture medium. </p...|$|E
40|$|At the cut end of {{deteriorated}} {{sugar cane}} stalks, Leuconostocmesenteroides grows, secreting <b>dextransucrase</b> and formingdextran. When biocide is sprayed, bacteria {{will be killed}} butdextransucrase might still be active and forming dextran. In this experiment, {{it was found that}} when fermentation wasstopped (L. mesenteroi des were killed) this enzyme(dextransucrase) was still able to form high concentration ofdextran. The amount of dextran formed depended on the time offermentation. It also depended on the p H and temperature duringthe incubation which affect the activity and the stability ofdextransucrase. The higher the incubation temperature (20 - 30 °C),the more sensitive <b>dextransucrase</b> activity to the pH changes (PH 4. 6 - 5. 4). The highest <b>dextransucrase</b> stability during a 20 hincubation was found at pH 5, 4. The highest activity was foundat 30 °C for pH 5. 4 while at 25 °C the activity was only slightly 10 IVer than 30 °C...|$|E
30|$|<b>Dextransucrase</b> catalyzes the {{synthesis}} of dextran from sucrose and transfers a glucose unit to other carbohydrates or phenolic compounds via glycosidic linkages (Moon et al. 2006; Robyt et al. 2008). The enzymatic transglycosylation by <b>dextransucrase</b> from Leuconostoc mesenteroides has been previously used for the modification of various bioactive compounds to improve their function or physical stability (Moon et al. 2007 a; Seo et al. 2009). Our previous study showed that transglycosylated hydroquinone, a potential skin-whitening agent, inhibited tyrosinase or reduced melanin synthesis {{to a greater extent}} than hydroquinone (Kim et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|The <b>dextransucrase</b> (EC 2. 4. 1. 5) {{activity}} from cell-free culture supernatants of Streptococcus mutans strain 6715 has been purified approximately 1, 500 -fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and isoelectric focusing. The enzyme was eluted {{as a single}} peak of {{activity from}} hydroxylapatite, and isoelectric focusing of the resulting preparation gave a single band of <b>dextransucrase</b> activity which focused at a pH of 4. 0. The final enzyme preparation contained two distinct, enzymatically active proteins as judged by assay in situ after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One of the proteins represented 90 % of the total <b>dextransucrase</b> activity and 53 % of the total protein. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated by gel filtration to be 94, 000. The temperature optimum of the enzyme was broad (34 to 42 C) and its pH range was rather narrow, with optimal activity at pH 5. 5. The Km for sucrose was 3 mM, and fructose competitively inhibited the enzyme reaction with a Ki of 27 mM...|$|E
40|$|Non-digestible {{oligosaccharides}} possess important physicochemical {{and physiological}} properties. They have gained great attention {{because of their}} potential prebiotic properties. The oligosaccharides have wide food industrial applications as dietary fibers, sweeteners, humectants, and possible weight controlling agents. In this thesis, cloned Weissella confusa VTT E- 90392 <b>dextransucrase</b> was used to catalyze the synthesis of oligosaccharides (acceptor products) by acceptor reaction, when sucrose was the glucosyl unit donor. Maltose acceptor reaction was selected to analyze {{the effects of the}} concentrations of sucrose and maltose, as well as the dosages of <b>dextransucrase</b> on maltose acceptor products. Other acceptor reactions were also evaluated, with primary lactose and cellobiose acceptor products being purified and partially characterized by MS/MS. Concentrations of sucrose and maltose, as well as their interactions were the most important factors regarding isomalto-oligosaccharides production. The production of overall oligosaccharides could be increased by increasing sucrose and maltose concentrations. Lactose, cellobiose, other disaccharides and trisaccharides could be acceptors for W. consufa <b>dextransucrase.</b> In combination with the structures from previous publications, 2 -a-Dglucopyranosyl-cellobiose and 2 -a-D-glucopyranosyl-lactose were probably the primary products for cellobiose and lactose, although one trisaccharide synthesized by lactose acceptor reaction remains unknown. In order to verify the characterization, NMR spectroscopic analysis is needed for further study. In conclusion, W. consufa <b>dextransucrase</b> is capable of catalyzing oligosaccharides synthesis, and acceptor reactions would be promising methods in producing prebiotic oligosaccharides...|$|E
40|$|Weissella confusa and Weissella cibaria {{isolated}} from wheat sourdoughs produce, from sucrose, linear dextrans {{due to a}} single soluble <b>dextransucrase.</b> In this study, the first complete gene sequence encoding <b>dextransucrase</b> from a W. confusa strain (LBAE C 39 - 2) along with the one from a W. cibaria strain (LBAE K 39) were reported. Corresponding gene cloning was achieved using specific primers designed {{on the basis of}} the draft genome sequence of these species. Deduced amino acid sequence of W. confusa and W. cibaria <b>dextransucrase</b> revealed common structural features of the glycoside hydrolase family 70. Notably, the regions located in the vicinity of the catalytic triad (D, E, D) are highly conserved. However, comparison analysis also revealed that Weissella dextransucrases form a distinct phylogenetic group within glucansucrases of other lactic acid bacteria. We then cloned the W. confusa C 39 - 2 <b>dextransucrase</b> gene and successfully expressed the mature corresponding enzyme in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme rDSRC 39 - 2 catalyzed dextran synthesis from sucrose with a K (m) of 8. 6 mM and a V (max) of 20 mu mol/mg/min. According to H- 1 and C- 13 NMR analysis, the polymer is a linear class 1 dextran with 97. 2 % alpha-(1 -> 6) linkages and 2. 8 % alpha-(1 -> 3) branch linkages, similar to the one produced by W. confusa C 39 - 2 strain. The enzyme exhibited optimum catalytic activity for temperatures ranging from 35 to 40 A degrees C and a pH of 5. 4 in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer. This novel <b>dextransucrase</b> is responsible for production of dextran with predominant alpha-(1 -> 6) linkages that could find applications as food hydrocolloids...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between Streptococcus mutans <b>dextransucrase</b> (EC 2. 4. 1. 5) and high-molecular-weight dextran was studied {{in both the}} presence and absence of substrate sucrose. Equivalent weight-percent solutions of primer dextrans that differed 200 -fold in molecular weight {{were found to be}} equally efficient in priming new dextran synthesis. Sodium borohydride reduction of dextran had no effect on its priming ability. These results suggest that dextran synthesis proceeds by addition of glucosyl residues to nonreducing termini of primer dextrans and that several enzyme molecules simultaneously bind to single high-molecular-weight dextran molecules. Kinetic data suggested that <b>dextransucrase</b> contains only one dextran binding site per enzyme molecule. The nature of the commonly observed highly aggregated state of <b>dextransucrase</b> was also studied. Two types of enzyme aggregates were distinguished: (i) oligomeric enzyme aggregates that formed in the absence of dextran and were dissociated by 1 M KCl; and (ii) dextran-induced enzyme aggregates that were stable to 3 M salt. Oligomeric enzyme aggregates were obtained from supernatants of fructose-grown cultures, whereas dextran-induced enzyme aggregates appeared to be present in glucose-grown cultures. The molecular weight of the smallest species of dextran-free detransucrase observed in solutions of 1 M KCl was estimated to be 40, 000 by gel column chromatography. Addition of dextran to primer-dependent <b>dextransucrase</b> resulted in formation of complexes that were stable in CsCl density gradients and exhibited a buoyant density of 1. 382 g/cm 3 as compared with a buoyant density of 1. 302 g/cm 3 exhibited by <b>dextransucrase.</b> The enzyme-dextran complexes observed in CsCl density gradients contained about 25 % dextran. This corresponded to 150 enzyme molecules (molecular weight, 40, 000) per dextran molecule (molecular weight, 2 X 10 (6)). The implication of these results to the mechanism of sucrose- and dextran-induced aggregation of S. mutans is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} the {{literature}} of work carried out on <b>dextransucrase</b> production, purification, immobilization and reactions has been carried out. A brief review has also been made of the literature concerning general enzyme biotechnology and fermentation technology. Fed-batch fermentation of the bacteria Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B 512 (F) to produce <b>dextransucrase</b> has formed the major part of this research. Aerobic and anaerobic fermentations have been studied using a 16 litre New Brunswick fermenter which has a 3 - 12 litre working volume. The initial volume of broth used in the studies was 6 litres. The results of the fed-batch fermentations showed {{for the first time that}} yields of <b>dextransucrase</b> are much higher under the anaerobic conditions than during the aerobic fermentations. <b>Dextransucrase</b> containing 300 - 350 DSU/cm 3 of enzyme activity has been obtained during the aerobic fermentations, while in the anaerobic fermentations, enzyme yields containing 450 - 500 DSU/cm 3 have been obtained routinely. The type of yeast extract used in the fermentation medium has been found to have significant effects on enzyme yield. Of the different types studied, the Gistex Standard was found to be the type that favoured the highest enzyme production. Studies have also been carried out on the effect of agitation rate and antifoam on the enzyme production during the anaerobic experiments. Agitation rates of up to 600 rpm were found not to affect the enzyme yield, however, the presence of antifoam in the medium led to a significant reduction in enzyme activity (less than 300 DSU/cm 3). Scale-up of the anaerobic fermentations has been performed at up to the 1000 litre level with enzyme yields containing more than 400 DSU/cm 3 of activity being produced. Some of the enzyme produced at this scale was used for the first time to produce dextran on an industrial scale via the enzyme route, with up to 99 % conversion of sucrose to dextran being obtained. An attempt has been made at continuous <b>dextransucrase</b> production. Cell washout was observed to occur at dilution rates of greater than 0. 4 h- 1. <b>Dextransucrase</b> containing up to 25 DSU/cm 3 /h has been produced continuously...|$|E
40|$|The {{available}} literature concerning <b>dextransucrase</b> and dextran {{production and}} purification has been reviewed {{along with the}} reaction mechanisms of the enzyme. A discussion of basic fermentation theory is included, together with {{a brief description of}} bioreactor hydrodynamics and general biotechnology. The various fermenters used in this research work are described in detail, along with the various experimental techniques employed. The micro-organism Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B 512 (F) secretes <b>dextransucrase</b> in the presence of an inducer, sucrose, this being the only known inducer of the enzyme. <b>Dextransucrase</b> is a growth related product and a series of fed-batch fermentations have been carried out to extend the exponential growth phase of the organism. These experiments were carried out {{in a number of different}} sized vessels, ranging in size from 2. 5 to 1, 000 litres. Using a 16 litre vessel, <b>dextransucrase</b> activities in excess of 450 DSU/cm 3 (21. 67 U/cm 3) have been obtained under non-aerated conditions. It has also been possible to achieve 442 DSU/cm 3 (21. 28 U/cm 3) using the 1, 000 litre vessel, although this has not been done consistently. A 1 litre and a 2. 5 litre vessel were used for the continuous fermentations of <b>dextransucrase.</b> The 2. 5 litre vessel was a very sophisticated MBR MiniBioreactor and was used for the majority of continuous fermentations carried out. An enzyme activity of approximately 108 DSU/cm 3 (5. 20 U/cm 3) was achieved at a dilution rate of 0. 50 h- 1, which corresponds to the maximum growth rate of the cells under the process conditions. A number of continuous fermentations were operated for prolonged periods of time, with experimental run-times of up to 389 h being recorded without any incidence of contamination. The phenomenon of enzyme enhancement on hold-up of up to 100 % was also noted during these fermentations, with <b>dextransucrase</b> of activity 89. 7 DSU/cm 3 (4. 32 U/cm 3) being boosted to 155. 7 DSU/cm 3 (7. 50 U/cm 3) following 24 hours of hold-up. These findings support the recommendation of a second reactor being placed in series with the existing vessel...|$|E
