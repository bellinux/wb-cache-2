50|$|Under Alexander, the St James's Theatre {{was said}} to be modern in outlook and attire. The imaginative fancy of Mr. Walter Crane had created designs for the {{decoration}} of the walls in the foyer. They were covered with <b>embossed</b> <b>paper</b> of green and gold. On the one side a curiously carved mantelpiece in walnut, was surmounted by a picture of Venus emerging from a shell, painted by Mr. J. Macbeth. While on the other side sat the ticket box, having all the appearance of an elegant cabinet, with antique clock and choice 'blue and white' as ornaments. On the floor were spread rich and costly rugs and Indian carpets. A flight of stairs made of Siena marble, covered with Indian carpet, and having brass standards {{on either side of the}} banisters, conducted one to the crush-room. Again, fancifully furnished, draped with printed tapestry, and resplendent with mirrors. From the scheme and the designers, it appears that Oscar Wilde must have advised on the house decoration.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{the first}} mass-{{produced}} Valentines of <b>embossed</b> <b>paper</b> lace were produced and sold shortly after 1847 by Esther Howland (1828-1904) of Worcester, Massachusetts.

Intrigued {{with the idea of}} making similar Valentines, Howland began her business by importing paper lace and floral decorations from England. A writer in Graham's American Monthly observed in 1849, [...] "Saint Valentine's Day ... is becoming, nay it has become, a national holyday." [...] The English practice of sending Valentine's cards was established enough to feature as a plot device in Elizabeth Gaskell's Mr. Harrison's Confessions (1851): [...] "I burst in with my explanations: 'The valentine I know nothing about.'

5000|$|In the law, a seal {{affixed to}} a {{contract}} or other legal instrument has had special legal significance at various times in the jurisdictions that recognise it. In the courts of common law jurisdictions, a contract which was sealed ("made under seal") was treated differently from other written contracts (which were [...] "made under hand"), although this practice gradually fell out of favour {{in most of these}} jurisdictions in the 19th and early 20th century. The legal term seal arises from the wax seal used throughout history for authentication (among other purposes). [...] Originally, only a wax seal was accepted as a seal by the courts, but by the 19th century many jurisdictions had relaxed the definition to include an impression in the paper on which the instrument was printed, an <b>embossed</b> <b>paper</b> wafer affixed to an instrument, a scroll made with a pen, or the printed words [...] "Seal" [...] or [...] "L.S." [...] (standing for the Latin term locus sigilli meaning [...] "place of the seal"). [...] Notwithstanding their reduced significance, seals are still used on contracts, usually in the impression on paper form.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} {{requirements}} of formality in English law generally shows a gradual shift towards {{fewer and fewer}} instances of transaction needing form, as technology and recording of agreements has become more advanced. Originally a contract which was sealed ("made under seal", using a wax seal) was treated differently from other written contracts (which were [...] "made under hand"). It was predominantly a mark of authentication. A document that was [...] "signed, sealed and delivered" [...] was taken as secure. Originally, only a wax seal was accepted as a seal by the courts, but by the 19th century many jurisdictions had relaxed the definition to include an impression in the paper on which the instrument was printed, an <b>embossed</b> <b>paper</b> wafer affixed to an instrument, a scroll made with a pen, or the printed words [...] "Seal" [...] or [...] "L.S." [...] (standing for the Latin term locus sigilli meaning [...] "place of the seal"). If a seal was in place, common law courts regarded it as removing the need for consideration to support the contract. It raised, at least, a rebuttable presumption of consideration.|$|E
50|$|Paralakhemundi is {{also known}} for crafts like the Jaikhadi bag, cane and bamboo work. The Chitrakar Sahi (Artist's Street) {{is famous for its}} clay, stone sculptures and water paintings. The chitrakar or {{painters}} could do wonders with their paint work. Some of the paint works include the Sculptures of Idols, Wall Painting, Fabric Painting, Painted Playing Cards, Paper Masks, <b>Embossed</b> <b>Paper</b> Idols and Souvenirs. Due to fading demand and economic considerations, now only a few artists are seen to practice the family tradition.The town celebrates almost all festivities, all round the year. The Jagannath Ratha Yatra being the most revered one. The Jagannath Rath Yatra of Paralakhemundi is second only to the famous Puri festival. The three Idols of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balbhadra and Lord Subhadra are quite huge in size and are adorable. The Yatra or Car Festival, was patronized by the Gajapati kings. In the initial years the car festival would follow the traditions of puri and had three separate cars or rathas. However it became one car till 2012. In that year the concept of three cars was again implemented and since then, the three idols enjoy the festivities for nine days on their own cars.The believers throng the Jagannath Temple everyday and its worth watching the bhajan following the evening aarati/ceremonial rituals.Dasahara, Gamhapurnima/Raksha Bandhan, Holi, Gajalakshmi Puja, Ganesh Puja, Kali Puja, Makar Sankranthi and Thakurani Yatra are major Hindu festivals observed in the town. Christmas and Ramzan are also celebrated very beautifully in the town. Traditionally the Thakurani yatra is conducted periodically for the local area Goddess (Grama Devi), a ritual that continues for about a week. During the Thakurani Yatra, the residents make caricatures, children participate in fancy dresses to make fun and to spread awareness regarding current issues. During evening, cultural programs like drama, orchestra and Bhuta Keli (dramatised romance of Lord Krishna and his Consort Radha maa) are staged. Gaja Muhaan is one more local traditional festivity. This is celebrated after the harvest season is over. The fresh paddy is converted into rice flakes, which are then made into a conical shape by using jaggery as the binding material. Huge cones of the rice flakes are prepared and are offered to the local resident Goddess. The Rice Flake Cone (Gaja Muhaan) is then taken out for procession around the city with orchestra and band. The believers carry these huge rice flake cones on their heads and dance to the tunes of the band to appease the Goddess. The scene is to be seen to be believed.|$|E

40|$|When {{teaching}} {{students with visual impairments}} educators generally rely on tactile tools to depict visual mathematical topics. Tactile media, such as <b>embossed</b> <b>paper</b> and simple manipulable materials, are typically used to convey graphical information. Although these tools are easy to use and relatively inexpensive, they are solely tactile and are not modifiable.

This study aims {{to bridge the gap between}} easy-to-use tactile tools and dynamic, interactive technologies in order to facilitate the haptic learning of mathematical concepts. We developed an haptic assistive device using a Tanvas electrostatic touchscreen that provides the user with multimodal (haptic, auditory, and visual) output. Three methodological steps comprise this research: 1) a systematic literature review of the state of the art in the design and testing of tactile and haptic assistive devices, 2) a user-centered system design, and 3) testing of the system’s effectiveness via a usability study.
