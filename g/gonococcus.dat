40|$|In vivo, <b>gonococci</b> {{encounter}} {{a myriad of}} conditions not present in vitro. At some stages of infection and disease, <b>gonococci</b> may grow anaerobically, probably by using sodium nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor. Also, <b>gonococci</b> sialylate their lipooligosaccharide (LOS) in vivo, by using low concentrations of cytidine 5 '-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid (CMP-NANA) present in host tissue. This sialylation {{is responsible for the}} acquired resistance of <b>gonococci</b> to both normal and immune human serum. Given that <b>gonococci</b> grown in the absence of oxygen or in the presence of CMP-NANA probably more closely resemble <b>gonococci</b> grown inside a human host, we studied the serum resistance of <b>gonococci</b> cultivated under these conditions. In the absence of CMP-NANA, anaerobically grown (anaerobic) <b>gonococci</b> were somewhat less sensitive to serum killing than were aerobically grown (aerobic) <b>gonococci.</b> However, anaerobic <b>gonococci</b> grown with 6 micrograms of CMP-NANA per ml exhibited almost complete serum resistance, while aerobic <b>gonococci</b> required 16 -fold-higher CMP-NANA concentrations to achieve significant serum resistance. Anaerobic <b>gonococci</b> incubated in CMP-NANA converted to serum resistance two to three times faster than did similarly treated aerobic <b>gonococci</b> and incorporated up to six times as much sialic acid into their LOS. <b>Gonococci</b> can express several different LOS molecules. Anaerobic <b>gonococci</b> expressed the LOS molecule that acts as an acceptor for sialic acid from CMP-NANA in greater quantity than aerobic <b>gonococci</b> did. Finally, Triton X- 100 extracts of anaerobic <b>gonococci</b> contained about four times more sialyltransferase activity than did extracts of aerobic <b>gonococci.</b> Sialyltransferase activity in these extracts was not inhibited by oxygen or enhanced by anaerobiosis. These data indicate that anaerobic conditions lead to altered LOS biosynthesis and to induction of sialyltransferase activity in <b>gonococci.</b> In vivo, where decreased oxygen levels and relevant concentrations of CMP-NANA are found, <b>gonococci</b> could readily become resistant to killing by normal and immune human serum...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gonococci</b> {{are capable}} of {{attaching}} {{to the surface of}} polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). In this location they resist phagocytosis and are not killed by PMN. To delineate the factors involved in the survival of these <b>gonococci,</b> we investigated the interaction of virulent <b>gonococci,</b> which adhere to cells and resist phagocytosis, and avirulent <b>gonococci,</b> which are phagocytized and killed by PMN. In the presence of serum, both virulent and avirulent <b>gonococci</b> associate equally well with PMN and stimulate increases in oxidative metabolism. In the absence of serum virulent <b>gonococci</b> attached to PMN and stimulated PMN oxidative metabolism {{to a greater extent than}} avirulent <b>gonococci</b> which did not attach to PMN (P = 0. 0009). Therefore, the survival of virulent <b>gonococci</b> attached to the PMN surface is not a result of failure to activate oxidative and bactericidal mechanisms. Both virulent and avirulent <b>gonococci</b> stimulated equivalent PMN specific granule release as measured by the appearance of lactoferrin in the media. Phagocytosis of avirulent <b>gonococci</b> stimulated significantly greater beta-glucuronidase release (P = 0. 01) and myeloperoxidase-mediated iodination of protein (P = 0. 001) by PMN than attachment of virulent <b>gonococci.</b> In the absence of serum neither type of <b>gonococci</b> stimulated beta-glocuronidase release or protein iodination by PMN. Thus, virulent <b>gonococci</b> fail to stimulate primary granule release by PMN. To further assess the role of attachment versus ingestion on the survival of <b>gonococci,</b> PMN were treated with cytochalasin B to block ingestion. Cytochalasin B-treated PMN were unable to kill either virulent or avirulent <b>gonococci</b> despite normal degranulation stimulated by the latter. The failure of PMN to kill surface-attached <b>gonococci</b> appears to be a consequence of the failure of PMN to enclose the virulent <b>gonococci</b> within a phagosome. The phagocytic vacuole thus plays a critical role in normal PMN bactericidal activity by providing a closed space in which the proper concentration of substances may be achieved to generate microbicidal activity...|$|R

In the absence of serum, <b>gonococci</b> possessing opacity-associated (Opa, formerly PII) outer membrane proteins adhere to, stimulate, and are phagocytically killed by human neutrophils. <b>Gonococci</b> lacking Opa proteins demonstrate none of these activities. We investigated whether the PAN proteins, or any other characteristics of anaerobic <b>gonococci,</b> altered the ability of nonpiliated, Opa+ or Opa- <b>gonococci</b> to adhere to, stimulate, or be phagocytically killed by neutrophils. The expression of Opa 4 by strain F 62, as determined by its relative mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, appeared to be unaltered by anaerobic growth, as seen previously (V. L. Clark, L. A. Campbell, D. A. Palermo, T. M. Evans, and K. W. Klimpel, Infect Immun. 55 : 1359 - 1364, 1987). Anaerobic and aerobic Opa+ <b>gonococci</b> adhered to and stimulated neutrophils to the same extent. Similarly, anaerobic and aerobic Opa- <b>gonococci</b> adhered to and stimulated neutrophils equally poorly. Finally, anaerobic and aerobic Opa+ <b>gonococci</b> were equally sensitive to phagocytic killing by neutrophils, while anaerobic and aerobic Opa- <b>gonococci</b> were equally resistant to killing. Thus, the role of Opa proteins in mediating the interactions of <b>gonococci</b> with human neutrophils appears unaltered by anaerobic growth, and the PAN proteins, or other cryptic properties of anaerobic <b>gonococci,</b> do not seem to modulate or mediate these phenomena...|$|R
40|$|The obligate human {{pathogen}} Neisseria gonorrhoeae (<b>gonococci)</b> causes the {{sexually transmitted disease}} gonorrhea. Interactions between <b>gonococci</b> and human cervical epithelial cells that promote bacterial invasion and post-invasion survival were examined. The data showed that <b>gonococci</b> activated MAPK signaling in cervical epithelial cells prior to invasion. <b>Gonococci</b> triggered prolonged ERK phosphorylation (possibly through EGFR signaling), which could facilitate gonococcal invasion. Furthermore, <b>gonococci</b> expressing lacto- N -neotetraose LOS decreased JNK activation and elicited lower IL- 8 production from host cells compared to variants expressing lactosyl LOS. I propose that <b>gonococci</b> can manipulate MAPK signaling to facilitate invasion into cervical epithelial cells and to evade the innate immune response. To investigate gonococcal invasion, I expressed Î²-lactamase on the outer membrane of gonococcal strain FA 1090 to generate the reporter strain FA 1090 psi(bla-iga'). Utilizing a Î²-lactamase reporter assay, I demonstrated that FA 1090 psi(bla-iga') only invaded a subpopulation of cervical epithelial cells. Nonviable FA 1090 psi(bla-iga') did not invade host cells and failed to recruit F-actin to sites of adherence. Viable <b>gonococci</b> required pili expression but not Opa expression to invade susceptible host cells. These data suggest that viable <b>gonococci</b> elicit invasion-promoting interactions with host cells not triggered by nonviable <b>gonococci.</b> Finally, the data demonstrated that <b>gonococci</b> realize different intracellular fates after entry into cervical epithelial cells. I developed a tannic acid survival assay to show that intracellular <b>gonococci</b> survived within host cells. Intracellular survival did not require catalase or the NfsB nitrogen reductase. A subpopulation of <b>gonococci</b> could escape from cells back into the extracellular milieu. <b>Gonococci</b> utilized an exocytosis pathway to escape after invasion that was blocked by treating cells with tannic acid, but not cytoskeletal inhibitors. I propose a working scenario whereby <b>gonococci</b> undergo cycles of invasion into and escape from a susceptible subpopulation of cervical epithelial cells. <b>Gonococci</b> that survive within host cells may represent bacteria that progress into deeper host tissues to disseminate to secondary sites. Escaping <b>gonococci</b> could invade into other host cells and are well-positioned for transmission to another host. <b>Gonococci</b> interact with the cervical epithelium through invasion, intracellular survival, and escape to establish bacterial persistence in the female host...|$|R

40|$|Serum-sensitive {{strains of}} Neisseria gonorrhoeae were {{incubated}} with suspensions of normal or {{chronic granulomatous disease}} human neutrophils in the absence or presence of fresh or heat-inactivated human serum; phagocytosis, gonococcal viability, and chemiluminescence were measured. Nonpiliated opaque or transparent <b>gonococci</b> (colony types 3 and 4, respectively) were used for phagocytic bactericidal assays. In the presence of 2. 0 % fresh human serum, normal neutrophils killed > 90 % of types 3 and 4 <b>gonococci</b> by 135 min. Serum alone at this concentration was not bactericidal. In the absence of serum, type 4 <b>gonococci</b> were not killed, whereas type 3 <b>gonococci</b> were killed {{to the same degree}} as in the presence of serum. Interestingly, heat-inactivated normal serum slightly inhibited phagocytic killing of type 3 <b>gonococci.</b> Results almost identical to those above were obtained when 5 % fresh human serum deficient in complement component 7 was substituted for 2 % normal autologous serum. This indicated that the later components of complement were not involved in the observed results. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the intracellular killing of the <b>gonococci,</b> we used neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease. These neutrophils are deficient in an activable NADPH oxidase and do not produce bactericidal oxygen products upon phagocytic stimulation. Neutrophils from two unrelated boys with chronic granulomatous disease killed type 3 and 4 <b>gonococci</b> to the same degree as did normal neutrophils. As with normal neutrophils, serum was needed for killing type 4 organisms. As expected, neutrophils from these patients showed absolutely no increased chemiluminescence in the presence of type 3 or 4 <b>gonococci,</b> with or without serum. The effects of serum on gonococcus-induced chemiluminescence by normal neutrophils was also investigated. For these studies, in addition to type 3 and 4 <b>gonococci,</b> we also used transparent colony types of lightly (type 1) and heavily (type 2) piliated organisms. Chemiluminescence induced by type 1, 2, or 3 <b>gonococci</b> (i. e., <b>gonococci</b> possessing either pili or opacity-associated proteins, but not both) was augmented only slightly by serum and then only at low ratios of <b>gonococci</b> to neutrophils. On the other hand, chemiluminescence induced by type 4 <b>gonococci</b> (i. e., <b>gonococci</b> possessing neither pili nor opacity-associated proteins) was substantially increased in the presence of serum. Stimulation of chemiluminescence by type 1, 2, 3, or 4 <b>gonococci</b> was dose dependent in the absence or presence of serum. Heat-killed type 3 <b>gonococci</b> induced chemiluminescence to the same degree as did viable organisms. Since the <b>gonococci</b> used in this research was strongly catalase positive, as are <b>gonococci</b> in general, and since it was killed by chronic granulomatous disease neutrophils, the results indicate that <b>gonococci</b> can be effectively killed within neutrophils, i. e., within phagolysosomes, by nonoxidative bactericidal mechanisms. Whereas type 3 <b>gonococci</b> were phagocytized and killed by neutrophils equally well with or without serum, serum was obligatory for phagocytic killing of type 4 <b>gonococci,</b> i. e., <b>gonococci</b> lacking opacity-associated proteins. In addition, either pili or opacity-associated proteins were apparently necessary for maximal stimulation of neutrophil chemiluminescence.
