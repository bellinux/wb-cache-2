Some electro-mechanical controllers are still in use (New York City still had 4,800 as of 1998, though the number is lower now due to the prevalence of the signal controller boxes). However, modern traffic controllers are solid state. The cabinet typically contains a power panel, to distribute electrical power in the cabinet; a detector <b>interface</b> <b>panel,</b> to connect to loop detectors and other detectors; detector amplifiers; the controller itself; a conflict monitor unit; flash transfer relays; a police panel, to allow the police to disable the signal; and other components.|$|E

50|$|The Applixware Words module waned in {{popularity}} among Linux users when full-featured open-source word processors, such as OpenOffice.org and AbiWord, became available. Although Applixware was less {{powerful than the}} newer office packages, its interface design was arguably superior. While OpenOffice.org {{tried to make the}} user experience to be similar to that of Microsoft Office, Applixware was different. Almost no user <b>interface</b> <b>panel</b> was implemented as a modal window. All control elements could be opened by the user and if a control panel was not applicable in the current context, it just made all its widgets inactive. Although a non-modal interface design significantly increases the complexity of the program, it also makes the GUI to feel more responsive to the user. In addition, Applixware's charting capabilities markably surpassed that of the Charts in OpenOffice.org 1.x and 2.x versions. Some graphics features were also much more advanced than what the Draw module in OpenOffice.org is capable of. Another feature of Applixware was its small resource requirements; it ran in a satisfactory manner even on low-end machines of the time.|$|E

40|$|In today's {{large-scale}} computer simulations, {{the need}} has arisen {{to provide the}} user with an informed means of navigating a virtual world, such as with hypermedia. While previous work has been conducted {{in the area of}} hypermedia in a small-scale, single-user virtual world simulation, there has been no design and implementation of hypermedia capability into a large-scale, real-time networked simulation, such as the NPSNET project. The method chosen for this thesis was to expand upon the Hyper-NPSNET project, a small-scale virtual world simulation system with hypermedia capability, to provide this capability to NPSNET. Access to video, audio, graphical, and textual data is provided via 'anchors' placed throughout the world. Additionally, a GUI <b>interface</b> <b>panel</b> was developed which allows the user to navigate throughout the virtual world, and access information stored in an associated database. The <b>interface</b> <b>panel</b> allows the user to view specific information from anchors within the 3 D world. Additional utility is provided for authoring of new anchors in the world. The result of this thesis is that NPSNET now possesses a full hypermedia capability, controllable via a system <b>interface</b> <b>panel.</b> A better overall training environment is provided because users can now readily access database information while traversing this large-scale, multi-user virtual simulation.

40|$|Abstract: A grid {{energy storage}} system for photo voltaic (PV) {{applications}} contains three different power sources i. e., PV array, battery storage system and the grid. It is advisable to isolate these three different sources to ensure the equipment safety. The configuration proposed in this paper provides complete isolation between the three sources. A Power Balancing Control (PBC) method for this configuration is proposed to operate the system in three different modes of operation. Control of a dual active bridge (DAB) -based battery charger which provides a galvanic isolation between batteries and other sources is explained briefly. Various modes of operation of a grid {{energy storage system}} are also presented in this paper. Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulation is carried out to check {{the performance of the}} system and the PBC algorithm.

40|$|Nearly all {{significant}} {{developments in}} the marine/maritime area originate from Europe, a true maritime continent. Consequently, the Marine/Maritime Science and Research Communities are among the world leaders in their respective fields, disciplines and sectors. To maintain its leadership and competitiveness, Europe must take advantage of new market opportunities and address the global challenges by means of focused RDI. Unfortunately the complexity and intricacy of the marine/maritime area has lead to widespread fragmentation of research efforts and actors. It is therefore important to identify and establish appropriate mechanisms to strengthen the cross-sectoral and interdisciplinary cooperation, key ferment for innovation, between both research communities. To this effect, the ETP WATERBORNE and the informal Post Aberdeen Marine Interest Group came together as they would benefit from an appropriate and efficient cooperation framework to achieve the Lisbon agenda in a sustainable way. To tackle global issues such as Climate Change and Competitiveness, the different interests and elements affecting such matters need to be integrated in a consistent way. Building on the EU 2 ̆ 7 s Maritime Policy and ERA, the key challenge for the EU Policies is to enable sustainable economic expansion, {{taking into account the}} environmental, economical and social aspects in a holistic way. This project will initiate the process for this holistic approach by identifying and generating a framework of cooperation for the two communities.

For many common tasks, users first need to locate a Web site(s) containing needed information from among the estimated 4 trillion existing web pages. The most common method used to search for information is the search engine. However, even sophisticated users often have difficulty navigating through the complexity of search engine interfaces. Designing more effective and efficient search engines is contingent upon a significant improvement in the search user <b>interface.</b> <b>PANEL</b> SUMMARY There are several purposes for using the Web, including publishing information in an electronic format, retrieving information, conducting and facilitating commerce, and others. The search engine has become the most common method used to search for information over the Internet, with over half of web users using Internet search engines each week and sixty percent searching for over an hour each week. In one study, only 18 % of users reported that they could fmd what they are looking for on the web. Also, 67 % said they were frustrated when searching. In Sullivan (2000), 2 1 % of the respondents reported being able to find {{what they were looking for}} every time, and only 60 % reported finding the relevant information most of the time. Aurelio (2000) reported that users need better search interface usability. In that study, users specifically requested help identifying command rules, narrowing searches, and categorizing results. Clearly, work is needed to improve search engine design. The human factors contributions to search engine design can be divided into at least three categories: input design, output design, and support for iterative search...|$|E

The need for such a management system is supported by the facts that both the development effort and the extent of machine-specific knowledge needed to successfully implement an arbitrary graphical simulation is significant. It is the aim of the Graphical Simulation Management System (GSMS) to reduce these burdens and place the power of 3 D simulation within easy reach. We have presented several examples of dynamical simulations in which the power and diversity of the management system is demonstrated...|$|R
