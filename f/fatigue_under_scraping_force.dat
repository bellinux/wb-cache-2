40|$|To {{improve the}} {{coefficient}} of performance (COP) in air-conditioning systems, the liquid-solid phase change temperature of the cold energy storage material should be approximately 10 Â Â°C. Moreover, a thermal storage material that forms a slurry can maintain large heat capacity for the working fluids. Solids that adhere to the heat transfer surface form a thermal resistance layer and significantly reduce the cooling storage rate; therefore, {{it is important to}} avoid adhesion of a thick solid layer on the surface to realize efficient energy storage. Tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) clathrate hydrate possesses the qualities of an efficient cold storage material. Therefore, it was used to examine the force required to remove solid phase from the heat transfer surface for a harvest-type cooling unit. The effects of TBAB concentration and surface properties on the <b>scraping</b> <b>force</b> required to remove adhered TBAB hydrate solid from the heat transfer surface were examined experimentally and comprehensively.

The present publication is primarily a survey of biaxial <b>fatigue</b> <b>under</b> constant amplitude loading on metal specimens. It starts with the physical understanding of the <b>fatigue</b> phenomenon <b>under</b> biaxial <b>fatigue</b> loads. Various types of proportional and non-proportional biaxial fatigue loads and biaxial stress distributions in a material are specified. Attention is paid to the fatigue limit, crack nucleation, initial micro crack growth and subsequent macro-crack in different modes of crack growth. The interference between the upper and lower surfaces of a fatigue crack is discussed. Possibilities for predictions of biaxial fatigue properties are analysed with reference to the similarity concept. The significance of the present understanding for structural design problems is considered. The book is completed with a summary of major observations...|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study has been}} conducted with two aims in mind. The first goal {{was to develop a}} description of how a cutting edge scrapes ice from the road surface. The second goal was to investigate the extent, if any, to which serrated blades were better than un-serrated or "classical" blades at ice removal. The tests were conducted in the Ice Research Laboratory at the Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research of the University of Iowa. A specialized testing machine, with a hydraulic ram capable of attaining scraping velocities of up to 30 m. p. h. was used in the testing. In order to determine the ice scraping process, the effects of scraping velocity, ice thickness, and blade geometry on the ice <b>scraping</b> <b>forces</b> were determined. Higher ice thickness lead to greater ice chipping (as opposed to pulverization at lower thicknesses) and thus lower loads. Behavior was observed at higher velocities. The study of blade geometry included the effect of rake angle, clearance angle, and flat width. The latter were found to be particularly important in developing a clear picture of the scraping process. As clearance angle decreases and flat width increases, the scraping loads show a marked increase, due to the need to re-compress pulverized ice fragments. The effect of serrations was to decrease the <b>scraping</b> <b>forces.</b> However, for the coarsest serrated blades (with the widest teeth and gaps) the quantity of ice removed was significantly less than for a classical blade. Finer serrations appear to be able to match the ice removal of classical blades at lower scraping loads. Thus, one of the recommendations {{of this study is to}} examine the use of serrated blades in the field. Preliminary work (by Nixon and Potter, 1996) suggests such work will be fruitful. A second and perhaps more challenging result of the study is that chipping of ice is more preferable to pulverization of the ice. How such chipping can be forced to occur is at present an open question...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{several new}} cutting edges for removal of ice from the roadway {{were tested in}} a series of closed road tests. These new cutting edges {{consisted}} of a variety of serrated shapes. The study also included measurement of ice <b>scraping</b> <b>forces</b> by in-service trucks. These trucks were instrumented in a similar manner as the truck used in the closed-road tests. Results from the closed-road and in-service tests were analyzed by two parameters. The first parameter is the scraping effectiveness, which is defined as the average horizontal force experienced by a cutting edge. The amount of ice scraped from the roadway is directly proportional to the magnitude of the scraping effectiveness. Thus an increase in scraping effectiveness indicates an increase in the amount of ice being scraped from the roadway. The second parameter is force angle, which is defined as tan to the - 1 power [vertical force/horizontal force]. A combination of a minimal force angle and a maximized scraping effectiveness represents a case in which the maximal amount of ice is being removed from the pavement without an exceptionally large vertical force. Results indicate that each cutting edge produced a maximal scraping effectiveness with a testing configuration of a 15 deg blade angle and a 23, 000 lb. download force. Results also indicate that each cutting edge produced a minimal force angle with a testing configuration of a 15 deg blade angle and a 10, 000 lb. download force. Results from the in-service trucks produced similar data and also similar trends within the data when compared to the results of the closed-road tests. This result is most important, as it suggests that the closed-road tests do provide an accurate measure of ice <b>scraping</b> <b>forces</b> for a given blade and configuration of that blade. Thus if the closed-road tests indicate that certain blades perform well, there is now excellent reason to conduct full scale tests of such blades...|$|R
