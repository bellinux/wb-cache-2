40|$|Railway rails {{are today}} often {{continuously}} welded. This type of joint generally requires less maintenance than {{is needed for}} the bolted joints. It has also reduced wheel damage and made the ride more comfortable. However, these joints are subject to damage. The severity of the fatigue problem {{is likely to increase}} since a trend towards higher train speeds, higher axle loads and heavier traffic density is probable even in the future. The thesis deals with the finite element simulation of two manufacturing processes, <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> welding of rails and laser cladding of railheads, and the subsequent service life of the welds under operating conditions. Welding of rails, elasto-plastic material modelling, in particular for material subject to cooling from a melted state, fatigue and general issues in computational welding mechanics are discussed. Experimental data and materials characteristics were collected from full-scale measurements of production welds, at the welding site, and from materials testing of smaller specimens. The microstructure and the material characteristics of both the base and welded materials, in the interval - 40 °C to + 600 °C, for the rail steel R 260 (900 A) were investigated. The emphasis is on the method of joining rails with <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> welding and the coating of surfaces using laser cladding, which were simulated with material models that handle the recovery behavior {{in the vicinity of the}} melting point. In addition, the interaction between residual stresses from the manufacturing operations, and service loads from the wheel-rail contact was studied. The influence of residual stresses on fatigue initiation, of a twin-disc specimen simulating laser cladded rail, and crack growth, from defects in a <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> weld, was examined. The results showed, in both cases, that the residual stresses caused by the processes were high enough to raise the risk of fatigue failure above that of the base material.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify and determine trends in the uncertainty in the life cycle cost (LCC) associated with the maintenance and renewal (M&R) of the rail of a railway track under a fixed set of input parameters and conditions. Rail maintenance models were identified in the literature which use the mean or expected value of the input distributions to determine a corresponding mean or expected LCC. Although these models display important trends with regard to input parameters such as inspection intervals, they provide no means to quantify the uncertainty related to maintenance and renewal decisions. Thus, a numerical model was developed and programmed using MATLAB which allows the quantification of the uncertainty in the LCC estimated for a given set of conditions. The model uses Monte Carlo simulation to determine the LCC associated with the installation, maintenance and renewal of the rail. The model incorporates imperfect inspections, a hazard function for rail fatigue defects modelled using the Weibull probability distribution and a P-F interval for rail fatigue defects modelled using an exponential probability distribution. The model also allows the modelling of maintenance as either perfect or minimal maintenance as well as the use of either <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> or alumino-thermic welds to conduct the maintenance. This allowed the development of a method to assess which weld type to use to minimise the minimum attainable mean LCC. The developed model was validated against a similar stochastic rail maintenance model from the literature. However, the model from the literature considers only the expected LCC and does not show any uncertainty related thereto. The novelty in this study therefore lies in the fact that the LCC uncertainty can be quantified in the form of a probability distribution at any given renewal tonnage for a given set of conditions. It was found that the distribution of the LCC at a given renewal tonnage followed a lognormal probability distribution. The standard deviation of the lognormal distributions fitted using the method of maximum likelihood was used as a metric to quantify the uncertainty related to the life cycle cost at a given renewal tonnage. The LCC uncertainty was found to increase with an increase in inspection interval length. Furthermore, the uncertainty was also found to increase with a respective increase in renewal tonnage. For varying inspection interval lengths it was found that the uncertainty of combined maintenance costs (planned plus unplanned maintenance costs) tended more strongly towards the uncertainty in the planned maintenance costs for smaller inspection intervals and more strongly towards the uncertainty in unplanned maintenance costs for larger inspection intervals. A critical cost ratio was found of <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> weld cost to alumino-thermic weld cost at which the minimum attainable mean LCC was equal. It is more economical to use <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> welding for maintenance if the cost of <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> welding maintenance produces a cost ratio lower than the critical cost ratio. The developed model could allow railway operators to assess the risk associated with renewal of the rail at varying renewal tonnages for given conditions such as inspection interval lengths, detectability of rail fatigue defects and the arrival rate of rail fatigue defects.

We can solve these problems by applying the welding production technology. For this {{it is necessary to}} conduct a research of the structure and mechanical properties of welded joints of sintered titanium alloys produced by flash welding. Methodology. Titanium industrial powders, type PT 5 - 1 were used as original substance. Forming of blanks, whose chemical composition corresponded to BT 1 - 0 alloy, was carried out using the powder metallurgy method. Compounds were obtained by flash welding without preheating. Microstructural investigations and mechanical tests were carried out. To compare the results investigations of BT 1 - 0 cast alloy were conducted. Findings. Samples of welded joints of sintered titanium blanks from VT 1 - 0 alloy using the <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> welding method were obtained. During welding the microstructure of basic metal consisting of grains of an a-phase, with sizes 40 [...] . 70 mkm, is transformed for the seam weld and HAZ into the lamellar structure of an a-phase. The remaining pores in seam weld were practically absent; in the HAZ their size was up to 2 mkm, with 30 mkm in the basic metal. Attainable level of mechanical properties of the welded joint in sintered titanium alloys is comparable to the basic metal. Originality.

40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis details the investigation into <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> weld failure at Corus, Port Talbot, where the process is used to join coils of steel, permitting cold rolling without interruption. The aim of this work {{was to examine the}} factors which constitute weld failure and to determine whether failure could be eliminated. It was shown that weld failure cannot be predicted with appreciable levels of confidence with the use of neural networks based on inputs such as steel composition and the thickness and width of the coils to be joined. 817 weld breaks were recorded during 2006, of which all but two were observed during cold rolling. Analysis of the samples provided indicate that in some case the term weld break was incorrectly used to describe what was in fact failure in the base material, away from the joint. Prior to this work there were no reported data on the residual stress levels generated after <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> welding of sheet steel with a thickness of 2. 5 mm. It is now clear that in addition to the expected tensile stress in the weld, there is also a compressive stress of up to 200 MPa in the base material which extends far beyond the heat-affected zone. This result may go someway to explain why failure in the base material is observed outside the heat-affected zone during cold rolling. Finally, a post-weld heat treatment for a high hardening boron-steel was examined. The heat treatment was intended to supersede previous attempts to reduce the post-weld cooling rate by applying a voltage across the weld to locally heat the region to a desired temperature.

All standard procedures of failure analysis were applied, with a careful assessment of the material characteristics and the fractured surface. It was concluded that fatigue cracks initiated near the weld bead and spread in a brittle mode, leading to premature fracture of the material.

A thermo-structural finite element model of a track containing an aluminothermic weld is linked with a developed computer code to perform fatigue crack initiation analysis.

40|$|When {{manufacturing}} built-up structures different operations like joining, forming {{and casting}} will introduce residual stresses, which will interact with subsequent service loads {{applied to the}} structure and also influence growth of cracks in critical locations. This overview addresses the fatigue design of structures considering the effects of residual stresses caused by manufacturing. The redistribution of residual stresses during operation, the derivation of stress-intensity factors for cracks in residual stress fields and techniques to study growth of cracks in structures containing residual stress fields will be discussed. Joining of components by welding {{will be discussed in}} detail. Welding will introduce residual stresses in the structure due to localized plastic deformation caused by strong temperature gradients, with normally, tensile peaks in the welded region where cracks often are initiated due to the stress concentration. The presence of tensile residual, mean, stresses in regions with stress concentrations make welds susceptible to fatigue crack growth, which has lead to the development of special design codes for welded joints. The background for such codes and different strategies for the fatigue design will be addressed.

The need to construct large diameter pipelines over long distances has led to an increased demand to improve the productivity of pipeline girth welding. Many novel techniques have been tried in the past to achieve productivity gains, including laser welding, <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> welding, homopolar welding, and radial friction welding. In spite of the failure to gain wide acceptance, there is still current development aimed at achieving their eventual implementation. Single wire mechanised gas metal arc welding (GMAW) remains the dominant pipe girth welding technique, and has been optimised in the past to produce the maximum productivity possible with this process. Continued development of GMAW with dual torch, tandem GMAW welding and novel techniques for GMAW roots is leading to further significant gains in arc welding productivity. This paper describes a new development, the CAPS project, (Cranfield Automated Pipe-welding System), where tandem GMAW in a narrow groove has been applied to pipeline girth welding with two tandem torches in a single welding head. The CAPS system offers welding productivity three to four times higher than that possible with the conventional single wire GMAW technique, while still producing a weld which is very similar to that generated by single wire welding. The development of the system is described, as well as recent successful trials under field conditions.

40|$|In this {{research}} project the feasibility was studied of finding {{an appropriate way}} of welding rings for a continuous variable transmission push-belt made out of strip material (- 10 mm wide, 0. 4 mm thick). The focus was on having the desired dimensions after welding {{in combination with the}} desired metallurgical and mechanica! properties. The wider aim of this project was twofold; firstly to obtain a higher quality in terms of a smoother surface of the rings, and secondly to reduce the casts of the production of the rings. The way of achieving these aims was by finding an appropriate welding process that could satisfy the geometrical and metallurgical demands set to the rings for the transmission push-belt. After a literature research different welding processes were tested including laser beam welding, electron beam welding, plasma are welding, upset welding, flash welding and 'mash resistance' welding. Same of these were tested with different experimental arrangements. These experiments were evaluated using optical microscopy, white light interferometry and hardness tests. The experiments were done on three different maraging steels the trade names which are Ultrafort, Durimphy and Phytime. The Ultrafort did not show similar behaviour to Durimphy and Phytime. This material proved to be less appropriate for this study, whereas Durimphy and Phytime are applicable for the transmission pushbelt. The latter two materials did not show metallurgical difficulties during welding. From these tests four welding processes were found to be applicable for the ring welding of a transmission push-belt. The first two processes are continuous wave laser beam welding and plasma are welding using two different experimental welding arrangements; a run-on and run-off tab at the start and end of the seam and the second arrangement involved welding different rings adjacent to each other (so called multiple ring welding).

These plants, referred to as 'Vision 21 ' and FutureGen programs by DOE, will produce electricity, chemicals, fuels, or a combination of these products, and possibly secondary products such as steam/heat for industrial use. MA 956 is a prime candidate material being considered for a high temperature heat exchanger in the 'Vision 21 ' and FutureGen programs. This material is an oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) alloy; however, there are some gaps in the data required to commit to the use of these alloys in a full-size plant. To fill the technology gaps for commercial production and use of the material for 'Advanced Power Generation Systems' this project has performed development activity to significant increase in circumferential strength of MA 956 as compared to currently available material, investigated bonding technologies for bonding tube-to-tube joints through joining development, and performed tensile, creep and fire-side corrosion tests to validate the use and fabrication processes of MA 956 to heat exchanger tubing applications. Development activities within this projected has demonstrated increased circumferential strength of MA 956 tubes through flow form processing. Of the six fabrication technologies for bonding tube-to-tube joints, inertia friction welding (IFW) and <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> welding (FBW) were identified as processes for joining MA 956 tubes.

Based upon the positive development activities, two test probes were designed and fabricated for field exposure testing at 1204 C ({approx} 2200 F) flue gas. The probes contained tube portions with FBW and IFW welded MA 956. Field testing of the probes and remaining heat exchanger design activity will be performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory under DOE Contract DE-AC 05 - 00 OR 22725...|$|E
