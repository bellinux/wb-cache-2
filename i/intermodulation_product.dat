40|$|All seven {{operational}} GPS Block IIR-M satellites {{have been}} subject to short maintenance periods between February 7 and 8, 2017. With the help of data from several tracking stations of the International GNSS Service (IGS) and high-gain antenna measurements, it could be identified that the satellites’ transmit power of different L 1 signal components has been changed during the maintenance. The analysis shows that the total radiated power of the satellites remains constant, but the power of the C/A-code and the P(Y) -code signals are increased whereas the powers of the M-code and the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>product</b> are reduced. A detailed look reveals a more efficient use of the total available power on the spacecraft through the decreased power of the <b>intermodulation</b> <b>product.</b> Thus, in sum more power is available for the three navigation signals on L 1. Observations from geodetic GNSS receivers have been analyzed to demonstrate the effect of the change in L 1 signal power distribution on the measured C/N 0 of the C/A-code and P(Y) -code for different receiver types.

General analytic expressions for the limiter output components are derived using an integral representation for the limiter characteristic.

Expressions for the desired signals and <b>intermodulation</b> <b>product</b> amplitudes are obtained for the case when the limiter input consists of three angle-modulated sinusoids and noise. The analysis is extended to n modulated sinusoids plus noise, and approximate expressions for the signal, <b>intermodulation</b> <b>product,</b> and noise terms are derived.

40|$|The {{placement}} of base station transceivers at {{close proximity to}} one another is a major challenge for RF engineers. In a colocated setting, the base station receivers have to receive weak desired signals {{in the presence of}} high-power transmit/jamming signals from colocated base station transmitters; resulting in major interference issues. The thesis identifies two major mechanism of interference for the colocated victim receiver. First, the strong jamming signals mix within the victim receiver front-end to produce <b>intermodulation</b> <b>products</b> that may fall on its desired receive channel and cause interference. The strong signals may also saturate the receiver circuits and cause desensitization. Second, large jamming signals from one colocated transmitter can radiate into the antenna system of a second colocated transmitter.
