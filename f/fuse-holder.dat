2500|$|In North America, fuses {{were used}} in {{buildings}} wired before 1960. These Edison base fuses would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. [...] Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of fuses with an excessive current rating, later fuse boxes included rejection features in the <b>fuse-holder</b> socket, commonly known as Rejection Base (Type S fuses) which have smaller diameters that {{vary depending on the}} rating of the fuse. This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) fuse rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248-11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison fuse boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) fuses, by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter. [...] This adapter screws into the existing Edison fuse holder, and has a smaller diameter threaded hole to accept the designated Type S rated fuse.|$|E
50|$|In 1949, {{following}} a factory fire, {{the decision was}} made to concentrate exclusively on electrical wiring devices (switches and sockets). The company very quickly extended its range to cover protection products (<b>fuse-holders</b> and circuit breakers, etc.), cable management products (trunking and mini-trunking), emergency lighting, etc.|$|R
