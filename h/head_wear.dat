50|$|Etymologically the Islands name Choddnnem {{is derived}} from the Sanskrit word Chuddamonnim. Chudda means <b>head</b> <b>wear</b> and Monnim (Mani) signifies some thing worn {{in the shape of a}} {{necklace}} or a jewel of cylindrical shape.|$|E

50|$|Until {{manufacturers}} developed {{new ways}} to mill the oxide, the crystals could easily be broken in the manufacturing process, and this led to excessive print-through (echo). Output from a tape could drop about 1 dB or so in a year's time. Although the decrease was uniform across the frequency range and noise also dropped the same amount, preserving the dynamic range, the decrease misaligned Dolby noise reduction decoders that were sensitive to level settings. The chrome coating was harder than competitive coatings, and that led to accusations of excessive <b>head</b> <b>wear.</b> Although the tape wore hard ferrite heads faster than oxide based tapes, it actually wore softer permalloy heads at a slower rate; and <b>head</b> <b>wear</b> was more a problem for permalloy heads than for ferrite heads. The <b>head</b> <b>wear</b> scare and licensing issues with DuPont kept blank consumer chrome tapes at a great disadvantage versus the eventually more popular Type II tapes that used cobalt-modified iron oxide, but chrome was the tape of choice for the music industry's cassette releases. Because of its low Curie temperature (approximately 386 K), chrome tape lent itself to high-speed thermomagnetic duplication of audio and video cassettes for pre-recorded product sales to the consumer and industrial markets.|$|E

50|$|The {{physical}} {{design of}} a head depends on whether it is fixed or rotating. In either case, {{the face of the}} head where the gap is must be made hard wearing and highly smooth to avoid excessive <b>head</b> <b>wear.</b> It can also be seen that due to the construction method of the head gap, <b>head</b> <b>wear</b> will tend to widen the gap, reducing the head's performance over time. The vertical alignment of the heads (the azimuth) must also match between recording and playback for good fidelity, and the gap should be as close to exactly vertical as possible for highest frequency response. Most tape transport mechanisms will allow fine mechanical adjustment of the azimuth of the heads. Sometimes this can be achieved by automatic circuitry - the actual mechanical azimuth adjustment being carried out by taking advantage of the piezo effect of certain types of crystal material.|$|E

Richly decorated <b>head</b> <b>wear,</b> jewelry and embroidery accents are a part of their routine.|$|E
5000|$|Dieselpunk fashion blends {{the styles}} {{commonly}} found during the diesel era with contemporary styles {{to create a}} fusion of both. The [...] "punk" [...] nature of the subculture comes from expressing a more complete presence in public akin to the fashion styles popular during the diesel era such as waistcoats, covered arms, hosiery, styles of shoes, and <b>head</b> <b>wear.</b> Dieselpunk emphasizes the inclusion of such accoutrements to render one's look [...] "complete," [...] in defiance of modern custom.|$|E
50|$|Chinese civil or {{military}} officials {{used a variety}} of codes to show their rank and position. The most recognized is the Mandarin square or rank bad In. Another code was also the use of colorful hat knobs fixed on the top of their hats. The specific hat knob on one's hat determined one's rank. As there were twelve types of hat knobs representing the nine distinctive ranks of the civil {{or military}} position. Variations existed for Ming official <b>head</b> <b>wear.</b> In the Qing Dynasty different patterns of robes represented different ranks.|$|E

5000|$|Dice Game: The {{five other}} players each rolled a die. Depending {{on what was}} rolled, a rather unsavory task or a rather simple task had to be {{completed}} by that player (e.g., draw a nude or be drawn naked, dye ones hair or shave their <b>head,</b> <b>wear</b> a cast on one or both legs, etc.) If three players completed their task, $40,000 would be added to the pot. The final player to roll was offered a special twist. Roll the die four times and complete all four tasks, to earn an additional $40,000, and an exemption for his/her self.|$|E
50|$|FileWare drives are 5¼-inch double-sided, {{but are not}} {{mechanically}} {{compatible with}} industry-standard diskettes. In a single-sided floppy disk drive, the disk head is opposed by a foam pressure pad. In a normal double-sided floppy disk drive, {{the top and bottom}} heads are almost directly opposed to each other. Apple was concerned about <b>head</b> <b>wear,</b> and instead designed the FileWare drive such that the top and bottom heads are {{on opposite sides of the}} spindle, and each is opposed by a pressure pad. Since there is only one actuator to move the heads, when one head is near the spindle, the other is near the outer rim of the disk.|$|E
