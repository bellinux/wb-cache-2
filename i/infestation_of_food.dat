40|$|This study evaluates {{emerging}} {{pests and}} biocide risks occurring in postharvest area. It was also given {{information on the}} current rate of pest <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> production premises. It was found that (in some facilities) pest levels exceeded the tolerable threshold leading to elevated risk of food product contamination and infestation. Field validation and analysis of biological efficacy and insecticide residues have been performed for new method of grain pyrethroid treatment during harvest. We found that grain contained 145 μg of deltamethrin per 1 kg of grain. It was lower than the label rate (250 μg of deltamethrin). Therefore we can conclude that risk of occurrence of such pyrethorid residues is very low in the Czech Republic...|$|E
40|$|The {{antifungal}} and antiaflatoxigenic {{activities of}} budmunchiamine A (BUA) isolated from Albizia amara and pithecolobine (PI) isolated from Albizia saman were assessed. The present study reports the broad-spectrum and concentration-dependent antifungal activities of BUA and PI with zone of inhibitions and minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 6. 8 to 19. 6 mm and 0. 015 - 0. 5 mg/mL, respectively. Aspergillus flavus growth and its aflatoxin B 1 production were completely inhibited in vitro by BUA and PI at concentration of 1 mg/mL. BUA severely inhibited {{the growth of}} wide range of seed-borne fungi of maize including aflatoxigenic A. flavus with an increased seedling vigour index in vivo at a lower concentration (1. 0 g/kg) than PI (2. 0 g/kg). Enhanced seedling vigour was observed in BUA and PI treatments with no adverse effect on seed germination. The present findings indicate the possible use of BUA and PI as antifungal agents against post harvest fungal <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> commodities and mycotoxin contamination.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University, 1950 This thesis {{was written}} {{as an attempt}} to provide the food {{packaging}} technologist with as much background as possible to enable him to understand the biological principles involved in insect <b>infestations</b> <b>of</b> <b>food</b> packages. Considerable factual information on most insects likely to be encountered as food pests is included as a reference source for those who are concerned with controlling these insects. A large number of figures have been included in order that the beginner in this field will not need to search for references showing illustrations of points made in the text.

40|$|Because of long {{distribution}} {{lines from}} the manufacturer to the consumer, commodities like sweets, baker's ware, cereal products and dried fruit will already be attacked by stored product insects in packages. The economical loss caused by food pests must be ranked as important. First <b>of</b> all <b>food</b> packages applied in masses by manufacturers, primarily folding cartons but also bags are little useful for protection of stored products against pests. For that reason, insect proof packages will be asked by manufacturers and packers. Research work has revealed that <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> packed <b>foods</b> will be caused exclusively by untight and defective package closures. Research and development in the packaging industry will lay stress upon an improved closure technique. Moreover high technical efficiency will be claimed for mechanical packaging. Besides a perfect machine compatibility of the packaging material a good adhesive technique is a necessary condition which allows manufacturing of package clo sures without pores and holes. As an example for a new packaging and adhesive technique, the so-called "Sift-Proof" procedure combined with the "Foam Melt"-method is described...|$|R
40|$|Stored {{products}} include materials, {{which may}} be dried, rendering them storable for future use as food, industrial raw materials, medicines, or as planting materials. These include cereals, pulses, dried seeds and root crops. Insect infestation is {{a major contributor to}} quality deterioration of stored products kept in warm and humid climates. Considerable physical and nutritional loss sustained are due to <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> stored <b>food</b> products by weevils, bruchids and other insects. Apart from the detrimental economic impact, these losses pose a major threat to food security. Traditional methods of applying spices, medicinal plants and their extractives, and inert materials with pest control potential as storage protectants, have increasingly been explored and exploited in the developing world as alternatives for the control of pests of stored products. In addition to insects, several other organisms attack stored products. These include microorganisms (mainly fungi and bacteria, which cause infection and deterioration), mites, rodents and birds. Plants and plant products can affect insects and other storage pests in various ways by exhibiting pest control activities as toxicants, attractants, repellents, antifeedants and growth regulators; they are also effective as antimicrobials and antifungals. Several kinds of materials are used as a means <b>of</b> stored <b>food</b> protection, including chemical fumigation, treatment with synthetic pesticides, and inert materials. This paper will review research relevant to the application of botanical pesticides, particularly those derived from spices and medicinal plants, and also inert materials, which are traditionally applied to control stored food pests in Thailand...|$|R
40|$|Research on {{jellyfish}} blooms {{has focused}} {{heavily on the}} factors influencing the production of blooms. Identifying the factors that cause blooms to collapse, however, is important for predicting the duration of blooms {{and when they are}} likely to disappear. We assembled studies from the literature to assess the persistence of populations of medusae, the timing of the disappearance of the populations and the potential cause of the populations' declines. We found 76 observations that met our criteria for inclusion that were derived from 33 studies and included 47 different taxa. Most populations exhibited strongly seasonal patterns of occurrence, but the population dynamics of the same or closely related species varied greatly across small spatial and temporal scales. Duration of occurrence was negatively related to latitude, but latitude explained only 8 % of the total variability, and no relationship existed when tropical species were excluded from the analysis. Senescence after spawning, <b>infestations</b> <b>of</b> parasites, <b>food</b> limitation, disease, low salinity, extreme water temperatures, predation and intertidal stranding were most commonly cited as causing blooms to collapse. Improving understanding of when and why blooms collapse will benefit coastal industries that are affected by blooms and greatly improve our understanding of how jellyfish blooms impact the ecology of the systems they inhabit.

5000|$|Unlike most {{previous}} explorers, Peary {{had studied}} Inuit survival techniques; he built igloos during the expedition {{and dressed in}} practical furs in the native fashion. He adopted these practices both for heat preservation (furs) and to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march by building igloos instead. Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system (which he called the [...] "Peary system") of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel. The Inuit were curious about the American party and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by the Inuit people's smell (they did not bathe), <b>of</b> their flea <b>infestations</b> and <b>of</b> their <b>food.</b> However, she studied the people and kept a journal of her experiences. In September 1891, Peary's men took dog sled teams and pushed inland onto the ice sheet, to lay caches of supplies. They did not go farther than 30 mi from Red Cliff.|$|R
5000|$|Pediculosis is an <b>infestation</b> <b>of</b> lice (blood-feeding ectoparasitic insects of {{the order}} Phthiraptera).

2500|$|Demodex mites are {{acquired}} {{shortly after}} birth and {{considered to be}} normal skin fauna that increase in number as people age. Almost everyone has {{a certain degree of}} the Demodex mite on their skin. Heavy <b>infestations</b> <b>of</b> Demodex can arrive in adolescence, and could last up to middle age. The increase <b>of</b> their <b>food</b> supply (sebaceous glands proliferate during puberty) explains the increase <b>of</b> <b>infestations</b> <b>of</b> mites during adolescence. [...] Hair follicles in all adults are infested, but the distribution of mites varies, which has a different impact on each person. Men are often more likely to have heavier infestations than women because they have more sebaceous glands, thus producing more food for the mites.|$|R
