25|$|According to the Train's log, 30 September was {{a special}} day. It was the second <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> that the base had not been shelled by Turkish artillery. Of course, they would {{make up for the}} {{oversight}} on 1 October, but for the sailors it was a welcome reprieve. While the Train wasn't itself involved in actual fighting, it was constantly shelled and bombed by Turkish forces. It was a common sight at Suvla to see 40 British soldiers under the direction of a RAN Petty Officer, working to bring supplies ashore during rough weather. The soldiers would openly look forward to returning to their trenches where they at least had the ability to shoot back at anyone who attacked them.|$|E
25|$|On May 29, the Storm Prediction Center {{issued a}} {{moderate}} risk for parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The outlook included a 10% hatched risk for tornadoes.

On May 30, {{for the second}} <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> the Storm Prediction Center issued a moderate risk with a 10% hatched risk of tornadoes, this time for eastern Oklahoma and {{a small part of}} Kansas.

Top seed Maria Sharapova was pushed to two close sets by fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva but {{eventually}} prevailed 7–5, 6–4. Fourth-seeded Belgian Kim Clijsters beat Daniela Hantuchová, who was playing for the second <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> 6–1 7–5 {{to advance to the}} quarterfinals, where she was drawn to face Martina Hingis, who needed three sets to battle past the number one ranked Chinese player Li Na after being a set down. She won 4–6, 6–3, 6–0. The final match of the day was the only women's match to be played on Vodafone Arena, with the others all being on Rod Laver Arena. There the twelfth-seeded Russian Anna Chakvetadze pulled off a surprisingly easy 6–4, 6–1 victory over former semi-finalist Patty Schnyder of Switzerland to advance to her first ever Grand Slam quarterfinal, and would next meet Sharapova.|$|E
25|$|Eric Russell and Mike Smith added 89 for {{the first}} wicket after Mike Brearley won the toss and batted. Russell, dropped three times, became the third batsman – after John Jameson and Zaheer Abbas – to {{complete}} 1,000 runs for the season. He was caught at mid-off for 84 in {{three and a half}} hours. Middlesex, 164 for 2 at the time of Russell's dismissal, was all out for 233. John Price took the wickets of Abbas Ali Baig and Ajit Wadekar off successive balls as India ended the first day on 41 for 3. They slid further to 94 for 6 before Viswanath and Abid Ali added 76 runs in an hour. Going in second with a 65-run lead, Middlesex lost five wickets for 20 runs in 40 minutes after tea. Bedi took 6 for 29 and India needed 197 to win. Price took two wickets off consecutive balls for the fourth <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Sardesai being the batsmen this time. This time the first five wickets fell for 79 but Eknath Solkar and Abid Ali added 56 and Bedi finished the match pulling Peter Parfitt for four. On a wearing wicket, Middlesex missed Fred Titmus who had been rested.|$|E
25|$|With {{the series}} {{returning}} to Yankee Stadium for Game 6, the comeback continued with Schilling pitching {{on a bad}} ankle. The three sutures in Schilling's ankle bled throughout the game, making his sock appear bloody red. Schilling struck out four, walked none, and only allowed one run over seven innings to lead the team to victory. Mark Bellhorn also helped in the effort as he hit a three-run {{home run in the}} fourth inning. In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees staged a rally and brought former Red Sox player Tony Clark to the plate as the potential winning run. Keith Foulke, pitching for the third <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> struck out Clark to end the game and force the deciding Game 7. In this game, the Red Sox completed their historic comeback owing to the strength of Derek Lowe's one-hit, one-run pitching and Johnny Damon's two home runs (including a grand slam in the second inning). The New York Yankees were defeated 10–3. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and 1975 New York Islanders as the only professional sports teams in history to win a best-of-seven games series after being down three games to none, as would the 2010 Philadelphia Flyers and 2014 Los Angeles Kings.|$|E

500|$|A large early {{breakaway}} {{began the}} stage, {{for the third}} <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b> This breakaway numbered 20, which after the first category one climb was whittled down to three, as some riders dropped because of the pace and others, from the teams of race leader Denis Menchov and other contenders, were called back by their sporting directors to stay with their team leaders. The three left out front were Yaroslav Popovych, Damiano Cunego, and Gabriele Bosisio. Eventually, Popovych shed his last remaining breakaway mates {{and for a time}} appeared poised for the stage win. The pink jersey group absorbed every member of the morning's breakaway except Popovych and Cunego by the time they began the Monte Petrano climb. Levi Leipheimer, who had previously stated that this was the day he might attack to move up the general classification, was dropped on Monte Petrano and despite the efforts of Lance Armstrong and Janez Brajkovič to pace him back into the pink jersey group, Leipheimer wound up finishing nearly three minutes behind the stage winner, falling from third to sixth in the general classification and effectively eliminating any designs he may have had on the pink jersey. Armstrong had been near the leaders on the climb, but dropped back to help Leipheimer, who would later say that Armstrong saved him [...] "minutes and minutes" [...] by shepherding him to the finish.|$|E
500|$|A lone [...] rider {{formed the}} day's breakaway. Daniel Sesma slipped {{ahead of the}} peloton after only [...] Given the stage's flat profile and the limited power one rider can muster on his own, he was allowed an {{advantage}} of nearly ten minutes at one point, before the chase began. When he was caught, at the [...] to go mark, the [...] team took {{to the front of}} the field to try to set up an attack by their leader Giovanni Visconti. Visconti never had much of an advantage, but the work done by his team did put sprinters like Mark Cavendish into more difficulty than anticipated on the short climb that preceded the finish. For the second <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> Cavendish had to chase back on to the main field prior to the mass sprint finale. In the sprint, world champion Thor Hushovd again led out race leader Tyler Farrar, but may have been too strong in so doing, as he briefly opened up a gap on his team leader. Cavendish lost the wheel of his leadout man Mark Renshaw, and again failed to factor into the finish. Hushovd's early leadout left Farrar to go for the finish line from [...] out, which proved too far as Juan José Haedo was able to come around the American at the last moment and just pip him at the line for the victory. Farrar, however, retained the race leadership for another day.|$|E

Txurruka's maximum lead over the rest of the field came on the descent from the Alto de Gatzaga, reaching around five-and-a-half minutes. Txurruka extended his lead in both the mountains and sprints classifications as [...] moved to the front of the peloton, and started the chase of Txurruka in earnest. On the Alto de San Martin, Jens Voigt (...) and 's Adriano Malori attacked from the peloton, and after around [...] of chasing, caught up to Txurruka.
