50|$|Two {{conclusions}} are readily apparent from this study. First, epigenetic processes are {{heavily involved in}} cell fate determination, {{as seen from the}} similar levels of cytosine methylation between induced pluripotent and embryonic stem cells, consistent with their respective patterns of transcription. Second, the mechanisms of <b>de-differentiation</b> (and by extension, differentiation) are very complex and cannot be easily duplicated, as seen by the significant number of differentially methylated regions between ES and iPS cell lines. Now that these two points have been established, we can examine some of the epigenetic mechanisms that are thought to regulate cellular differentiation.|$|E
50|$|Should such {{rejuvenation}} be achievable {{the consequences}} for medicine would be profound. It would avoid the need to artificially pass through an embryonic stage - either by nuclear transfer or by the so-called iPS cells method - to rejuvenate cells. One would simply {{be able to take}} aged cells from a patient and then return to the patient their own, histocompatible, rejuvenated heart cells, liver cells etc. In sharp contrast to the cycle of artificial <b>de-differentiation</b> of somatic cells to stem cells and then the artificial re-differentiation of stem cells to the desired differentiated cell type, which is highly inefficient, time-consuming and results in unstable cell types. The process of partial cloning would be efficient and rapid and thus cheap both in terms of materials and manpower. In short, partial cloning has enormous potential to relieve human suffering and disease: it is the most rapid and cheap route to successful regenerative medicine. Partial cloning also avoids the ethical problems associated with “classical” cloning in that it does not result in live born - it mere uses the oocyte briefly as a means to condition and thereby rejuvenate the old cell exclusively.|$|E
50|$|According to Habermas, Nietzsche {{undertakes}} {{a critique}} of “subject-centered reason,” of modern forms of knowledge and ethics, from a standpoint that only appears to be “genealogical,” that is, situated, historically, outside of modernity and Enlightenment thinking in an archaic, Dionysian era of myth, prior {{to the formation of}} modern subjectivity in the renunciation of instinct or “life.” He sees Nietzsche’s argument that all moral and cognitive claims (along with the rational subject) are the historical products of a power forced inward by its inability to discharge itself not as being based on a genealogy of modernity, but rather as {{a critique of}} the modern cognitive and practical subject from the perspective of an equally modern aesthetics (which Nietzsche “transposes,” according to Habermas, “into the archaic”), elevating the “judgment of taste of the art critic into a model for value judgment.” Nietzsche's critique of subject, in other words, is based on a modern aesthetic experience - in particular, the “painful <b>de-differentiation,</b> a de-delimitation of the individual, a merging with amorphous nature within and without” - which presupposes the modern subject itself. What appears, then, in Nietzsche as the historical “other” reason is in fact a version of Kantian aesthetics shorn of any claim of intersubjective validity.|$|E
40|$|Background: When rat {{salivary gland}} cells are cultured in vitro, they dedifferentiate within 24 h. Hypothesis: Growth factors will prevent <b>de-differentiation</b> of primary {{cultures}} of parotid gland cells, {{and they will}} induce differentiation of ParC 5 cells. DNA methylation drives <b>de-differentiation</b> {{and the loss of}} expression in cultured parotid cells. Methods: Rat parotid glands were collected and cultured in media using different combinations of growth factors. DNA was evaluated for methylation at various time points. Results: No media tested prevented the <b>de-differentiation</b> of parotid cells, and none induced differentiation of ParC 5 cells. Limited variation in methylation of CpG sites was seen. Conclusion: Growth factors do not prevent <b>de-differentiation</b> in primary cell culture, nor do they activate differentiation in ParC 5 cells.

40|$|Conversion of astrocytes to neurons, via <b>de-differentiation</b> to neural {{stem cells}} (NSC), {{may be a}} new {{approach}} to treat neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries. The signaling factors affecting such a cell conversion are poorly understood, and they are hard to identify in complex disease models or conventional cell cultures. To address this question, we developed a serum-free, strictly controlled culture system of pure and homogeneous ‘astrocytes generated form murine embryonic stem cells (ESC) ’. These stem cell derived astrocytes (mAGES), as well as standard primary astrocytes resumed proliferation upon addition of FGF. The signaling of FGF receptor tyrosine kinase converted GFAP-positive mAGES to nestin-positive NSC. ERK phosphorylation was necessary, but not sufficient, for cell cycle re-entry, as EGF triggered no <b>de-differentiation.</b> The NSC obtained by <b>de-differentiation</b> of mAGES were similar to those obtained directly by differentiation of ESC, as evidenced by standard phenotyping, and also by transcriptome mapping, metabolic profiling, and by differentiation to neurons or astrocytes. The <b>de-differentiation</b> was negatively affected by inflammatory mediators, and in particular, interferon gamma (IFNγ) strongly impaired the formation of NSC from mAGES by a pathway involving phosphorylation of STAT 1, but not the generation of nitric oxide. Thus, two antagonistic signaling pathways were identified here that affect fate conversion of astrocytes independent of genetic manipulation. The complex interplay of the respective signaling molecules that promote/inhibit astrocyte <b>de-differentiation</b> may explain why astrocytes do not readily form neural stem cells in most diseases. Increased knowledge of such factors may provide therapeutic opportunities to favor such conversions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent studies {{demonstrated}} that mature atrocytes {{have the capacity}} for de-differentiating into neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) in vitro and in vivo. However, it is still unknown what signals endow astroglial cells with a <b>de-differentiation</b> potential. Furthermore, the signaling molecules and underlying mechanism that confer astrocytes with the competence of NSPC phenotypes have not been completely elucidated. Here, we found that sonic hedgehog (Shh) production in astrocytes following mechanical injury was significantly elevated, and that incubation of astrocyes with the injured astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) causes astrocytes to gradually lose their immunophenotypical profiles, and acquire NSPC characteristics, as demonstrated by down-regulation of typical astrocytic markers (GFAP and S 100) and up-regulation of markers that are generally expressed in NSCs, (nestin, Sox 2, and CD 133). ACM treated astrocytes exhibit self-renewal capacity and multipotency similar to NSPCs. Concomitantly, in addition to Ptc, {{there was a significant}} up-regulation of the Shh downstream signal components Gli 2 and Cyclin D 1 which are involved in cell proliferation, dramatic changes in cell morphology, and the disruption of cell-cycle G 1 arrest. Conversely, the depletion of Shh by administration of its neutralizing antibody (Shh n-Ab) effectively inhibited the <b>de-differentiation</b> process. Strikingly, Shh alone had little effect on astrocyte <b>de-differentiation</b> to NSPCs. These data above suggest that Shh is a key instructive molecule while other molecules secreted from insulted astrocytes may synergistically promote the <b>de-differentiation</b> event...|$|E
40|$|Normal tissue {{architecture}} is disrupted following injury, as resident tissue cells become damaged and immune cells are recruited {{to the site}} of injury. While injury and inflammation are critical to tissue remodeling, the inability to resolve this response can lead to the destructive complications of chronic inflammation. In the pancreas, acinar cells of the exocrine compartment respond to injury by transiently adopting characteristics of progenitor cells present during embryonic development. This process of <b>de-differentiation</b> creates a window where a mature and stable cell gains flexibility and is potentially permissive to changes in cellular fate. How <b>de-differentiation</b> can turn an acinar cell into another cell type (such as a pancreatic b-cell), or a cell with cancerous potential (as in cases of deregulated Kras activity) is of interest to both the regenerative medicine and cancer communities. While it is known that inflammation and acinar <b>de-differentiation</b> increase following pancreatic injury, it remains unclear which immune cells are involved in this process. We used a combination of genetically modified mice, immunological blockade and cellular characterization to identify the immune cells that impact pancreatic regeneration in an in vivomodel of pancreatitis. We identified the innate inflammatory response of macrophages and neutrophils as regulators of pancreatic regeneration. Under normal conditions, mild innate inflammation prompts a transient <b>de-differentiation</b> of acinar cells that readily dissipates to allow normal regeneration. However, non-resolving inflammation developed when elevated pancreatic levels of neutrophils producing interferon-c increased iNOS levels an...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilisation}} and {{accumulation of}} 15 N-labeled metabolites by a 15 N-labeled transformed root culture of Datura stramonium L. was investigated by in vivo 15 N-nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. After resuspension in spent growth medium, the pools of [15 N]glutamate and [15 N]glutamine were rapidly depleted {{and there was}} an increase in the 15 N-NMR signals from conjugated putrescines and hyoscyamine. The signal from the conjugated putrescines passed through a maximum 2 d after the roots were resuspended, and it was concluded that putrescine could be stored as putrescine conjugates prior to its utilisation in other pathways. The transient accumulation of 15 N-label in the hydroxy-cinnamoylputrescines was reduced when the <b>de-differentiation</b> of the root cultures into a suspension culture was initiated by exposure to a medium containing α-napthaleneacetic acid and kinetin. This led to the hypothesis that phytohormone-induced <b>de-differentiation</b> of the root cultures required the presence of free polyamines, and this was tested using two potent inhibitors of putrescine biosynthesis, DL-α-difluoromethylarginine and DL-α-difluoromethylornithine. In-vivo 15 N-NMR spectra of roots grown in 15 N-enriched medium supplemented with these inhibitors showed that the 15 N-labelling of the conjugated polyamines and hyoscyamine was markedly reduced. DL-α-difluoromethylarginine also prevented the phytohormone induced <b>de-differentiation</b> of the root cultures, and this effect could be reversed by the supply of exogenous putrescine. Thus the supply of putrescine appears to {{play a crucial role in}} mediating the phytohormone induced <b>de-differentiation</b> of the root culture...|$|E
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the <b>de-differentiation</b> of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from contractile to proliferative/synthetic phenotype {{has an important}} role during vascular remodeling and diseases. Here we provide evidence that challenges this theory. We identify {{a new type of}} multipotent vascular stem cell (MVSC) in blood vessel wall. MVSCs express markers including Sox 17, Sox 10 and S 100 β, are cloneable, have telomerase activity, and can differentiate into neural cells and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) -like cells that subsequently differentiate into SMCs. On the other hand, we use lineage tracing with smooth muscle myosin heavy chain as a marker to show that MVSCs and proliferative or synthetic SMCs do not arise from the <b>de-differentiation</b> of mature SMCs. Upon vascular injuries, MVSCs, instead of SMCs, become proliferative, and MVSCs can differentiate into SMCs and chondrogenic cells, thus contributing to vascular remodeling and neointimal hyperplasia. These findings support a new hypothesis that the differentiation of MVSCs, rather than the <b>de-differentiation</b> of SMCs, contributes to vascular remodeling and diseases. Vascular diseases are a leading cause of death in many countries. The development o...|$|E

Osteoarthritic chondrocytes undergo morphological and biochemical changes that lead to chondrocyte <b>de-differentiation.</b> We investigated whether the Wnt pathway is involved in <b>de-differentiation</b> of human articular chondrocytes in vitro. Human articular chondrocytes were cultured for four passages in {{the presence or absence}} of IL- 1 in monolayer or micromass culture. Changes in cell morphology were monitored by light microscopy. Protein and gene expression of chondrocyte markers and Wnt pathway components were determined by Western blotting and qPCR after culture. After culturing for four passages, chondrocytes exhibited a fibroblast-like morphology. Collagen type II and aggrecan protein and gene expression decreased, while collagen type I, matrix metalloproteinase 13, and nitric oxide synthase expressions increased. Wnt molecule expression profiles changed; Wnt 5 a protein expression, the Wnt target gene, c-jun, and in Wnt pathway regulator, sFRP 4 increased. Treatment with IL- 1 caused chondrocyte morphology to become more filament-like. This change in morphology was accompanied by extinction of col II expression and increased col I, MMP 13 and eNOS expression. Changes in expression of the Wnt pathway components also were observed. Wnt 7 a decreased significantly, while Wnt 5 a, LRP 5, β-catenin and c-jun expressions increased. Culture of human articular chondrocytes with or without IL- 1 not only induced chondrocyte <b>de-differentiation,</b> but also changed the expression profiles of Wnt components, which suggests that the Wnt pathway is involved in chondrocyte <b>de-differentiation</b> in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The exocrine {{pancreas}} {{exhibits a}} distinctive capacity for tissue regeneration and renewal following injury. This regenerative ability {{has important implications}} for a variety of disorders, including pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, diseases associated with high morbidity and mortality. Thus, understanding its underlying mechanisms may help develop therapeutic interventions. Serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine, 5 -HT) has been recognized as a potent mitogen for a variety of cells and tissues. Here we investigated whether serotonin exerts a mitogenic effect in pancreatic acinar cells in three regenerative models, namely inflammatory tissue injury following pancreatitis, tissue loss following partial pancreatectomy and thyroid hormone-stimulated acinar proliferation. Genetic and pharmacological techniques were used to modulate serotonin levels in vivo. Acinar <b>de-differentiation</b> and cell cycle progression during the regenerative phase were investigated over the course of two weeks. By comparing acinar proliferation in the different murine models of regeneration, we found that serotonin did not affect clonal regeneration of mature acinar cells. Serotonin was however required for acinar <b>de-differentiation</b> following inflammation-mediated tissue injury. Specifically, lack of serotonin resulted in delayed up-regulation of progenitor genes, delayed formation of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and defective acinar cell proliferation. We identified serotonin-dependent acinar secretion as a key step in the progenitor-based regeneration, as it promoted acinar cell <b>de-differentiation</b> and the recruitment of type 2 macrophages. Finally, we identified a regulatory Hes 1 -Ptfa axis in the uninjured adult pancreas activated by zymogen secretion.

30|$|In general, {{the cell}} fate {{conversions}} are considered as the changes of cells from one type to another, {{and can be}} frequently observed during embryonic development when most types of cells are generated. The success of somatic cells to regain pluripotency after nuclear transfer or exogenous expression of four pluripotency-related transcriptional factors makes <b>de-differentiation</b> or iPSC generation as one new type of cell fate conversion (Gurdon, 1962 a, b; Takahashi et al., 2007; Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006). The direct reprogramming from fibroblasts to functional neurons enables cell fate conversion to cover an even wider area including differentiation, <b>de-differentiation,</b> and trans-differentiation (Vierbuchen et al., 2010). Since the combination of <b>de-differentiation</b> and differentiation or trans-differentiation alone can use cells isolated from patient skin or urine to generate patient-specific functional cells (Muller et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012), which {{have the potential to}} treat a variety of diseases without facing ethics concerns and immunologic rejections (Grabel, 2012; Nishikawa et al., 2008), a lot of efforts have been put to study the mechanisms underlying cell fate conversions to optimize these technologies for clinic application.|$|E

Osteoarthritic chondrocytes undergo morphological and biochemical changes that lead to <b>de-differentiation.</b> The involvement of signaling pathways, such as the Wnt pathway, during cartilage pathology has been reported. Wnt signaling regulates critical biological processes. Wnt signals are transduced through at least three intracellular signaling pathways including the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, the Wnt/Ca 2 + pathway and the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway.

Human articular chondrocytes were cultured through four passages with no treatment, or with sFRP 3 treatment, an inhibitor of Wnt pathways, or with DKK 1 treatment, an inhibitor of the canonical pathway.

Inhibition of the Wnt pathway showed that the canonical Wnt signaling probably is responsible for inhibition of collagen II expression, activation of metalloproteinase 13 expression and regulation of Wnt 7 a and c-jun expression during chondrocyte <b>de-differentiation</b> in vitro.
