5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was <b>her</b> <b>bright,</b> engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, Plisetskaya was a {{different}} kind of ballerina. She spent a very short time in the corps de ballet after graduation and was quickly named a soloist. <b>Her</b> <b>bright</b> red hair and striking looks made her a glamorous figure on and off the stage. “She was a remarkably fluid dancer but also a very powerful one”, according to The Oxford Dictionary of Dance. “The robust theatricality and passion she brought to her roles made her an ideal Soviet ballerina.” Her interpretation of The Dying Swan, a short showcase piece made famous by Anna Pavlova, became her calling card. Plisetskaya was known for the height of her jumps, her extremely flexible back, the technical strength of her dancing, and her charisma. She excelled both in adagio and allegro, which is very unusual in dancers.|$|E

500|$|Off the ice, Richard was a quiet, unassuming {{youth who}} spoke little. He met {{his future wife}} Lucille Norchet when he was seventeen, and she nearly fourteen. [...] She was the younger sister {{of one of his}} {{teammates}} at Bordeaux, and <b>her</b> <b>bright,</b> outgoing personality complemented Richard's reserved nature. Lucille proved adept at guiding him through trials and disappointments he experienced in both hockey and life. They were engaged when he was 20, and though her parents felt she was too young, married on September 12, 1942, when she was seventeen.|$|E
500|$|Discussing Emma's {{style and}} costuming, Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich has explained: [...] "We {{wanted to make}} her look like everything’s so neat—perfectly ironed and tucked-in shirts with matching belts, shoes and pins. We wanted to make her {{stand out from the}} other teachers. She’s always so happy and excited, so we wanted her outfits to represent that sunny disposition. In the pilot, we made her look much more teacher-y. Now we're having more fun with her character, keeping <b>her</b> <b>bright</b> and unusual. Quirky is the word. Emma’s also always in stacked Mary Janes or T-strap heels. It takes the outfit down from being too stylish or too sexy. It makes her look prim and almost old-fashioned." ...|$|E
500|$|The EP {{received}} generally positive critical reception. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic {{said the}} songs on The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection were [...] "all crisp, cheerful arrangements that are suitably seasonal but also faithful to <b>her</b> <b>bright</b> country-pop." [...] Craig Shelburne of CMT said, [...] "Thanks to this teen star, {{a new generation of}} sensitive girls may discover the melancholy but oh-so-melodic 'Last Christmas'. She also includes two original holiday songs." [...] An uncredited review in Deseret News felt that the release was too short, with only 6 songs, yet fulfilled its task. Dan Maclntosh of Country Standard Time concluded, [...] "Swift is a fine singer, who finds ways to inject sincere emotion into every line she sings. They say the best things come in small packages. And that saying holds true for Swift's new one." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilkinson's short {{stature and}} {{distinctive}} red hair, combined with her uncompromising politics, {{gave rise to}} popular nicknames such as the [...] "Fiery Particle" [...] and [...] "Red Ellen". With <b>her</b> <b>bright,</b> fashionable clothes and her forceful manner, she was easily noticeable—an obituarist wrote that [...] "wherever there was a row going on in support of some good or even fairly good cause, that rebellious redhead was sure to be seen bobbing about {{in the heart of}} the tumult". In her later career, ambition and pragmatism led her to temper her earlier Marxism and militancy and work within mainstream Labour Party policy; she came to believe that parliamentary democracy offered a better route to social progress than any alternative. Yet, Vernon says, [...] "she never lost her resolute independence of thought, and sought power not for self glory but to succour the weak of the world".|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson's {{arrival in}} the House of Commons {{attracted}} considerable press comment, much of it related to <b>her</b> <b>bright</b> red hair and the vivid colours of her clothing. She informed MPs: [...] "I happen to represent in this House one of the heaviest iron and steel producing areas in the world—I know I do not look like it, but I do". The Woman's Leader [...] described her as a [...] "vigorous, uncompromising feminist and an exceedingly tenacious, forcible and hard-headed politician". As an unofficial spokesperson for women's rights, Wilkinson achieved {{one of her first}} parliamentary victories in 1925, when she persuaded the government to correct anomalies affecting widows in its Pensions Bill. She combined with Lady Astor from the Conservative benches, in March 1926, to attack the government's proposed decrease in expenditure on women's training centres. Wilkinson's ODNB biographer, Brian Harrison, acknowledges that while [...] "women's issues" [...] were often to the fore in her speeches, she was primarily a socialist rather than a feminist, and if forced to decide between them would have chosen the former.|$|E
500|$|... "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] has {{received}} generally favorable reviews from contemporary critics. [...] Regarding the song's musical genre, Roger Holland of PopMatters {{believed there was}} no reason for Swift to limit herself into only the country music or why she should be a country artist at all. Holland continued, [...] "Yet this is the channel to market she has chosen, and so she has to be prepared to hear complaints about the way that trademarked Mutt Lange guitar whine has been married to <b>her</b> <b>bright</b> shiny pop songs in order to get them onto CMT, GAC, and country radio." [...] Bill Lamb of About.com rated [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] four out of five stars. Lamb complimented Swift's vocal delivery and songwriting style, but criticized the production and arrangement, perceiving them to be dull. He added that the track's refrains were most impacting and deemed it among the most memorable songs of 2007. Sean Dooley, also of About.com, described Swift's vocals as [...] "nothing less than captivating." ...|$|E

500|$|Chris William of Entertainment Weekly graded {{the show}} a B+ and commented that, despite her age (at the time fourteen), Cyrus was a {{determined}} and likable performer {{who was able}} to command the stage the entire show. He continued to compare her to Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne stylistically and musically, respectively. Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel believed the Best of Both Worlds Tour was as entertaining as concerts performed by Spears or the Backstreet Boys, adding that the show's quality made past Hilary Duff concerts [...] "look like something in a mall food court." [...] However, Abbott also stated that Cyrus was unable to duplicate the energy of Hannah Montana. Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times expected to be let down by the concert after the commotion and hype built for it, but was not. She said, [...] "The show was terrific: a two-hour sugar rush and one long challenge to fans, who had to keep up with Ms. Cyrus's hectic pace." [...] Regarding Cyrus, Sanneh stated she was a likable singer, being able to emphasize on certain words and that her demeanor on stage portrayed her as a [...] "hard-working, sweet-natured troublemaker. There's something slightly disruptive about <b>her</b> <b>bright</b> smile [...] And she brings a welcome hint of chaos to everything she does." [...] J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post described the concert as [...] "a nearly 90-minute blast of pop in which the charismatic Cyrus– who complained that she wasn't feeling well– commanded the stage with confidence, performing with a particular swagger." [...] Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times described the show to be operated at a [...] "frenzied fever pitch" [...] and be only appealing to children, confusing adults with its presentation.|$|E

2500|$|Midna's {{original}} form is a turqoise skinned woman with body markings on her limbs, orange hair, and red eyes. She also wears a South Asian-like attire composing of black gagra choli with a trailing black veil. However, after being cursed by Zant, Midna became a diminutive [...] "imp". Other than {{her lack of}} clothing, save a Fused Shadow fragment (powerful magical relics of her race) as a mask, Midna bears elements of her {{original form}}. While in her imp form, Midna frequently speaks in sinister and sarcastic ways, often acting uninterested in the events of Hyrule and/or Link's plight unless they suit her needs. <b>Her</b> <b>bright</b> orange hair is her main method of physical control while she is in imp form and will often use it to deal physical damage or control Link while {{he is in his}} wolf form. Her on-screen dialogue is often accompanied by a babble of pseudo-speech, which was produced by scrambling English phrases sampled by Kōmoto.|$|E

2500|$|In 2002, Paltrow made small {{appearances}} in the documentary Searching for Debra Winger and the action satire comedy Austin Powers in Goldmember, while she starred in the thriller-drama Possession with Aaron Eckhart as a couple of literary scholars who unearth the amorous secret of two Victorian poets as they find themselves falling under a deepening connection. Critically panned, the film made a lukewarm US$14.8 million worldwide. In the following year, she headlined the romantic comedy View from the Top, where she obtained the part of woman {{from a small town}} who sets out to fulfill her dream of becoming a flight attendant. Budgeted at US$30 million, the film only earned US$7 million in its opening weekend; it eventually grossed US$15.6 domestically and US$19,526,014 worldwide. She herself later disparaged the film, calling it [...] "terrible". Paltrow starred as the titular role in Sylvia (2003), a British biographical drama directed by Christine Jeffs and co-starring Daniel Craig chronicling the romance between prominent poets Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes. Distributed for a limited release in most markets, Sylvia made US$2.9 million internationally. The New York Times, in its review for the film, wrote that [...] "her performance goes well beyond mimicry. She has a vivid, passionate presence, even when her lively features have gone slack with depression and <b>her</b> <b>bright</b> blue eyes have glazed over".|$|E
