In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, [...] "Here's the deal: {{my father was}} born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if {{it comes down to}} a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton.

[...] Chancellor Kohl, commenting on the letter, said that those who signed it [...] "don't {{know a thing about}} Germany and don't want to know." [...] German officials argued that [...] "the whole fuss was cranked up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won't give them: tax-exempt status as a religion. This is intimidation, pure and simple." [...] Officials explained that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all [...] "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as [...] "absurd" [...] and cited German court rulings stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a [...] "contemptuous cartel of oppression".|$|E

500|$|There {{had also}} been changes in the {{legislative}} approach to be taken, changes which had occurred behind closed doors. The Gray Commission's public claim on May 28 that it had nothing new to report was not truthful. In fact, a secret meeting of the Gray Commission's executive committee had occurred on May 27 which Representative Howard W. Smith, Representative Watkins Moorman Abbitt, Representative Burr Harrison, Tuck, and other outsiders had attended. The group approved of Stanley's March 9 proposal to cut off all state funds for any school district which integrated, and discussed {{a number of other}} proposals (including a pupil assignment plan, whether to require local approval of integration or local approval of taxes to support integration, and repeal of state laws permitting school districts to be sued). Although the full Gray Commission met publicly the following day, they were secretly joined in executive session by Governor Stanley. Stanley announced that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> a special session of the legislature, and that if the Gray Commission could not come up with any new proposals then he himself would craft bills for the General Assembly to consider. Although no plan was formally agreed upon, the Gray Commission asked its counsel David J. Mays [...] to craft proposals along six lines: 1) Cutting off state funds to any school district which integrated; 2) Allowing local referenda to veto the appropriation of local funds for integration; 3) Repeal of state laws allowing school districts to be sued; 4) Allowing the state to invoke its police power to prevent integration (under the assumption that integration would lead to public unrest and disorder); 5) Enacting a pupil assignment plan to be implemented solely by the governor (under the assumption that no court would jail the governor); and 6) Enacting a pupil assignment plan to be implemented solely by the General Assembly (under the assumption that no court would jail the entire legislature). No action was taken on these proposals at the Gray Commission's meeting on June 4.|$|E

Bearing these horrific facts in mind, it is clearly a gross oversimplification to dismiss Campbell's stance in the Spanish Civil War as evidence that he was a Fascist. Such an obvious mitigating circumstance was, however, almost universally overlooked by Campbell's detractors in England, all of whom appended the 'Fascist' label to his person, employing it, and the accompanying stereotypical effluvia with which such an epithet is associated, with the cynical glee of seasoned character assassins." ...|$|E
