40|$|The {{relationship}} between MAUT and AHP for three-level hierarchic structures is demonstrated {{based on a}} common framework interpreting multiattribute decision making techniques. A theorem showing {{the conditions under which}} two multiattribute decision making techniques result in a consistent preference structure is proved. It can be justified based on this theorem that the rank reversal problem in AHP resulting from the addition or <b>deletion</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternatives</b> is caused by multiplying inappropriate criteria priorities with local priorities for alternatives. A scaling method, AHP', is introduced synthesizing judgments from pairwise comparisons within and among criteria into value scales in MAUT.

Our findings indicate that using the geometric mean reduces the variance in ratings substantially; hence, yielding lower inconsistency in ratings.

A practical example is examined using the proposed approach to demonstrate its validity and practicability in rank preservation.

40|$|Mucoidy, or {{overproduction}} of the exopolysaccharide {{known as}} alginate, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa {{is a poor}} prognosticator for lung infections in cystic fibrosis. Mutation of the anti-σ factor MucA is a well-accepted mechanism for mucoid conversion. However, certain clinical mucoid strains of P. aeruginosa have a wild-type (wt) mucA. Here, we describe a loss-of-function mutation in kinB that causes overproduction of alginate in the wt mucA strain PAO 1. KinB is the cognate histidine kinase for the transcriptional activator AlgB. Increased alginate production due to inactivation of kinB was correlated with high expression at the alginate-related promoters PalgU and PalgD. <b>Deletion</b> <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> σ factor RpoN (σ 54) or the response regulator AlgB in kinB mutants decreased alginate production to wt nonmucoid levels. Mucoidy was restored in the kinB algB double mutant by expression of wt AlgB or phosphorylation-defective AlgB. D 59 N, indicating that phosphorylation of AlgB was not required for alginate overproduction when kinB was inactivated. The inactivation of the DegS-like protease AlgW in the kinB mutant caused loss of alginate production and an accumulation of the hemagglutinin (HA) -tagged MucA. Furthermore, we observed that the kinB mutation increased the rate of HA-MucA degradation. Our results also indicate that AlgW-mediated MucA degradation required algB and rpoN in the kinB mutant. Collectively, these studies indicate that KinB is a negative regulator of alginate production in wt mucA strain PAO 1...|$|R

This cascade is frequently hijacked by cancers {{that arise from}} the malignant transformation of germinal center (GC) B cells, underscoring the importance of deciphering the function of NF-κB in these cells. The NF-κB signaling cascade is comprised of two branches, the canonical and alternative NF-κB pathways, mediated by distinct transcription factors. The expression and function of the transcription factors <b>of</b> the <b>alternative</b> pathway, RELB and NF-κB 2, in late B-cell development is incompletely understood. Using conditional <b>deletion</b> <b>of</b> relb and nfkb 2 in GC B cells, we here report that ablation of both RELB and NF-κB 2, but not of the single transcription factors, resulted {{in the collapse of}} established GCs.

40|$|Abstract Background Germ-line {{mutations}} in the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes are major contributors to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. Large rearrangements are less frequent in the BRCA 2 gene than in BRCA 1. We report, here, the first total <b>deletion</b> <b>of</b> exon 3 in the BRCA 2 gene that was detected during screening of 2058 index cases from breast/ovarian cancer families for BRCA 2 large rearrangements. <b>Deletion</b> <b>of</b> exon 3, {{which is in}} phase, does not alter the reading frame. Low levels <b>of</b> <b>alternative</b> transcripts lacking exon 3 (Δ 3 delta 3 transcript) {{have been reported in}} normal tissues, which raises the question whether <b>deletion</b> <b>of</b> exon 3 is pathogenic. Methods Large BRCA 2 rearrangements were analysed by QMPSF (Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments) or MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification). The exon 3 deletion was characterized with a "zoom-in" dedicated CGH array to the BRCA 2 gene and sequencing. To determine the effect <b>of</b> exon 3 <b>deletion</b> and assess its pathogenic effect, three methods of transcript quantification were used: fragment analysis of FAM-labelled PCR products, specific allelic expression using an intron 2 polymorphism and competitive quantitative RT-PCR. Results Large rearrangements of BRCA 2 were detected in six index cases out of 2058 tested (3 % of all deleterious BRCA 2 mutations). This study reports the first large rearrangement of the BRCA 2 gene that includes all of exon 3 and leads to an in frame <b>deletion</b> <b>of</b> exon 3 at the transcriptional level. Thirty five variants in exon 3 and junction regions of BRCA 2 are also reported, that contribute to the interpretation of the pathogenicity <b>of</b> the <b>deletion.</b> The quantitative approaches showed that there are three classes of delta 3 BRCA 2 transcripts (low, moderate and exclusive). Exclusive expression of the delta 3 transcript by the mutant allele and segregation data provide evidence for a causal effect of the exon 3 deletion. Conclusion This paper highlights that large rearrangements and total <b>deletion</b> <b>of</b> exon 3 in the BRCA 2 gene could contribute to hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer. In addition, our findings suggest that, to interpret the pathogenic effect of any variants of exon 3, both accurate transcript quantification and co-segregation analysis are required. </p...|$|R

We screened a population-based sample of 648 isolates for the <b>deletion</b> <b>of</b> five RDs, designated RD 105, RD 181, RD 142, RD 150, and RD 239, using microarray-based hybridization, PCR, and DNA sequencing and assessed the associations between the RD deletions and the clinical characteristics of the patients using chi-square analysis and multivariate logistic regression model. Of the 648 isolates, 18 (2. 8 %) had the RD 239 deletion and 39 (6. 0 %) had the RD 105 <b>deletion.</b> The <b>deletions</b> <b>of</b> RD 142, RD 150, and RD 181 subdivided the isolates with the RD 105 deletion into four groups comprising a group with concurrent <b>deletions</b> <b>of</b> RD 105, RD 181, and RD 142 (n = 13); a group with concurrent <b>deletions</b> <b>of</b> RD 105, RD 181, and RD 150 (n = 5); a group with concurrent <b>deletions</b> <b>of</b> RD 105 and RD 181 (n = 13); and a group with a <b>deletion</b> <b>of</b> RD 105 only (n = 8). Extrathoracic tuberculosis is statistically significantly associated with infection with the isolates with concurrent <b>deletions</b> <b>of</b> RD 105, RD 181, and RD 142 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3. 05; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 1. 58, 5. 90) and the isolates with concurrent <b>deletions</b> <b>of</b> RD 105, RD 181, and RD 150 (adjusted OR = 11. 09; 95 % CI = 4. 27, 28. 80), after controlling for the previously identified risk factors for extrathoracic tuberculosis (human immunodeficiency virus serostatus, race, gender, and the genotype of the plcD gene).
