40|$|Abstract Background Appendiceal parasites {{can cause}} {{symptoms}} of appendiceal pain, independent of microscopic evidence of acute inflammation. The {{diagnosis of a}} parasitic infestation is generally achieved only after the pathologic examination of the resected appendices. Patients/Methods Pathology department records were reviewed for all patients who required an operation for symptoms of acute appendicitis between 2000 and 2006. The specimens which were pathologically diagnosed to contain parasites were reevaluated for features of acute <b>inflamation,</b> and parasite type. The medical records were reviewed in detail to achieve a diagnostic score(Eskelinen). Radiologic imaging findings were correlated, if present. Results Of the 190 appendectomies performed, 6 specimens (3, 15 %) were found to contain parasites(4 Enterobius vermicularis, 2 Taenia subspecies). Appendectomies with Taenia showed acute <b>inflamation,</b> while acute <b>inflamation</b> was absent in the ones with Enterobius vermicularis. The Eskelinen score was higher than the treshold in two cases with an acute <b>inflamation,</b> and in two without. Ultrasound scans, and a computed tomography scan were performed in 5 patients. In 3 of 4 bland appendices, results favored acute appendicitis. Conclusion The diagnosis of gastrointestinal parasites is not only made by examining the stool but the diagnosis {{can be made by}} histology from surgical specimens. Timely diagnosis and appropriate therapy might prevent probable future complications that may necessitate surgical procedures, at least in some of the patients. The clinical management of these infections is different from that for classical appendicitis. </p...|$|E

Another important elements in a good raising economy are reproduction and performance. The goal of the research was to find out the health conditions of cows, their reproduction and longevity. The research took place in ZOD Kolný. Milk efficiency, reproduction, health condition and selection of animals were monitored on 330 cows from race Holštýn and Česká straka in 2006 - 2007. Obtained data have been processed by variance analysis and correlation analysis in Microsoft Excel programme. Dairycows were stabled in a free box stable. The basic feed ration was canned roughage with a pithy supplement. We have observed teh health condition of dairycows, causes of setting cows aside, longevity, servis period, between-calving interval and efficiency. The average data were compared in the light of lactation lactation. Obtained data were also compared with records from the Czech republic. The research has found out that in a dairycow drove with average efficiency 7 584, 5 kg there have been 3583 veterinary interventions executed on 270 monitored cows, but 3322 from that have been interventions related to reproduction failures. The whole number of dairycows set aside while researching was 142. The main causes of settin cows aside were the reproduction failures(13, 03 %) and the lacteal gland <b>inflamations</b> (7, 8 %). The age analysis has shown that only 24, 2 % of cows are on 4 th and higher lactation. Most cows are on the 2 nd lactation (100 heads). There we could see the heads descent ply down to the 8 th lactation, were there are only 3 dams. The average servis period was 167, 03 days. There were over 85 % of dairycows with unsatisfactory servis period (over 75 days). 58, 14 % of dairycows got over 120 day limit. These data in comparison with the whole czech rate, where the servis period is 125, 8 days, show the servis period 41, 5 days longer. The average interval lenght was 42, 7 days, which is 17, 3 days longer than the republic average in 2006. Economical deprivation caused by the servis period prolongation were 3921, 26 Kč per cow. Altough the profit with 104 Kč spending on one day was along with average milk yield 7 548, 50 Kč 39 789, 55 Kč per caw per year.

The differences of SP expression in trigemnial ganglion of the mouse between other species such as the rats may cause by species-specific differences. 2) Co-localisation studies between SP und neuronal receptors such as trkA, PAR 2 and TRPV 1 in sensory airway trigeminal und jugulare/nodose neurons of the mouse have been carried out. 2 a) SP was frequently found in trigeminal airway neurons expressing PAR 2 oder TRPV 1 receptors. 2 b) For the lower airways, most vagal airway neurons also express trkA oder TRPV 1 receptors under normal conditions. 2 c) Furthermore, NGF may induce SP expression in vagal sensory neurons by activation of trkA receptors in vivo. 3) Using the mouse model for allergic airway inflammation, the expression of SP in vagal sensory and of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptid tyrosine (NPY) in sympathetic ganglia were studied. 3 a) Under allergic airway <b>inflamation,</b> SP was induced by de novo subpopulation of neurons. 3 b) In association with the induction of SP in sensory neurons allergic airway <b>inflamation</b> was increased. Allergic airway <b>inflamation</b> was characterised by the increase of the number of eosinophils in the broncho-alveolare lavage (BAL). 3 c) The results of these studies showed that expression of TH and NPY in sympathetic neurons was not changed under allergic airway <b>inflamation</b> in comparison to the controls. 3 d) The induction of SP in allergic airway <b>inflamation</b> was only found in vagal sensory neurons, whereas SP expression was not found in sympathetic neurons under normal condition and allergic airway inflammation. 4) Using immunhistochemical and pharmacological in vivo und in vitro studies, two neuronal receptors such as trkA and TRPV 1 were found to be responsible for the induction and release of SP and CGRP.

Given the high prevalence of malnutrition in dialysis patients {{and its effect on}} morbi-mortality of patients, it is necessary to establish an adequate monitoring of nutritional aspects for early detection of patients at risk or with nutritional deficit and carry out an early nutritional intervention that will manage to reverse the situation. Objetives: • To describe the nutritional state of patients attended at the dialysis unit of the nephrology service of the Consorcio Hospitalario de Vic, according to the Malnutrition Inflammation Score for a period of 2 years. • To describe the socio-demographic and clinical features of dialysis patients in the Consorcio Hospitalario de Vic whose nutritional state was assessed using the Malnutrition Inflammation Score. • To analyse whether factors such as gender, age, type of dialysis treatment, the presence of comorbility, the type of haemodialysis access, the time on dialysis, the number of hospitalizations or total number of days hospitalized are related to the nutritional state of dialysis patients at the Consorcio Hospitalario de Vic, according to the Malnutrition Inflammation Scores obtained. Material and methods: Prospective transversal study. Carried out at the Nephrology Unit of the Consorcio Hospitalario de Vic. Patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease and who undergo dialysis were studied, and dialysis patients with treatment records of more than three months were included. The study was carried out from January 2009 to December 2010. Socio-demographic variables (age, gender, type of dialysis treatment, origin of the renal pathology, existence of history of comorbility, access used for haemodialysis, situation of dialysis treatment, cause for end of dialysis treatment), the nutritional state according to the Malnutrition Inflammation Score and consumption of resources (number of hospitalizations per year, total number of days hospitalized per year, time on dialysis) were analysed. The data were obtained from the computerized records of the nephrology service. The SPSS v. 18. 0. programme was used for the statistical analysis. Results: 130 patients were analysed, which corresponded to the total number of patients assessed according to nutritional state using the Malnutrition Inflammation Score during 2009 and 2010. Of these, 79 (60. 8 %) were men and 51 (39. 2 %) were women, the average age was 64. 76 ± 14. 27 years, and 18. 5 % of the patients were malnourished. Of the total of 130 patients analysed, 399 Malnutrition Inflammation Score values were obtained. From 69 (53. 1 %) of them, there were 4 scores, from 18 (13. 8 %) there were 3 scores and for 26 (20, 0 %) there were 2 and for 17 (13. 1 %) there was only one. It was observed that 353 (88. 5 %) of the scores were classified as well-nourished and 46 (11. 5 %) as malnourished. The mean scores on the Malnutrition Inflammation Score scale according to the number of records (from the first to the fourth) were: 6. 29 ± 3. 65, 6. 06 ± 2. 91, 6. 38 ± 3. 13 and 7. 96 ± 3. 50 respectively, with statistically significant differences being observed (p= 0. 001). The nutritional evolution of 113 patients (86. 9 %) was analysed, who were those who had more than one record of Malnutrition Inflammation Score. The scores of the first and last record were taken into account. The average score for the first records was 5. 96 ± 3. 34 compared to the average for the final scores which was 7. 50 ± 3. 62, these differences being statistically significant (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: • We would highlight the importance of knowing the nutritional state of chronic kidney insufficiency patients receiving haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis treatment due to the risk of presenting associated morbi-mortality. • The Malnutrition Inflammation Score is a good instrument for assessing nutritional state, facilitating the care of dialysis patients. • The time on replacement therapy and the presence of comorbility are two of the main aspects to take into consideration when controlling the nutritional state of patients with chronic kidney disease. • Studies should continue to be carried out on the application of the Malnutrition Inflammation Score in assessing the nutritional state and the level of evidence should be modified...|$|E

Polyphenolic compounds in pomegranate especially ellagitannin (hydrolyzed), anthocyanins, gallotannin,and ellagic acid can maintain oral hygiene, healthy skin from the effects of free radicals caused by UV radiation, has the ability to synthesize cholesterol, destroying free radicals in the human vascular system and can prevent prostate cancer. In vitro and in vivo test has shown the fruit is acting as anti diabetic drug, and hypolipidemic, anticarcinogenic, antibacterial, anti <b>inflamation,</b> and antiviral.

40|$|Background: Henoch-Schönlein purpura is {{the most}} common {{vasculitis}} of small blood vessels in children. The diagnosis of the disease is confirmed in a patient with a specific rash, joint <b>inflamation,</b> abdominal pain or renal disease. The specific rash is necesary for the confirmation of the diagnosis. Henoch-Schönlein purpura can rarely present with a complication withot a prior presentation of the rash. In these cases diagnosis is difficult until the presentation of the specific skin manifestation. In the majority of patients the disease course is not complicated and has a good prognosis. Conclusion: In this article we present three patients with an atypical presentation of the disease and a review of current literature on the topic. </p...|$|E

Soreness of oral mucosa under a denture, like all pain is complex uncomfort experience, in which multitude of factors interact from the emotional to the physical. Uneven pressure on tissue support under a denture base is probably initially caused irritate to denture bearing tissue, contribute to causing <b>inflamation</b> and increased sensitivity.

40|$|Recently the {{orthodontic}} treatment needs had increased {{with the increased}} of community incomes. During treatment sometimes there is problem toward periodontal tissue. Fixed appliances that bonded to the teeth surface can cause difficulty in controlling the plaque especially in the marginal region that can cause the <b>inflamation</b> and gingival enlargement. Gingival enlargement due to the local irritation of tha plaque can be treated with plaque control, scaling, root planing until surgery intervention. The {{aim of the treatment}} with surgical intervention for gingival enlargement is to eliminate the gingival pocket so the patient can easily clean the teeth and the disease will not continue. Beside that the gingival contour will recover and become normal agai...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cigarette smoke {{includes}} {{free radicals}} that cause <b>inflamation</b> process which can increase <b>inflamation</b> markers such as alcaline phosphatase (ALP) serum. Fluvastatin has anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting the secretion of the enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) secreted by activated neutrophils which produce serum ALP serum and decreased levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL- 1, IL- 8, and total leukocytes and neutrophils in sepsis rat. Fluvastatin {{also has a}} pro-inflammatory effects that increase the levels of cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) resulting in activation of neutrophils. This study aims {{to determine the effect}} of serum ALP levels. Methods : This study is an experimental study with pre and post test only control group design. Rats that had undergone adaptation for 1 week were divided rendomly into 3 groups each 6 rats and induced by cigarette smoke. KA was given fluvastatin 5 mg/kgBW, KB was given fluvastatin 10 mg/kgBW, and K without fluvastatin per-oral. AlP levels is checked by spctrofotometry (unit/cc) before an after exposure by 2 cigarettes/days in 4 weeks. Normal distributes data were analized by One Way Annova test and data that were not normally distributed were analized by the Krusskal Wallis test Result: Difference in serum ALP levels before and after exposure to cigarette smoke K: 226. 8; KA: 180. 17; KB: 378. 0 with p> 0. 05 between groups C and KA and p < 0. 05 between KB and K and KA and KB. Conclusion: Fluvastatin can not inhibit the increase of ALP levels in wistar rats that were given exposure to 2 cigarettes/days for 4 weeks. Fluvastatin 5 mg/kgBW had mean levels of serum ALP is smaller than the fluvastatin group and the control group 10 mg/KgBB...|$|E

[...] 	Third International Jellyfish Blooms Symposium, 13 - 16 July 2010, Mar de Plata, ArgentinaDue to its {{influence}} on humans, toxicity of the different Cnidarians groups {{has always been a}} subject of concern. In particular, jellyfish proliferations can highly affect human activities, such as bathing, fishery and tourism, as well as public health. We have used different approaches to evaluate the social impact of the coastal aggregations of the scyphomedusa Pelagia noctiluca (Forsskål, 1775) in Catalonia, one of the most touristic places in Spain. P. noctiluca is known {{to be one of the}} most venomous jellyfish in the Mediterranean. Temporal and spatial distribution of Pelagia noctiluca aggregations, as well as other jellyfish species, along the Catalan coast were investigated. The data was obtained by means of sightings reports collected during the summer seasons of 2007, 2008 and 2009 in the framework of the “Medusa Project”. Jellyfish stinging data from the same time periods were obtained from the Red Cross operation protocols. We detected that the majority of Red Cross attentions showing high number of stung people coincides with the presence, even in very low densities, of Pelagia noctiluca in the swimming areas. We also described Pelagia noctiluca stinging effects on 21 volunteers. Some dermatologic parameters as transepidermal water loss (TEWL); cutaneous blood flow (CBL), skin colour, <b>inflamation</b> degree and pain were measured. Some measurements were maximal at initial contact: TEWL, and pain; while others showed their maximum after 15 minutes: CBL, skin color, and degree of <b>inflamation.</b> All parameters decreased after 1 hour. Our results agree with previous descriptions about erythema, vesicles, and crustPeer Reviewe...|$|E
