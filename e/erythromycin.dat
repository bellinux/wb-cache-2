5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by <b>erythromycin</b> and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to <b>erythromycin</b> therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|Macrolide antibiotics, such as <b>erythromycin,</b> are an {{effective}} treatment for DPB when taken regularly {{over an extended}} period of time. Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of <b>erythromycin</b> for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and blood gas (an arterial blood test that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from <b>erythromycin</b> therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa. However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, <b>erythromycin</b> may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.|$|E
5|$|With <b>erythromycin</b> {{therapy in}} DPB, great {{reduction}} in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} neutrophil proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides {{are not involved in}} their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, <b>erythromycin</b> therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, <b>erythromycin,</b> norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which {{may result in}} its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{frequently}} {{applied to the}} skin or taken orally to treat acne and are thought to work due to their antimicrobial activity against P. acnes {{and their ability to}} reduce inflammation. With the widespread use of antibiotics for acne and an increased frequency of antibiotic-resistant P. acnes worldwide, antibiotics are becoming less effective, especially macrolide antibiotics such as topical <b>erythromycin.</b> Commonly used antibiotics, either applied to the skin or taken orally, include clindamycin, <b>erythromycin,</b> metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and tetracyclines such as doxycycline and minocycline. When antibiotics are applied to the skin, they are typically used for mild to moderately severe acne. Antibiotics taken orally are generally considered to be more effective than topical antibiotics, and produce faster resolution of inflammatory acne lesions than topical applications. Topical and oral antibiotics are not recommended for use together.|$|E
5|$|Colchicine is an {{alternative}} for those unable to tolerate NSAIDs. At high doses, side effects (primarily gastrointestinal upset) limit its usage. At lower doses, which are still effective, it is well tolerated. Colchicine may interact with other commonly prescribed drugs, such as atorvastatin and <b>erythromycin,</b> among others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Erythromycin</b> {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies. First-generation cephalosporins {{may be used in}} those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin. Streptococcal infections may also lead to acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|If left untreated, DPB {{progresses}} to bronchiectasis, an irreversible {{lung condition}} that involves {{enlargement of the}} bronchioles, and pooling of mucus in the bronchiolar passages. Daily treatment of DPB with macrolide antibiotics such as <b>erythromycin</b> eases symptoms and increases survival time, but the disease currently has no known cure. The eventual result of DPB can be respiratory failure and heart problems.|$|E
5|$|Untreated DPB {{leads to}} bronchiectasis, {{respiratory}} failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%. With <b>erythromycin</b> treatment, individuals with DPB {{now have a}} much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like P.aeruginosa. The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment {{has been allowed to}} end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, <b>erythromycin</b> therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.|$|E
5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin sodium, penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (azithromycin, <b>erythromycin</b> estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic <b>erythromycin</b> became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E
5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, <b>erythromycin,</b> and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|Several {{antibiotics}} {{have been}} used successfully to treat S.iniae infection in fish. Enrofloxacin, a quinolone antibiotic, {{has been used to}} great effect in hybrid striped bass (Morone chrysops× M.saxatilis), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain. Amoxicillin, <b>erythromycin,</b> furazolidone, and oxytetracycline have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi). Vaccination against S.iniae has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a {{completely}} synthetic drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike <b>erythromycin</b> and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most beta-lactams, which are semisynthetic). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid {{have been reported in}} the chemistry literature. Despite good yields, the original method (developed by Upjohn for pilot plant-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as palladium on carbon and the highly sensitive reagents methanesulfonyl chloride and n-butyllithium—and needs low-temperature conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis. A somewhat more concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, nefazodone, sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, <b>erythromycin,</b> diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E
5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to <b>erythromycin</b> therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, <b>erythromycin,</b> and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as <b>erythromycin</b> and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythromycin</b> {{is easily}} inactivated by gastric acid; therefore, all orally {{administered}} formulations are given as either enteric-coated or more-stable salts or esters, such as <b>erythromycin</b> ethylsuccinate. <b>Erythromycin</b> is very rapidly absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due {{to the high}} concentration in phagocytes, <b>erythromycin</b> is actively transported {{to the site of}} infection, where, during active phagocytosis, large concentrations of <b>erythromycin</b> are released.|$|E
25|$|Standard-grade <b>erythromycin</b> is {{primarily}} composed of four related compounds known as erythromycins A, B, C, and D. Each of these compounds can {{be present in}} varying amounts and can differ by lot. <b>Erythromycin</b> A {{has been found to}} have the most antibacterial activity, followed by <b>erythromycin</b> B. Erythromycins C and D are about half as active as <b>erythromycin</b> A. Some of these related compounds have been purified and can be studied and researched individually.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{evidence}} both {{for and against}} the association of pyloric stenosis and exposure to <b>erythromycin</b> prenatally and postnatally. Exposure to <b>erythromycin</b> (especially long courses at antimicrobial doses, and also through breastfeeding) {{has been linked to}} an increased probability of pyloric stenosis in young infants. <b>Erythromycin</b> used for feeding intolerance in young infants has not been associated with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythromycin</b> is metabolized by enzymes of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily, CYP3A. The {{activity of}} the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, e.g. <b>erythromycin.</b> If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor)—are taken concomitantly with <b>erythromycin,</b> levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted drug interaction involves <b>erythromycin</b> and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels {{and the potential for}} rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if <b>erythromycin</b> is associated.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythromycin</b> {{can be used}} in children, and {{tetracycline}} in adults. Some studies show, however, that <b>erythromycin</b> rapidly eliminates Campylobacter {{from the}} stool without affecting the duration of illness. Nevertheless, children with dysentery due to C. jejuni benefit from early treatment with <b>erythromycin.</b> Treatment with antibiotics, therefore, depends on the severity of symptoms. Quinolones are effective if the organism is sensitive, but high rates of quinolone use in livestock means that quinolones are now largely ineffective.|$|E
25|$|Eryc (<b>erythromycin)</b> an antibiotic.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol has an {{additive}} effect {{when combined with}} zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly. <b>Erythromycin</b> appears to increase the absorption rate of zopiclone and prolong its elimination half-life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. Itraconazole has a similar effect on zopiclone pharmacokinetics as <b>erythromycin.</b> The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the <b>erythromycin</b> and itraconazole drug interaction with zopiclone. Temporary dosage reduction during combined therapy may be required, especially in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Earlier {{case reports}} on sudden death {{prompted}} {{a study on}} a large cohort that confirmed a link between <b>erythromycin,</b> ventricular tachycardia, and sudden cardiac death in patients also taking drugs that prolong the metabolism of <b>erythromycin</b> (like verapamil or diltiazem) by interfering with CYP3A4. Hence, <b>erythromycin</b> should not be administered to people using these drugs, or drugs that also prolong the QT interval. Other examples include terfenadine (Seldane, Seldane-D), astemizole (Hismanal), cisapride (Propulsid, withdrawn in many countries for prolonging the QT time) and pimozide (Orap). Theophylline, which is used mostly in asthma, is also contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam {{interacts with}} the {{antibiotic}} <b>erythromycin</b> which is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. This interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of <b>erythromycin</b> to the patient, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had acute pneumonia and renal failure. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with <b>erythromycin</b> may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other significant physical complications.|$|E
25|$|Scientists at Chugai Pharmaceuticals {{discovered}} an erythromycin-derived motilin agonist called mitemcinal that {{is believed to}} have strong prokinetic properties (similar to <b>erythromycin)</b> but lacking antibiotic properties. <b>Erythromycin</b> is commonly used off-label for gastric motility indications such as gastroparesis. If mitemcinal can be shown to be an effective prokinetic agent, it would represent a significant advance in the gastrointestinal field, as treatment with this drug would not carry the risk of unintentional selection for antibiotic-resistant bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{concomitant}} use of sibutramine {{and drugs}} which inhibit CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole and <b>erythromycin,</b> may increase plasma levels of sibutramine.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017 it was {{marketed as}} a topical {{combination}} drug with <b>erythromycin</b> under the brand names Isotrex Eritromicina, Isotrexin, and Munderm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythromycin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes respiratory tract infections, skin infections, chlamydia infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and syphilis. It may also be used during pregnancy to prevent Group B streptococcal infection in the newborn. <b>Erythromycin</b> may be used to improve delayed stomach emptying. It can be given intravenously and by mouth. An eye ointment is routinely recommended after delivery to prevent eye infections in the newborn.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} cornerstone {{in treating}} rheumatic fever includes the continual use of low-dose antibiotics (such as penicillin, sulfadiazine, or <b>erythromycin)</b> to prevent recurrence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Erythromycin</b> is {{available}} in enteric-coated tablets, slow-release capsules, oral suspensions, ophthalmic solutions, ointments, gels, enteric-coated capsules, non enteric-coated tablets, non enteric-coated capsules, and injections.|$|E
25|$|Cytochrome P450 eryF (CYP107A1) {{originally}} from the actinomycete bacterium Saccharopolyspora erythraea {{is responsible for}} the biosynthesis of the antibiotic <b>erythromycin</b> by C6-hydroxylation of the macrolide 6-deoxyerythronolide B.|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, omeprazole, oxcarbazepine, ticlopidine, topiramate, ketoconazole, itraconazole, disulfiram, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, <b>erythromycin,</b> probenecid, propranolol, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluoxetine, and {{valproic acid}} prolong {{the action of}} {{diazepam}} by inhibiting its elimination.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotic}} clarithromycin {{was invented}} by scientists at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in the 1970s {{as a result of}} their efforts to overcome the acid instability of <b>erythromycin.</b>|$|E
