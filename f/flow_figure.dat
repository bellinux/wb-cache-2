Discharge {{at the lake}} outlet will vary based on the normal depth calculated from the lake and channel characteristics. Channel roughness is a characteristic described by the Gauckler-Manning coefficient (also called Manning's n). Channel roughness can be determined using Manning's Roughness Coefficients which describes the channel in terms of vegetation and size of bed sediment. Channel slope can be found using topographic maps to determine changes in elevation along the channel. The level of the lake (y) above the outlet is used for determining discharge, and can be determined by measuring the lake level relative to the channel bottom.

40|$|High-speed planing {{boats are}} widely popular but little is {{understood}} about their stability at high speeds. Many of these craft {{are known to}} experience unexpected behavior at operational speeds. Research at the University of Michigan intending to understand dynamic instability has used a water impact model to determine the flow over a cross-section of the hull. The impact model takes a two-dimensional section of the hull and predicts how the flow moves over the bottom as the hull section enters the water. By using a low order strip theory and viewing the planing hull {{as a series of}} cross-sections at different points of impact (near the bow the hull is just starting to enter the water while near the transom the hull has mostly entered the water), this model determines the transverse flow characteristics over the entire hull. The resulting boundary value problem can be numerically solved using a two-dimensional vortex distribution. At the last IWWWFB conference, the authors discussed Xu’s model for asymmetric impact along with the governing equations and problem formulation for symmetric impact with horizontal velocity [1]. The present work begins with a brief review of Xu’s work and the motivation for understanding horizontal velocity during impact. The solutions to the governing equations are then presented as well as results for both symmetric and asymmetric impact with horizontal velocity. Xu [3] developed a model for asymmetric impact which was built on Vorus’s [2] work. Vorus’s model allowed for arbitrary sectional contour impact, reordering the variables in the first order in a physically consistent manner. Xu described two types of impact due to asymmetry. Type A <b>flow,</b> <b>Figure</b> 1, was when there was small asymmetry and the water moved out towards the chine {{on both sides of the}} keel.

For the prototypical flow north of Pavonis Mons (Fig. I), such a balance leads to a flow morphology that approximately self-replicates at all locations along the flow path [2, 3]. Moreover, most quantitative characteristics of emplacement (e. g., viscosity, volumetric flow rate) of the prototype flow at Pavonis Mons resembled those of large channelized lava flows on Earth.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the {{analysis}} of <b>flow</b> <b>figures</b> {{turned out to be}} essential for labour market research and policy advice. The ongoing debate about how flexible is the German labour market could not been answered just analysing stock figures or turnover rates. Here we follow the useful analytical framework of transitional labour markets dealing centrally with <b>flow</b> <b>figures.</b> By developing a multi-account system (MAS) we go some steps ahead compared to indicators like job and labour turnover rates. First we combine the information of administrative data of the micro level with macro data containing pupils, self employed, retired persons. Embedded in an external framework, which is given by demography, the MAS describes the transition process of the labour market on the regional level and contains all 180 local employment agencies in Germany. The multi-account model thus serves as a basis for strategically aligning each agency with the individual local situation of the labour market by explicitly taking into account the regional specifics. Thus it helps for future strategic decisions of active labour market policy, which has been regionalized increasingly. For estimating the unknown transitions of the data matrix we use a new algorithm the so called ADETON tool, which has the additional merit comparing to other entropy maximizing methods, that constraints can be formulated in a fuzzy way rather than exactly. Further we demonstrate on the basis of three agencies (Ingolstadt, Memmingen, Halle) some practice and numerical examples concerning transitions from vocational training to the following labour market status. We state that the analytical potential of this instrument is not yet exhausted. In any event, it is already clear that the information content of this model by far exceeds that of a system of individual indicators. Details and relations of the regional labour market become apparent which show a high-resolution image of possible obsolete structures or increasing labour market dynamics. The model thus gives clear hints as to the scope and limits of the active labour market policy. ...|$|R
