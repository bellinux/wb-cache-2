50|$|The {{results of}} the last two presidential {{elections}} show an electorate anchored to the left, in a town that has elected a mayor belonging to the French Communist Party between 1995 and 2014; the results of regional elections and the last two parliamentary elections confirm this trend. The incumbent mayor did not seek a fifth term in municipal elections in 2014 which the voting, similar to the municipal elections in 2008, does not bring out a decisive political orientation. The European election results do not lend themselves to analysis with a relatively low participation and voting in one round which promotes the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> but for the first time, the electorate middle class nominated National Front candidates {{at the top of their}} votes.|$|E
40|$|Voting Theory {{generally}} {{concludes that}} -in first-past-the-post elections- 1) All voters {{should go to}} effective candidates (Duverger's Law); 2) Parties' platform should converge (Median Voter Theorem). Observations, though, suggest that such predictions are not met in practice. We show that divergence and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> is a natural election outcome when there is uncertainty and repetition of elections. "Voting for Losers" increases the informational content of elections, and forces main parties to relocate towards extremists. As a result, they maximize their probability of being elected, not by converging to the median but by diverging to a certain extent. Ideological behavior results then from optimizing considerations alone. ...|$|E

The study uses graphic representations of the HJ-Biplot method to perform holistic analysis. This method is effective for qualitative evaluation of relationships. Based on observations from 146 listed companies, this study compares two different contexts and governance backgrounds. Results show that governance mechanisms affect firm performance differently depending on whether firms are operating in a context characterized by concentration or <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>voting</b> rights. Sector and company size also influence corporate governance mechanisms and firm performance. This holistic approach yields important contributions to the literature because, despite the number of studies that exist, there is still insufficient understanding of how specific governance mechanisms affect company valuation and performance. This study demonstrates the importance and influences that sector of activity, company size, and context have in developing proper corporate governance mechanisms...|$|R
30|$|A {{closer look}} at Table  2 however reveals {{different}} voting patterns between the Tunisians {{at home and abroad}} when it comes to middle-size and small-size parties. First, medium-size parties usually obtain better results abroad. In 2011, four out of five parties that ranked behind the winner of the election (EnNahda) had much better results abroad than at home (from three to four points). Similarly, in 2014, three out of four parties that ranked behind Nidaa Tounes and EnNahda had better results abroad than at home (from one to three points). Conversely, small size parties (“others” in Table  2) have better results at home than abroad. In other words, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vote</b> is much greater in Tunisia than abroad.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the process of}} coalition-making {{and the result of}} the third provincial election, which was held on April 20 and June 20, 2013 in Iraq. Through detailed analysis of the coalition-making process as well as the patterns of the results in each province, this paper concludes the following three points: First, most, if not all parties attempted to form party-coalitions strategically. The main parties, which had a certain number of seats in the parliament, reorganized their alliance into six huge coalitions. The other parties also reorganized their alliances into bigger party coalitions. Second, {{as a result of this}} strategic coalition-making, the main parties maintained their votes while the other parties remarkably increased their seats by avoiding the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> among one another.

40|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of {{information}} and uncertainty which has been used recently in different areas, besides of its original utilization in physics. Finance, microeconomics, macroeconomics, utility functions or even psychology are approached areas, using analogies between the areas physics and nature, creating a new research area: Econophysics (see, for example, Ausloos et al, 1999 or Bouchaud, 2002). This paper intends to explore the utilization of entropy through politics and election results, an area just slightly explored (Gill, 2005). It generalizes interpretation of entropy, considering it a measure of dissatisfaction and disillusion of populations in relation to politics. Some phenomena like the increase of abstention in a country, consequence of the dissatisfaction of population and of their alienation in relation to politics could be detected and analysed. This discontentment could result, for example, in the appearance of new political parties, with more division of votes and increasing entropy (result of the discontentment and uncertainty by electors). Absolute majorities, while imply less <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes,</b> are synonym of more confidence in a given party, making a reduction of entropy. Electoral results could also be influenced by particular phenomena, like those terrorist attacks made in vespers of the two last elections in Spain, with consequences on the affluence to the polls by electors, and influencing levels of entropy. Elections' dates could also influence results: for example, elections on summer season suffer from more abstention. Elections' results could also be connected with aspects like safety feeling of citizens, with unpopular socio-economic policies taken by government or even with the economic performance of a country. One of the purposes {{of this paper is to}} find these types of phenomena and try to relate them with the concept of entropy. Another objective is to analyse the reality in different European countries. ...|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{question}} <b>of</b> detecting electronic <b>voting</b> fraud based on count data alone, specifically {{focusing on the}} 2004 Venezuelan recall election. The opposition (YES, in favour of recalling sitting president Hugo Chavez), which lost the referendum, alleged {{that the government had}} committed electronic voting fraud. In this work, we use the count data to investigate two of the opposition’s claims, ultimately concluding that the claims cannot be upheld by the count data alone. The first allegation is based on the total number of ties (defined below) for the YES/NO in each particular station. In this paper we compare four or five models for the count data. We present an FDR analysis of 6507 roughly independent test statistics that shows no systematic fraud in the form of “vote-capping” and {{no significant differences between the}} <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the YES <b>votes</b> and the NO votes. The second allegation involves Benford’s Law, which is a model for the “significant digits” of an observation. If we look at the significant digit distribution of elections generated by a “fair election model” (the null model used by the YES side as evidence of fraud), we see that Benford’s Law does not hold. Finally, we conclude with a simple scenario of fraud that is statistically undetectable based on solely the count data. Hence, ou...|$|R
40|$|Static {{mechanical}} properties (e. g. elastic modulus) and fatigue properties of a material all have dispersions. Material inhomogeneity (it {{can be characterized}} well by the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> elastic modulus) is the internal factor <b>of</b> <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> fatigue properties and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the load is the external factor. In this paper, according to theoretical derivation and preliminary experiments verification, the following relationships between <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> fatigue properties and <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> static {{mechanical properties}} of a material are obtained: the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> fatigue life is n (the fatigue index) times of the sum <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> elastic modulus and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the load.

40|$|To {{study the}} role <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> atrial repolarization (DAR) in {{the genesis of}} atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), monophasic action potentials (MAP) were recorded simultaneously from a catheter at the high lateral right atrium (HLRA) and a catheter moving around the high, middle and low lateral right atrium (RA) the high, anterior and posterior septal RA and the RA appendage in 15 patients with paroxysmal AF and 15 patients with atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia (AVNRT) or concealed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) without history of AF. After recordings during sinus rhythm (SR), MAPs were recorded during programmed stimulation (PS) via the HLRA catheter at a drive cycle length (CL) of 500 ms. Thus, MAPs were recorded simultaneously from 2 sites {{at a time and}} sequentially from 4 to 12 sites during SR, drive pacing and PS. Taking the MAP at the HLRA as reference, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization time (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT) and its two components, the <b>dispersions</b> <b>of</b> activation time (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT) and MAP duration (<b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration) among the 4 to 12 sites were calculated and taken as parameters of DAR. RESULTS: During SR and PS, the maximal <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT was significantly greater in AF than in control patients, 113 +/- 49 ms vs 50 +/- 28 ms (P< 0. 001) and 114 +/- 56 vs 70 +/- 43 ms (P< 0. 05) respectively. The increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> RT in the AF group was caused by increases in both <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> MAP duration and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> AT.

This study {{tested the}} {{correlation}} of QT and JT dispersion and other potentially useful electrocardiographic (ECG) indexes with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization and recovery time. Background. <b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization is currently being assessed noninvasively from the surface ECG by means of QT and JT dispersion, although their correlation with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> repolarization as measured directly from the myocardium is not well established. Methods. Multiple monophasic action potentials were recorded simultaneously with a 12 -lead ECG from isolated Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. The QT and JT dispersion was compared with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> monophasic action potential duration at 90 % repolarization (APD 90) and with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> recovery time. As new ECG indexes, total T wave area, T wave area after the peak (late T wave area) and T peak to T end interval were also tested. Results. The QT and JT dispersion showed a significant correlation with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> APD 90 and the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> recovery time (r values between 0. 58 and 0. 64, respectively, p < 0. 001). However, total T wave area showed better correlation, respectively, with <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> APD 90 and recovery time (r = 0. 79 and r = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001), as did late T wave area (r = 0. 81 and r = 0. 81, p < 0. 0001) and T peak to T end interval (r = 0. 81 and r = 0. 82, p < 0. 0001).

The time difference between {{the ends of the}} two monophasic action potentials were used as a measure <b>of</b> the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization, which consists of the activation time difference and the monophasic action potential duration difference. During double and triple programmed stimulation, the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization increased significantly with the shortening of the coupling interval but decreased slightly with the shortening of the preceding interval. The induction of the ventricular arrhythmias in these patients was invariably associated with a marked increase in the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular repolarization.
