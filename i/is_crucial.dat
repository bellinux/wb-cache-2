5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E
5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E

5|$|Studies in Europe and North America {{have shown}} {{dramatic}} declines in bee colonies. The U.S. has lost 59% of its bee colonies since 1947, and Europe has lost over 25% since 1985. Determining {{the causes of}} bee colony collapse <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to the global economy, as bee pollination assists with 9.5% of the global agricultural production worth billions of dollars.|$|E
5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{identify}} intention is critical to joint attention. When individuals understand that others have goals, intentions, and attentional states, {{they are able to}} enter into and direct another's attention. Joint attention promotes and maintains dyadic exchanges and learning about the nature of social partners. The ability to engage in joint attention <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> for language development.|$|E

5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and airspeed changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|The mass balance, or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of a glacier <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. A glacier with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers {{have a negative}} mass balance and are retreating.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two phases}} for P. rebeli {{complete}} {{integration into the}} Myrmica schencki ant colony: initial integration and full integration. In both stages of integration, the P. rebeli caterpillar is brought into the brood nest; however, in full integration, the P. rebeli also achieves its high social status within the host society. That status <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> for surviving periods of host colony stress such as food shortage.|$|E

5|$|Worker {{death is}} an {{important}} factor in colony failure, and is the cause of 13–76% of colony failures. This may be in part due to the small colony size. Because the colonies are small, worker longevity <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> for the survival of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Boone {{runs through}} the jungle, and locates Shannon tied to a tree. Boone frees her and they run away from the {{pursuing}} monster. The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek, watching her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill Locke, screaming that he had killed his sister, but Locke reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to have a vision that, according to Locke, <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to his experience on the island. Boone says seeing Shannon dead made him feel relieved. Locke says to come with him, and the two disappear into the jungle.|$|E

5|$|Deckard's unicorn-dream sequence, {{inserted}} into the Director's Cut and concomitant with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn, is {{seen by many as}} showing that Deckard is a replicant—because Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories. The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity, or that the absence of a decisive answer <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> to the film's main theme. The film's inherent ambiguity and uncertainty, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from multiple perspectives.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been eroded by the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may be further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions <b>is</b> <b>crucial</b> if good order is to be restored to the system.|$|E

For such a three-page topological book embedding in which spine crossings are allowed, every graph can be embedded with at most a logarithmic number of spine crossings per edge, and some graphs need this many spine crossings.|$|E
