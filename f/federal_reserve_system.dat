5|$|American {{televangelist}} Pat Robertson, {{with his}} 1991 best-selling book The New World Order, {{became the most}} prominent Christian popularizer of conspiracy theories about recent American history. He describes a scenario where Wall Street, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System,</b> the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission control the flow of events from behind the scenes, nudging people constantly and covertly {{in the direction of}} world government for the Antichrist.|$|E
5|$|Conspiracy theorists {{generally}} {{speculate that}} the New World Order is being implemented gradually, citing {{the formation of the}} U.S. <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> in 1913; the League of Nations in 1919; the International Monetary Fund in 1944; the United Nations in 1945; the World Bank in 1945; the World Health Organization in 1948; the European Union and the euro currency in 1993; the World Trade Organization in 1998; the African Union in 2002; and the Union of South American Nations in 2008 as major milestones.|$|E

5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System)</b> that the preferable {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{final report}} of the National Monetary Commission was {{published}} on January 11, 1911. For nearly two years legislators debated the proposal {{and it was not}} until December 23, 1913, that Congress passed the Federal Reserve Act. President Woodrow Wilson signed the legislation immediately and the legislation was enacted on the same day, December 23, 1913, creating the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System.</b> Charles Hamlin became the Fed's first chairman, and none other than Morgan's deputy Benjamin Strong became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the most important regional bank with a permanent seat on the Federal Open Market Committee.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{played a}} major part in {{the passage of the}} Legal Tender Act of 1862, when {{for the first time the}} United States issued {{currency}} backed only by its own credit, not by gold or silver. Early makeshifts to finance the war, such as war bonds, had failed as it became clear the war would not be short. In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the National Banking Act, that required that banks limit their currency issues to the amount of federal bonds that they were required to hold. The system endured for a half-century, until supplanted by the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> in 1913.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the core}} {{economic}} functions, consumption, production, and investment, have become highly globalized in recent decades. While consumers increasingly import foreign goods or purchase domestic goods produced with foreign inputs, businesses continue to expand production internationally to meet an increasingly globalized consumption in the world economy. International financial integration among nations has afforded investors the opportunity to diversify their asset portfolios by investing abroad. Consumers, multinational corporations, individual and institutional investors, and financial intermediaries (such as banks) are the key economic actors within the global financial system. Central banks (such as the European Central Bank or the U.S. <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System)</b> undertake open market operations {{in their efforts to}} realize monetary policy goals. International financial institutions such as the Bretton Woods institutions, multilateral development banks and other development finance institutions provide emergency financing to countries in crisis, provide risk mitigation tools to prospective foreign investors, and assemble capital for development finance and poverty reduction initiatives. Trade organizations such as the World Trade Organization, Institute of International Finance, and the World Federation of Exchanges attempt to ease trade, facilitate trade disputes and address economic affairs, promote standards, and sponsor research and statistics publications.|$|E
5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> in 1913, the establishment of deposit insurance {{in the form of the}} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid). See Post-World War II economic expansion for further discussion.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} Federal Reserve Act in 1913, {{giving rise to}} the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System.</b> Its {{inception}} drew influence from the Panic of 1907, underpinning legislators' hesitance in trusting individual investors, such as John Pierpont Morgan, to serve again as a lender of last resort. The system's design also considered {{the findings of the}} Pujo Committee's investigation of the possibility of a money trust in which Wall Street's concentration of influence over national financial matters was questioned and in which investment bankers were suspected of unusually deep involvement in the directorates of manufacturing corporations. Although the committee's findings were inconclusive, the very possibility was enough to motivate support for the long-resisted notion of establishing a central bank. The Federal Reserve's overarching aim was to become the sole lender of last resort and to resolve the inelasticity of the United States' money supply during significant shifts in money demand. In addition to addressing the underlying issues that precipitated the international ramifications of the 1907 money market crunch, New York's banks were liberated from the need to maintain their own reserves and began undertaking greater risks. New access to rediscount facilities enabled them to launch foreign branches, bolstering New York's rivalry with London's competitive discount market.|$|E

5|$|Frank A. Vanderlip was {{president}} of the National City Bank of New York, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and a founder of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System.</b> He lived at the Beechwood estate and created the first Montessori school in the United States, the Scarborough School, nearby. Vanderlip also helped found and was the first president of Scarborough's Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Marian Cruger Coffin, a landscape architect, was born and grew up in Scarborough. The twentieth and last Third Assistant Secretary of State, J. Butler Wright, also lived in Scarborough, at Woodlea, later the golf house for Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Emily Taft Douglas, a U.S. Representative and wife of Senator Paul Douglas, lived in Briarcliff Manor from 1986 to her death in 1994. Composer and conductor Aaron Copland, famous for Rodeo and Fanfare for the Common Man, began spending weekdays at Mary Churchill's house in Briarcliff Manor in early 1929, and had a post office box in Briarcliff Manor. He spent almost a month living there before moving to nearby Bedford; his ultimate residence is in nearby Cortlandt Manor. Brooke Astor, a philanthropist, socialite, and member of the Astor family, lived in Briarcliff Manor for much of her life. Children's author C. B. Colby was on the village board, was the village's Fire Commissioner, and researched for the village historical society's 1977 history book. He lived on Pine Road until his death in 1977. Anna Roosevelt Halsted lived with Curtis Bean Dall on Sleepy Hollow Road; their children, Eleanor and Curtis, attended the Scarborough School. Blanchette Ferry Rockefeller, twice-president of the Museum of Modern Art, lived in the village until her death. Eugene T. Booth, a nuclear physicist and Manhattan Project developer, lived in the village. John Cheever lived in Scarborough, and spent most of his writing career in Westchester towns such as Briarcliff Manor and Ossining. He served in the Briarcliff Manor Fire Department. Coby Whitmore, a painter and magazine illustrator, lived in the village from 1945 to 1965. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and journalist John Hersey attended public school and lived in Briarcliff Manor; he was the village's first Eagle Scout and a lifeguard at the village pool, and his mother Grace Baird Hersey was a village librarian. Folk singer and songwriter Tom Glazer lived on Long Hill Road for almost 30 years. Mathematician Bryant Tuckerman, who helped develop the Data Encryption Standard, was a long-time village resident.|$|E
25|$|Another {{instrument}} of monetary policy adjustment {{employed by the}} <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> is the fractional reserve requirement, {{also known as the}} required reserve ratio. The required reserve ratio sets the balance that the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> requires a depository institution to hold in the Federal Reserve Banks, which depository institutions trade in the federal funds market discussed above. The required reserve ratio is set by the Board of Governors of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System.</b> The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> {{can also}} {{increase}} the money supply by allowing banks to issue more loans, which is accomplished by reducing the reserve requirement ratio. This regulation of banks is pursuant to the Commerce Clause. Conversely, the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> can reduce the money supply by selling securities or by increasing the reserve requirement ratio.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> (also {{known as}} the Federal Reserve or simply the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the {{enactment}} of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises. Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> {{implements}} {{monetary policy}} largely by targeting {{the federal funds}} rate. This is the interest rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans of federal funds, which are the reserves held by banks at the Fed. This rate is actually determined by the market and is not explicitly mandated by the Fed. The Fed therefore tries to align the effective federal funds rate with the targeted rate by adding or subtracting from the money supply through open market operations. The <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System</b> usually adjusts the federal funds rate target by 0.25% or 0.50% at a time.|$|E

25|$|Paper {{money is}} a form of {{currency}} that is physically printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, under authority of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System.</b> The Bureau of Engraving and Printing is part of the U.S. Treasury Department, whereas the Federal Reserve is not. In contrast to paper money, coins are physically produced by the U.S. Mint, within and under authority of the U.S. Treasury.

50|$|Part of the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> <b>System's</b> {{mission was}} {{to act as a}} lender of last resort to banks during {{financial}} panics. However, the Board of Governors did not have enough authority to mandate policies or act independently. Many of the governors, as well as members of Congress and the public, wanted the <b>Federal</b> <b>Reserve</b> to be more active as the Great Depression began—for instance, by increasing the amount of money in circulation and liquidating financial markets. Opponents of these proposals believed that they would eventually create high inflation, hurting the economy in the long term.|$|R
