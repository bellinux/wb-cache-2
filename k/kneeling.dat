5|$|It is {{possible}} to prevent the onset of prepatellar bursitis, or prevent the symptoms from worsening, by avoiding trauma to the knee or frequent <b>kneeling.</b> Protective knee pads can also help prevent prepatellar bursitis for those whose professions require frequent <b>kneeling</b> and for athletes who play contact sports, such as American football, basketball, and wrestling.|$|E

5|$|The Combat: Woman Pleading for the Vanquished {{is a large}} painting, 399cm (13ft 1in) across. It {{depicts a}} {{defeated}} soldier, <b>kneeling</b> in front of another soldier. The defeated fighter strains to free himself from {{the grip of the}} victorious warrior, who stands, raising a sword. A <b>kneeling</b> woman clutches the waist of the victorious soldier, raising her face to him to beg him to spare his defeated foe. The defeated warrior has a stronger body, a face more in keeping with the conventions of attractiveness at the time, and a more sympathetic expression, while the victorious man is darker skinned and has an expression of blank fierceness. The vanquished soldier's sword has broken, and lies beside him on the ground.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of <b>kneeling</b> and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the Sinai and Palestine to the east during his reign. The art historian William Stevenson Smith has pointed out, that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting {{that they may not}} be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of <b>kneeling</b> captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II {{as well as in the}} tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.|$|E

5|$|During royal coronations, however, {{separate}} banners {{for each}} of the two constituent nations of the Commonwealth were still used. Crown (i.e., Polish) and Lithuanian standard-bearers carried the furled banners in a procession to the royal cathedral where, shortly after the anointment and just before the crowning of the king-elect, they handed the banners to the primate who unfurled them and handed them to the <b>kneeling</b> king. The king would then stand up and give the unfurled banners back to the standard-bearers.|$|E

5|$|James VI's {{inheritance}} of the English crown in 1603 led to rule via the Privy Council from London. He also increasingly controlled the {{meetings of the}} Scottish General Assembly and increased the number and powers of the Scottish bishops. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through Five Articles, which included practices that had been retained in England but largely abolished in Scotland, most controversially <b>kneeling</b> for the reception of communion. Although ratified, they created widespread opposition and resentment and were {{seen by many as}} a step back to Catholic practice.|$|E

40|$|Banished from Rome, Coriolanus seeks his {{revenge on}} Rome {{along with his}} blood enemy Aufidius. In order to dissuade Coriolanus from {{destroying}} Rome, his mother Volumnia <b>kneels</b> at his feet and entreats him to call off the attack. The scene, {{which is one of}} the most significant in the play, is supposed to strike a chord with the audience. Yet it cannot actually sympathetic. Why is this? One of the reasons is that repetition of the action that one <b>kneels</b> weakens its sacredness. Volumnia <b>kneels</b> to him, yet this rather degrades Coriolanus by repeating what he is expected to do before citizens to be a consul. The other reason is that the figures of plebeians, who stand between Coriolanus and citizens, and seduce the latter, come to be identical with Volumnia, who now faces up to Coriolanus for the people in Rome. The last and the most significant is the sense of exaggeration which is revealed in a physical movement when one <b>kneels.</b> Coriolanus, who hates to <b>kneel</b> to anyone, refuses to show his scars that he has got in fights. Setting a high value on his conduct as a general, he dislikes the idea that his scars speak for him. Yielding to Volumnia 2 ̆ 7 s appeal, Coriolanus <b>kneels</b> before her. He has acknowledged that the sense of excessiveness is produced when one <b>kneels,</b> and he hates it, and yet he accepts his mother who <b>kneels</b> before him. At the end of the play, Coriolanus is assassinated by Volscian citizens who call him a betrayer. If any sense of tragedy cannot be felt inhis death, it could be because that Coriolanus is undone by the sense of exaggeration that Volumnia brings when she <b>kneels,</b> and his death cannot evoke the sympathy of the audience...|$|R
5|$|Modelling is {{far from}} the only {{possible}} way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's Stefaneschi Triptych, 1320, illustrates recursion in the form of mise en abyme; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the <b>kneeling</b> figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering. Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings such as his 1917 Great Metaphysical Interior explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by trauma to the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent <b>kneeling.</b>|$|E

5|$|The mid-11th century Gosforth Cross {{located in}} Cumbria, England, has been {{interpreted}} as featuring various figures from Norse mythology.

5|$|The various nicknames {{associated}} with prepatellar bursitis {{arise from the}} fact that it commonly occurs among those individuals whose professions require frequent <b>kneeling,</b> such as carpenters, carpet layers, gardeners, housemaids, mechanics, miners, plumbers, and roofers. The exact incidence of the condition is not known; it is difficult to estimate because only severe septic cases require hospital admission, and mild non-septic cases generally go unreported. Prepatellar bursitis is more common among males than females. It affects all age groups, but is more likely to be septic when it occurs in children.|$|E
