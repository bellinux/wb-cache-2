40|$|Lipases from {{different}} sources and two mycelium-bound lipases, {{in a free}} or immobilized form, in ginger starch film were screened as biocatalysts in the reaction of (R,S) - 1 -phenylethanol (1) with vinyl acetate and other acylating agents. The effect of various reaction parameters in the resolution of (1) catalyzed by lipase from Burkholderia cepacia (BCL) immobilized in ginger starch film was evaluated (acyl donor type, alcohol:acyl donor molar ratio, temperature and organic solvent). The catalytic efficiency of BCL immobilized in polymeric blends of ginger starch and polyethylene oxide (PEO), in different compositions, was also studied. Vinyl acetate and <b>iso-propenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> furnished the highest conversion (9 %) and enantiomeric excess (> 99 %) of the (R) -ester. The alcohol:acyl donor molar ratio and temperature optimum were 1 : 1 and 28 ÂºC, respectively. The mixture of n-hexane/glycerol (9 : 1 v:v) was the most adequate for this reaction (conversion 23 %, E > 200). The ginger starch/PEO (7 : 3 m/m) blend was successfully reused six times consecutively...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of two native lipases (lipase from Aspergillus niger and Rhizoupus oligosporus) {{in the resolution}} of (RS) -phenylethylamine (1), varying the temperature, acyl donor type (ethyl acetate, vinyl acetate, <b>iso-propenyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and acetic anhydride) and organic medium, was studied. The effect {{of the nature of}} the anion using native A. niger lipase in n-heptane with a series of imidazolium-based ILs [BMIm][X], where X = BF 4, PF 6, SCN and Cl, was also evaluated. Using the lipase from A. niger, the R- 2 b amide was obtained with conversions from 6 to > 99 % and E-values from 2 to > 200, with n-heptane or n-hexane. This lipase showed better E-values in a two-phase system using n-heptane and [BMIm][PF 6] or [BMIm][BF 4] 9 : 1 (v/v), obtaining values of 9 and 7, respectively, when vinyl acetate was used as the acyl donor, compared to the use of pure n-heptane (E = 2). The series for the anions in terms of decreasing performance was as follows: PF 6 - >BF 4 - > SCN- > Cl-...|$|E
