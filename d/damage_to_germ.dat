40|$|The {{technique}} of premature chromosome condensation (PCC) {{has been used}} primarily to study interphase chromosomes of somatic cells. In this study, mitotic cells were fused to cells from the mouse testes to examine the chromosomes of germ cells. The testes contain various types of cells, both germinal and nongerminal. In these initial studies, four types of PCC morphologies were observed. Chromosome morphology of the PCC and labeling experiments demonstrated the mouse cell origin of various PCC. Attempts were next made to determine the cell types producing the PCC. Spermatogonia, diplotene spermatocytes, secondary spermatocytes and round spermatids are proposed to be {{the origin of the}} PCC morphologies. Some PCC could be banded by G and C banding techniques and the mouse chromosomes identified. ^ Studies were subsequently undertaken to evaluate this technique as a method of evaluating <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>germ</b> cells. Testicular cells from irradiated mice were fused to mitotic cells and the PCC examined. Both round spermatids and secondary spermatocytes exhibited chromosome damage in the form of chromatid breaks.

40|$|BACKGROUND A {{traumatic}} {{injury to}} the primary dentition can cause <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the <b>germ</b> of the permanent successor. As a clinical consequence a dilaceration with root deformation, malpositioning and disturbances of eruption can occur. Surgical repositioning of such a dislocated crown of a developing tooth can be a treatment option. CASE REPORT A four year old patient was referred to our clinic because of a mobile upper primary central incisor and a radiographically visible displaced dental crown. Her history revealed a traumatic dental injury one year ago. Radiologic examination confirmed an inflammatory root resorption on tooth 61 and a dislocation of the developing tooth 21. In order to avoid further displacement due to the inflammation, 61 was extracted at the first appointment. A radiographic image 7 months later showed no improvement in the malposition of tooth 21. Therefore tooth 21 was surgically repositioned into its correct position. Follow-up over 3 years confirmed a continued root development and a full eruption of 21 in its correct position. CONCLUSION Early diagnosis and early treatment of a dislocated permanent tooth <b>germ</b> is essential <b>to</b> allow a favorable outcome.

40|$|Tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) is a cytokine that mediates many of {{the metabolic}} responses after endotoxemia, septicemia, and tissue injury. The effect of TNF on testicular function was determined {{in a series of}} studies in which rhTNF (0, 2, and 4 X 10 (5) units/kg/ 24 hours) was administered by continuous infusion to male Wistar rats maintained on total parenteral nutrition adequate for growing rats. Testicular weight and histology, and plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone levels were determined at 1, 3, and 6 days. Testicular weight decreased within 24 hours and this was associated with a fall in plasma testosterone and increased LH and FSH levels. These changes persisted for 6 days, indicating a loss of testosterone-mediated negative feedback on gonadotropin release. Histologic examination demonstrated significant <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the <b>germ</b> cells in the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium; extensive exfoliation of spermatocytes and spermatids occurred at day six. However the primary spermatogonia in the basal compartment were relatively spared. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> the seminiferous epithelium at earlier times was noted in some tubules.

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate whether exposure to radiofrequency radiation similar to that emitted by mobile phones of second-generation standard Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) induces genotoxic effects in cultured human cells. The cytogenetic effects of GSM- 900 MHz (GSM- 900) RF radiation were investigated using R-banded karyotyping after in vitro exposure of human cells (amniotic cells) for 24 h. The average specific absorption rate (SAR) was 0. 25 W/kg. The exposures were carried out in wire-patch cells (WPCs) under strictly controlled conditions of temperature. The genotoxic effect was assessed immediately or 24 h after exposure using four different samples. One hundred metaphase cells were analyzed per assay. Positive controls were provided by using bleomycin. We found no direct cytogenetic effects of GSM- 900 either 0 h or 24 h after exposure.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} corn germ to withstand the fuel ethanol fermentation process without major <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>germ</b> integrity and germ oil quality, five treatments were designed to explore degerming before fermentation (front-end) and after fermentation (tail-end), and the feasibility of breaking the kernel with minimum shear forces (wet-split). Germ from low-shear (wet-split) tail-end degerming maintained its integrity during the process. The wet-grind pretreatment caused 22 % germ damage, and the subsequent fermentation caused 18 % additional germ damage. The germ recovered after fermentation showed physical strength {{similar to that of}} those isolated by wet means before fermentation. The oils extracted from the tail-end germ fractions had the same low free fatty acid (FFA) content (2 %) and similar low peroxide value (2 meq/kg) as those extracted at the front end. The good oil quality of the tail-end germ fraction was attributed to excellent germ integrity. The oil recovered after traditional dry-grind ethanol production was highly deteriorated, with 22 % FFAs and 9 meq/kg peroxide value because the germ was broken into small pieces during dry grinding. So long as kernel-breakage or size-reduction pretreatments are conducted to retain intact germs or keep them in large pieces before fermentation, the germ can survive the cooking, starch hydrolysis, and yeast metabolism during the ethanol fermentation process. These findings lay a foundation for developing new degerming strategies where the germ can be isolated during or after fermentation, which could be easily integrated into the conventional dry-grind corn ethanol process...|$|E

40|$|Transposable {{elements}} (TEs) {{have the}} capacity to replicate and insert into new genomic locations. This contributs significantly to evolution of genomes, but can also result in DNA breaks and illegitimate recombination, and therefore poses a significant threat to genomic integrity. Excess <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> the <b>germ</b> cell genome results in sterility. A specific RNA silencing pathway, termed the piRNA pathway operates in germ cells of animals to control TE activity. At the core of the piRNA pathway is a ribonucleoprotein complex consisting of a small RNA, called piRNA, and a protein from the PIWI subfamily of Argonaute nucleases. The piRNA pathway relies on the specificity provided by the piRNA sequence to recognize complementary TE targets, while effector functions are provided by the PIWI protein. PIWI-piRNA complexes silence TEs both at the transcriptional level – by attracting repressive chromatin modifications to genomic targets – and at the posttranscriptional level – by cleaving TE transcripts in the cytoplasm. Impairment of the piRNA pathway leads to overexpression of TEs, significantly compromised genome structure and, invariably, germ cell death and sterility. The piRNA pathway is best understood in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and in mouse. This Chapter gives an overview of current knowledge on piRNA biogenesis, and mechanistic details of both transcriptional and posttranscriptional TE silencing by the piRNA pathway. It further focuses on the importance of post-translational modifications and subcellular localization of the piRNA machinery. Finally, it provides a brief description of analogous pathways in other systems...|$|R
40|$|Cyclophosphamide is a bifunctional alkylating agent. Administration of low {{doses of}} {{cyclophosphamide}} to male rats produces severe {{effects on the}} outcome of their progeny. The studies in this thesis show that one week treatment with cyclophosphamide can produce about 30 % post-implantation loss. This indicates that post-testicular spermatozoa are sensitive to alkylating agents. Previous studies have shown that six weeks treatment caused more than 95 % post-implantation loss. The effects of cyclophosphamide treatment on rat spermatozoal nuclei in the testis and epididymis were also addressed in this thesis. Rat cauda epididymal spermatozoa collected after one week of cyclophosphamide treatment showed no change in decondensation pattern in vitro; while samples obtained from rats treated for six weeks showed a slowed chromatin elongation and dispersion pattern. Iodoacetamide binding revealed that there was about a 30 % decrease in the amount of free sulfhydryls in spermatozoal nuclei from six weeks treated samples, while there was no detectable change in one week treated samples. DNA single strand breakage was detected in one week treated samples only in the presence of proteinase K in the lysis solution, while significant amounts of both DNA single strand breakage and DNA cross-links were detected in six weeks treated samples. Using a DNA synthesis in vitro system, it was found that six weeks treatment decreased spermatozoal template function, while one week treatment did not result in any significant difference in DNA template function when compared with the control. It is proposed that as the mele germ cells undergo the chromatin transition processes, the chromatin is in an open dynamic status, which expresses many vulnerable sites of the genome to aklylating agent.

40|$|Further {{investigation}} of possible regulatory pathway of NYD-SP 24 {{demonstrated that the}} cell cycle of NYD-SP 24 overexpressing cells was incompletely blocked at G 2 /M phase, and one of cell cycle-related genes, p 21, shown to be an inducer of differentiation in different types of cell system, was found upregulated in a p 53 -independent manner, consistent with a role of NYD-SP 24 in differentiation. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Spermatogenesis is a unique cell differentiation process consisting of three main phrases, namely mitosis, meiosis and postmeiosis. The differentiation of germ cells in the process involves distinct transcriptional programs, each under control of different transcription factor network. Many testis-specific transcription factors have been reported previously, however, few detailed studies have been done. This thesis describes the characterization and functional studies of a newly discovered testis-specific transcription factor, NYD-SP 24, and the {{investigation of}} the possible regulatory pathway of NYD-SP 24 in spermatogenesis. The results demonstrated that in normal human tissues, NYD-SP 24 was specifically and highly expressed in the testis but not in other somatic tissues, indicating its possible role in spermatogenesis. In the mouse model, mRNA and protein of NYD-SP 24 mouse homolog gene (mNYD-SP 24) were increased in the first wave of spermatogenesis. During the differentiation of germ cells, mNYD-SP 24 mRNA and protein were confined to spermatocyte, round spermatid and spermatozoa. In hyperthermic mouse model, expression of mNYD-SP 24 was decreased following the <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>germ</b> cells by heat shock, but returned to normal level upon recovery of spermatogenesis. These results suggest the involvement of NYD-SP 24 in spermatogenesis. To identify the possible downstream targets of NYD-SP 24, microarray and two-dimension gel technologies were performed in NYD-SP 24 overexpressing cells and control cells. The results of microarray showed that 16 genes were upregulated and 4 genes were downregulated in NYD-SP 24 overexpressing cells. In the two-dimension gel analysis, 12 protein spots were found to be altered significantly, with 8 increased and 4 decreased. Among these proteins, 3 were successfully identified by mass spectrometry. The nuclei localization in germ cells and the ability of NYD-SP 24 to alter gene expression profile suggest that NYD-SP 24 may be a testis-specific transcription factor, involved in gene regulation in spermatogenesis.

40|$|Effects of {{man made}} {{pollutants}} on an ecosystem are initiated at the cellular level where a prime determinant for survival of an organism {{is its ability}} to metabolise and excrete toxic chemicals or their metabolites, thereby preventing cellular toxicity or <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>germ</b> cell DNA. Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) enzymes are responsible (in concert with the remainder of the Ah battery enzymes) for the metabolism of numerous xenobiotics and endogenous compounds, including the metabolic activation of most environmental toxic chemicals and carcinogens. Genetic polymorphisms which affect performance of these enzymatic detoxification systems may alter tolerance to pollutants and thus survival in polluted environments. Alterations in the susceptibility of individuals and the development of resistant populations has arisen by forced selection of populations with variant genes, resulting in increased detoxification capacity. There is evidence for such scenarios of variations in activities of pollutant biotransforming enzymes of fish contributing to survival in polluted estuarine environments and several chemically resistant populations have been identified in the USA and Europe. In fish it has been demonstrated that CYP 1 A enzyme activity is required to activate some carcinogenic xenobiotics to a metabolic state in which they can form DNA adducts. The mechanism of reduced CYP 1 A expression in highly contaminated populations may therefore represent resistance to chemical stressors. European flounder (Platichthys flesus) from some waterways which {{have a long history of}} severe sedimentary contamination do not show elevated levels of CYP 1 A. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether any heritable differences were apparent between offspring from parents inhabiting long-term polluted and pristine areas. Flounder were obtained from a highly polluted estuary in the UK and crossed with fish from a relatively pristine environment. Offspring were raised in communal tanks in order to standardise environmental conditions, and allow investigations into the genetic variation of CYP 1 A. To allow identification of offspring to parental fish, polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated and characterised for the flounder. Novel cDNA probes to transcription factors in the detoxification pathway (AhR 2 and ARNT 2) were cloned for flounder, and RT-PCR / Southern blot methods were developed for quantitation of gene transcript levels. A novel method of CYP 1 A quantification using real-time PCR was developed. PAH and PCB exposure trials were carried out on mixed batch offspring, and CYP 1 A gene transcript levels assessed using Northern blot and real-time PCR techniques. Offspring were genotyped to their parents using the microsatellites obtained, and CYP 1 A transcript levels were correlated with clean and polluted areas. CYP 1 A was further correlated to transcription factor expression, and data are presented. Following exposure to the commercial PCB mixture, Aroclor 1254, CYP 1 A transcript levels were found to be significantly lower in families whose parents originated from a polluted area. This observation indicates that there is a possible genetic component to variation in CYP 1 A levels, and that these fish may have acquired a heritable tolerance to polluted areas. The lack of induction, or correlation with CYP 1 A levels, of AhR 2 and ARNT 2 expression indicates a possible AhR independent pathway for the metabolism of PCBs in the flounder. © Tom Dixon 2003 [URL]...|$|E
