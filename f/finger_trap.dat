25|$|The {{purpose of}} door guards (also known as hinge guards, anti-finger <b>trapping</b> devices, or <b>finger</b> guards) {{is to reduce}} the number of <b>finger</b> <b>trapping</b> {{accidents}} in doors, as doors pose a risk to children especially when closing. Door guards protect fingers in door hinges by covering the gap that is created by opening doors by covering the hinges of doors with a piece of rubber or plastic that wraps from the door frame to the door. There are also door safety products which eject the fingers from the push side of the door as it is being closed.|$|R
50|$|Before surgery can be started, {{the patient}} has to be {{positioned}} {{in such a way}} that the wrist is stabilized. In order to do this, {{the patient has}} to be placed on the operating table with his or her face upward. The wrist of the arm on which will be operated on, has to be placed on a separate operating table on the side of the other operating table. To properly stabilize the wrist, the patient's elbow is flexed and the forearm is immobilized by using a traction apparatus. By using a traction apparatus, it will also become easier to insert the instruments. In general, 4.5-6.8 kilograms of traction is implemented with the aid of <b>finger</b> <b>traps.</b> The surgeon can either opt for nylon <b>finger</b> <b>traps</b> or for wire traps. In most cases, nylon <b>finger</b> <b>traps</b> will be preferred to wire traps, as nylon is a more resilient material and thus distributes the traction force to the skin more evenly. Usually, traction is applied to two fingers, namely the index finger and middle finger. Sometimes it may be necessary to more evenly distribute the traction force on the skin, as the patient's skin may be too fragile or atrophic. The traction brought about by the traction apparatus is then applied to three or even four fingers.The surgeon can either opt for dry arthroscopy or for wet arthroscopy. When performing a dry procedure the wrist can still, if necessary, be approached using open surgery. This may, for example, be required when a TFCC lesion is diagnosed. The latter is not possible when a wet procedure is performed, because the fluid that is used causes expansion of the tissue. To improve visualization within the wrist, an inflow irrigation system is used during surgery. Currently, several systems are available, such as gravity flow, a hand pump, large syringes, or a mechanical infusion pump. For irrigation, lactated Ringer’s solution is generally used. The characteristics of lactated Ringer’s solution are that it is physiological and rapidly absorbed. Moreover, the right equipment must be available to finish a complete diagnostic arthroscopy, as well as to perform various operative procedures. Complications of using an irrigation system is that fluid extravasation into the soft tissues of the forearm can result in a compartment syndrome.|$|R
500|$|In Richard Krzemien's {{original}} draft, Portal {{was referred}} to as Dilo. Executive producer Maurice Hurley saw Portal as being a sort of guard-dog, but thought that the Ferengi turned the concept into [...] "silliness". Director Richard Colla felt that the episode had problems which were only identified after shooting was completed. Riker's notion of sending Chinese <b>finger</b> <b>traps</b> to the Ferengi vessel {{at the end of the}} episode was a reference to The Original Series episode [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] where Chief Engineer Scott beams over a shipload of tribbles to a Klingon ship. Wil Wheaton later recalled that the cast were unhappy with the episode as they didn't like several aspects of it including the fingercuffs joke and the Ferengi in general. The episode also featured the first occasion that Geordi La Forge gave a report to the bridge from the engineering section. The producers liked this image so much that from season two onwards the character became the Chief Engineer.|$|R
5000|$|A Chinese <b>finger</b> <b>trap</b> (also {{known as}} a Chinese finger puzzle, Chinese thumb cuff, Chinese {{handcuffs}} and similar variants) is a gag toy used to play a practical joke on unsuspecting children and adults. The <b>finger</b> <b>trap</b> is a simple puzzle that traps the victim's fingers (often the index fingers) in both ends of a small cylinder woven from bamboo. The victim of the joke must push their finger farther inside the [...] for it to loosen.|$|E

Riker responds with a quote from Sun Tzu, [...] "Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy," [...] while not flinching as the attack comes. Portal 63 accepts this and stands down from the challenge, satisfied that the Federation is civilized, and allows the Enterprise to go free. It further offers Riker the opportunity to destroy the Ferengi vessel, but he declines {{on the grounds that the}} Ferengi would learn nothing from such an action. Both away teams return to their ships with power restored, and the Ferengi return the stolen energy converter.

50|$|Timmy {{tells the}} group he snuck {{in through the}} upstairs window, and so the group decide to try and escape. However, while doing so the window slams shut on Samantha's <b>fingers,</b> <b>trapping</b> her and forcing the others to flee. The Detective {{attempts}} to save Samantha, however Radford stabs both to death. Regrouping downstairs, the survivours find a police officer outside the front entrance, however Radford makes the group unable to be seen, and the police officer soon leaves. Desperate, the group resort to {{trying to break the}} projector, and thus stop the movie. However, the door is locked, and so Timmy enters the ventilation system. He makes it to the room and lets the others in, where Harley breaks the projector just in time to save Josh who is attacked by Radford. The projector quickly repairs itself, and Radford re-appears and chases the group. Harley, Babe and Timmy hide in a closet but the killer breaks through the door and stabs Harley in the stomach with the corkscrew, while the others get away.|$|R

It becomes apparent as the book goes on that because Dillon is continuing writing to Preston, that he and Preston are trapped together in Chinese Handcuffs. In his last letter to Preston, Dillon states that he is pushing his <b>fingers</b> into the <b>trap</b> to let himself go. This also ties into the main theme of the book.|$|R

50|$|To make casabe, the starchy root {{of bitter}} cassava is {{ground to a}} pulp, then {{squeezed}} to expel a milky, bitter liquid called yare. This carries the poisonous substances with {{it out of the}} pulp. Traditionally, this squeezing is done in a sebucan, an 8 to 12 ft long, tube-shaped, pressure strainer, woven in a characteristic helical pattern from palm leaves. The sebucan usually is hung from a tree branch or ceiling pole, and it has a closed bottom with a loop that is attached to a fixed stick or lever, which is used to stretch the sebucan. When the lever is pushed down, stretching the sebucan, the helical weaving pattern causes the strainer to squeeze the pulp inside. This is similar to the action of a Chinese <b>finger</b> <b>trap.</b> The pulp is spread in thin, round cakes about 2 ft in diameter on a budare to roast or toast.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese <b>finger</b> <b>trap</b> is also {{a common}} metaphor for a problem that can be {{overcome}} by relaxing, i.e. not trying too hard to solve it; for example, in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.

50|$|A catch bond {{is a type}} of noncovalent bond whose {{dissociation}} lifetime {{increases with}} tensile force applied to the bond. Normally, bond lifetimes are expected to diminish with force. In the case of catch bonds, the lifetime of the bond actually increases up to a maximum before it decreases like in a normal bond. Catch bonds work {{in a way that is}} conceptually similar to that of a Chinese <b>finger</b> <b>trap.</b> While catch bonds are strengthened by an increase in force, the force increase is not necessary for the bond to work. Catch bonds were suspected for many years to play a role in the rolling of leukocytes, being strong enough to roll in presence of high forces caused by high shear stresses, while avoiding getting stuck in capillaries where the fluid flow, and therefore shear stress, is low. The existence of catch bonds was debated for many years until strong evidence of their existence was found in bacteria. Definite proof of their existence came shortly thereafter in leukocytes.|$|E
40|$|We use a discrete, lattice-based {{model for}} {{two-dimensional}} materials {{to show that}} Möbius bands made with stretchable materials {{are less likely to}} crease or tear. This stems a delocalization of twisting strain that occurs if stretching is allowed. The associated low-energy configurations provide strategic target shapes for the guided assembly of nanometer and micron scale Möbius bands. To predict macroscopic band shapes for a given material, we establish a connection between stretchability and relevant continuum moduli, leading to insight regarding the practical feasibility of synthesizing Möbius bands from materials with continuum parameters that can be measured experimentally or estimated by upscale averaging. To take advantage of stretchability in the case of Möbius bands made of graphene, DNA, and other effectively unstretchable materials, we develop and explore a novel architecture that uses the Chinese <b>finger</b> <b>trap</b> as a fundamental building block and imparts notable stretchability to otherwise unstretchable materials.

40|$|Laplace {{barriers}} {{composed of}} full-posts or ridges have been previously reported {{as a mechanism}} for virtual fluid confinement, but with unstable displacement (capillary <b>fingering</b> or fluid <b>trapping,</b> respectively). A new platform of 'partial-posts' eliminates the disadvantages of full-posts or ridges, while providing ~ 60 - 80 % open channel area for rapid electrowetting fluid transport (> 5 cm s(- 1)). The fluid mechanics of partial-post Laplace barriers are far more complex than previous Laplace barriers as it involves two mechanisms: fluid can first begin to propagate either between, or under, the partial-posts. Careful design of channel and partial-post geometries is required, else one mechanism will dominate over the other. The physics and performance of partial-post Laplace barriers are verified using theoretical equations, experimental results, and dynamic numerical modeling.

5000|$|The tablillas was an {{auxiliary}} torture used {{to increase the}} effectiveness of other tortures that could be applied while the prisoner was bound to the Rack and stretched {{to the point where}} his fingers and toes were tense. The tablillas were a set of four small pillories, each with five holes designed tightly to confine either fingers or toes, and—during the application of other tortures—long, thin, gradually tapered wedges were hammered into the holes alongside the fingers and toes, based upon the assumption that the simultaneous squeezing and crushing of up to ten fingers and ten toes would prove an effective enhancement to the primary torture.
