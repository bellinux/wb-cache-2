40|$|Two {{experiments}} are reported which explore {{the relationships between}} auditory feedback (<b>engine</b> <b>noise),</b> speed choice, driving violations and driver comfort. Participants played a driving simulation game with different levels of auditory {{feedback in the form}} of <b>engine</b> <b>noise.</b> In Experiment 1, a between-subjects design revealed that no noise and low levels of <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> (65 dB(A)) resulted in participants driving at faster speeds than in the medium (75 dB(A)) and high (85 dB(A)) levels of <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> conditions. The low noise feedback conditions were also associated with decreases in driver comfort. Experiment 2 also demonstrated that low levels of <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> feedback (no feedback and 70 dB(A)) were associated with increases in driving speed, and driving violations relative to higher levels of feedback (75 dB(A) and 80 dB(A)). Implications exist for current car manufacturing trends which emphasise a growing increase in noise insulation for the driver. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The Acoustical Theory for Design of Aircraft Cabins (ATDAC) is a {{computer}} program developed to predict interior noise levels inside aircraft and to evaluate the effects of different aircraft configurations on the aircraft acoustical environment.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explains}} {{the effect of}} various lubricant and engine temperatures on the intake mass air flow, <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> and lubricant pressure behaviour of a motor-driven spark ignition engine. The lubricant pressure, <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> and mass air flow changes were recorded under a steady state operating condition with an increased engine speed in which both the volume and temperature of the lubricant remained unchanged for each sets of test. The engine was driven by an electric motor at a wide-open throttle and a constant speed ranging from 500 to 3000 rpm with 500 rpm increment. The lubricant and cooling water were set at 32 °C (unheated) and 90 °C (heated) for each run. In general, {{the pressure of the}} lubricant was found to decrease for either increased engine speed or lubricant temperature. It was found that high lubricant viscosity produced high overall engine friction and resulted to a higher <b>engine</b> <b>noise.</b> Heated lubricant started off with a very low pressure with 0. 996 bar compared to unheated lubricant with 2. 497 bar in 500 rpm. Unheated engine lubricant recorded a peak noise of 107. 2 dB at 1500 rpm before it dropped momentarily before increased linearly beyond this speed. The findings in this work are useful for researchers in the field of automotive technologies, environmental and triblogies.

40|$|In this paper, a {{combustion}} {{analysis of a}} compression ignition (CI) engine operating with biodiesel blends has been experimentally investigated {{to examine the effects}} of biodiesel on the combustion process and the characteristics of the <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> produced by the combustion process. The experiment with different loads and speeds was conducted on a four-cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection and turbocharged diesel engine fuelled with biodiesel (B 50 and B 100) and normal pure diesel. The signals of vibration, acoustic and the in-cylinder pressure were measured for analysing the engine combustion. In order to examine these signals, a coherent power spectrum analysis method is used to investigate the <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> signals for locating the frequency band which is closely related to the combustion process. Subsequently, the Wigner-Ville distribution is employed to analyse the energy distribution of <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> in the time-frequency domain. A band-pass filter based on fractional Fourier transform is developed to extract the main combustion induced <b>noise</b> from the <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> for comparison. The interim results show that the sound energy level of combustion <b>noise</b> of <b>engine</b> fuelled by biodiesel and its blends is higher than that of engine fuelled by diesel. This is also identical to the variation of in-cylinder pressure. Hence, acoustic signals of the CI engine provide useful features for remote engine condition monitoring and supply fuel monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process {{for the detection of}} motor vehicles and a device which is suitable for performing said process.

The invention is based on the problem of providing increased security for the motor vehicles parked in the car park area. It is intended to make a theft more difficult or even totally impossible. This is achieved by means of a process for the detection of motor vehicles (1, X), in particular at the exit from a secured or restricted area such as a parking zone or a multi-storey car park, by which the <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> (M 1) of the vehicle (1) entering the area (v<-e) is detected (11 e) and stored (recorded) and that the stored <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> (M 1) is compared with the <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> (Mx) of a or the vehicle (X, 1) which supposedly (P, 13 a) coincides with the motor vehicle (1) whose <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> (M 1) was recorded on entry (v<-e) and which is intending (P) to exit (v<-a) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{algorithm}} for {{the real}} time synthesis of internal combustion <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> is presented. Through the analysis of a recorded <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> signal of continuously varying engine speed, a dataset of sound samples is extracted allowing the real time synthesis of the noise induced by arbitrary evolutions of engine speed.

40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>noise</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} noises in urban noises. NVH improvements are essential in order to fulfill various noise emission regulations such as ISO 362. Reducing <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> has become a necessity for engine developers. Measurement plays an important role beside the simulations to improve the NVH behavior, because the engine is a rather complicated mechanical system with many components. ISO 3745 is an ideal method for sound power measurement for internal combustion engines since it provides a fast measurement through many different engine speeds. However room as well as the measurement method, should comply with this standard. Because of the size and installation situation for a running engine there is limited space for measurement; and it is difficult to reach standards requirements especially for such a directive sound source. The difficulty to meet these requirements also applies to Scania's anechoic room. Here <b>engine</b> <b>noise</b> characteristics and the uncertainties in sound power measurement have been discussed based on both measurement and simulation.
