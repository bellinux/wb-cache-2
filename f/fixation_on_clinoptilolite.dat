40|$|The {{adsorption}} of o-, m- and p-nitrophenols <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite</b> type {{natural zeolite}} {{has been studied}} {{as a function of}} the solution concentration and temperature. The adsorption rates were observed to be equal to the first-order kinetics. The rate constants were calculated for 25. 0 – 40. 0 – 50. 0 °C at constant concentration. The activation energies, (Ea) for nitrophenoles adsorption on zeolite, were estimated using the Arrhenius equation. Thermodynamic parame-ters were calculated for all nitrophenols. Adsorption isotherms of o-, m- and p-nitrophenols on natural zeolite were determined. These isotherms were modeled according to the Freundlich and Langmuir adsorption isotherms. The isotherms for nitrophenols <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite</b> were assigned as L curves. The L curve of p-nitrophenol is two step while the L curves of o- and m-nitrophenols are one-step. © 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHighly {{sensitive}} conductometric urea biosensors {{were developed}} by exploiting the successful combination of ammonium-sieving and ion exchange properties of clinoptilolite, with a unique biorecognition capacity of urease. To optimize the performance of urea biosensors based <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite,</b> the dependences of their analytical signals on pH, buffer capacity and ionic strength of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) were studied. Optimum pH for urea biosensors was found {{within the range of}} pH 6. 0 - 7. 0. The dependences of biosensors responses on buffer capacity and ionic strength of PBS were of the same profile as those obtained for the urea biosensor which was not modified with clinoptilolite. Analytical characteristics of urea biosensors based <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite</b> were evaluated by determination of the sensitivity, linear and dynamic ranges, detection limit, the apparent Michaelis-Menten constant and the response time. The optimum features in terms of sensitivity, dynamic range, and detection limit (20. 36 μS/mM, 0 - 64 mM, and 10 − 6 M, respectively) were found for the urea biosensor, based on a primary layer of clinoptilolite followed by a secondary layer of urease and clinoptilolite in a single bioselective membrane. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants Km for the developed urea biosensors based <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite</b> varied from 2. 73 to 5. 67 mM. These values differed significantly from the value of Km for the urea biosensor which was not modified with zeolite (1. 89 mM).

40|$|The results {{presented}} in the article are based on first-pass reading times, defined as the sum of <b>fixation</b> durations <b>on</b> a word until the first <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> any other word. The first-pass reading time on word wt is zero if a later word from the same sentence was fixated before the first <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> wt. To investigate if our conclusions hold for other reading-time measures, we repeated the analysis using two alternatives: right-bounded and go-past reading time. Right-bounded time is identical to first-pass time except that it includes the durations of <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> wt that occur after a regression. That is, it equals the total duration of <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> wt until the first <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> any later word of the sentence. The go-past reading time {{is defined as the}} total duration of <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> all words from w 1 (the first word of the sentence) up to wt, starting from the first <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> wt until the first <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> any later word of the sentence. 1 As was the case for first-pass, the right-bounded and go-past reading times on wt are zero if a later word from the same sentence was fixated before the first <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> wt.

40|$|AbstractThe present paper {{deals with}} the {{modification}} of the mineral filler based <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite</b> by the silanization process and application of prepared modified forms into polymeric materials. Zeolite clinoptilolite is natural aluminosilicate material with the special porous structure belonging to zeolite group. Surface modification of clinoptilolite was performed with 3 -(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane. The influence of silanization conditions – time (1, 2 and 3 hours) and temperature (20 °C and 50 °C) on the efficiency of clinoptilolite modification was studied. Prepared modified fillers were mixed into rubber compounds as partial replacement of commonly used filler – carbon black. Influence of prepared fillers on rheoloy and vulcanizing characteristics of rubber compounds and also on physical and mechanical properties, crosslink density and termooxidative ageing of the vulcanizates was studied. Obtained results of measured characteristics of polymeric systems containing filler based <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite</b> were compared with the results obtained {{in the case of}} reference rubber compound with a commercially used filler – carbon black. Based on the results the influence of silanization conditions of <b>clinoptilolite</b> filler <b>on</b> its efficiency in polymeric systems has been determined...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Amino acids {{have been}} {{extensively}} used in several {{processes of the}} pharmaceutical and food industries. Treatments for the recovery and reuse of the wastewaters generated from these processes are few and little known. This work aims at studying the influence of different variables on the sorption of L-cysteine, contained in aqueous solutions, <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite</b> mineral. L-Cysteine (Cys) was sorbed by Clinoptilolie (Clino) from aqueous solutions of variable concentrations, temperatures and pHs. The powder X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), InfraRed (IR) spectroscopy and thermal analysis (TG, DTG and DSC) techniques were applied for characterization of materials. The {{results indicated that the}} sorption process depends strongly on pH, temperature and concentration of amino acid. Cysteine is specifically sorbed <b>on</b> <b>clinoptilolite</b> surface sites, probably through its NH 3 + moiety. The pH dependence suggests that these sites may be silanolate groups (Si-O-). The experimental data of sorption isotherms obtained and analyzed with Langmuir model showed that this model fitted the sorption data.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to find out whether ironic effects in a far aiming task were {{accompanied}} by shorter final <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> the target. Generally, it is well known that a sufficiently long final <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> the target is of crucial importance for accurate performance in far aiming. Recently, it has been shown that ironic effects in golf putts and penalty kicks (in which one does the opposite of what was intended, e. g., shoot close to the keeper while attempting to avoid this) were preceded by longer <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> the to-be-avoided area, which may have resulted in shorter final <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> the target area. Therefore, in the current study we examined football players taking penalties in a simulated penalty environment with and without instructions to avoid the goalkeeper. The findings revealed that ironic effects were indeed accompanied by significantly shorter final <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> the target area, i. e., the open goal space. It is concluded that in far aiming tasks, ironic effects are accompanied by insufficiently long final <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> the target. © 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to use eyegaze tracking data to provide insights into designing radiology workstations. We designed a look-alike radiology task with artificial stimuli. The task involved a comparative visual search of two side-by-side images, using two different interaction techniques. We tracked the eyegaze of four radiologists while they performed the task and measured the duration of the <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> the controls, the left and right images, and on the artificial targets. Response time differences between the two interaction techniques exceeded the differences of <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> the controls. <b>Fixations</b> <b>on</b> the left-side images are longer than the right-side images, and the search for multifeatured targets occurs in two phases: first a regular scan path search phase for a likely target and then a confirmation phase of several <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> the target in each side-by-side image. We conclude that eyegaze tracking shows that disruption of visual search leads to cognitive disruption; subjects use the left image as a reference image and multiple saccades between left and right side images are necessary, because of the limitations of the visual working memory...|$|R

In children with ASD, by contrast, neither gap effect nor ERPs differ between faces and objects. Follow-up experiments demonstrated that instructed <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> the eyes induces larger gap effect for faces in children with ASD, whereas instructed <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> the mouth can disrupt larger gap effect in TD children.

40|$|Qualitative {{impairments}} in social interactions {{is one of}} the problems children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) faced with. In a normal development there is a connection between the points the eyes are fixated on and the child’s social behavior. Previous research has found that children with ASD have atypical eye contact. The thesis of this present study was: “Can <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> different emotions be related to social dysfunctioning and connected to autistic characteristics of young children and can the Theory of Mind (ToM) be used to explain this? The sample consisted of 18 children between 3, 5 and 6 years old,with varying degrees of autistic behavior The research was based on a number of ASD-characteristics, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) was used for this. The social cognition was measured by the ToM tasks from the NEPSY. The visual fixation patterns during watching videos of different emotions by these children were registered by the Tobii application. The results of the study show children with more autistic characteristics scored significantly different <b>on</b> <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> objects, <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> eyes (when they have a low score on Social Awareness) and Joint Attention (by a low score on Social Communication), but they did not show less attention to <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> social areas (total <b>fixation</b> duration <b>on</b> faces, eyes, mouth and Joint Attention). So the <b>fixation</b> <b>on</b> different emotions can in specifics ways be connect to social dysfunctioning. No association was found between the fixation and the ToM. It is strongly recommended tot replicated this research, comparing a far larger clinical group of children with ASD to a control group. In this additional research more theories should be used to explain results and more. The additional research may well fully explain ASD in future, as a basis for developing suitable treatment, so children with ASD can develop optimally...|$|R

40|$|Deficits in the {{processing}} of facial emotions have been reported extensively in patients with schizophrenia. To explore whether restricted attention {{is the cause of}} impaired emotion processing in these patients, we examined visual attention through tracking eye movements in response to emotional and neutral face stimuli in a group of patients with schizophrenia and healthy individuals. We also examined the correlation between visual attention allocation and symptoms severity in our patient group. Thirty adult patients with schizophrenia and 30 matched healthy controls participated in this study. Visual attention data were recorded while participants passively viewed emotional-neutral face pairs for 500 ms. The relationship between the visual attention and symptoms severity were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in the schizophrenia group. Repeated Measures ANOVAs were used to compare the groups. Comparing the number of fixations made during face-pairs presentation, we found that patients with schizophrenia made fewer <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> faces, regardless of the expression of the face. Analysis of the number of <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> negative-neutral pairs also revealed that the patients made fewer <b>fixations</b> <b>on</b> both neutral and negative faces.
