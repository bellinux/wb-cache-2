5|$|The {{book was}} {{released}} {{the day after}} Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs, entitled Steve Jobs, was released by Simon & Schuster. Jobs had died on October 5 and the release date was moved forward. The Jobs book's release <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> forward twice; It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> from spring 2012 to November 21 after Jobs stepped down {{and then to the}} October 24 date after his death. When The Litigators debuted on November 3 on the USA Today best-seller list, which does not separate fiction and non-fiction, it debuted at number 2 behind the Jobs book.|$|E
5|$|Altar 2 {{was found}} in the West Plaza, where it was {{associated}} with Stela 3 at the base of Structure 3. Altar 2 was a plain monument and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> from its original location.|$|E
5|$|Altar 6 is a plain {{monument}} {{that was}} found in Group 21 together with Stela 10. Like its associated stela it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> from its original location in antiquity but was probably not moved far.|$|E
5000|$|Although I don't know why, the {{pictures}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved.</b> (=why {{the pictures}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Certain transit {{authorities}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to {{a series}} of bus stops outside Place Bonaventure, while others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to a loop route along René Lévesque Boulevard.|$|R
60|$|Footnotes <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> {{to the end}} of {{the poem}} to which they refer; in Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> {{to the end of}} the book.|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, the {{division}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Flanders in February 1917. Initially based at Steenwerck, {{the following month}} it shifted north to the Messines area, which was south of Ypres, to relieve the 36th Division.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria Airways had its {{headquarters}} at Airways House in Abuja {{at the time}} of dissolution. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> from Murtala Muhammed Airport between 1999 and 2000. The airline logo consisted of the Nigerian flag with a green elephant named Skypower in its centre.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 2014, V-22 {{aircraft}} carried Delta Force commandos to a campsite {{in eastern}} Syria where Islamic State militants had held American and other hostages. The commandos eliminated the militants at the site, {{but found that}} the hostages <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> elsewhere and returned home empty handed.|$|E
2500|$|Chapter 7 ("Shakespeare and Company") <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to <b>be</b> chapter 3, and chapter 16 ("Nada y Pues Nada") <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> {{to the end}} of {{the book}} as an [...] "Additional Paris Sketch".|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the size}} of the stone it is thought {{unlikely}} that it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> far, if it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> at all, from the spot at which it originally stood. 1886 Ogam noticed.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{facade of}} the church <b>has</b> <b>been</b> modified {{after a series of}} renovations. The original altar of the church <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> backward to allow a larger area for the faithful inside the church building. The original sacristy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to the side.|$|R
5|$|Since 2000, adoptions of Bankers from Shackleford {{have been}} {{managed by the}} Foundation for Shackleford Horses. As of 2007, 56horses had found new homes, 10 resided with another herd on Cedar Island, and two <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to the Ocracoke herd.|$|E
5|$|A town borough was {{formally}} created in 1201, {{and by the}} 1220s there was a settlement established outside the castle gates; some of those residents who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> out of the bailey may have resettled there. Richard built a stone wall around the new town, linking it to the castle defences, intending it both as a defensive measure and to impress visitors.|$|E
5|$|By 30 November, the 6th Brigade was {{surrounded}} and the Afrika Korps, including the Italian Ariete Division, began attacking after midday with tanks and infantry. Despite {{the support of}} anti-tank guns, the New Zealanders were overrun. Shuttleworth was made a prisoner-of-war along with his surviving company commanders. The survivors of the 25th Battalion, now commanded by Major Henry Burton, the sole surviving company commander, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> into reserve a few days previously and managed to withdraw before Sidi Rezegh was overrun.|$|E
50|$|Two {{additional}} species, {{the rock}} earthcreeper and the straight-billed earthcreeper, were formerly placed in this genus, but <b>have</b> now <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Ochetorhynchus. Comparably, the Chaco earthcreeper and the Bolivian earthcreeper were formerly placed in this genus, but <b>have</b> now <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Tarphonomus, and the striated earthcreeper <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Geocerthia.|$|R
50|$|D. parasitica, which {{traditionally}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{considered a}} parasite of Lubomirskiid sponges (gut analyses {{have shown that}} it is not), was formerly placed in Brandtia, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Dorogostaiskia. Other species formerly placed in Brandtia <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Gmelinoides (G. fasciatus and G. fasciatoides).|$|R
50|$|Some species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to genus Mimoides.|$|R
5|$|By December, Etruria <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Tobruk, {{where she}} {{provided}} gunfire {{support to the}} Italians defending the city. She was joined there by Etna and twelve torpedo boats. In the meantime, most of the fleet had returned to Italy for refitting. In January 1912, Etruria was moved back to Benghazi. For {{the next six months}} she remained here, supporting the garrison against Ottoman counter-attacks. The ship repeatedly shelled the Ottoman camps outside the city. On 15 October, the Ottomans surrendered, ending the war.|$|E
5|$|During 1983–1984, the {{painting}} was exhibited at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell {{the painting}} to Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer {{with the statement that}} the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to a building of its own, the painting should be moved there too.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the Washington State Legislature {{commissioned}} {{a new state}} highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly-numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, initially with State Route522 (SR522) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 2 from Seattle to North Bend, and State Route202 (SR202) assigned to the branch of Primary State Highway 15 from Woodinville to Monroe. By 1970, SR522 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to the Bothell–Monroe Cutoff, while SR202 {{was moved to the}} Woodinville–North Bend highway.|$|E
50|$|The terms {{monolith}} {{and elements}} such as monolithic columns are normally used for objects made from a single large piece of rock which is detached from the ground, and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> a considerable distance, as with several Egyptian obelisks, which <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> across the world.|$|R

5|$|On 30 March, the Alsos Mission reached Heidelberg, where {{important}} {{scientists were}} captured including Walther Bothe, Richard Kuhn, Philipp Lenard, and Wolfgang Gertner. Their interrogation revealed that Otto Hahn {{was at his}} laboratory in Tailfingen, while Werner Heisenberg and Max von Laue were at Heisenberg's laboratory in Hechingen, and the experimental natural uranium reactor that Heisenberg's team had built in Berlin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Haigerloch. Henceforth, {{the main focus of}} the Alsos Mission was on these nuclear facilities in the Württemberg area.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December, {{district}} collector Manikandan said 173 relief centres {{had been}} opened in Puducherry {{and that those}} evacuated from low-lying areas <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to 22 relief centres. They were given food thrice a day, with children given milk; blankets were also provided. In the past week, 5,25,475 food packets had been distributed. Special medical camps were conducted and medicines and sanitary napkins were distributed. The administration opened 66 relief centres in Karaikal to accommodate rain affected persons.|$|E
5|$|Seven sculpted monuments {{have been}} found at Akte, an unusual number for such a small site. If these monuments were {{originally}} erected at Akte, then this may mean that the site was actually outside of the Motul de San José polity. Archaeological investigations of the stelae carried out in 2003 were unable {{to determine if the}} monuments <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Akte or not.|$|E
50|$|Plot Summaries <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> {{to their}} {{individual}} volume pages.|$|R
5000|$|Austrocarina Laseron, 1954 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to {{the family}} Horaiclavidae.|$|R
50|$|Some species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> {{between this}} genus and Stictea.|$|R
5|$|Stela 10 {{was found}} in Group 21 {{together}} with Altar 6. They are among the very few monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city. Stela 10 was carved with a frame containing a figure, now badly eroded. The figure is standing with feet separated and turned outwards. Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it. Stela 10 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.|$|E
5|$|Tax {{revenue from}} the Belgian Congo enabled the Belgian {{government}} in exile and Free Belgian Forces to fund themselves, unlike most other states in exile, which operated through subsidies and donations from sympathetic governments. It also meant that the Belgian gold reserves, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to London in 1940, were not needed to fund the war effort, and therefore were still available {{at the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} theatrical {{release date}} {{was due in}} November 2004 before being changed many times; the dates <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to February 2005, 29 July, 23 November, and finally 26 August. Executive producer Bob Weinstein blamed the pushed back release dates on budgetary concerns. To help promote The Brothers Grimm, a three-minute film trailer was shown at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, while twenty minutes of footage was shown at the 2005 event.|$|E
