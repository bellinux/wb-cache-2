5000|$|In the European Union EU REGULATION No 910/2014 on <b>electronic</b> {{identification}} and <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> for <b>electronic</b> transactions in the European internal market (eIDAS) sets the legal frame for electronic signatures [...] It repeals Directive 1999/93/EC.

40|$|Pseudonymisation {{is gaining}} {{traction}} among modern electronic identification systems as a privacy enhancing technique that can significantly reduce risks of personal data misuse. The recently agreed General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) encourages {{the use of}} pseudonymisation to comply with its requirement of privacy-by-design. Art. 5 of the European Regulation on <b>electronic</b> identification and <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> (eIDAS) on data processing and protection simply allows the use of pseudonyms in electronic transactions although the facilitation of {{the implementation of the}} principle of privacy by design is clearly among the aims listed by Art. 12 of eIDAS.

40|$|Part 4 : Application Areas and EvaluationInternational audienceThe use {{of privacy}} {{protection}} measures {{is of particular}} importance for existing and upcoming users' digital identities. Thus, the recently adopted EU Regulation on <b>Electronic</b> identification and <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> (eIDAS) explicitly allows the use of pseudonyms {{in the context of}} eID systems, without specifying the way they should be implemented. The paper contributes to the discussion on pseudonyms and multiple identities, by (1) providing an original analysis grid that can be applied for privacy evaluation in any eID architecture, and (2) intro-ducing the concept of eID deployer allowing to model virtually any case of the relation between the user, the eID implementation and user's digital identities. Based on these inputs, a comparative analysis of four exemplary eID architec-tures deployed in European countries is conducted. The paper also discusses how sensitive citizens of these countries are to the privacy argument while adopting these systems, and presents the "privacy adoption paradox"...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{identity}} (eID) is on everyone's lips as {{is increasingly}} used in various services nowadays. In Europe, the EU (European Union) Regulation N. 910 / 2014 on <b>electronic</b> identification and <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> for <b>electronic</b> transactions {{in the internal}} market (eIDAS Regulation) has also created a legal structure for electronic identification, signatures, seals and documents throughout EU, so an intensive work is spent on putting it in practice. In this paper, we describe first the e-SENS (Electronic Simple European Networked Services) infrastructure, which is composed of (national) nodes set {{as part of the}} STORK 2. 0 eID infrastructure and new nodes implementing the eIDAS specification. Since the e-SENS infrastructure uses the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for authentication and attribute transfer, the data security is strongly related to SAML security. Moreover, it depends also on architecture complexity. We analyze two possible solutions for stronger data security in e-SENS: one is based on the exploitation of the SAML Holderof-Key web browser profile, while the other one exploits the encryption of the SAML tokens. We present details in adopting such solutions in e-SENS infrastructure and we discuss their pros and cons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} implementation of an Attribute Provider (AP), compatible with the protocol defined in the STORK 2. 0 electronic identity European infrastructure that provides cross-border authentication and attribute management in web-based services. Currently, this infrastructure is used as basis in some European countries to implement the recently adopted eIDAS Regulation on <b>electronic</b> identification and <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> for <b>electronic</b> transactions in the internal market. For example, in the e-SENS project the existing nodes of the STORK 2. 0 infrastructure are linked to new nodes implementing the eIDAS technical specification, to create a unique interoperability platform. In our work, we considered several key aspects that have been underlined by the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace in USA, e. g. the possibility to incorporate attribute services in identity architectures, the principle of data minimization (provide the minimum set of attributes required so the AP should not overshare as default), {{and the problem of}} user consent.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} preventing the successful use of current electronic commerce systems is the users lack of trust in such systems. Current solutions focus on providing secure communication and authentification methods. It is commonly argued that such methods will increase trust between users and <b>electronic</b> marketplaces. However, <b>trust</b> among companies acting as business partners on business-to-business electronic marketplaces is not addressed in these solutions. This form of trust is of particular importance for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} that require support for the negotiation phase through the marktplace. In this thesis <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> based on the concept of traceability are introduced. In particular, the trust between users of electronic marktplaces is addressed. To create the <b>services,</b> a <b>trust</b> model based on elements from computer science, psychology, and sociology is developed. This models demands a trustworthy realisation of the services. To this end, the principle of a distributed trusted third party is introduced. Here a network of trusted third parties is used as a <b>service</b> provider for <b>trust</b> <b>services.</b> A service environment based on web services is developed for the technical realisation of the <b>trust</b> <b>services.</b> Using the environment, users of a marketplace can then select and configure <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> to their needs and preferences. This combination of <b>trust</b> <b>services</b> with the realisation through distributed trusted third parties can thus be used to enhance <b>trust</b> on <b>electronic</b> marketplaces...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, an {{increasing}} number of Certified E-Mail systems (CEM) have been implemented in Europe and worldwide, but their diffusion and validity are mainly restricted in a national arena. Despite the effort of European Union (EU) that recently defined a specification for guaranteeing interoperability of CEM systems between Member States, its adoption has not be not yet fuelled, mainly since any CEM system receives a legal value by its State legislation. It is difficult to extend the legal value of CEM security mechanisms, e. g. receipts with timestamps which are considered evidences and legal proofs in disputes that may arise from different Parties inside a State, unless a common political and legal agreement will be created. At this aim, recently EU introduce the new Regulation on <b>Electronic</b> Identification and <b>Trust</b> <b>Services</b> (eIDAS), to address this issue. We believe that the first step for encouraging a more large adoption between communities is to implement CEMs using standard worldwide recognized solutions. In this paper we propose a technical evolution of the Italian CEM, called Posta Elettronica Certificata (PEC) moving from a close mechanisms to the adoption of a more standardized, distributed solution, based on DNS Security Extensions (DNSSec). This proposal would have a minimal impact on the legislation, restricted to the annex that defines PEC technical rules. ...|$|R
40|$|Part 3 : E-government Services and GovernanceInternational audienceThe <b>electronic</b> {{identification}} and <b>trust</b> <b>service</b> regulation (eIDAS) was adopted in 2014 {{to create a}} digital common market in the European Union (EU). As the world {{is becoming more and}} more digital, countries need to develop ways to integrate digital migrants. While the EU does not currently have a digital common market, several EU countries already have working systems for cross-border digital cooperation. The principal focus of this article was to address whether eIDAS can be implemented in these countries, without challenging the local initiatives. The Estonian e-government system (EES) was chosen as an exemplary case. Here we analyzed whether the eIDAS complements or challenges the national e-government initiatives, such as Estonia’s e-residency project, and whether it is in the interest of member states to contribute to the fast implementation of the eIDAS as the most effective measure for achieving cross-border use of e-services. To address these questions, a content, context and process (CCP) analysis framework was used. Based on our findings, we concluded that, although the eIDAS creates some additional obligations, the regulation supports national e-government goals and domestic cross-border initiatives. Also, without supranational interference, it is highly unlikely that digital open borders could be created among 28 member states. Thus, it is in the interest of the member states to contribute to a fast implementation of the eIDAS...|$|R
