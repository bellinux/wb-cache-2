50|$|The {{intravenous}} LD50 {{of the new}} alkaloid {{was approximately}} 150mg/kg for mice and 0.75 mg/kg for rabbits/ Before death, the mice showed periodic convulsions of a clonic type, erection of the hairs and excitability. At doses of 50-100mg/kg it produced only this peculiar symptomatology: the mice stood upright and pressed on each other's noses and chattered their teeth. In rabbits, and injection into the ear vein in doses of 0.1-1mg/kg produced dilatation of the pupil, excitability or convulsions of a clinic type. The ears became pale and cold with intense vasoconstriction. The toxicity of the alkaloid to rabbits seemed to depend on its power of raising the body-temperature in this species. In rabbits the similarity between {{the effects of the}} new alkaloid and ergometrine were particularly striking, but ergometrine was less toxic to rabbits (the approximate intravenous LD50 of ergometrine was 3.5mg/kg).D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide induced, in low concentrations (minimum active concentration 0.1-1µg/ml), a contracture in the isolated uterus of the virgen guinea pig. There was a satisfactory dose/response relationship. This contracture was very similar to that produced by ergmetrine maleate, which, however, was 1-2 times more potent.On the rabbit uterus in situ both alkaloids produced a prompt contraction and increased rhythmic activity of the uterus. For ergometrine the minimum active dose by intravenous route was 0.1-0.3 mg/kg and for the new alkaloid 0.2-0.5mg/kgm. The actions of both alkaloids lasted some minutes, and owing to the favourable circumstance that the interference between the effects of the two alkaloids was negligible, it was possible to test them on the same preparation. Ergometrine was 1-2 times more potent than the new alkaloid. On the isolated seminal vesicles of the guinea pig, the new alkaloid was approximately 200 times less potent than ergotamine tartrate as an adrenergic blocking drug. Rabbits anaethetized with urethane supported doses of D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide which would have killed unanaesthetized animals. Rapid intravenous injections of small doses (0.1-0.2mg/kg) of the new alkaloid caused an evanescent decrease or a small increase of blood pressure; with higher doses (0.3/0.5mg/kg and more) the blood pressure increased moderately without showing any dose/response relationship. <b>Ergometrine</b> <b>maleate</b> seemed to be less active on bloodpressure, and there was no significant change of blood pressure with 0.3-0.5 mg/kg.The new alkaloid was without effect, when given in small doses, on the blood pressure of cats anaethetized with chloralose. Higher intravenous doses (0.1-0.3mg/kg) caused a sustained hypotension of long duration and a moderate decrease of heart-rate. The respiration of rabbits and cats was depressed by small doses of the new alkaloid; cats seemed to be less resistant than rabbits. In cats, 0.01mg/kg of the new alkaloid caused broncho-constriction and contractions of the nictitating membrane of long duration. The new alkaloid have no action on isolated rabbit auricles at doses up to 100µg/ml. In summing up, the new naturally occurring alkaloid D-lysergic acid methyl carbinolamide has powerful ergometrine-like oxytocic action and weak ergotamine-like adrenergic blocking actions. It must be included, on the basis of pharmacological evidence, in the ergometrine group of ergot alkaloids. Ergometrine, however, is less toxic and more active than the new alkaloid. Results suggest that it could have a lysergic acid diethylamide-like activity, but this hypothesis must be checked by experiments on humans.|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of {{coronary artery spasm}} {{at the site of}} previous successful angioplasty and its importance in leading to subsequent restenosis or recurrence of symptoms are unknown. Fourteen consecutive patients with single vessel coronary artery disease who had undergone successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were studied. All patients were given <b>ergometrine</b> <b>maleate</b> (ergonovine maleate) intravenously during repeat cardiac catheterisation six weeks to three months after angioplasty. Five patients demonstrated excessive luminal reduction (spasm) at the site of previous angioplasty that led to luminal stenoses ranging from 50 % to 79 %. Two of these patients developed chest pain and ST segment changes during <b>ergometrine</b> <b>maleate</b> provocation and they also showed maximal vasoconstriction. The remaining nine patients did not develop important luminal change at the site of angioplasty after <b>ergometrine</b> <b>maleate.</b> <b>Ergometrine</b> <b>maleate</b> administration resulted in {{less than or equal to}} 20 % reduction in lumen diameter of adjacent apparently normal sections of the coronary arteries in all but two patients. At the site of previous angioplasty in the five patients with spasm, however, the lumen was constricted by a mean (SD) of 51 (12) %, whereas in the nine patients not demonstrating spasm mean reduction was 12 (7) %.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] 46 -year-old White man had a 2 -year history of frequent atypical chest pain associated with palpitations and presyncope. Clinical examination revealed an intermittent mid-systolic non-ejection click followed by a blowing mid-to-late systolic murmur indicative of the billowing mitral leaflet syndrome (BMLS) (primary mitral valve prolapse (MVP); Barlow's syndrome). This diagnossis was confirmed on cardiac catheterization, left ventricular cine angiography showing mild mitral insufficiency. M-mode and cross-sectional echocardiograms failed to show the MVP, although phonocardiography documented the intermittent non-ejection click and mid-systolic apical murmur. Ambulatory Holter monitoring showed symptomatic inferolateral myocardial ischaemia, and maximal stress-testing elicited asymptomatic ischaemia in the same zone. Selective coronary angiography delinated a normal left coronary artery and an insignificant fixed obstructive lesion {{in the second part}} of the dominent right coronary artery (RCA). Provocation with <b>ergometrine</b> (ergonovine) <b>maleate</b> gave rise to severe coronary vasospasm superimposed on the insignificant lesion in the RCA. This spasm provoked myocardial ischaemia resulting in symptomatic ventricular fibrillation which was successfully reserved. The patient's symptoms have been fairly well controlled by nitrates and nifedipine. As far as I am aware this is the first documentation of coronary vasospasm in the BMLS. In this syndrome coronary artery spasm has often been postulated to be responsible for acute myocardial infarction with a normal appearance of the coronary arteries on angiography. This mechanism has also been incriminated in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmias in cases of primary MVP. These various contentious and important issues are reviewed. Publisher’s versio...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the quality of a select group of medicines sold in accredited drug dispensing outlets (ADDOs) and pharmacies in different regions of Tanzania as part of an in-depth cross-sectional assessment of community access to medicines and community use of medicines. We collected 242 samples of amoxicillin trihydrate, artemether-lumefantrine (ALu), co-trimoxazole, <b>ergometrine</b> <b>maleate,</b> paracetamol, and quinine from selected ADDOs and pharmacies in Mbeya, Morogoro, Singida, and Tanga regions. The analysis included physical examination and testing with validated analytical techniques. Assays for eight of nine products were conducted using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). For ALu tablets, we used a two-tiered approach, where tier 1 was a semi-quantitative Global Pharma Health Fund-Minilab® method and tier 2 was high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as described in The International Pharmacopoeia's monograph for artemether-lumefantrine. The physical examination of samples revealed no defects in the solid and oral liquid dosage forms, but unusual discoloration in an injectable solution, <b>ergometrine</b> <b>maleate.</b> For ALu, the results showed that of 38 samples, 31 (81. 6 %) passed tier 1 testing and 7 (18. 4 %) gave inconclusive drug content results. The inconclusive ALu samples were submitted for tier 2 testing and all met the quality standards. The pass rate using the HPTLC and TLC/HPLC assays was 93. 8 %; the failures were the <b>ergometrine</b> <b>maleate</b> samples purchased from both ADDOs and pharmacies. The disintegration testing of the solid dosage forms was conducted in accordance with US Pharmacopeia monographs. Only two samples of paracetamol, 1. 2 % of the solid dosage forms, failed to comply to standards. The study revealed a high overall rate of 92. 6 % of samples that met the quality standards. Although the overall failure rate was 7. 4 %, it is important to note that this was largely limited to one product and likely due to poor distribution and storage rather than poor manufacturing practices. Over 90 % of the medicines sold in ADDOs and pharmacies met quality standards. Policy makers need to reconsider ergometrine maleate's place on the list of medicines that ADDOs are allowed to dispense, by either substituting a more temperature-stable therapeutically equivalent product or requiring those sites to have refrigerators, which is not a feasible option for rural Tanzania...|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Black employee exposed to industrial nitroglycerin (NG) in an explosives factory presented with severe precordial pain. The clinical presentation was that of significant transient anteroseptal and anterolateral transmural myocardial ischaemia which responded promptly to sublingual isosorbide dinitrate. Despite being removed from exposure to industrial NG and receiving therapy with long-acting oral nitrates and calcium antagonists, the patient continued to experience repeated attacks of severe retrosternal pain, although transient myocardial ischemia was not demonstrated electrocardiographically during these episodes. Cardiac catheterization revealed a normal myocardial haemodynamic system and selective coronary arteriography delineated coronary arteries free from any obstructive lesions. An ergonovine (<b>ergometrine)</b> <b>maleate</b> provocative test failed to elicit coronary artery spasm, although this was undertaken while the patient was on nitrate and calcium-blocker therapy. Clinical records of previous significant constrictive pericarditis (probably due to tuberculosis) with resultant abnormalities on the ECG complicated the diagnosis. Evaluation was further hindered by the known 'variant pattern' seen on the ECGs {{of members of the}} Black population. We postulate that this patient's clinical features were a direct result of severe vasospasm affecting the left coronary artery; it is also strongly suggested that withdrawal from contact with industrial NG precipitated this potentially lethal coronary vasospasm.

40|$|ReviewThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] middle-aged Coloured man had a 6 -year history of chest pain induced by effort and also experienced at rest. Quite dramatic episodes of associated arrhythmias, specifically 'torsade de pointes' (atypical ventricular tachycardia) and syncope were experienced by the patient, despite the use of numerous anti-arrhythmic and anti-anginal agents. Transmural anteroseptal and non-transmural anterolateral myocardial infarctions were documented {{in the presence of}} a normal left coronary artery (LCA). Severe reversible vasospasm of the right coronary artery (RCA) was provoked with the use of ergonovine (<b>ergometrine)</b> <b>maleate</b> at cardiac catheterization. It is postulated that the cause of the previous myocardial infarctions was significant vasospasm of the LCA branches, and that he was subject to multiple coronary vasospasm, as was highlighted by the visualization of spasm superimposed on atheromatous plaque within the RCA. Furthermore, it is strongly suggested that the potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias, including 'torsade de pointes', were a direct result of coronary vasospasm, which in turn gave rise to his presyncope and syncope attacks. No evidence of sinoatrial node disease could be found. The only risk factor for ischaemic heart disease which applied in his case was heavy cigarette smoking. Control of his disabling symptoms seems to have been achieved by the use of maintenance nifedipine (a calcium-blocking agent) long-acting nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate) and quinidine gluconate, confirming the probable vasospastic aetiology of the 'torsade de pointes'. At no stage was there dangerous prolongation of the QT interval, an oft-quoted prerequisite for this arrhythmia. Some of the more important aspects of coronary vasospasm are discussed; as far as I am aware this is the first patient documented in the literature with 'torsade de pointes' associated with angiographically demonstrated coronary artery spasm.

40|$|The haemodynamic {{response}} to myocardial ischaemia {{in patients with}} variant angina during ambulatory activity is unknown. Ambulatory pulmonary artery pressure monitoring with a transducer tipped catheter and simultaneous frequency modulated electrocardiograms {{was used to assess}} changes in left ventricular function in five male patients (mean age 51. 8 years) during variant angina; four patients had coronary artery stenosis and one had normal coronary arteries. Two hundred and seventy hours of ambulatory recordings were analysed. Twenty episodes (12 painful, 8 silent) of ST segment change greater than 1 mm occurred. Episodes tended to occur more frequently in the early morning hours. Six episodes of painful ST elevation were associated with a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. In the remaining episodes ST segment elevation was of shorter duration and there was no rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. Pain was usually a late feature. Silent ST segment elevation occurred at rest and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure increased in all but one episode. Silent exertional ST segment depression was associated with a greater increase in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure than that seen during ST segment elevation. ST segment depression preceded or followed ST segment elevation in two episodes. The onset of ST segment elevation nearly always preceded the onset of a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure. <b>Ergometrine</b> <b>maleate</b> provocation produced a rise in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure in three patients. In one there was no {{response to}} 1000 micrograms but spontaneous episodes of ST segment elevation were recorded during ambulatory monitoring. Treadmill exercise resulted in both ST segment elevation and depression with a similar haemodynamic response during both types of electrocardiographic change. When there is important coronary artery disease in two or more vessels ST segment changes may occur in different territories during treadmill exercise and during spontaneous episodes.
