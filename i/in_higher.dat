40|$|Intact air-grown ({{photosynthetic}} {{photon flux}} density, 400 microeinsteins per square meter per second) clover plants (Trifolium subterraneum L.) were transfered to high CO 2 (4000 microliters CO 2 per liter; {{photosynthetic photon flux}} density, 400 microeinsteins per square meter per second) or to high light (340 microliters CO 2 per liter; photosynthetic photon flux density, 800 microeinsteins per square meter per second) to similarly stimulate photosynthetic net CO 2 uptake. The daily increment of net CO 2 uptake declined transiently <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2, but not <b>in</b> <b>high</b> light, below the values in air/standard light. After about 3 days <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2, the daily increment of net CO 2 uptake increased but did not reach the high light values. Nightly CO 2 release increased immediately <b>in</b> <b>high</b> light, whereas there was a 3 -day lag phase <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2. During this time, starch accumulated to a high level, and leaf deterioration was observed only <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2. After 12 days, starch was two- to threefold <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2 than <b>in</b> <b>high</b> light, whereas sucrose was similar. Leaf carbohydrates were determined during the first and fourth day <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2. Starch increased rapidly throughout the day. Early in the day, sucrose was low and similar <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2 and ambient air (same light). Later, sucrose increased considerably <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2. The findings that (a) much more photosynthetic carbon was partitioned into the leaf starch pool <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2 than <b>in</b> <b>high</b> light, although net CO 2 uptake was similar, and that (b) rapid starch formation occurred <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2 even when leaf sucrose was only slightly elevated suggest that low sink capacity was not the main constraint <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2. It is proposed that carbon partitioning between starch (chloroplast) and sucrose (cytosol) was perturbed by high CO 2 {{because of the lack}} of photorespiration. Total phosphate pools were determined in leaves. Concentrations based on fresh weight of orthophosphate, soluble esterified phosphate, and total phosphate markedly declined during 13 days of exposure of the plants to high CO 2 but changed little <b>in</b> <b>high</b> light/ambient air. During this time, the ratio of orthophosphate to soluble esterified phosphate decreased considerably <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2 and increased slightly <b>in</b> <b>high</b> light/ambient air. It appears that phosphate uptake and growth were similarly stimulated by high light, whereas the coordination was weak <b>in</b> <b>high</b> CO 2...|$|R
