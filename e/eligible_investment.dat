At the same time I examine the impact of GDP growth and inflation. I find a positive effect of GDP growth on the art market. After taking these questions into consideration I found, that even though art is associated with relatively low rate of return, it is <b>eligible</b> <b>investment</b> tool. Since it is unrelated to joint stock, it can serve as a convenient instrument of portfolio diversification. At the same time, Czech paintings may also serve as a very good store of value...|$|E

First, the presence of MNCs in Pakistan, the vast majority of which have made significant CSR undertakings, means that Pakistani firms seeking to do business with them will often have to meet CSR tests themselves. Second, the increasing financial clout of so-called Socially Responsible Investement (SRI) funds means that Pakistani firms have an incentive to comply with CSR standards so as to become <b>eligible</b> <b>investment</b> instruments. We begin by canvassing briefly the history of CSR movement and what are by now relatively well-known CSR principles and standards.

40|$|AbstractIn Uganda the low {{national}} electrification rate {{of around}} 15 % {{and a very}} poor rate of progress in rural electrification, from an estimated 1 % in 2001 to around 7 % in 2013 are identified {{as major challenges for}} economic development and poverty reduction. In this context, the objective of this scientific paper is to analyze the economic feasibility of mini-grids based on renewable energies {{in the context of the}} Ugandan energy market as an off-grid electrification solution. In doing so, financial feasibility of mini-grids is also taken into consideration from macro-economic perspectives and risk management aspects. It acknowledges that off-grid electrification can be seen as mandatory to reach the ambitious national electrification targets and offering a huge opportunity in a so far almost untapped market, while at the same time still facing various financing- and market barriers in Uganda. By an executed case study, the paper simulates the level of subsidies required to reach economic feasibility, revealing that it can only be achieved with high level of subsidies involved due to the currently difficult financing conditions. Therefore, innovative financing recommendations are given by suggesting a layered fund as a multi-level financial support mechanism. Given the appropriate incentives, it can facilitate a subsidy phase-out for mini-grids in regards to a sustainable public sector engagement until self-sustaining market conditions are reached. It could attract investors by offering <b>eligible</b> <b>investment</b> conditions such as appealing return rates on decipherable risks by a reallocation between different shareholder layers, including public sector funding as a safety caution, while at the same time gradually transferring grant funding to revolving funding support step by step...|$|E

The snakes transact their end of the business in a more orderly and systematic way than the government transacts its end of it, because the snakes have had a long experience and know all about the traffic. You can make sure that the government will never kill fewer than 110,000 snakes in a year, and that it will newer quite reach 300,000--too much room for oscillation; good speculative stock, to bear or bull, and buy and sell long and short, and all that kind of thing, but not <b>eligible</b> for <b>investment</b> like the other.

40|$|The CDM is a {{project-based}} {{mechanism to}} promote flexibility in mitigation climate change, by promoting investment in mitigation projects in developing countries. There has been concern about potential perverse incentives {{for developing countries}} like South Africa not to adopt progressive national policies, fearing that CDM projects implementing such policy {{would no longer be}} additional. The CDM rules on additionality require that emissions are reduced ‘below those that would have occurred {{in the absence of the}} registered CDM project activity’. The paper shows that recent decisions by the CDM Executive Board make it clear that such perverse incentives will not be created. The paper suggests concrete interpretations of this guidance for two possible project types. Projects implementing national policies that promote zero- or low-carbon emission technologies (e. g. South Africa’s renewable energy target) can still go through the CDM process. Where there are local regulations, as for landfill gas, projects would not be ruled out entirely, but would receive credit for the difference between actual methane capture and that needed to meet local safety, health and environmental standards.

40|$|The Triodos Bank is of two minds {{regarding}} {{the phenomenon of}} nanotechnology. Companies involved in this technology might be of interest for investments, e. g. because nanotechnology can contribute to a more sustainable world. Triodos aspires this and therefore wonders whether it should implement nanotechnology as a sustainability criterion (or minimum standard) in it’s absolute analysis of stock-listed companies. In this analysis stock-listed companies are assessed on different criteria to conclude {{whether or not they}} are <b>eligible</b> for <b>investments.</b> Or, should Triodos leave the phenomenon aside for a while, and wait for significant discoveries to be made? Earlier studies (2007 - 2009) towards nanotechnology have been executed by Triodos’ researchers and a Nano-framework was built up. However, as a result of the studies, the pro’s of nanotechnology were not perceived as being able to outweigh the con’s. And due to internal developments, nanotechnology was left aside. Triodos now wonders if there are any significant changes in the present time. Therefore Triodos asks the following question: “should we again consider nanotechnology?”. In order to address this question I firstly analyze Triodos’ current Nano-framework. I identify different claims and values in it and establish it’s fundamental attitude as being defensive. Secondly, I oppose the Nano-framework to Triodos’ core business principles. Those business principles – which create the existence of the bank - are offensive, and therefore, a field of tension between both assemblies is constituted. On the one hand the business principles want to change the world actively by promoting sustainability, whilst on the other, the Nano-framework is precautious towards nanotechnology. Above all, nanotechnology has the ability to match Triodos positive aspirations. So why being as precautious as the Nano-framework tends to see? I therefore A) attempt to comment on this via an ethical perspective (the Precautionary Principle), B) consult three Nano-experts on behalf of the results and C) conclude that Triodos’ Nano-framework requires reconsiderations. Ultimately, I present a set of recommendations on how Triodos can accomplish this optimally...|$|R
