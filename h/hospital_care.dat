5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from an artery. Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of <b>hospital</b> <b>care.</b> At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Because most {{research}} on long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospitals</b> {{has focused on}} Medicare, {{the objective of this}} research is to describe the Georgia Medicaid population who received care at a long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital,</b> the type and volume of services provided by these long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospitals,</b> and the costs and outcomes of these services. For those with select respiratory conditions, we descriptively compare costs and outcomes to those of patients who received care for the same services in acute <b>care</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Methods: We describe Georgia Medicaid recipients admitted to a long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital</b> between 2011 and 2012. We compare them to a population of Georgia Medicaid recipients admitted to an acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital</b> for one of five respiratory diagnosis-related groups. Measurements used include patient descriptive information, admissions, diagnosis-related groups, length of stay, place of discharge, 90 -day episode costs, readmissions, and patient risk scores. Results: We found that long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital</b> admissions for Medicaid patients were fairly low (470 90 -day episodes) and restricted to complex cases. We also found that the majority of long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital</b> patients were blind or disabled (71. 2 %). Compared to patients who stayed at an acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital,</b> long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital</b> patients had higher average risk scores (13. 1 versus 9. 0), lengths of stay (61 versus 38 [*]days), costs (US$ 143, 898 versus US$ 115, 056), but fewer discharges to the community (28. 4 % versus 51. 8 %). Conclusion: We found that the Medicaid population seeking care at long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospitals</b> is markedly different than the Medicare populations described in other long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital</b> studies. In addition, our study revealed that Medicaid patients receiving select respiratory care at a long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital</b> were distinct from Medicaid patients receiving similar care at an acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital.</b> Our findings suggest that state Medicaid programs should carefully consider reimbursement policies for long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospitals,</b> including bundled payments that cover both the original hospitalization and long-term acute <b>care</b> <b>hospital</b> admission...|$|R
