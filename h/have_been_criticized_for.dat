5|$|Critical {{and general}} {{reception}} of the character has been mainly favorable, although various aspects have been criticized. While some less gorier skills <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> lacking the appeal of other characters' finishing moves and sounds he yells during regular attacks, Liu Kang's darker characterization in the later games has been praised.|$|E
5|$|Numerous feminist {{movements}} and ideologies have {{developed over the}} years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism {{led to the creation of}} ethnically specific or multicultural forms of feminism, including black feminism and intersectional feminism.|$|E
5|$|The Marvel vs. Capcom {{series has}} {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, who have praised its fast-paced gameplay, animated visuals, and wealth of playable characters. On the other hand, the games <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> {{their lack of}} content, especially more recent installments. The series has enjoyed broad appeal, especially in markets outside of Japan, selling approximately 8.4 million units as of September 2017.|$|E

50|$|GEI and GGP {{measures}} are conceptually more broader. GEI focuses on socioeconomic opportunities, but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> ignoring {{underlying causes of}} gender inequality such as health. GGI is the most comprehensive, through it in turn <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> being too broad.|$|R

5|$|The claims <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> {{ignoring}} {{that the}} second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space system does not violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E
5|$|The media <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> {{focusing}} {{more on the}} First Lady's fashion {{sense than}} her serious contributions. She said after the 2008 election that {{she would like to}} focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families. In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and has stated that Obama is miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{repetitive}} {{actions and}} long-playing times, 4X games <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> excessive micromanagement. In {{early stages of}} a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some approaches have been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that Galactic Civilizations succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game's use of programmable governors. Sins of a Solar Empire was designed to reduce the incentives for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game's interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, Master of Orion III reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> making {{statements}} supporting {{peace and}} respecting national sovereignty, but while carrying out military actions {{such as in}} Grenada, fomenting a civil war in Colombia to break off Panama, and Iraq. The U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> advocating free trade but while protecting local industries with import tariffs on foreign goods such as lumber and agricultural products. The U.S. <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> advocating concern for human rights while refusing to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The U.S. has publicly stated that it is opposed to torture, but <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> condoning it in the School of the Americas. The U.S. has advocated a respect for national sovereignty but has supported internal guerrilla movements and paramilitary organizations, such as the Contras in Nicaragua. The U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> voicing concern about narcotics production {{in countries such as}} Bolivia and Venezuela but doesn't follow through on cutting certain bilateral aid programs. The U.S. <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> not maintaining a consistent policy; it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> accused of denouncing alleged rights violations in China while supporting alleged human rights abuses by Israel.|$|R
5000|$|New Urbanism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> being {{a form of}} {{centrally}} planned, large-scale development, [...] "instead {{of allowing}} the initiative for construction to {{be taken by the}} final users themselves". It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.|$|R

5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new merit system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of the merit system, many governors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating the merit system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E
5|$|Domain-general views <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> {{not fully}} {{explaining}} how children manage to avoid mapping errors {{when there are}} numerous possible referents to which objects, actions, or events might point. For instance, if biases are not present from birth, why do infants assume that labels refer to whole objects, instead of salient parts of these objects? However, domain-general perspectives do not dismiss the notion of biases. Rather, they suggest biases develop through learning strategies instead of existing as built-in constraints. For instance, the whole object bias could be explained as a strategy that humans use to reason about the world; perhaps we are prone to thinking about our environment in terms of whole objects, and this strategy is not specific to the language domain. Additionally, children may be exposed to cues associated with categorization by shape early in the word learning process, which would draw their attention to shape when presented with novel objects and labels. Ordinary learning could, then, lead to a shape bias.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, Chyna {{became the}} first woman to qualify for the King of the Ring tournament. She was also the first female to be the number one {{contender}} for the WWF Championship, but lost the spot to Mankind before SummerSlam in August. Later that year, Laurer became a fan favorite again during her long feud with Jeff Jarrett. At Unforgiven, she had a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jarrett, which she lost. She defeated Jarrett for the title at No Mercy in his last WWF match, a Good Housekeeping match, on October 17 at No Mercy, in the process becoming the first and only woman to win the Intercontinental Championship. She also gained the services of his valet, Miss Kitty. Laurer claims that Jarrett demanded (and received) $300,000 from Vince McMahon in order to lose the title cleanly to a woman. His contract had expired on October 16, and he was therefore not contractually obligated to appear on the pay-per-view. If he had not appeared, the WWF would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> false advertising, and the lineage of the title would have been broken.|$|E

5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>for</b> apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded that the role of hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E
