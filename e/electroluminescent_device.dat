50|$|Upon {{returning}} to Corpus Christi College, {{after a year}} spent in Japan studying the nonlinear optical properties of poly(arylenevinylene) polymers, he {{played a central role}} in the February 1989 discovery of conjugated polymer electroluminescence, suggesting the experiment that led to Jeremy Henley Burroughes' first observation of light emission. Together with Jeremy Burroughes he undertook the initial characterisation of the basic properties of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) light emitting diodes, demonstrating that the light emission phenomenon was injection electroluminescence and that the frequency response was sufficiently fast to permit video display applications. Recognizing the importance of their discovery Bradley and Burroughes decided that it should be patented and together with Richard Friend filed a GB patent (PCT/GB90.00584) with first claim:An <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>device</b> comprising a semiconductor layer in the form of a thin dense polymer film comprising at least one conjugated polymer;''''a first contact layer which is selected so that on application of an electric field to said device charge carriers of a first type are injected into the semiconductor layer; and a second contact layer which is selected so that on application of an electric field to said device charge carriers of a second type are injected into the semiconductor layers, wherein the polymer film of the semiconductor layer has sufficiently low concentration of extrinsic charge carriers that on applying an electric field between the first and second contact layers across the semiconductor layer as to render the second contact layer positive relative to the first contact layer charge carriers of said first and second types are injected into the semiconductor layer and combine to form in the conjugated polymer charge carrier pairs which decay radiatively so that radiation is emitted from the conjugated polymer.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the properties of}} alternating current (AC) -driven electroluminescence from (Ba 0. 4 Ca 0. 6) TiO 3 :Pr 3 + diphase polycrystal-based device. The results of crystal phases and micrographs, and the symmetrical dual emissions in one AC cycle, indicate the spontaneous formation of a dielectric/phosphor/dielectric sandwich microstructure in (Ba 0. 4 Ca 0. 6) TiO 3 :Pr 3 +. The <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>device</b> emits a red light of 617 nm, which is attributed to the 1 D 2 - 3 H 4 transition of Pr 3 + in the phosphor phase. At a fixed AC frequency, the intensity of electroluminescence exhibits a steep enhancement when applying an increased driving electric field that is beyond a threshold. In a fixed driving electric field, the intensity of electroluminescence shows a rapid rise at low frequencies, but reaches saturation at high frequencies. Based on a double-injection model, we discussed systematically the electroluminescent processes in a whole cycle of AC electric field, which matched well with the experimental data.

40|$|A {{new type}} of bottom-emission <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>device</b> is {{described}} in which a metal oxide is used as the electron-injecting contact. The preparation of such a device is simple. It consists of the deposition of {{a thin layer of}} a metal oxide on top of an indium tin oxide covered glass substrate, followed by the solution processing of the light-emitting layer and subsequently the deposition of a high-workfunction (air-stable) metal anode. This architecture allows for a low-cost <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>device</b> because no rigorous encapsulation is required. Electroluminescence with a high brightness reaching 5700 cd m– 2 is observed at voltages as low as 8 V, demonstrating the potential of this new approach to organic light-emitting diode (OLED) devices. Unfortunately the device efficiency is rather low because of the high current density flowing through the device. We show that the device only operates after the insertion of an additional hole-injection layer in between the light-emitting polymer (LEP) and the metal anode. A simple model that explains the experimental results and provides avenues for further optimization of these devices is described. It is {{based on the idea that}} the barrier for electron injection is lowered by the formation of a space–charge field over the metal-oxide–LEP interface due to the build up of holes in the LEP layer close to this interfac...|$|E
