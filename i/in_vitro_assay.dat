25|$|Thalidomide and its immune-modulating analogs {{alter the}} {{production}} of the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-12 and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The analogs are believed to inhibit {{the production of}} TNF-α, where the analogs are up to 50.000 times more potent in vitro than the parent drug thalidomide. The mechanism is believed to be through enhanced degradation of TNF-α mRNA, resulting in diminished amounts of this pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted. This explains the effect of thalidomide when given to ENL patients, as they commonly have high levels of TNF-α in their blood and in dermatological lesions. In contrast, <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assay</b> demonstrated that TNF-α is actually enhanced in T-cell activation, where CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were stimulated by anti-CD3 which was later confirmed in an early phase trials involving solid tumors and inflammatory dermatologic diseases.|$|E

30|$|The {{title of}} this short essay asks “in <b>vitro</b> or not <b>in</b> vitro?”. Hopefully, we could provide convincing {{arguments}} {{that the answer is}} clearly positive for the use of <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assays</b> <b>in</b> ecotoxicology and that this is supported not only from ethical but also from scientific grounds. <b>In</b> fact, <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assays</b> can enhance the currently used approaches in ecotoxicological hazard assessment. While in vivo tests such as the fish acute lethality test bear little ecological relevance [28], a battery of <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assays</b> generating a toxicity profile of a chemical or environmental sample and informing on the initial steps of adverse outcomes can provide in-depth information on ecological functions at risk. In combination with genomic technologies, <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assays</b> offer ample opportunities for a more informed hazard assessment, both in chemical testing and in the monitoring of the environment. As such, they are an important tool in moving descriptive approaches to a more systematic and predictive assessment of the environmental risk of chemicals and complex mixtures.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} define an <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> {{integrated}} testing strategy (ITS) for estrogenicity, {{a set of}} 23 reference compounds representing diverse chemical classes were tested {{in a series of}} <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assays</b> including proliferation and reporter gene assays. Outcomes of these assays were combined with published results for estrogen receptor (ER) binding assays and the OECD validated BG 1 Luc ER transcriptional activation (TA) assay and compared with the outcomes of the in vivo uterotrophic assay to investigate which assays most accurately predict the in vivo uterotrophic effect and to identify discrepancies between the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assays</b> and the <b>in</b> vivo uterotrophic <b>assay.</b> All <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assays</b> used revealed a reasonable to good correlation (R 2 ¿=¿ 0. 62 – 0. 87) with the in vivo uterotrophic assay but the combination of the yeast estrogen bioassay with the U 2 OS ERa-CALUX assay seems most promising for an ITS for <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> estrogenicity testing.

50|$|Citrus sinesis and Chenopodium album {{were the}} first plants from which the genes {{encoding}} chlorophyllase were isolated. These experiments revealed an uncharacteristic encoded sequence (21 amino acids in Citrus sinensis and 30 amino acids in Chenopodium album) located on the N-terminal that was absent from the mature protein. The chlorophyllase enzyme is a smart choice as the rate limiting enzyme of the catabolic pathway since degreening and the expression of chlorophyllase is induced in ethylene-treated Citrus. Recent data, however, suggests that chlorophyllase is expressed at low levels during natural fruit development, when chlorophyll catabolism usually takes place. Also, some data suggests that chlorophyllase activity is not consistent with degreening during natural senescence. Finally, {{there is evidence that}} chlorophyllase has been found in the inner envelope membrane of chloroplast where it does not come in contact with chlorophyll. Recent studies inspired by inconsistent data revealed that chlorophyllase in Citrus lacking the 21 amino sequence on the N-terminal results in extensive chlorophyll breakdown and the degreening effect that should occur in vivo. This cleavage occurs in the chloroplast membrane fraction. Both the full chlorophyllase and the cleaved, mature chlorophyllase, however, experienced similar levels of activity in an <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>assay.</b> This data suggests that the mature protein comes in contact with its substrate more readily because of the N-terminal sequence and some natural regulation occurs that directly affects enzyme activity. Another possibility is that the suborganelle compartments breaking down allowing a greater amount of enzyme activity.|$|E
