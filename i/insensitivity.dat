5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones have been linked to acne, including the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (<b>insensitivity</b> to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E
5|$|For some people, aspirin {{does not}} have as strong an effect on {{platelets}} as for others, an effect known as aspirin-resistance or <b>insensitivity.</b> One study has suggested {{women are more likely}} to be resistant than men, and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 people found 28% were resistant.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Australian arm of KFC {{was accused}} of racial <b>insensitivity</b> over a {{television}} commercial showing an outnumbered white cricket fan handing out pieces of fried chicken to appease a dancing, drumming and singing group of black West Indies supporters. The clip found its way {{around the world on}} the internet, prompting stinging criticism in the United States where fried chicken remains closely associated with long-standing racist stereotypes about black people in the once segregated south.|$|E
5|$|The human ear can {{generally}} hear sounds with frequencies between 20 Hz and 20 kHz (the audio range). Sounds {{outside this}} range are considered infrasound (below 20Hz) or ultrasound (above 20kHz) Although hearing requires an intact and functioning auditory {{portion of the}} central nervous system as well as a working ear, human deafness (extreme <b>insensitivity</b> to sound) most commonly occurs because of abnormalities of the inner ear, rather than in the nerves or tracts of the central auditory system.|$|E
5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled San Francisco Police Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against {{the wishes of the}} SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial <b>insensitivity</b> and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E
5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} hooped crinoline {{may be seen}} as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial <b>insensitivity.</b> It was noted that hoop skirts and crinolines had been worn by both black and white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, {{met with}} Groves on 30 January 1948 to {{evaluate}} his performance. Eisenhower recounted {{a long list}} of complaints about Groves pertaining to his rudeness, arrogance, <b>insensitivity,</b> contempt for the rules and maneuvering for promotion out of turn. Eisenhower made it clear that Groves would never become Chief of Engineers. Groves realized that in the rapidly shrinking postwar military he would not be given any assignment approaching in importance the one he had held in the Manhattan Project, as such posts would go to combat commanders returning from overseas, and he decided to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 24 January 1948, just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the Manhattan Project. By special Act of Congress his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test.|$|E
5|$|Half a {{year after}} the Lindisfarne trip, Pete and Jenny have separated. He moves from house to house, {{eventually}} finding a houseshare with a gay landlord. He has a brief fling with Ramona, which is followed by some dates with a teacher (Pooky Quesnel). Jenny begins a relationship with a dotcom millionaire (Ben Miles), who decorates her house with flowers and takes her on a trip to New York. The fling ends when Jenny realises he does not love her. She and Pete reconcile after briefly considering a divorce. David and Karen bring home their newborn twins, and Karen's ex-pat mother (Mel Martin) moves in for a couple of episodes. Karen is reunited with an old boyfriend (Richard Dillane), who is in Manchester for a photography exhibition. Karen is rivalled by Jenny, who has returned to working to pay the bills while Pete is living elsewhere. David takes a sudden interest in politics after meeting local residents' activist Jessica (Yasmin Bannerman). He starts an affair with her but she dumps him after being offended by his <b>insensitivity</b> when he tries to end it. Karen finds out about the affair in Episode 8 but is adamant that she and David will stay together for the children. Adam and Rachel decide to have children but are distraught to discover that she is infertile from complications with her abortion. They decide to get married instead but Adam is briefly tempted when he reunites with a long-lost love (Victoria Smurfit) on his stag weekend to Belfast.|$|E
5|$|Sarah {{was called}} to Cambridge in 1703, where her only {{surviving}} son, John, Marquess of Blandford, was taken ill with smallpox. The Duke of Marlborough was recalled from the war and was at his bedside when he died on 20 February 1703. Sarah was heartbroken {{over the loss of}} her son and became reclusive for a period, expressing her grief by closing herself off from Anne and either not answering her letters or doing so in a cold and formal manner. However, Sarah did not allow Anne to shut her out when Anne suffered bereavement. After the death of Anne's husband, Prince George of Denmark in 1708, Sarah arrived, uninvited, at Kensington Palace to find Anne with the prince's body. She pressed the heartbroken Queen to move from Kensington to St James's Palace in London, which Anne bluntly refused, and instead commanded Sarah to call Abigail Masham to attend her. Aware that Abigail was gaining more influence with Anne, Sarah disobeyed her, and instead scolded her for grieving over Prince George's death. Although Anne eventually submitted and allowed herself to be taken to St James's Palace, Sarah's <b>insensitivity</b> greatly offended her and added to the already significant strain on the relationship.|$|E
25|$|CAIS {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{categories}} of androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (AIS) since AIS is differentiated according to the degree of genital masculinization: complete androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (CAIS) when the external genitalia is that of a normal female, mild androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (MAIS) when the external genitalia is that of a normal male, and partial androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (PAIS) when the external genitalia is partially, but not fully masculinized.|$|E
25|$|Individuals {{with mild}} (or minimal) {{androgen}} <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (grade 1 on the Quigley scale) are born phenotypically male, with fully masculinized genitalia; this category of androgen <b>insensitivity</b> is diagnosed when {{the degree of}} androgen <b>insensitivity</b> in an individual with a 46,XY karyotype is great enough to impair virilization or spermatogenesis, but is not great enough to impair normal male genital development. MAIS is the mildest and least known form of androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome.|$|E
25|$|PAIS is one {{of three}} types of {{androgen}} <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome, which is divided into three categories that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization: complete androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is that of a normal female, mild androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is that of a normal male, and partial androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia is partially, but not fully masculinized.|$|E
25|$|Relative <b>insensitivity</b> to {{lidocaine}} is genetic. In hypokalemic sensory overstimulation, relative <b>insensitivity</b> to lidocaine {{has been}} described in people who also have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In dental anaesthesia, a relative <b>insensitivity</b> to lidocaine can occur for anatomical reasons due to unexpected positions of nerves. Some people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are insensitive to lidocaine.|$|E
25|$|AIS {{is divided}} into three {{categories}} that are differentiated by the degree of genital masculinization: complete androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (CAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal female; mild androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (MAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are that of a normal male, and partial androgen <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (PAIS) is indicated when the external genitalia are partially, but not fully, masculinized.|$|E

25|$|All {{forms of}} {{androgen}} <b>insensitivity</b> {{are associated with}} infertility, though exceptions have been reported for both the mild and partial forms. Lifespan is not thought {{to be affected by}} AIS.|$|E
25|$|Mild {{androgen}} <b>insensitivity</b> syndrome (MAIS) is {{a condition}} that results in a mild impairment of the cell's {{ability to respond to}} androgens. The degree of impairment is sufficient to impair spermatogenesis and / or the development of secondary sexual characteristics at puberty in males, but does not affect genital differentiation or development. Female genital and sexual development is not significantly affected by the <b>insensitivity</b> to androgens; as such, MAIS is only diagnosed in males. The clinical phenotype associated with MAIS is a normal male habitus with mild spermatogenic defect and / or reduced secondary terminal hair.|$|E
25|$|The westerners' {{two main}} demands—protection from the Indians {{and the right}} to {{navigate}} the Mississippi River—went mainly unheeded during the 1780s. North Carolina's <b>insensitivity</b> led frustrated East Tennesseans in 1784 to form the breakaway State of Franklin.|$|E
