Many of them have also <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> a number of museums in Europe and America. Most of these sculptures have been found through the excavations in Somapura Mahavihara. Pala sculpture derives its origins from the late Gupta style, but later on deviated from it.|$|R
5|$|Cartledge {{pursued the}} claim anyway {{in an attempt}} to have the law changed, and {{decisions}} were made against him in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal. After the Court of Appeal decision a Committee on Limitation of Actions in Cases of Personal Injury was created under Mr Justice Davies, which produced its report before the Cartledge case had even got to the House of Lords. The report, published in September 1962, made several recommendations which <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> a Limitation Bill placed before Parliament on 6 May 1963. While it was passing through the House of Lords, Lord Reid suggested it would be simpler to amend the Limitation Act 1939, but this was never acted on. The act received the Royal Assent on 31 July 1963 and came into force immediately.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the spread}} of such ideas was {{forbidden}} in the Spanish territories, as was the sale of related books or their unauthorized possession. Spain instituted those bans when it declared war on France after the execution of LouisXVI and retained them after the peace treaty of 1796. News {{of the events of}} 1789 and copies of the publications of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite efforts to keep them at bay. Many enlightened criollos came into contact with liberal authors and their works during their university studies, either in Europe or at the University of Chuquisaca (modern Sucre).

Two Kraft products were involved in direct tie-ins: the Bull's-Eye BBQ Burger in 2005 and the A-1 Steakhouse XT sandwich in 2010. In both cases, Burger King prominently used {{the names of the}} Kraft products, A1 Steak Sauce and Bull's-Eye Barbecue Sauce, in the names of the sandwiches. Kraft has supplied several of Burger King's children's products, including a Jell-O brand dessert during BK's Teletubbies promotion in 1999, and the Kraft macaroni and cheese used in its lower-fat kid's meals introduced in 2009.|$|E
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of the video film market in Nigeria is {{traced back to the}} 1980s when television productions thrived. Many of the television productions often <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> VHS, leading {{to the development of a}} small scale informal video trade. This method was adopted and built on by producers and distributors at Alaba market to reinvent the film industry which was at the time facing a major decline. The first film produced on video in Nigeria is 1988's Soso Meji, produced by Ade Ajiboye. Subsequently, Alade Aromire produced Ekun (1989) on video. However, the boom experienced in this era is generally believed to have been kick started by Kenneth Nnebue's Living in Bondage (1992), although some historians claim otherwise.|$|R

On 13 November an auction was held, although the railway failed to attract much interest. Most rolling stock, and every loco except for Lew, was scrapped at Pilton. Some coaches were sectioned for use as garden sheds. Third class seats became garden furniture, and first class seats <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> local snooker halls and Masonic lodges. In December, Plymouth ship breaker Sidney Castle won the tender to dismantle the railway. The remaining track was lifted by June 1936, and in September, surviving loco Lew was shipped to Brazil. The stations and track bed were auctioned in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The {{asteroid}} belt formed from the primordial solar nebula {{as a group}} of planetesimals. Planetesimals are the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter imbued the protoplanets with too much orbital energy for them to accrete into a planet. Collisions became too violent, and instead of fusing together, the planetesimals and most of the protoplanets shattered. As a result, 99.9% of the {{asteroid belt}}'s original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits.|$|E

The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention, but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie {{by a vote of}} 50 to 43. A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures {{to protect the rights of}} slaveholders in the new constitution. Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction, and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic.

The valuable gold coins <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> Lower Austria too. King Ferdinand I of Habsburg established their exchange rate 7 % {{lower than that of}} the Hungarian ducats. On the other hand, the Ottoman authorities in Buda set the exchange rate of the Hungarian ducat at a level that was approximately 6 % lower than the exchange rate of the Turkish ducat. The fact that the exchange rates in the markets differed from those fixed in the respective orders of the states indicated that the two opposing great powers were not only battling in the field, but were also engaged in an economic struggle. The author, apart from the contemporary Venetian exchange rates, used several other pieces of evidence concerning money circulation in remote areas of Europe...|$|R

5|$|Tipu then {{ordered the}} {{destruction}} of all 27 churches in Canara. According to oral tradition, the Idgah mosque in Mangalore was constructed with stones from the destroyed Milagres Church. Other Christian establishments that were spared were converted to storehouses, offices, or homes for wealthy Muslims. A popular fortification in Mangalore, the Sultan Battery, built in 1784 by Tipu Sultan to prevent English warships from entering the Gurupura river, was constructed with stones taken from destroyed churches. The bells from the demolished churches eventually <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> a number of temples in the area. After being informed of the impending roundup by a friend in Tipu's government, Fr. Joachim Miranda disbanded St. Joseph's Seminary and sent the seminarians to Verapoly, from where some proceeded to Goa while some joined the Augustinian order.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{weaponry}} used by Phan's rebels was far {{inferior to}} that of their adversaries, and their inland positions were within firing range of the French Navy. The Vietnamese could not rely on China to give them material support, and other European powers such as Portugal, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom were unwilling to sell them weapons for various reasons. Thus, Phan had to explore overland routes to procure weapons from Siamese sourcesusing seafaring transport was impossible due {{to the presence of}} the French Navy. He instructed his followers to create a secret route from Hà Tĩnh through Laos into northeastern Siam; one such route from Mount Vu Quang was believed to have been created around 1888. It is unclear if Phan himself went to Thailand, but a young female supporter named Co Tam was his designated arms buyer in Tha Uthen, which boasted a substantial expatriate Vietnamese community. In 1890, the Siamese Army transported around 1,000 Austrian repeating-rifles from Bangkok to Luang Prabang in Laos. However, it is unclear whether the weapons <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Vietnamese hands or whether they were related to Co Tam's activities.|$|E
5|$|Two-hundred fifty of Task Force Smith's {{force had}} {{returned}} to the American lines before nightfall, with about 150 more of the force killed, wounded or missing. Most of the other stragglers <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the American lines over the next several days. The last stragglers from 2nd Platoon, B Company, reached Chonan five days later, only 30 minutes ahead of the North Korean army. Upon the initial count, Task Force Smith suffered 20 killed in action, 130 wounded in action or missing in action, and around 36 captured. After {{the end of the war}} this figure was revised to 60 dead, 21 wounded and 82 captured, 32 of whom died in captivity. This casualty count accounted for 40 percent of Task Force Smith. U.S. troops advancing northward during the Pusan breakout offensive would later discover a series of shallow graves containing the bodies of several soldiers of the 24th Infantry Division. All had been shot in the back of the head, their hands bound behind their backs with communications wire. North Korean casualties were approximately 42 dead and 85 wounded, with four tanks destroyed or immobilized. The North Korean advance was delayed approximately seven hours.|$|E

In a five-month field study, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate how office workers in 40 offices experience and use automatically controlled exterior venetian blinds with options for manual override and switching off the automatic mode. In total, 3433 blinds adjustments (average of 0. 86 per office per day) were recorded, of which 73. 6 % was initiated by the user. Significant correlations between weather parameters and blind adjustments were found, including sunshine duration and user-triggered lowering of blinds (R= 0. 354), cloud cover and user-triggered lowering of the blinds (R=- 0. 281), and outside temperature and user-triggered raising of blinds (R=- 0. 266). Four blinds usage profiles were identified and the underlying motivations for the different users were described. In the majority of offices, the automatic mode was switched off...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} Vision Systems have <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> <b>into</b> many {{real-world}} applications. This includes such fields as surveillance and tracking, computer graphics and various factory settings such as assembly line inspection and object manipulation. The application of Computer Vision techniques to factory automation, Machine Vision, {{is a growing}} field. However in most Machine Vision systems an algorithm is needed to infer 3 D information regarding the objects {{in the field of}} view. Such a task can be accomplished using a Stereo Vision algorithm. In this thesis a new Machine Vision Algorithm for Close-Range Position Sensing is presented where a Hopfield Neural Network is used for the Stereo Matching stage: stereo Matching is formulated as an energy minimization task which is accomplished using the Hopfield Neural Networks. Various other important aspects of this Vision System are discussed including camera calibration and objects localization. Source: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 45 - 01, page: 0423.

5|$|Aside from {{complaints}} {{regarding the}} high retail {{price for the}} three-record set, particularly in Britain – {{a result of the}} government's refusal to waive its tax surcharge – controversy soon surrounded the project's fundraising. Because the event had not been registered as a UNICEF benefit beforehand, and was therefore not granted tax-exempt status – the blame for which Harrison lay squarely at Klein's feet – most of the money generated was held in an Internal Revenue Service escrow account for ten years. In interview with Derek Taylor for his autobiography in the late 1970s, Harrison put this figure at somewhere between $8 million and $10 million. Before then, in early 1972, New York magazine reported that some of the proceeds remained unaccounted for and had <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Klein's accounts. Klein responded by suing the magazine for $150 million in damages, and although the suit was later withdrawn, the accusations attracted unwelcome scrutiny at a time when questions were also being asked about Klein's mismanagement of the Beatles' finances. That year, an estimated $2 million had gone to the refugees via UNICEF before the IRS audit of Apple got under way; finally, in 1981, $8.8 million was added to that total following the audit.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Mikhail Gorbachev {{introduced}} perestroika and its reforms, permitting {{free speech and}} pluralism, Aeroflot had shown considerable growth. In 1950, air transportation only accounted for 1.2 {{percent of the total}} passenger transportation turnover in the Soviet Union, yet, by 1987, air travel accounted for 18.7 of that. It continues growing today. After the Soviet Union broke up, Boris Yeltsin ushered in a new, free market economy. Foreign airlines were permitted to land in Russia and Aeroflot split into several sectors, including today's airline that bears the same name. It became a privatized company, and soon other airlines <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Russian spotlight. Transaero Airlines and S7 (Sibir) Airlines commenced operations in mid-1992. In 1993, Transaero became the first Russian aircraft operator to receive Boeing airplanes. Transaero only operated three Russian built Tu-124 airplanes, the rest of their fleet consists of only Boeing types (747, 777, 767)—modernizing and Westernizing Russian aviation. S7, though originally operating more Soviet-built airplanes, currently fly only Airbus and Boeing types. Aeroflot, too, followed suit. Beginning in 1994, Aeroflot began taking deliveries of Western Airplanes. Aeroflot uses its Airbus and Boeing fleet primarily on Western routes to encourage Western passenger travel. In 2006, Aeroflot joined the global airline alliance SkyTeam, and in 2010, S7 joined a different global alliance, OneWorld. The Soviet aviation industry has unequivocally shifted to adapt more modern and Western philosophies of air travel, although it was the inventive Soviet style of air transportation that helped build Russia, its industries and its widespread global influence into what it is today.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Walpole {{moved into}} a house near Keswick in the Lake District. His large income enabled him to {{maintain}} his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, {{on the slopes of}} Catbells overlooking Derwentwater, was his main home {{for the rest of his}} life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> his fiction. The critic James Agate commented that one might think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart-Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long-sought conception of a perfect friend. Cheevers, a policeman, with a wife and two children, left the police force and entered Walpole's service as his chauffeur. Walpole trusted him completely, and gave him extensive control over his affairs. Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family.|$|E
