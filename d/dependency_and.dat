5|$|Godwin is {{generally}} regarded as {{the founder of the}} school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in Political Justice (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates <b>dependency</b> <b>and</b> ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{plays at}} the park with his teddy, Rupert. A vicious dog grabs Rupert from him and tears it to shreds. Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased <b>dependency</b> <b>and</b> even has a nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.|$|E
5|$|The second epoch saw the reigns of {{the last}} three legendary kings. The second epoch was more {{consequential}} than was the first, which was in part due to the significant degree of territorial expansion which occurred during this period. Regardless of how true these legends were, it is likely that, as the legends suggest, a series of conquests did occur during the late monarchy. As a result of these conquests, it became necessary to determine what was to be done with the conquered people. Often, individuals whose towns had been conquered remained in those towns, while other such individuals came to Rome. To acquire legal and economic standing, these newcomers adopted a condition of dependency toward either a Patrician family, or toward the king. Eventually, the individuals who were dependents of the king were released from their state of <b>dependency,</b> <b>and</b> became the first Plebeians. As Rome grew, it needed more soldiers to continue its conquests. When the Plebeians were released from their dependency, they were released from their Curia. When this occurred, while they were no longer required to serve in the army, they also lost their political and economic standing. To bring these new Plebeians back into the army, the Patricians were forced to make concessions. While it is not known exactly what concessions were made, {{the fact that they were}} not granted any political power set the stage for what history knows as the Conflict of the Orders.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the Citizenship Act 1977 defines 'New Zealand' as New Zealand, the Cook Islands, Niue, the Ross <b>Dependency</b> <b>and</b> Tokelau, the Citizenship (Western Samoa) Act 1982 defines 'New Zealand' to mean New Zealand only.

25|$|This {{question}} about what comes first (the functions or the constellation) is not an inflexible matter. The stances of both grammar types (<b>dependency</b> <b>and</b> constituency grammars) is not narrowly limited to the traditional views. <b>Dependency</b> <b>and</b> constituency are both fully compatible with both approaches to the syntactic functions. Indeed, monostratal systems, be they dependency- or constituency-based, will likely reject {{the notion that the}} functions are derived from the constellation or that the constellation is derived from the functions. They will take both to be primitive, which means neither can be derived from the other.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} schema {{conversion}} from relational schemas to XML DTDs. As functional dependencies {{play an important}} role in schema conversion process, the concept of functional dependency for XML DTDs is proposed to preserve the semantics implied by functional <b>dependencies</b> <b>and</b> keys of relational schemas. A conversion method called NeT-FD (Nesting-Based Translation with Functional Dependencies) is proposed to convert relational schemas to XML DTDs in the presence of functional <b>dependencies</b> <b>and</b> keys. The method presented here can preserve the semantics implied by functional <b>dependencies</b> <b>and</b> keys of relational schemas and can convert multiple tables to XML DTDs at the same time. 1...|$|R

25|$|Pain is {{typically}} treated with opioids, varying in potency {{based on the}} severity of symptoms. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, drug tolerance, chemical <b>dependency,</b> <b>and</b> addiction may occur.

Thus, lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen.|$|E
