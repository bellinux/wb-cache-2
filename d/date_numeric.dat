40|$|Text {{recognition}} in scene image and video frames {{is difficult because}} of low resolution, blur, background noise, etc. Since traditional OCRs do not perform well in such images, information retrieval using keywords could be an alternative way to index/retrieve such text information. Date is a useful piece of information which has various applications including date-wise videos/scene searching, indexing or retrieval. This paper presents a date spotting based information retrieval system for natural scene image and video frames where text appears with complex backgrounds. We propose a line based date spotting approach using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) {{which is used to}} detect the date information in a given text. Different date models are searched from a line without segmenting characters or words. Given a text line image in RGB, we apply an efficient gray image conversion to enhance the text information. Wavelet decomposition and gradient sub-bands are used to enhance text information in gray scale. Next, Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG) feature has been extracted from gray image and binary images for date-spotting framework. Binary and gray image features are combined by MLP based Tandem approach. Finally, to boost the performance further, a shape coding based scheme is used to combine the similar shape characters in same class during word spotting. For our experiment, three different date models have been constructed to search similar <b>date</b> information having <b>numeric</b> <b>dates</b> that contains numeral values and punctuations and semi-numeric that contains dates with numerals along with months in scene/video text. We have tested our system on 1648 text lines and the results show the effectiveness of our proposed date spotting approach...|$|R

40|$|The {{object-oriented}} {{data model}} {{is the culmination of}} over thirty years of database research. Initially, database research focused on the need to provide information in a consistent and efficient manner to the business community. Early data models such as the hierarchical model and the network model met the goal of consistent and efficient access to data and were substantial improvements over simple file mechanisms for storing and accessing data. However, these models required highly skilled programmers to provide access to the data. Consequently, in the early 70 's E. F. Codd, an IBM research computer scientists, proposed a new data model based on the simple mathematical notion of the relation. This model is known as the Relational Model. In the relational model, data is represented in flat tables (or relations) which have no physical or internal links between them. The simplicity of this model fostered the development of powerful but relatively simple query languages that now made data directly accessible to the general database user. Except for large, multi-user database systems, a database professional was in general no longer necessary. Database professionals found that traditional data in the form of character data, <b>dates,</b> and <b>numeric</b> data were easily represented and managed via the relational model. Commercial relational database management systems proliferated and performance of relational databases improved dramatically. However, there was a growing community of potential database users whose needs were not met by the relational model. These users needed to store data with data types not available in the relational model and who required a far richer modelling environment than that provided by the relational model. Indeed, the complexity of the objects to be represented in the model mandated a new approach to database technology. The Object-Oriented Model was the result...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA stratigraphically and {{temporally}} ordered {{sequence of}} channel calcretes preserved along the Wadi Dana, Southern Jordan, records the Quaternary {{evolution of the}} formation and infilling of rock-cut channels and their subsequent incision in a tectonically subsiding basin. It is currently unknown under what palaeoenvironmental conditions these non-pedogenic calcretes formed. Stable isotope analyses {{have been used to}} investigate whether any past topographical, hydrological, vegetational, diagenetic, and/or temporal signatures can be identified from the channel calcretes. The results of this research indicate that channel calcrete development is influenced by altitudinal variation (affecting vegetation and hydrology) within the landscape as well as location within individual wadi channels (which has an affect on diagenetic processes). The lack of calcretisation of a terrace that is between + 1 and 1. 5 m above the modern wadi floor supports the idea that the environment is currently too arid for calcrete to develop. Thus the presence of older Wadi Dana channel duricrusts suggests wetter conditions when they formed. The δ 18 O data of the calcrete implies cooler conditions than today, as there is little evidence of a strong evaporative effect.

The word stems are generated by string to word vector conversion applied to the artist and title attributes. Standard word delimiters are used to split multiple text strings to words and the Porter stemming algorithm [24] reduces words to common stems in order to map different forms of one word to their common stem. To limit the number of attributes that are left after conversion, a minimum word frequency is set, which determines how often a word stem must occur within one class. While the artist word list looks very specific to the collection of artists in the database, the title word list seems to have more general relevance with words like [...] "love", [...] "feel", or [...] "sweet".

40|$|ABSTRACT: 19 th and 20 th century {{stratigraphy}} often concerned itself {{primarily with}} classification and nomenclature, during {{what can be}} termed the heroic and codex ages of stratigraphy. In contrast, 21 st century stratigraphy will fall within the post-modern age. In possession of agreed classification schemes, future stratigraphers will concentrate on (i) the reconstruction of earth environments and processes (including evolution) through time, (ii) the eficient location and recovery of useful earth resources, and (iii) the study of those geological hazards that can be understood within a stratigraphic context. The first objective- reconstructing environments through time- {{requires the use of}} a conceptual framework similar to the one that we term the geological time scale (GTS). The 21 st century GTS will be based on GSSP designations at the base of all geological Periods and, ultimately, Ages, i. e. it will comprise an internationally agreed chronologic hierarchy. Recognition of local chronologic schemes (as distinct from biostratigraphies based on Oppelzones) will thereafter serve no useful purpose and local “Ages ” will become redun-dant. Globally, recognition of a separate but completely parallel chronostratigraphic classification will also serve no useful purpose, and this hierarchy too will be abandoned. Correlation of events into the GTS will be undertaken using a wide variety of methods, including <b>numeric</b> <b>dating,</b> fossil occurrence, physical and chemical properties, tephrochronology and astrochronologic retrodictions. Biostrati-graphy, though remaining a vital tool, especially for Phanerozoic strata, will carry no necessary correlation primacy.

40|$|The two {{youngest}} interglacials, {{the current}} Holocene and the Last Interglacial, are very widely geologically studied. Dating {{techniques such as}} radiocarbon (for the Holocene) and Uranium/Thorium (for the Last Interglacial) allow quite precise <b>numeric</b> <b>dating.</b> Annually layered sequences, such as the Greenland ice core records (for the Holocene) and varved sequences (for the Last Interglacial) provide further dating control, especially where estimating durations is involved. Correlation techniques and event-stratigraphy (whether short-lived climatic events, volcanic eruptions or other semi-instantaneous events such as sea-level jumps) provide yet further control. In this presentation, we will compare the currently used chronostratigraphic divisions for the Termination I and the Holocene to those in use for Termination II and the Last Interglacial. Three important events in the former are [1]: • Base MIS 1, at maximum change of benthic δ 18 O within Termination I, c. 14. 7 ka • Base Holocene, at maximum climatic change in the North Atlantic incl. Greenland, c. 11. 702 B 2 K • Base Middle Holocene, following the last major North-Atlantic meltwaterpulse, c. 8. 2 ka Three correlative events in the latter may be [1, 2, 3]: • Base MIS 5 e, at maximum change of benthic δ 18 O within Termination II, c. 131 ka • Base Last Interglacial, (?) at maximum climatic change in the North Atlantic (?), c. 126 ka • Base Eemian, (?) following the last major North-Atlantic meltwaterpulse (?), c. 121 ka The chronostratigraphic definition of some of mentioned boundaries (Middle Holocene, Base Last Interglacial) is currently {{on the agenda of}} the ICS’ [4] Subcommission of Quaternary Stratigraphy [5]. Besides establishing as accurate and independent as possible numeric ages for the boundaries, correlation of the units to the Marine Isotope Stratigraphy (and the termination midpoints that define the stages) and to regional bio-/chronostratigraphic units such as the NW European Eemian is part of the definition activity. Comparing how we treat our subdivision definitions for the two youngest interglacials may help to reach mutually consistent forms of the wanted definitions. For the youngest stratigraphic intervals this may be very important because these intervals serve as sequence stratigraphic keys to the further past and as calibration period for our understanding of the climate system at Milankovitch time-scales.

40|$|Ocean Drilling Program Site 1119 {{is located}} east of South Island, New Zealand, in 394 m water depth {{on the upper}} {{continental}} slope. Though 93 km offshore today, during recent glaciations the site lay near the lowstand shoreline, directly beneath the path of seasonal riverine meltwater plumes. The core comprises an upper portion (0 – 86. 19 metres composite depth (mcd)) deposited as upper slope clinoforms and a lower portion (to 513. 5 mcd) deposited as mid-slope, intermediate water depth sediment drifts, the two intervals being separated across a short c. 25 k. y. long unconformity within Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 8. Almost throughout, the core comprises alternating micaceous muds and silts (glacials) and muddy, sometimes calcareous, sands (interglacials). Because of the enhanced potassium content of the terrigenous muds, the lithologies that characterise the two different climatic states possess markedly different natural gamma radiation signals, high and low, respectively. The natural gamma profile of Site 1119 therefore provides a high quality climatic time series with a 1 – 2 k. y. resolution (as sampled) back to the mid-Pliocene. The cyclic gamma ray pattern provides a proxy measure of ice volume in the Southern Alps, and is therefore an atmospheric record. This record matches closely that of oceanic oxygen isotope curves back to MIS 100 (2. 4 Ma) and less closely beyond to MIS Gi- 11 (3. 91 Ma) {{at the base of}} the core. Marked, high gamma ray intervals at 3. 68 – 3. 63, 3. 38, 3. 12, and 2. 80 – 2. 67 Ma may reflect sharp mid-latitude atmospheric coolings at these times, as supported by marine faunal and isotopic evidence elsewhere in the New Zealand region. Alternatively, they may in part reflect changes in clay provenance consequent upon tectonic uplift in the hinterland. The natural gamma measurements are consistent with an overall decline of 6 °C in average atmospheric temperature over South Island, New Zealand, since 2. 45 Ma. Milankovitch 41 k. y. cyclicity is also prominent in the natural gamma record over this period, and its 60 API unit magnitude implies temperature swings up to 12 °C between glacials and interglacials (G/I). Similarly large G/I temperature changes occur also in nearby sea surface temperatures east of South Island and in atmospheric temperatures in Antarctica (Vostok), suggesting that Pleistocene climate signals were closely synchronised across wide areas of Southern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. Together with changing tectonic and related palaeogeographic patterns, these temperature changes must have played a significant role in influencing the local time ranges of taxa used in biostratigraphy. Very few, if any, traditional New Zealand Pliocene-Pleistocene index fossils have synchronous ranges across the region, and other methods of correlation (magnetostratigraphy, cyclostratigraphy, tephrochronology, isotope stratigraphy, and <b>numeric</b> <b>dating)</b> have therefore come to be of particular importance.
