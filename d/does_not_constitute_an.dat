"As regards El Salvador, the Court {{considers}} that in {{customary international law}} the provision of arms to the opposition in another State <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>an</b> armed attack on that State. As regards Honduras and Costa Rica, the Court states that, {{in the absence of}} sufficient information as to the transborder incursions into the territory of those two States from Nicaragua, it is difficult to decide whether they amount, singly or collectively, to an armed attack by Nicaragua. The Court finds that neither these incursions nor the alleged supply of arms may be relied on as justifying the exercise of the right of collective self-defence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{holding in}} Michigan v. Jackson was narrowed {{later by the}} Court in McNeil v.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, from the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against compelled self-incrimination. [...] "Therefore, while a defendant who has invoked his Sixth Amendment right to counsel with respect to the offense for which he is being prosecuted may not waive that right, he may waive his Miranda–based right not to be interrogated about unrelated and uncharged offenses." [...] Also the Court held in Michigan v. Harvey, , that evidence acquired in violation of Michigan v. Jackson could be used for impeachment purposes.|$|E

60|$|It {{may seem}} to the reader that all this insistence upon the supreme {{necessity}} for an organized literature springs merely from the obsession of a writer by his own calling, but, indeed, that is not so. We who write are not all so blinded by conceit of ourselves {{that we do not}} know something of our absolute personal value. We are lizards in an empty palace, frogs crawling over a throne. But it is a palace, it is a throne, and, it may be, the reverberation of our ugly voices will presently awaken the world to put something better in our place. Because we write abominably under pressure and for unhonoured bread, none the less we are making the future. We are making it atrociously no doubt; we are not ignorant of that possibility, but some of us, at least, would like to do it better. We know only too well how that we are out of touch with scholarship and contemplation. We must drive our pens to live and push and bawl to be heard. We must blunder against men an ampler training on either side would have made our allies, we must smart and lose our tempers and do the foolish things that are done {{in the heat of the}} day. For all that, according to our lights, we who write are trying to save our world in a lack of better saviours, to change this mental tumult into an order of understanding and intention in which great things may grow. The thought of a community is the life of that community, and if the collective thought of a community is disconnected and fragmentary, then the community is collectively vain and weak.
