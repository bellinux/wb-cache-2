5|$|When Darwin {{received}} Alfred Russel Wallace's {{paper that}} described natural selection, Hooker and Charles Lyell {{arranged for a}} <b>joint</b> <b>reading</b> of papers by Darwin and Wallace to the Linnean Society on July1, 1858. Since Darwin had nothing prepared, the reading included excerpts from his 1844 Essay and from a letter he had sent to Asa Gray in July 1857 outlining his theory {{on the origin of}} species. By that time, Darwin had begun writing his book On the Origin of Species. The correspondence with Gray was thus a key piece of evidence in establishing Darwin's intellectual priority with respect to the theory of evolution by natural selection. Neither Darwin nor Wallace attended the meeting. The papers were published by the society as On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection. By summer 1859 it was obvious to Gray and others working with Darwin that On the Origin of Species would be a ground-breaking book.|$|E
5|$|Communication with Wallace in the far-off Malay Archipelago was {{impossible}} without months of delay, {{so he was}} not part of this rapid publication. Fortunately, Wallace accepted the arrangement after the fact, happy that he had been included at all, and never expressed public or private bitterness. Darwin's social and scientific status was far greater than Wallace's, and it was unlikely that, without Darwin, Wallace's views on evolution would have been taken seriously. Lyell and Hooker's arrangement relegated Wallace to the position of co-discoverer, and he was not the social equal of Darwin or the other prominent British natural scientists. However, the <b>joint</b> <b>reading</b> of their papers on natural selection associated Wallace with the more famous Darwin. This, combined with Darwin's (as well as Hooker's and Lyell's) advocacy on his behalf, would give Wallace greater access to {{the highest levels of the}} scientific community. The reaction to the reading was muted, with the president of the Linnean Society remarking in May 1859 that the year had not been marked by any striking discoveries; but, with Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species later in 1859, its significance became apparent. When Wallace returned to the UK, he met Darwin. Although some of Wallace's iconoclastic opinions in the ensuing years would test Darwin's patience, they remained on friendly terms for the rest of Darwin's life.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this study was}} to examine how the quality of the {{parent-child}} relationship and parenting style are related to the quality and quantity of parent-child literacy interactions and children 2 ̆ 7 s early literacy development. Little is known about the indirect effects that the parent-child relationship may have on children 2 ̆ 7 s acquisition of early literacy skills. As such, this research was designed to uncover ways in which the parent-child relationship may mediate or moderate children 2 ̆ 7 s acquisition of such skills. It was hypothesized that the parent-child relationship may impact children 2 ̆ 7 s emergent literacy skills through other variables, such as the quality of the home environment or the quality of parent-child <b>joint</b> book <b>reading.</b> It was also hypothesized that the parent-child relationship may moderate the relation between parent-child literacy interactions and children 2 ̆ 7 s emergent literacy skills. The participants in this study were 54 mothers and their 3 -year-old children (29 girls). Children were recruited from half-day early childhood education programs. Results indicate that neither the quality of mother-child <b>joint</b> book <b>reading</b> nor the home literacy environment mediates the relation between the parent-child relationship and children 2 ̆ 7 s emergent literacy skills. The results showed that the quality of the parent-child relationship, as represented by parenting style, significantly predicted children 2 ̆ 7 s emergent literacy development beyond the quality of mother-child <b>joint</b> book <b>reading</b> or the occurrence of home literacy activities. Findings also suggest that the relation between the quality of parent-child <b>joint</b> book <b>reading</b> and children 2 ̆ 7 s emergent literacy skills is moderated by the quality of the parent-child relationship. Similarly, the relation between the home literacy environment and children 2 ̆ 7 s emergent literacy skills was also moderated by the quality of the parent-child relationship. ...|$|R

Vazakas continued writing poetry and having it published in {{an increasing number of}} periodicals including Poetry, Poetry Magazine, Crossing Section, Western Review, and some anthologies. He gave occasional lectures and readings at Harvard University and one at Brown University. On four occasions he received fellowships to summer colonies at Breadloaf, VT; Yaddo, NY; and McDowell, NH. His second volume, The Equal Tribunals, was published in 1962. The following year, on the recommendation of Archibald MacLeish, he won an Amy Lowell Traveling Scholarship for 1962-63, renewed for 1963-64, and went to England.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} the relationship between parental educational level, <b>joint</b> storybook <b>reading</b> and children&# 39;s language competence. Our sample included 123 5 -year-old children attending one of the Slovenian preschools. Frequency of parent-child <b>joint</b> storybook <b>reading</b> was measured indirectly with the children&# 39;s book title checklist, which was used in the Slovenian language environment for the first time, and which, in comparison with the parents&# 39; report about how often they read to their children, represents a more objective measure of storybook exposure. By using checklist we avoid socially desirable responses, which parents give because they think that reading is important for children&# 39;s language development. We found out that parental education is positively related to the parental familiarity with the titles of books for children. Furthermore, the results show that storybook exposure is, regardless of parental educational level, a factor of home environment which makes an important contribution to the development of children&# 39;s language competence...|$|R

40|$|Formal {{institutions}} {{shape the}} governance of economic, legal and social relations and have the purpose of mitigating agency problems. While prevalent research theorizes that firms’ ownership structure tends to become less concentrated as formal institutions protect minority shareholders more strongly, more recent theoretical arguments posit an opposite relationship. A <b>joint</b> <b>read</b> of these perspectives suggests that both strong and weak protection encourages concentrated ownership. In this paper, we contend that these mixed results may be, at least partially, due to the large focus of research on takeover acquisitions and {{to the neglect of}} acquisitions of minority equity stakes. While previous studies suggest that controlling shareholders may have incentives to own large equity stakes both under weak and strong shareholder protection, this work argues that minority shareholders have no incentive to own small equity shares when formal institutions weakly protect their interests. Consequently, we argue that firms that acquire a minority equity stake will tend to purchase larger portions of the target’s equity when shareholder protection {{and the quality of the}} institutional environment are weaker. We find support of these hypotheses on a global sample of 218 minority acquisitions. The results of this study shed further light on the relationship between ownership structure and formal institutions and expand the still limited literature on minority acquisitions...|$|R

The main purpose of this pilot was to identify and describe developmentally different features of children’s communicative acts in relation to mothers’ communicative acts. Ten children, of ages ranging from 11 months to 28 months and their mothers, participated in this pilot.

Analyses were made of both mothers’ and children’s communicative acts including both gestural and speech activity, using an existing coding system called the Inventory of Communicative Acts-Abridged (INCA-A) with an additional supplemental coding system. The results indicate that the adopted coding system seemed to capture developmentally different features of communicative acts in terms of quantity and quality. Examinations of the mothers’ communicative acts also suggested possibilities of identifying different interaction styles across dyads as well as changes within a dyad in which mothers deploy a variety of communicative acts in relation to their child’s developmental course...|$|R
