5|$|Moravec's paradox: Proving theorems {{and solving}} {{geometry}} problems is comparatively easy for computers, but a supposedly simple task like recognizing a face or crossing a room without bumping into anything is extremely difficult. This <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> why research into vision and robotics had made so little progress {{by the middle}} 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} enzyme {{kinetics}} {{is important for}} two basic reasons. Firstly, it <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> how enzymes work, and secondly, it helps predict how enzymes behave in living organisms. The kinetic constants defined above, KM and Vmax, are critical to attempts to understand how enzymes work together to control metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Amin {{recruited}} {{his followers}} {{from his own}} ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 percent of the 22 top generals and 75 percent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 percent and 87.5 percent of these groups {{even though they were}} only 5 percent of the population. This <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> why Amin survived eight attempted coups.|$|E

5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is satisfied {{without the use}} of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be uncovered. Risk-neutral investors will be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the exchange rate between those countries is expected to adjust such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on euro deposits, thereby eliminating the potential for uncovered interest arbitrage profits. Uncovered interest rate parity <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> the determination of the spot exchange rate. The following equation represents uncovered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. It also <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E

5|$|Understanding {{traits of}} {{individual}} organisms <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> patterns and processes at other levels of organization including populations, communities, and ecosystems. Several areas of ecology of evolution {{that focus on}} such traits are life history theory, ecophysiology, metabolic theory of ecology, and Ethology. Examples of such traits include features of an organisms life cycle such as age to maturity, life span, or metabolic costs of reproduction. Other traits {{may be related to}} structure, such as the spines of a cactus or dorsal spines of a bluegill sunfish, or behaviors such as courtship displays or pair bonding. Other traits include emergent properties that are the result at least in part of interactions with the surrounding environment such as growth rate, resource uptake rate, winter, and deciduous vs. drought deciduous trees and shrubs.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of all known cancers involve {{mutations}} of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which regulates the cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's protein dimer in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first peer reviewed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.|$|E
5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} {{has become}} popular among poor Americans, {{particularly those who}} seek personal and social advancement. It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants. Apologists for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views. Joel Robbins of Cambridge University notes that most anthropologists attribute the theology's appeal to the poor—especially in the Global South—to {{the fact that it}} promises security and <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> capitalism. Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners. In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church, he noted that members felt part of a complex gift-exchange system, giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return (either from God directly or through another church member). Hillsong Church, the largest congregation in Australia, teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success. Marion Maddox has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of upwardly mobile Australians.|$|E
50|$|Watson and Clark (1991) {{proposed}} the Tripartite Model of Anxiety and Depression to <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> the comorbidity between anxious and depressive symptoms and disorders. This model divides {{the symptoms of}} anxiety and depression into three groups: negative affect, positive affect and physiological hyperarousal. These three sets of symptoms <b>help</b> <b>explain</b> common and distinct aspects of depression and anxiety.|$|R

25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{builds on}} the flood basalt eruption theory. An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius {{would not be enough}} to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until frozen methane reservoirs below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian–Triassic boundary layer. It also <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> why {{the first phase of the}} layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.|$|E
25|$|Seafloor {{spreading}} {{occurs at}} mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed through volcanic activity and then gradually {{moves away from}} the ridge. Seafloor spreading <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. It was first proposed by Harry Hammond Hess and Robert S. Dietz in 1960.|$|E
25|$|Complex Adaptive Systems theory - Dutch scholar Jaap van Ginneken {{claims that}} contagion, {{convergence}} and emergent norms are just instances of the synergy, emergence and autopoiesis or self-creation of patterns and new entities typical {{for the newly}} discovered meta-category of complex adaptive systems.

25|$|In {{peppered}} moths, the allele for dark-bodied moths is dominant, {{while the}} allele for light-bodied moths is recessive, {{meaning that the}} typica moths have a phenotype (visible or detectable characteristic) that is only seen in a homozygous genotype (an organism that has two copies of the same allele), and never in a heterozygous one. This <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> how dramatically quickly the population changed when being selected for dark colouration.|$|E
25|$|John Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley {{propose that}} dreams {{are caused by}} the random firing of neurons in the {{cerebral}} cortex during the REM period. Neatly, this theory <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> the irrationality of the mind during REM periods, as, according to this theory, the forebrain then creates a story {{in an attempt to}} reconcile and make sense of the nonsensical sensory information presented to it. This would explain the odd nature of many dreams.|$|E
25|$|The Sino-Soviet rift and the {{obsession}} with Khrushchev's revisionism looms {{large in the}} coming of the Cultural Revolution, as Mao saw revisionism and de-Stalinization as a threat not only to his own position but also to the very survival of the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary force. Accordingly, an appreciation of Kang's role as a supporter of Mao's line in this period <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> his return to very near the pinnacle of power a few years later.|$|E

25|$|Postconstructivism {{benefited from}} a natural {{reaction}} against both the avantgarde and the eclectics of the past. It was perceived as new, {{and at the same}} time allowed grand buildings that were to the taste of provincial elite. Another benefit in a time of total rationing was that, unlike Constructivism, the new style minimized use of steel and cement, turning back to primitive masonry with wooden floors and partitions. This <b>helps</b> <b>explain</b> the spread of Postconstructivism in the 1930s.|$|E

Leaning the torso {{with respect to the}} bike does not cause the bike to lean far enough to generate anything but the shallowest turns. No-hands riders may be able to keep a heavy bike centered in a lane and negotiate shallow highway turns, but not much else.|$|E
