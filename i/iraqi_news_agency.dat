40|$|A general {{inhomogenity}} of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> markes {{the discrepancy}} between definions of a <b>news</b> <b>agency,</b> the function of <b>news</b> <b>agencies,</b> and the closeness of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> to other <b>news</b> outlets among the mass media. Different cases give evidence that these differences exist in internationally operating <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> We argue with two claims accessing the contemporary situation: a) we rely on the perspective of classic analysis of the sender and receiver(s) of a message in a communication model and b) special interest groups as connected segments of subnetworks {{in the mass media}} industry. We will examine several worldwide operating <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> with internet presence regarding their self-description, their role in mass media communication, and classic definitions of <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> After examining several cases, we will show the general common roles of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> in the mass media network. The variety of <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> results in differentiated forms of these distributors. While major <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> work as contributors of information for other mass media and thus technically fulfill the role of a <b>news</b> <b>agency,</b> smaller agencies have the declared aim to cover ‘special interest’ serving as a conterpoint to mainstream <b>news</b> <b>agencies.</b> News agencies participate in linear and circular distribution forms we classify here as ‘frames of the news’ and ‘spirals of silence’. Our examination shows that <b>news</b> <b>agencies</b> as producing and delivering organizations for the mass media work with high self-reference and reference to other mass media...|$|R

50|$|Media under Saddam Hussain's Ba'ath {{party was}} {{severely}} limited and strictly {{controlled by the}} state.

40|$|As {{with all}} wars, the U. S. {{military}} invasion of Iraq in 2003 {{needed to be}} portrayed as a just war {{in an attempt to}} garner support and legitimacy, domestically and internationally. The United States was acting as hegemonic power in the international state-system and, in light of this role, had imperatives and tools in creating the argument for a just war that differed from those used by nonhegemonic states. The United States acted extraterritorially by diffusing a message of moral right. Arab resistance to the war was evident {{in the construction of the}} United States and its leadership as immoral, precluding its ability to wage a just war. This article focuses on the Arab response by analyzing the portrayal in Arab newspapers of the imminent war on Iraq. Sixty-five newspapers of the Arabic language (plus the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>news</b> <b>agency),</b> published in seventeen Arab countries, of which four were Iraqi newspapers, were consulted for the purpose of this study. Interpretation of the geopolitical rhetoric within newspaper reports and political cartoons published in Arab newspapers highlights the way that arguments of morality and immorality were connected to understandings of territorial sovereignty and hegemonic extraterritorial influence into territorial sovereign spaces...|$|E
