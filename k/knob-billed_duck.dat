50|$|Immature <b>knob-billed</b> <b>ducks</b> {{look like}} a large greyish female of the cotton pygmy goose (Nettapus coromandelicus) and may be {{difficult}} to tell apart if no other birds are around to compare size and hue. However, <b>knob-billed</b> <b>ducks</b> in immature plumage are rarely seen without adults nearby and thus they are usually easily identified too.|$|R

50|$|Most taxonomic {{authorities}} split {{this species}} and the <b>knob-billed</b> <b>duck</b> from each other. Some authorities, including the Clements checklist and the American Ornithological Society keep the cosmopolitan duck intact, {{in which case}} the species name melanotos is valid since it is older. The comb duck is generally smaller in size when compared to the <b>knob-billed</b> <b>duck,</b> and flanks are darker (black in males, medium grey in females).|$|E

50|$|This duck {{feeds on}} {{vegetation}} by grazing or dabbling {{and to a}} lesser extent on small fish, invertebrates, and seeds. It can become a problem to rice farmers. <b>Knob-billed</b> <b>ducks</b> often perch in trees. They are typically seen in flocks, small in the wet season, up to 100 in the dry season. Sometimes they separate according to sex.|$|R
40|$|Habitat {{availability}} for Afrotropical waterbirds {{is highly}} dynamic with unpredictable rainfall patterns and ephemeral wetlands resulting in diverse movement strategies among different species. Movement strategies among waterfowl encompass resident, regional and intercontinental migrants, but little quantitative information exists on their specific movement patterns. We studied the movement ecology of five Afrotropical waterfowl species marked with satellite transmitters in Malawi, Mali and Nigeria. Resident species, including White-faced Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna viduata, Fulvous Whistling Ducks Dendrocygna bicolor and Spur-winged Geese Plectropterus gambensis, remained sedentary {{during the rainy}} season and only flew limited distances during other months. In contrast, <b>Knob-billed</b> <b>Ducks</b> Sarkidiornis melanotos made short regional movements ? 50 km in all months and showed little site fidelity to previously used habitats in subsequent years. Garganey Anas quequedula followed an intercontinental strategy and made long-distance jumps across the Sahara and Mediterranean to their Eurasian breeding grounds. Most species flew farthest during the dry season, as mean daily movements varied from 1. 5 to 14. 2 km and was greatest in the winter months (January-March). Total distance moved varied from 9. 5 km for White-faced Whistling Ducks (October-December) to 45. 6 km for <b>Knob-billed</b> <b>Ducks</b> (April-June). Nomadic behaviour by <b>Knob-billed</b> <b>Ducks</b> was evidenced by long exploratory flights, but small mean daily movements suggested that they were relying on previous experience. Improving our understanding of these movement strategies increases our ability to assess connectivity of wetland resources that support waterfowl throughout their annual cycle and focuses conservation efforts on their most important habitats.

50|$|Two large water {{bodies on}} the site have been {{developed}} {{with a view to}} harness migratory birds and provide haven for birds in winter and summer months through the creation of lagoons and marshy lands. The area of water body no.1 is 14 acre. There is a splendid bio-diversity in India and a great number of birds arrive from numerous locales all around the world throughout the year. Some of the birds that migrate to Indian wetlands in winter season are Siberian cranes, greater flamingos, ruffs, white wagtails, rosy pelicans, spotted sandpipers, starlings, and gadwalls. Birds that migrate in summer are <b>knob-billed</b> <b>ducks,</b> blue-cheeked bee-eaters, blue-tailed bee-eaters, cuckoos, etc.|$|R

50|$|One can see sarus cranes, <b>knob-billed</b> <b>duck,</b> spotbill duck in the dam. During the winter, demmossile, common eastern crane, barheaded geese and {{migrating}} birds descent on the water. Crocodiles bask on the dam shores.|$|E
50|$|This common {{species is}} unmistakable. It {{is one of}} the largest species of duck. Length can range from 56 to 76 cm, {{wingspan}} ranges from 116 to 145 cm and weight from 1.03 to 2.9 kg. Adults have a white head freckled with dark spots, and a pure white neck and underparts. The upperparts are glossy blue-black upperparts, with bluish and greenish iridescence especially prominent on the secondaries (lower arm feathers). The male is much larger than the female, and has a large black knob on the bill. Young birds are dull buff below and on the face and neck, with dull brown upperparts, top of the head and eyestripe. <b>Knob-billed</b> <b>ducks</b> are generally larger in size when compared to comb ducks, and flanks are usually lighter (light grey, in females sometimes whitish).|$|R
50|$|The <b>knob-billed</b> <b>duck</b> {{is declining}} in numbers locally, {{but due to}} its wide range it is not {{considered}} globally threatened by the IUCN. It {{is one of the}} species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.|$|E

5000|$|Uncertainty {{surrounds}} the correct systematic placement of this species. Initially, it {{was placed in}} the dabbling duck subfamily Anatinae. Later, it was assigned to the [...] "perching ducks", a paraphyletic assemblage of waterfowl most of which are intermediate between dabbling ducks and shelducks. As the [...] "perching ducks" [...] were split up, the <b>knob-billed</b> <b>duck</b> was moved to the Tadorninae or shelduck subfamily.|$|E
