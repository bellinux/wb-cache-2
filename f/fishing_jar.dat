Compounders or accelerators are {{energized}} when you over pull on the working string and compress a compressible fluid through {{a few feet of}} stroke distance {{and at the same time}} activate the <b>fishing</b> <b>jar.</b> When the <b>fishing</b> <b>jar</b> releases the stored energy in the compounder/acclerator lifts the drill collars upwards at a high rate of speed creating a high impact in the jar.|$|E

The fisher boy can become alive and grow and, with his fishing-rod, can hook the fish which are engraved on the bottom part of the fish-globe and which also can become alive and grow. The oldman is later accused of stealing the <b>fish</b> <b>jar</b> from the pastor.|$|R
5000|$|Jamming {{avoidance}} response [...] (JAR) is {{a behavior}} performed by some species of weakly electric <b>fish.</b> The <b>JAR</b> occurs when two electric fish with wave discharges meet - if their discharge frequencies are very similar, each fish will shift its discharge frequency {{to increase the}} difference between the two fish's discharge frequencies. By doing this, both fish prevent jamming of their sense of electroreception.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the mechanical and hydraulic versions, jars are classified as drilling <b>jars</b> or <b>fishing</b> <b>jars.</b> The operation of the two types is similar, and both deliver approximately the same impact blow, but the drilling jar is built such that it can better withstand the rotary and vibrational loading associated with drilling. Jars {{are designed to be}} reset by simple string manipulation and are capable of repeated operation or firing before being recovered from the well. Jarring effectiveness isdetermined by how rapidly you can impact weight into the jars. When jarring without a compounder or accelerator you rely only on pipe stretch to lift the drill collars upwards after the jar releases to create the upwards impact in the jar. This accelerated upward movement will often be reduced by the friction of the working string along the sides of the well bore, reducing the speed of upwards movement of the drill collars which impact into the jar. At shallow depths jar impact is not achieved because of lack of pipe stretch in the working string.|$|R
5000|$|All <b>fish</b> that perform <b>JAR</b> are wave-discharging <b>fish</b> that emit steady quasi-sinusoidal discharges. For {{the genus}} Eigenmannia, {{frequencies}} range from 240 to 600 Hz. [...] The EOD frequency is very steady, typically {{with less than}} 0.3% variation over a 10-minute time span.|$|R
50|$|A tip jar {{is a game}} {{similar to}} a raffle. Players buy folded or sealed pieces of paper dealt from large glass jars in hopes of winning prizes. The pieces of paper conceal numbers or symbols that may entitle the {{purchaser}} to winnings immediately after opening the ticket. Tip jars were named {{at a time when}} the betting slips were tipped out of bags into glass <b>jars</b> or <b>fish</b> bowls. <b>Jars</b> are not necessarily needed. The tickets can be spread out in a pile or pinned on a board.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "father of canning" [...] is the Frenchman Nicolas Appert. In 1795, {{he began}} experimenting {{with ways to}} can <b>fish</b> in <b>jars</b> and then he placed the jars in boiling water. During {{the first years of}} the Napoleonic Wars, the French {{government}} offered a 12,000 Franc prize to anyone who could devise a cheap and effective method of preserving large amounts of food. The larger armies of the period required increased and regular supplies of quality food. Appert submitted his invention and won the prize in January 1810. The reason for lack of spoilage was unknown at the time, since it would be another 50 years before Louis Pasteur demonstrated the role of microbes in food spoilage. However, glass containers presented challenges for transportation. Shortly after, the British inventor and merchant Peter Durand patented his own method, this time in a tin can, creating the modern-day process of canning foods.|$|R

5000|$|William Osler Abbott {{was born}} July 26, 1902 in New Bedford, MA. He {{was given the}} {{nickname}} [...] "pete" [...] growing up. His father, Alexander Abbott, {{was a member of}} the resident staff at Johns Hopkins Hospital and his mother, Georgina Osler, was a niece of William Osler. His parents met while his mother was taking care of Osler's home in Baltimore. His family would vacation at Waquoit a lot in the summers, which is where he came to love everything about the sea. At just the young age of 10, Abbott would skin the <b>fish</b> in <b>jars</b> of water and put the bones and cartilage together with fine wire and when he was only 15, he could sail 30 miles at night from Waquoit to Nantucket. William Osler Abbott married a young lady from Kansas City named Lucy Waldo in 1928. The newly married Abbotts spent their honeymoon in an open dory sailing among Cape Cod's Elizabeth Islands. They had three children, Thomas William Osler, Ann Gatewood, and Lucy Featherstone.|$|R
40|$|Directional {{drilling}} {{technology was}} extended and modified to drill the first well of a subsurface geothermal energy extraction {{system at the}} Fenton Hill, New Mexico, hot dry rock (HDR) experimental site. Borehole geometries, extremely hard and abrasive granite rock, and high formation temperatures combined to provide a challenging environment for directional drilling tools and instrumentation. Completing {{the first of the}} two-wellbore HDR system resulted in the definition of operation limitations of -many conventional directional drilling tools, instrumentation, and techniques. The successful completion of the first wellbore, Energy Extraction Well No. 2 (EE- 21), to a measured depth of 4. 7 km (15, 300 ft) in granite reservoir rock with a bottomhole temperature of 320 C (610 F) required {{the development of a new}} high-temperature downhole motor and modification of existing wireline-conveyed steering tool systems. Conventional rotary-driven directional assemblies were successfully modified to accommodate the very hard and abrasive rock encountered while drilling nearly 2. 6 km (8, 500 ft) of directional hole to a final inclination of 35 {sup o} from the vertical at the controlled azimuthal orientation. Data were collected to optimize the drilling procedures far the programmed directional drilling of well EE- 3 parallel to, and 370 metres (1, 200 ft) above, Drilling equipment and techniques used in drilling wellbores for extraction of geothermal energy from hot granite were generally similar to those that are standard and common to hydrocarbon drilling practices. However, it was necessary to design some new equipment for this program: some equipment was modified especially for this program and some was operated beyond normal ratings. These tools and procedures met with various degrees of success. Two types of shock subs were developed and tested during this project. However, downhole time was limited, and formations were so varied that analysis of the capabilities of these items is not conclusive. Temperature limits of the tools were exceeded. EE- 2. Commercial drilling and <b>fishing</b> <b>jars</b> were improved during the drilling program. Three-cone, tungsten-carbide insert bit performance with downhole motors was limited by rapid gauge wear. Rotary drilling was optimized for wells EE- 2 and EE- 3 using softer (IADS 635 code) bits and provided a balance between gauge,. cutting structure, and bearing life. Problems of extreme drill string drag, drill string twist-off, and corrosion control are discussed...|$|R
60|$|Almayer spoke jovially {{and dropped}} with a {{contented}} sigh into the armchair nearest to the table. Nina Almayer {{came through the}} curtained doorway followed by an old Malay woman, who busied herself in setting upon the table a plateful of rice and <b>fish,</b> a <b>jar</b> of water, and a bottle half full of genever. After carefully placing before her master a cracked glass tumbler and a tin spoon she went away noiselessly. Nina stood by the table, one hand lightly resting on its edge, the other hanging listlessly by her side. Her face turned towards the outer darkness, through which her dreamy eyes seemed to see some entrancing picture, wore a look of impatient expectancy. She was tall for a half- caste, with the correct profile of the father, modified and strengthened by the squareness of {{the lower part of}} the face inherited from her maternal ancestors--the Sulu pirates. Her firm mouth, with the lips slightly parted and disclosing a gleam of white teeth, put a vague suggestion of ferocity into the impatient expression of her features. And yet her dark and perfect eyes had all the tender softness of expression common to Malay women, but with a gleam of superior intelligence; they looked gravely, wide open and steady, as if facing something invisible to all other eyes, while she stood there all in white, straight, flexible, graceful, unconscious of herself, her low but broad forehead crowned with a shining mass of long black hair that fell in heavy tresses over her shoulders, and made her pale olive complexion look paler still by the contrast of its coal-black hue.|$|R
40|$|This film shows {{most of the}} {{ceremonial}} portion of the funeral procession of Tom Kim Yung (1858 - 1903), military attache to the Chinese Legation to the United States. The funeral procession took place at 1 : 00 pm on Wednesday, September 23, 1903, and was probably the largest ever seen in Chinatown. Tom's death (note that Tom is the family name) was the tragic consequence of a police assault, leading to his subsequent suicide. Following an elaborate service at the Chinese Consulate, the funeral procession formed and proceeded through Chinatown. Then, the participants rode in carriages to the Ning Yung Chinese Cemetery at Colma, just south of San Francisco, for a final ceremony. The body was then returned to Chinatown and kept by an undertaker before being shipped home to China, as was the custom. Tom Kim Yung's suicide was {{the outcome of a}} tragic Chinatown incident. Tom was in San Francisco on special duty, having arrived from China a few months earlier, and was soon to leave for Washington, D. C. A colonel in the Chinese Army, he {{had been one of the}} imperial bodyguards. On the evening of September 13, 1903, he was returning to the Chinese Consulate on Stockton Street after dining with a merchant. Policeman John Kreamer, apparently mistaking him for a wanted man, insulted him as a degenerate. Tom resisted arrest and was punched in the face by Kreamer, falling to the ground. Another policeman, Officer Brodt, and two bypassers came to assist Kreamer, and Tom was temporarily tied to a fence by his queue, then hauled off to jail where he was held on the charge of assaulting a police officer. A local merchant had him released on bail. Tom brooded over his irreparable loss of face and the impunity of the police until September 14, when he gassed himself from the light fixtures in his room at the Consulate. He left behind a note explaining his reasons for taking his life. Accounts of the subsequent investigation reveal it to have been inadequate at best. Chew Tszchi, First Secretary of the Chinese Legation, came from Washington to attest to Tom's character, having known him in Peking. Tom's diplomatic immunity was completely ignored by the authorities. In Chinatown there was some division over Tom's guilt, and anonymous leaflets distributed during the funeral suggested that Consul General Yung Bow had ordered Tom's suicide. To prevent unrest in Chinatown, Tom's body was released to the care of a Chinese undertaker before the inquest. At the inquest, seven prominent Chinatown citizens testified on Tom's behalf. Officer Kreamer refused even to attend until finally subpoenaed by the city coroner. A verdict of suicide was reached on October 9. Despite requests from the State Department that Governor Pardee and Mayor Schmitz look into the affair, no further action was taken. The whole proceeding highlights the strong anti-Chinese feeling - amounting to open racism - that prevailed at the time. The following is a scene-by-scene description of the film: [Frame: 0797] The camera looks slightly north of east across Dupont Street (Grant Avenue today), the main street of Chinatown. The Chinese transliteration of the name was Dupon Gai, meaning "slatboard capital street. " The camera was probably located on the balcony of a building between Clay and Sacramento streets. All business in Chinatown was suspended for the day. Note the traditional ponytails, or queues, worn by Chinese men, a universal custom during the Quing (Manchu) dynasty (1644 - 1911). The procession mixes a few western elements with the full pageantry of a traditional Chinese funeral. Note that white is the color of Buddhist mourning dress and mourning relatives also wear white headbands, as do official mourners. Following three mounted police officers (not shown) come two mounted mourners [1002]. The two lanterns that follow bear the family names of the deceased [1134]. Banners precede the white military band (such bands are still in use today) [1317]. Next come twelve Tom family members carrying tablets listing the rank and titles of the deceased [1546], followed by four men in tall hats who ward off malevolent spirits [1715]. Following them are fifteen Buddhist priests in white [1840], carrying staffs with the "eight auspicious signs" of Chinese Buddhism (<b>fish,</b> <b>jar,</b> lotus, mystic knot, canopy, umbrella, conch-shell, and wheel of the law). They are followed by fifteen Taoist priests with symbolic staffs [2185]. The following carriage may contain food to be sacrificed at the cemetery [2291]. Next comes a tall banner giving the whole obituary of the deceased [2510]. Then follows the chief mourner Consul General Yung Bow attended by incense bearers [2675]. A riderless horse folows [2830], carrying the spirit of the deceased attended by two mourners. A line of San Francisco police officers precedes the hearse [3074], which is drawn by six horses and attended by mourners who are reflected in its windows [3183]. The open carriage following bears a portrait of the deceased framed by a large floral wreath [3430] (today, the carriage would be a convertible). A banner and umbrella follow, the latter customarily presented to a popular official when he leaves a district. Tall banners mounted on the following wagon display poetic epitaphs [3650] (right: "A star has fallen to earth"; left: "Your name is made famous by this bitter record") flanked by the names of sons, nephews, and cousins of the deceased, who will carry on the family name and honor. Next come representatives of the Six Companies (the federation of district associations that arbitrated justice in Chinatown). Several hold raised fans [3823]. Prominent merchants follow, flanked by horsemen [3918]. After a short cut in the film, two carriages of the immediate family of the deceased are seen [4156]. Although the film ends here, written accounts document that some one hundred and twenty-three additional carriages followed in the procession. Copyright: no reg. Duration: 2 : 19 at 12 fps.
