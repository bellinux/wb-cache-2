5|$|Equally {{challenging}} for {{women are the}} physiological and emotional changes associated with the cessation of menses (menopause or climacteric). While typically occurring gradually {{towards the end of}} the fifth decade in life marked by irregular bleeding the cessation of ovulation and menstruation is accompanied by marked changes in hormonal activity, both by the ovary itself (oestrogen and progesterone) and the pituitary gland (follicle stimulating hormone or FSH and luteinizing hormone or LH). These hormonal changes may be associated with both systemic sensations such as <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> and local changes to the reproductive tract such as reduced vaginal secretions and lubrication. While menopause may bring relief from symptoms of menstruation and fear of pregnancy it may also be accompanied by emotional and psychological changes associated with the symbolism of the loss of fertility and a reminder of aging and possible loss of desirability. While menopause generally occurs naturally as a physiological process it may occur earlier (premature menopause) as a result of disease or from medical or surgical intervention. When menopause occurs prematurely the adverse consequences may be more severe.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>flashes</b> {{and other}} vasomotor {{symptoms}} accompany the menopausal transition. While many sources continue {{to claim that}} <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> during the menopausal transition are caused by low estrogen levels, this assertion was shown incorrect in 1935 and, in most cases, <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> are observed despite elevated estrogen levels. The exact cause of these symptoms is not yet understood, possible factors considered are higher and erratic variation of estradiol level during the cycle, elevated FSH levels which may indicate hypothalamic dysregulation perhaps caused by missing feedback by inhibin. It has been also observed that the vasomotor symptoms differ during early perimenopause and late menopausal transition {{and it is possible}} that they are caused by a different mechanism.|$|E

Present study designed {{to compare the}} effects of HRT with Piascledine in treatment of <b>hot</b> <b>flash.</b> The cases {{of this study were}} sixty-six women at the age range of 40 to 70 years and complaints of menopause-induced <b>hot</b> <b>flashing,</b> whose last menstruation dated at least 6 months prior {{to the beginning of the}} study. The patients in this open label clinical trial, randomized to receive Piascledine capsule 1 mg or HRT (0. 625 mg oral daily Conjugated Estrogen tablets, plus 2. 5 mg continuous oral daily Medroxyprogesterone Acetate tablets) for 2 month. <b>Hot</b> <b>flash</b> property and severity was assessed via a daily check list and Visual analog scale.

40|$|Background and Aim: Menopause is {{a period}} in women’s lives that is {{accompanied}} with outcomes and effects which can adversely affect {{on the quality of}} life and weaken well-being. The most widely recognized outcome of menopause is <b>hot</b> <b>flash</b> that adversely affects on work, social activities, enjoying life, sleep, andin sum- total quality of living. The common treatment of this symptom is hormone treatment (HRT) which has some adverse effects and sometimes some contraindications. The present study aimed at assessing the effect of Vitex on <b>hot</b> <b>flash.</b> Materials and Methods: This double –blind and clinical trial was performed on 54 women with <b>hot</b> <b>flash</b> aged between 45 and 55 years in Isfahan in 2002, which had been referred for treatment. The population was randomly divided into 2 groups: 1) taking Vitex 2) control group, taking placebos. Data collection was done through interviews and a questionnaire considering demographic and <b>hot</b> <b>flash</b> characteristics (using Kupperman Index), which was filled out for each woman. <b>Hot</b> <b>flash</b> was assessed in three stages. The obtained data was analysed by means of SPSS software, descriptive and inferential statistics; and P...|$|R

25|$|HRT may be {{reasonable}} {{for the treatment}} of menopausal symptoms, such as <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a skin patch. Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of strokes and blood clots. When used for menopausal symptoms some recommend it be used for the shortest time possible and at the lowest dose possible. Evidence to support long term use however is poor.|$|E
25|$|Short-term hormone {{replacement}} with estrogen has negligible effect on overall mortality for high-risk BRCA mutation carriers.

This result can probably be generalized to other women at high risk in whom short-term (i.e., one- or two-year) treatment with estrogen for <b>hot</b> <b>flashes</b> may be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Before menopause, a woman's periods {{typically}} become irregular, {{which means}} that periods may be longer or shorter in duration or be lighter or heavier {{in the amount of}} flow. During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, sweating, and reddening of the skin. <b>Hot</b> <b>flashes</b> often stop occurring after a year or two. Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness, trouble sleeping, and mood changes.|$|E
25|$|Progesterone {{is used in}} {{combination}} with estrogen {{as a component of}} HRT for menopausal symptoms. A progestogen is needed to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and increased risk of endometrial cancer caused by unopposed estrogen in women with intact uteruses. In addition, progestogens, including progesterone, are able to treat and improve <b>hot</b> <b>flashes.</b> Progesterone, both alone and {{in combination}} with estrogen, also has beneficial effects on skin health and is able to slow the rate of skin aging in postmenopausal women.|$|E
