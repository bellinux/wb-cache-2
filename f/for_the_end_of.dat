Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe.

40|$|Abstract – Motivated by known {{preferences}} for certain amino acids in positions around a-helices, we developed neural network-based predictors of both N and C a-helix ends, which achieved about 88 % accuracy.

By incorporating this new type of input, we significantly improved the basic one-stage predictor of protein secondary structure {{in terms of both}} per-residue (Q 3) accuracy (+ 0. 8 %) and segment overlap (SOV 3) measure (+ 1. 4).

5|$|The {{story of}} Operation Ten-Go is revered {{to some degree}} in modern Japan as {{evidenced}} by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland.

5|$|After the play's initial run, Kooman {{revised the}} script, making {{prominent}} {{changes in the}} scenes involving Jason and Marta. In the version performed at the premiere, the two characters debate issues of human rights on a solely philosophical level, while in the new version, Marta makes real demands of Jason, making their interactions more dynamic. Kooman made Jason's wife Ali more patient and understanding in dealing with Jason's lengthy absences from home and removed the intermission. According to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate, Kooman's changes strengthened the emotional pull of the play. Because {{of the amount of}} interest in She Has a Name in 2011, not enough tickets were available for the initial run, and a second run was planned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> 2011.
