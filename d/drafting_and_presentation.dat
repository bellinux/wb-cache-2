40|$|In the European Parliament, a ‘rapporteur’ is an MEP {{appointed}} {{to oversee the}} <b>drafting</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> of reports. This role is highly important in the Parliament, with rapporteurs being elected to the position by their fellow MEPs. But does the distribution of these appointments favour certain states over others? Steffen Hurka, Michael Kaeding and Lukas Obholzer present findings from {{a study of the}} allocation of rapporteurs in the 2009 - 14 parliament. They find that new member states that joined in the 2004 and 2007 enlargements were underrepresented among rapporteurs and were therefore less able to influence EU legislation than older member states...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of international financial markets, financial scandals in 2000 {{and the crisis}} in 2007 showed {{the need for the}} existence of clear simple, concise rules regarding the <b>drafting</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> of financial and accounting information of the companies, especially transnational ones. Amid the fact that the 2000 s were shaken by issues such as accounting frauds, the question of transmitting information in the most correct, real and representative way emerged. The more the information is accurate, without being embellished in accounting terms, the more users are better informed and can make decisions knowledgeably. Also in the paper, a correlation is made between performance and information contained in financial reports, each user being interested in certain performance indicators...|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} laws a {{legislature}} makes {{in a given}} year reflects the broadness or narrowness of the area in which it updates current policy during that period. The legislature decides on this so as to maximize the chair’s utility. Those variables, therefore, that increase benefit or decrease cost add to the annual number of laws; socio-economic change, political change, the strength of the governing parties, and legislative resources are expected to influence legislative productivity. In this paper, these hypotheses are tested in two ways. The first approach compares 45 countries. The second deals with the longitudinal data of Japanese lawmaking from 1961 to 1994. In terms of statistics, it is necessary to tackle the problem of spurious regressions because these time series data are unit root processes. Engle Granger methodology solves it and confirms the theory. The results show that political factors, not socio-economic ones, determine the number of laws.

40|$|EXPRESS is a data {{modeling}} language. EXPRESS {{is relatively new}} having only been standardized in 1993. Today, few tools exist that automatically generate EXPRESS and correspondingly most EX- PRESS is hand-written. In the future, we predict that all but {{a tiny fraction of}} EXPRESS will be computer generated or computer read. While perhaps only during debugging, much of it will be read by humans so it is important that it "appear" as easy to read as possible. The Supplementary Directives for the <b>Drafting</b> <b>and</b> <b>Presentation</b> of ISO 10303 state rules and guidelines for layout of EXPRESS. These rules and guidelines are incomplete and inadequate for humans, no less for the purposes of writing software to perform such presentation.

These new rules are aimed at what we believe will be the biggest producers of EXPRESS in the future - [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Northumbria University’s Student Law Office {{has been}} {{offering}} {{members of the}} public assistance with business and commercial law related issues for a number of years. This work includes reviewing and drafting commercial contracts, advising on business set up, directors’ duties, constitutional documents and trading disclosures, dealing with contentious and non-contentious intellectual property issues, and advising on information technology matters including domain name ownership. In March 2011 I joined the Student Law Office from a medium sized commercial firm. I was presented with the task of developing what was then known as the “small business” work carried out in the clinic. Whilst touching on some of the general issues most new clinicians come across during their first year, this paper will concentrate specifically on the development of business work in clinics. It will review was has and, perhaps more importantly, what has not worked during my first academic year. I will be making particular reference to the three “C”s: Connectivism (encouraging the students to network and setting up scenarios to allow them to do that), Commercial Awareness (training student to think like a commercial lawyer and learn more about the business world) and Creating a Product (document <b>drafting</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentation)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Colorado-Boulder for {{comments}} on earlier <b>drafts</b> <b>and</b> <b>presentations.</b> Targeting Conservation Investments in Heterogeneous Landscapes: a distance function approach and application to watershed management To achieve a given level {{of an environmental}} amenity at least cost, decision-makers must integrate information about spatially variable biophysical and economic conditions. Although the biophysical attributes that contribute to supplying an environmental amenity are often known, {{the way in which}} these attributes interact to produce the amenity is often unknown. Given the difficulty in converting multiple attributes into a unidimensional physical measure of an environmental amenity (e. g., habitat quality), analyses in the academic literature tend to use a single biophysical attribute as a proxy for the environmental amenity (e. g., species richness). A narrow focus on a single attribute, however, fails to consider the full range of biophysical attributes that are critical to the supply of an environmental amenity. Drawing on the production efficiency literature, we introduce an alternative conservation targeting approach that relies on distance functions to cost-efficiently allocate conservation funds across a spatially heterogeneous landscape. An approach based on distance functions has the advantage of not requiring...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the realm}} of digital technologies, the student, the {{educator}} and the design industry all seemingly want different things. The industry desires fast and accurate documenters, the educator persuades the student to explore the potentials of massing and modelling, and the student wants to present their work with photographic realism. Digital technologies can be a distraction to design discourse by making it about the image rather than the ideas or the creative process. This view is also commonly held by two groups, design academics and those who resist technological change. Can education of digital communications reconcile all these needs? Are BIM (Building Information Modelling) and parametric systems the panacea, {{the next generation of}} CAD software combining <b>drafting,</b> modelling <b>and</b> <b>presentation</b> in one user friendly program or simply another marketing approach by software developers and resellers? This paper will explore the individual requirements of each of the stakeholders, identify the causal relationships, both fundamental and contributory, between them and relate their experience to the Australian context. The discussion will also direct particular attention to the question whether the University should be educating students in digital technologies or should the design industry take greater responsibility for training their staff?...|$|R
40|$|The {{technical}} review panel (TRP) reviewed the <b>draft</b> document <b>and</b> <b>presentations</b> regarding {{the assessment of}} the spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) in California, USA. Only the U. S. portion of the stock was considered, with a northern boundary at Point Conception, thus it includes the whole Southern California Bight (SCB). The major center of distribution is central Baja California. One stock was assumed for the whole SCB, so no local dynamics were followed or described. Environmental considerations regarding temperature and salinity, conditions under which spiny lobster are sensitive, were not explored. Commercial and recreational fisheries were considered, with a time series of removals constructed back to 1916 for commercial fisheries. The recreational fishery was reconstructed back to 1965, with gear-switching documented to the present time. Details of management changes were also described throughout the history of the fishery. This stock is data-limited, with only catch records and some measure of commercial effort provided. There are no biological data (size or age compositions) available SCB-wide, nor any fishery-independent measures of abundance. A fishery-dependent measure of commercial catchper-unit-effort (CPUE) was provided using the raw landings per trap pulls, but showed very littl...|$|R

40|$|Long {{understood}} as the key document in Britain's Cold War history, the Duncan Sandys Defence White Paper of 1957 nevertheless has a largely forgotten context: home defence. This article argues that understanding this context allows important new conclusions to be drawn concerning the <b>drafting,</b> <b>presentation</b> <b>and</b> the reception of the document and the deterrent strategy it expounded. It argues that the Paper failed {{to establish a new}} doctrine for civil defence which reconciled the policy with the wider deterrent strategy. In doing this, the Paper presented a muddled policy to the public: one which failed to justify the reductions in civil defence provision but which stressed the destructive power of thermonuclear weapons. This had the effect of encouraging the critics of the government's nuclear strategy to flag up the absence of adequate civil defence measures and highlight the 'admission' that there was no defence against the hydrogen bomb...|$|R
