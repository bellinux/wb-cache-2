40|$|Jumping {{plays an}} {{integral}} part of ballet performance and this study examines some of the ballet dancer’s characteristics that influence <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Forty-nine dancers (M = 21; F = 28) completed a series of tests that included two footed vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height,</b> single leg vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> and anthropometric measurements. Supplemental training history and company position were also recorded. Statistical analysis (ANCOVA and MANOVA) indicated males had a greater vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> than females (p 0. 05). These results corroborate to previous research and also provide greater insight on how anthropometric and choreographic factors potentially influence vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in ballet dancers. The ineffective influence of supplemental training on vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> needs greater examination. How other training regimens could influence <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in dancers needs to be examined...|$|R

A vertical leap in basketball also involves rapid & repeated muscle contraction & stretching. Various {{methods have been}} used to improve the vertical leap in players, but only few studies mention about plyometrics. Aim: To determine the effect of Plyometric training on vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in high school basketball players & compare them with their untrained counterparts. Methods and Materials: 144 students were randomly selected & distributed in Group I (Pre-pubertal) & Group II (Pubertal) which was further divided into Group A (trained players) & Group B (untrained students). A gender wise distribution followed this. Plyometric training of 6 weeks was conducted & the vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> pre & post training were recorded & compared. Results: Vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> improved significantly post Plyometric in Group Bcompared to Group A. Boys showed improvement in Group B, however girls were better in Group A. Correlation of BMI with vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was negative & significant in Group B. Conclusion: Plyometric training brought significant change in untrained students. Boys gained more <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> while girls showed significant increase in <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> during pubertal growth spurt.

40|$|Plyometrics {{has been}} widely researched, finding it an {{effective}} method for improving <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> and lower body power. It has not however been researched as a trampoline specific strength and conditioning intervention. Aim: This study aims to assess {{the effectiveness of a}} six-week plyometric program on the lower body power and on trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in trampoline gymnasts. Method: In a mixed experimental study 19 competitive trampolinists (16 ± 3 years) were assigned to either a control or plyometric training group. The training group performed a progressive 6 -week plyometric intervention, whilst the control group performed no plyometrics. All participants were tested pre- and post-intervention. Force plates were used to assess <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> and impulse of countermovement (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ). Trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was assessed using time of flight (ToF) of 10 straight jumps. Data was analysed for differences between pre- and post-testing measures. Results: No significant differences were found, in neither lower body power (p> 0. 05) nor trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (p> 0. 05), between pre- and post-testing in the control group. The training group showed no significant difference in trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> between pre- and post-testing (p> 0. 05). The training group showed significant increases in power, with both significantly increased CMJ and SJ height (p< 0. 05) and impulse (p< 0. 05), between pre- and post-testing. Conclusion: Results suggest that a 6 -week plyometric training program was effective for significantly improving trampolinists lower body power on the floor. However, the plyometrics did not cause significant improvements on the trampoline, with no increases in trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Future research needs to further validate these findings, with greater sample sizes, as well as further investigation into the physiological demands of trampolining.

40|$|Stretching {{is often}} {{included}} {{as part of}} a warm-up procedure for basketball activity. However, the efficacy of stretching with respect to sport performance has come into question. We determined the effects of 4 different warm-up protocols followed by 20 minutes of basketball activity on flexibility and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Subjects participated in 6 weeks (2 times per week) of warm-up and basketball activity. The warm-up groups participated in ballistic stretching, static stretching, sprinting, or basketball shooting (control group). We asked 3 questions. First, what effect does 6 weeks of warm-up exercise and basketball play have on both flexibility and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height?</b> We measured sit and reach and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> before (week - 1) and after (week 7) the 6 weeks. Flexibility increased for the ballistic, static, and sprint groups compared to the control group (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001), while vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> did not change for any of the groups. Our second question was what is the acute effect of each warm-up on vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height?</b> We measured vertical jump immediately after the warm-up on 4 separate occasions during the 6 weeks (at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6). Vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was not different for any group. Finally, our third question was what is the acute effect of each warm-up on vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> following 20 minutes of basketball play?

40|$|Previous studies {{investigating}} the biomechanical {{factors associated with}} maximal countermovement <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> have typically utilised cross-sectional data. An alternative but less common approach is to use pre-to-post training change data, where the relationship between an improvement in <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> and a change in a factor is examined more directly. Our study compared the findings of these approaches. Such an evaluation is necessary because cross-sectional studies are currently a primary source of information for coaches when examining what factors to train to enhance performance. The countermovement jump of forty four males was analysed before and after an eight week training intervention. Correlations with <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> were calculated using both cross-sectional (pre-training data only) and pre-to-post training change data. Eight factors identified in the cross-sectional analysis were not significantly correlated with a change in <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in the pre-to-post analysis. Additionally, only six of eleven factors identified in the pre-to-post analysis were identified in the cross-sectional analysis. These findings imply that: (a) not all factors identified in a cross-sectional analysis may be critical to <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> improvement, and (b) cross-sectional analyses alone may not provide an insight into all of the potential factors to train to enhance <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Coaches {{must be aware of}} these limitations when examining cross-sectional studies to identify factors to train to enhance jump ability. Additional findings highlight that while exercises prescribed to improve <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> should aim to enhance concentric power production at all joints, a particular emphasis on enhancing hip joint peak power may be warranted...|$|R

40|$|AbstractJump {{analyses}} {{are often used}} in performance diagnostic and scientific research. Usually vertical ground reaction forces are measured to calculate <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> There are different types of force plates and varying sampling rates. Generally calculation of <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> based on impulse-momentum or flight time method. This study investigates the influence of different sampling rates in filtered and non-filtered force signals on the <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> calculated with impulse-momentum and flight time method. For the study we used vertical ground reaction forces of 60 counter movement jumps (CMJ) performed by 20 professional soccer players. Forces are measured with two force plates (Kistler). Sampling rate was set to 1000  Hz. Curves are used non-filtered and filtered (Butterworth) and were downsampled to 500  Hz, 200  Hz and 100  Hz. The <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was calculated with a customized program designed using LABVIEW (National Instruments). Body weight was calculated with the impulse momentum method of the whole jump time. Numerical integration method was the trapezoidal rule. Differences between groups were tested with a oneway repeated measures ANOVA and carried out with Bonferroni correction (p≤ 0. 05). <b>Jump</b> <b>height</b> decreased significant with downsampling force curves for impulse-momentum and flight time method and filtered and non-filtered condition. Mean changes between 1000 and 500  Hz were 0. 1 – 0. 2  cm, between 1000 and 200  Hz 0. 5 – 0. 6  cm and between 1000 and 100  Hz 1. 3 – 1. 5  cm. There are no differences between <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (impulse-momentum method) in filtered and non-filtered condition at 1000, 500, 200 and 100  Hz. In flight time method filtering the force curves decreased the <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> The decrease in <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> after downsampling force time curves maybe an influencing factor of different results described in literature. Especially between 1000 and 100 – 200  Hz the differences have practical relevance. The influence in other parameters like landing peak force can be much greater. The use of a filter before calculation <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> seems to be uncritical for impulsemomentum method. In flight time method the influence of filtering is low and certainly lesser than other factors like force threshold or landing style.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare static and dynamic warm-up regimes on lower limb muscle power and thereby the perform-ance of the individual. Methodology: Twenty eight (28) {{subjects}} were assigned into groups consisting of 2 members. From each group, 1 subject performed the static stretching and the other subject performed dynamic stretching as warm-up. This was followed by non-counter movement jumps on a force platform and the vertical <b>jump</b> <b>heights</b> were recorded. Data were analysed using one-way ANOVA and paired t-test at 0. 05 alpha.

Discussion: The increase in vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> could be related to the increase in force pro-duction which plays an important role during the vertical jump test.

Two JJSs were used to establish consistency between systems. <b>Jump</b> <b>height</b> was calculated from flight time obtained from the JJS and force platform. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) demonstrated excellent within-session reliability of the CMJ height measurement derived from both the JJS (ICC =. 96, P <. 001) and the force platform (ICC =. 96, P <. 001). Dependent t tests revealed that the JJS yielded a significantly greater CMJ <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (0. 46 ± 0. 09 m vs 0. 33 ± 0. 08 m) than the force platform (P <. 001, Cohen d = 1. 39, power = 1. 00).

Vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was calculated from the take-off velocity (Vtake-off) provided by a force platform. Thirty swimmers belonging to the National Slovenian swimming team performed a jump squat incremental loading test, lifting 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of body weight in a Smith machine. Jump performance was simultaneously monitored using an AMTI portable force platform and a linear velocity transducer attached to the barbell. Simple linear regression was used to estimate <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> from the Vmax and FPV recorded by the linear velocity transducer. Vmax (y = 16. 577 x - 16. 384) was able to explain 93 % of <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> variance with a standard error of the estimate of 1. 47 cm. FPV (y = 12. 828 x - 6. 504) was able to explain 91 % of <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> variance with a standard error of the estimate of 1. 66 cm. Despite that both variables resulted to be good predictors, heteroscedasticity in the differences between FPV and Vtake-off was observed (r 2 = 0. 307), while the differences between Vmax and Vtake-off were homogenously distributed (r 2 = 0. 071).
