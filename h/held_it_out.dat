500|$|U2 {{found that}} they were neither {{prepared}} nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and {{felt that they were}} not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of [...] "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to Bono, saying, [...] "You tell me what to play and I'll play it. You want to play it yourself? Go ahead." [...] With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' [...] "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song [...] "One". While working on [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became [...] "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing [...] "blank page approach" [...] to writing and recording together.|$|E
2500|$|Gordon opines {{that the}} Quran in {{particular}} and Islamic jurisprudence in general have not placed a premium on manumission but <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> as one way for atonement of sin. He states that [...] "Manumission {{was only one of}} several virtuous observances that the pious could avail themselves of and was by no means the most important," [...] noting that other options include reaffirming faith in God and giving food to the poor. He concludes that [...] "there was no contradiction between being a devout Muslim and a slave-owing one as well." ...|$|E

60|$|He bent unsteadily over Quest. Suddenly {{the latter}} sprang up, seized {{him by the}} leg and sent him sprawling. The gun fell from his hand. Quest picked <b>it</b> up and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> firmly <b>out,</b> {{covering}} both men. Gallagher was on his knees, groping for his own weapon.|$|R
60|$|The princess {{was delighted}} with this visit {{and with the}} hopes the mermaid <b>held</b> <b>out.</b> <b>It</b> was {{something}} to meet some one fresh to talk to.|$|R

60|$|She <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> before him. He {{glanced at}} it and back into her face.|$|E
60|$|She <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> {{without a}} word. She {{had been holding}} it in her hand.|$|E
60|$|He bowed {{over the}} hand which she <b>held</b> half-shyly <b>out.</b> <b>It</b> {{was not a}} form of {{greeting}} in which she often indulged.|$|R
60|$|Round {{went the}} capstan, the {{windlass}} clanked, {{and the ship}} forged slowly ahead as the warps and hawsers became rigid. At that moment a heavy block of ice, which had been overbalanced by {{the motion of the}} vessel, fell with a crash on the rudder, splitting off a large portion of it, and drawing the iron bolts that <b>held</b> <b>it</b> completely <b>out</b> of the stern-post.|$|R
60|$|Glenn led {{her along}} {{the base of}} the wall to three other pens, in each of which was a fat old sow with a litter. And at the last enclosure, that owing to dry soil was not so dirty, Glenn picked up a little pig and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> {{squealing}} <b>out</b> to Carley as she leaned over the fence. It was fairly white and clean, a little pink and fuzzy, and certainly cute with its curled tall.|$|R
60|$|The young bee <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in silence--unmistakably a drone leg {{incapable}} of packing pollen.|$|E
60|$|She drew a {{very small}} white hand from a very large leather mitten, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fidgetting {{with his}} fingers, and {{scarcely}} {{knowing what he}} was doing, the young politician <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{changed the}} subject abruptly, and they talked of other matters until {{they went back to}} the drawing-room. Some time {{afterward}} {{there was a knock at}} the door, and Geraldine, opening <b>it,</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> a telegram to Andrew.|$|R
50|$|By 88 BC, the war {{was largely}} over except for the Samnites (the old rivals of Rome) who still <b>held</b> <b>out.</b> <b>It</b> {{is likely that the}} war would have {{continued}} a lot longer had Rome not made concessions to their allies.|$|R
5000|$|Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote [...] "Inkaar {{could have}} been truly radical. But it becomes a film that prefers to cop out, rather than deliver on the promise <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> so bravely in its initial passages." ...|$|R

60|$|Colonel Zane took a long, {{feathered}} arrow {{from where}} it lay on a bench, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to Jonathan.|$|E
60|$|Up to {{this point}} {{business}} had continued in the most promising manner, and if <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> as well {{there would be no}} difficulty in his paying all the money he owed, even although there might be no very large profit.|$|R
60|$|Now the {{ceremonial}} law did bring or lead to Christ these two ways: First, In {{that it did}} continue in full force until he did come into the world, and had done that which was by <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> for him to do.|$|R
50|$|Diyodar {{was ruled}} by the Bhilria Vaghela Rajput dynasty, who, on the {{overthrow}} of Rajput power in Patan, took (1297) Bhildi, near Palanpur, and for some generations <b>held</b> <b>it.</b> Driven <b>out</b> by the Muslims, they, in turn, held Samav in Kankrej, Munjpur in Radhanpur, and Tervada in Tharad, and, again ousted by the Muslims, took Diyodar. Once an estate of eighty-four villages, Diyodar reduced to half of its size as it lost areas to the Kankrej and Bhabhar Kolis. In the famine of 1786 the district was deserted, the chief with his family seeking a maintenance elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|Eagerly {{watched by}} Mrs. Inchbare, she wrote {{an order to}} the poultry-woman, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with a gracious smile.|$|E

50|$|On 25 August 1918 at Martinpuich, France, {{during a}} strong {{counter-attack}} Sergeant Colley's company was holding an advanced position with two platoons {{in advance and}} two in support. The forward platoons were ordered to hold on at all costs and Sergeant Colley went, without orders, to help these two platoons. He rallied the men, then formed a defensive flank and <b>held</b> <b>it,</b> although <b>out</b> of the two platoons only three men remained unwounded and the sergeant himself was dangerously wounded and died the same day. It was entirely due to his action that the enemy was prevented from breaking through.|$|R
50|$|In November 1583, Ernst's brother laid siege to the Elector's palace at Poppelsdorf. A gothic water {{fortress}} {{had been}} built in 1341 and was expanded the following year into a double-fortress. Despite its relatively low walls, <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> for two weeks, and Ernst's troops breached the gates on 18 November.|$|R
60|$|Asti crept forward, and {{the glowing}} {{shape in the}} royal robe bent over her so that the light of it shone upon her face. It bent over her and seemed to whisper in her ear. Then <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> its hands towards Tua as though in blessing, and {{instantly}} was not.|$|R
60|$|The boy <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> It was a toy, a bear. A teddy bear. The boy's {{eyes were}} large, but without expression.|$|E

60|$|But {{why this}} {{contrast}} between the forecastle and the quarter-deck, between the man-of-war's-man and his officer? Because, though war would equally jeopardize the lives of both, yet, while <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> to the sailor no promise of promotion, and what is called glory, these things fired the breast of his officers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the development}} of the banking sector in twelve transition countries. Foreign banks have become major players in the financial system of these countries. Still, foreign bank presence and financial development in general vary considerably between these economies. Distance from the home country is an important determinant for a foreign bank to enter a specific country. The most frequently used mode of entry is buying (part) of a domestic bank. This share is gradually expanded until a majority share is <b>held.</b> <b>It</b> turns <b>out</b> that foreign banks have, in general, higher profitability and efficiency levels than domestic banks.

50|$|The {{match was}} a best of 12 games. Players scored 1 {{point for a}} win and half a point for a draw. If, after 12 games, the score was tied at 6 points each, then a {{tie-break}} would be <b>held.</b> As <b>it</b> turned <b>out,</b> {{the first round of}} tie-breaks (rapid games) was indeed required, and was held on October 13, 2006.|$|R
