The illegal water trade brings water to the residents of <b>the</b> <b>slums</b> for a price. Bags of water are exchanged, though illegally, and a profit is made by selling these bags. This trade is very popular and a necessity because of the high demand and rarity of water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slum.</b>|$|R

Notable residents of Toynbee Hall included R. H. Tawney, Clement Attlee, Guglielmo Marconi, and William Beveridge. The Hall continues to exert considerable influence, with the Workers Educational Association (1903), Citizens Advice Bureau (1949) and Child Poverty Action Group (1965) all being founded or influenced by it. In 1888, the matchgirls of Bryant and May in Bow went on strike for better working conditions. This, combined with the many dock strikes in the same era, made the East End a key element in the foundation of modern socialist and trade union organisations, as well as the Suffragette movement.|$|E

50|$|Critics {{argue that}} slum removal by force tends {{to ignore the}} social {{problems}} that cause slums.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Street {{foods are}} an {{important}} source of nutrients for poor urban residents. This study aimed to identify determinants of the proportion of daily energy provided by non-home-prepared foods. METHODS: A survey was conducted in a slum and a low- to middle-income area of Nairobi. The survey included 241 men and 254 women. Through a structured questionnaire, data on demographic and socioeconomic factors were collected and food intake was assessed with three standardized 24 -hour recalls. A measure of socioeconomic status was constructed with principal component analysis. RESULTS: For women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> area, <b>the</b> presence of school-age children and distance to work were determinants of non-home-prepared food consumption, whereas employment status and distance to work were determinants for men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> area (P < 0. 05). Having their own income and, for those employed, employment status were determinants for women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low- to middle-income area, whereas socioeconomic status was the determinant for the men (P < 0. 05). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Slum</b> area, most non-home-prepared foods were derived from street foods, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> low- to middle-income area, both kiosks and street foods were important sources of non-home-prepared foods. CONCLUSION: <b>In</b> <b>the</b> determinants of non-home-prepared energy consumption, we discerned a pattern from rather basic determinants to determinants of a more complicated nature with increasing socioeconomic level of the groups. Furthemore, a shift from street foods to kiosks as the main source of non-home-prepared foods consumed appeared with increasing socioeconomic levels. (C) Elsevier Inc. 2003...|$|R

25|$|A {{growing economy}} that creates jobs at rate faster than {{population}} growth, offers people opportunities and incentive to relocate from poor slum to more developed neighborhoods.

40|$|Background: A {{health system}} that {{provides}} equitable {{health care is}} a principal goal in many countries. Measuring horizontal inequity (HI) in health care utilization is important to develop appropriate and equitable public policies, especially policies related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Design: A cross-sectional survey of 1, 211 randomly selected households in slum and non-slum areas was carried out in four urban districts of Hanoi city in 2013. This study utilized data from 3, 736 individuals aged 15 years and older. Respondents were asked about health care use during the previous 12 months; information included sex, age, and self-reported NCDs. We assessed the extent of inequity in utilization of public health care services. Concentration indexes for health care utilization and health care needs were constructed via probit regression of individual utilization of public health care services, controlling for age, sex, and NCDs. In addition, concentration indexes were decomposed to identify factors contributing to inequalities in health care utilization. Results: The proportion of healthcare utilization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> and non-slum areas was 21. 4 and 26. 9 %, respectively. HI in health care utilization <b>in</b> favor of <b>the</b> rich was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> areas, whereas horizontal equity was achieved among <b>the</b> non-slum areas. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> areas, we identified some key factors that affect the utilization of public health care services. Conclusion: Our results suggest that to achieve horizontal equity in utilization of public health care services, policy should target preventive interventions for NCDs, focusing more on <b>the</b> poor <b>in</b> <b>slum</b> areas...|$|R
40|$|Methods. We {{conducted}} a health survey of 576 adults in 2006. Census tracts were stratified by income level and categorization as a slum.

We found <b>the</b> worst indicators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> stratum. <b>The</b> life expectancy at birth of men living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> richest {{parts of the city}} was 12. 8 years longer than that of men living in deprived areas. For both men and women older than age 65 years, healthy life expectancy was more than twice as high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> richest sector as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>slum</b> sector. Conclusions. Our analysis detailed the excess burden of poor health experienced by disadvantaged populations of Rio de Janeiro. Policy efforts are needed to reduce social inequalities in health in this city, especially among the elderly...|$|R
