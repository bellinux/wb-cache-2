25|$|I {{have written}} this letter {{to you on}} a happy day to me, {{which is also the}} last day of my life. For I have been {{attacked}} by a painful inability to urinate, and also dysentery, so violent that nothing can be added to the violence of my sufferings. But the cheerfulness of my mind, which comes from the recollection of all my philosophical contemplation, counterbalances all these afflictions. And <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> {{to take care of the}} children of Metrodorus, in a manner worthy of the devotion shown by the young man to me, and to philosophy.|$|E
25|$|I {{have just}} had an {{interview}} with Andrássy. He set forth his views clearly and plainly. I quite understood them and arrived at the conclusion that if you would trust him – and trust him entirely – we might still be saved, not only Hungary, but the monarchy, too.... I {{can assure you that}} you are not dealing with a man desirous of playing a part at any price or striving for a position; on the contrary, he is risking his present position, which is a fine one. But approaching shipwreck, he, too, is prepared to do all in his power to save it; what he possesses – his understanding and influence in the country – he will lay at your feet. For the last time <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> in Rudolf's name not to lose this, at the last moment...|$|E

500|$|On 20 April 1770, Smart {{was arrested}} for debt. On 11 January 1771, he was tried by Lord Mansfield, the gentleman who {{originally}} introduced Smart to Alexander Pope, and he was soon recommended to the King's Bench Prison. Although he was in prison, Charles Burney purchased the [...] "Rules" [...] (allowing him some freedom), and Smart's final weeks may have been peaceful although pathetic. In his final letter, Smart begged for money from Rev. Mr. Jackson, saying: [...] "Being upon recovery from a fit of illness, and having nothing to eat, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> to send me two or three shillings which (God willing) I will return, with many thanks, {{in two or three}} days." [...] On 20 May 1771, Smart died from either liver failure or pneumonia shortly after completing his final work, Hymns, for the Amusement of Children.|$|E
500|$|The GameCube version {{rated the}} lowest among critics {{out of the}} three versions. Ben Kosmina of Nintendo World Report promised that [...] "gamers {{experiencing}} the wacky mascot {{for the first time}} may enjoy it." [...] Michael Lafferty of GameZone described the game as [...] "safe, sterile and redundant." [...] Matt Casamassina on IGN concluded that [...] "at {{the end of the day}} this is the same Crash game I played so many years ago without any real innovations or evolutions." [...] Nintendo Power praised the [...] "sheer variety" [...] of the gameplay. Kilo Watt of GamePro said that [...] "graphically, this version is slightly below the recent Xbox release but in line with the competent PlayStation 2 iteration." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly agreed that [...] "Wrath on the GC is much more polished here than on the PS2," [...] while Play Magazine denounced the GameCube version as [...] "a shell of the other two console versions, so <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> to pass." ...|$|E
500|$|Philip Tilden, Churchill's architect, {{began work}} on the house in 1922 and the Churchills rented a {{farmhouse}} near Westerham, Churchill frequently visiting the site to observe progress. The two-year building programme, the ever-rising costs, which escalated from the initial estimate of £7,000 to over £18,000, {{and a series of}} construction difficulties, particularly relating to damp, soured relations between architect and client, and by 1924 Churchill and Tilden were barely on speaking terms. Legal arguments, conducted through their respective lawyers, rumbled on until 1927. Clementine's anxieties about the costs, both of building and subsequently living at Chartwell also continued. In September 1923 Churchill wrote to her, [...] "My beloved, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> not to worry about money, or to feel insecure. Chartwell is to be our home (and) we must endeavour to live there for many years." [...] Churchill finally moved into the house in April 1924, a letter dated 17 April of that year to Clementine begins, [...] "This is the first letter I have ever written from this place, and it is right that it should be to you".|$|E

500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen {{called for the}} salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: [...] "never, never, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you,</b> include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise." [...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|E
500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend if I did not... tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> to believe that I would not harbour such a thought." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens, a {{moderator}} of {{the ecumenical}} council, questioned, [...] "whether moral theology took sufficient account of scientific progress, {{which can help}} determine, what is according to nature. <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> my brothers let us avoid another Galileo affair. One is enough for the Church." [...] In an interview in Informations Catholiques Internationales on 15 May 1969, he criticized the Pope’s decision again as frustrating the collegiality defined by the Council, calling it a non-collegial or even an anti-collegial act. He was supported by Vatican II theologians such as Karl Rahner, Hans Küng, and several bishops, including Christopher Butler, who called {{it one of the}} most important contributions to contemporary [...] discussion in the Church.|$|E

The letters from Munich to San Francisco get shorter and more panicky, begging Max to stop: [...] "My God, Max, {{do you know what}} you do? ...

Greenough expressed frustration with his stance and eventually won readmission for Gilkey and Lumbard. He expressed especial frustration that Lowell would not readmit Day.

2500|$|At 11:00a.m. on 28 July, Austria {{declared}} war on Serbia. Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm’s [...] "Stop in Belgrade" [...] proposal until noon. At 1:00am on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian monitor SMS Bodrog, which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries. In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary. Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia. Nicholas replied: [...] "Am glad you are back... I appeal to you to help me. An ignoble war has been declared on a weak country... Soon I shall be overwhelmed by pressure brought upon me... to take extreme measures which will lead to war.

2500|$|From {{then on the}} writer's {{visits to}} the Palace became rare, but he used each one as an {{opportunity}} to [...] "speak the truth regardless," [...] as he put it. In 1862 Tolstoy solicited for Ivan Aksakov who'd been banned from editing his Den (The Day) newspaper. A year later he helped Ivan Turgenev out of an exile the latter found himself in after having contacted the [...] "London propagandists", as Alexander Herzen and Nikolay Ogarev were then known. In 1864 Tolstoy tried to exert his influence upon Alexander II to make him alleviate the plight of the imprisoned Chernyshevsky. Asked by the Tsar for the latest news in the world of literature, Tolstoy said: [...] "The whole of Russia has gone into mourning for Chernyshevsky to whom an injustice has been done..." [...] - [...] "No, Tolstoy, <b>I</b> <b>beg</b> <b>you</b> never to remind me of Chernyshevsky, please," [...] the monarch hastily retorted.
