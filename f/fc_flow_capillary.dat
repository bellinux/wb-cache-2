We have derived both infiltration parameters from the disc infiltrometer records and capillary invasion parameters from the combined analyses of soil structure and soil water carried out on horizontal soil core slices of approximately 7 mm thickness. We assumed that the recorded transient flow can be subdivided into the <b>capillary</b> <b>flow,</b> estimated from sorptivity (differentiated linearization method), and the gravity-driven transient flow, calculated as the difference between the recorded total flow and the estimated <b>capillary</b> <b>flow.</b> Although gravity-driven flow occurred in this study, we assumed that capillary invasion theory is applicable because the topsoils were dry, leading to predominance of <b>capillary</b> <b>flow,</b> and the experiment was ended shortly after reaching the steady-state <b>flow.</b> <b>Capillary</b> invasion was the predominant transient flow process occurring into the silt loam soil whereas a combination of <b>capillary</b> <b>flow</b> and gravity-driven transient flow occurred into the sandy loam soil and the silty clay soil.

40|$|Most point-of-care (POC) {{and patient}} {{self-testing}} (PST) devices {{are based on}} the analysis of whole blood taken from a finger prick. Whole blood contains a bountiful of information about the donor’s health. We analyze here two particularities of microsystems for blood analysis: the blood non-Newtonian behavior, and the <b>capillary</b> <b>flow</b> in reagent-coated channels. Capillarity is the most commonly used method to move fluids in portable systems. It is shown first that the <b>capillary</b> <b>flow</b> of blood does not follow the Lucas-Washburn-Rideal law when the <b>capillary</b> <b>flow</b> velocity is small, due to its non-Newtonian rheology and to the formation of rouleaux of RBCs. In a second step, the <b>capillary</b> <b>flow</b> of blood on reagent-coated surfaces is investigated; first experimentally by observing the spreading of a droplet of blood on different reagent-coated substrates; second theoretically and numerically using the general law for spontaneous <b>capillary</b> <b>flows</b> and the Evolver numerical program. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, we {{simulate}} an ascending air phase flow in {{a vertical}} porous channel initially saturated with a liquid phase. The numerical study is performed for large range of injected {{air mass flow}} rate from the bottom to the top. The different forces intervening in the drainage process is analyzed according to several permeabilities. The results show that for a weak gas mass <b>flow</b> rate, the <b>capillary</b> effect is dominant. In this case, the gas saturation in a porous channel is proportional to the permeability. For more important gas mass flow rate, the saturation behavior becomes inversely proportional to the permeability of the porous channel.

40|$|Microreactor {{technology}} {{is an important}} method of process intensification. Liquid-liquid slug <b>flow</b> <b>capillary</b> microreactor {{has been used to}} intensify the mass transfer limited and strongly exothermic reactions. In this type of reactor, either two liquids flow alternate to each other in a capillary or one liquid flows as a continuous flow while other flows in the form of enclosed drops (slugs) depending on the interfacial tension between two liquids and liquid adhesion with the solid walls. The enhanced mass transfer is due to the internal circulations within the slugs which arise due to shearing action between the slug axis and the capillary wall or continuous phase. The slug size and the intensity of internal circulations depend on the type of mixing element and physical properties of the liquids. The proper understanding of physical behaviour of fluids at the microscale is a challenging issue for the growing microreactor application demands. This paper highlights the hydrodynamic characteristics of the liquid-liquid slug <b>flow</b> <b>capillary</b> microreactor. Experimental results on flow regime, slug size and particle image velocimetry along with corresponding complementary start-of-the-art CFD simulations are discussed in detail...|$|R

30|$|This {{reduction}} in retinal <b>capillary</b> <b>flow</b> {{does not necessarily}} mean vascular obliteration or non-perfusion. Leakage of plasma outside the inflamed wall may lead to a decrease in the flow velocity inside the retinal vessel. In fact, OCTA may not detect retinal <b>capillary</b> <b>flow</b> outside the range of 0.3  mm/s to 2  mm/s. Thus, in active vasculitis with FA leakage, there may be a global slowdown of the retinal circulation that may be identified with OCTA.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} two fluid model for {{predicting}} gas liquid Taylor <b>flow</b> in <b>capillaries.</b> The model {{is based on}} the hydrodynamics characteristics of Taylor bubbles and liquid slug. By considering a unit cell consisting of a bubble and a liquid slug as control volume, conservation of momentum equations for gas and liquid film is combined and solved with a set of empirical closure equations. We also propose a new expression for the interfacial friction factor, which takes the influences of surface tension, the liquid velocity and viscosity and the gas holdup into account. By combining this new expression with the two fluid model, we can calculate the hydrodynamic characteristics of gas-liquid Taylor <b>flow</b> in <b>capillaries</b> for different channels diameters and working fluids. The model is validated by experimental results reported in existing literature. Very good agreement can be observed, demonstrating its potential application in predicting the phenomena of Taylor <b>flow</b> in <b>capillaries...</b>|$|R
40|$|Contrast-enhanced {{ultrasound}} (CEU) {{has been}} used to measure muscle microvascular perfusion in vivo in response to exercise and insulin. In the present study we address whether CEU measurement of capillary volume is influenced by bulk flow and if measured capillary filling rate allows discrimination of different flow pattern changes within muscle. Three in vitro models were used: (i) bulk flow rate was varied within a single length of capillary tubing; (ii) at constant bulk <b>flow,</b> <b>capillary</b> volume was increased 3 -fold by joining lengths of capillary in series, and compared to a single length; and (iii) at constant bulk <b>flow,</b> <b>capillary</b> volume was increased by sharing flow between a number of lengths of identical capillaries in parallel. The contrast medium for CEU was gas-filled albumin microbubbles. Pulsing interval (time) versus acoustic–intensity curves were constructed and from these, capillary volume and capillary filling rate were calculated. CEU estimates of capillary volume were not affected by changes in bulk flow. Furthermore, as CEU estimates of capillary volume increased, measures of capillary filling rate decreased, regardless of whether capillaries were connected in series or parallel. Therefore, CEU can detect a change in filling rate of the microvascular volume under measurement, but it {{can not be used to}} discriminate between different flow patterns within muscle that might account for capillary recruitment in vivo...|$|R

40|$|The Marangoni {{contraction}} of sessile drops of a binary mixture of a volatile and a nonvolatile liquid {{has been investigated}} experimentally and theoretically.
