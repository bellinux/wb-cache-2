25|$|Engine offerings {{were reduced}} to just two: the {{standard}} 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel.|$|E
25|$|Styling {{changes were}} minimal in 1951 and 1952. Power {{steering}} was added {{as an option}} in 1952 and horsepower climbed to 170 thanks primarily to a new <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor.</b> Sales continued to slide falling to about 66,000 in 1951 and to 51,000 in 1952.|$|E
25|$|Following a major {{downsizing}} and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre {{received only}} minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now {{powered by a}} turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... two <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors,</b> 10.5:1 compression, [...] @ 5100 rpm, [...] @ 2600 rpm.|$|R

50|$|Depending on sanctioning {{body and}} class, engines may either be <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> or {{throttle}} body {{electronic fuel injection}} and must be a naturally aspirated intake system.|$|R
25|$|Under the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was {{replaced}} by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.|$|E
25|$|Under the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was {{replaced}} in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 {{designed for the}} upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower {{version of the same}} engine with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.|$|E
25|$|Both {{base and}} Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the {{standard}} 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor,</b> 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.|$|E
50|$|It {{featured}} a 350HP, 289CI Ford Mustang V-8 engine, with a four-speed stick shift. It had two <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> {{mounted on a}} Mickey Thompson Ram-Thrust manifold.|$|R
5000|$|The 1956 Corvette {{introduced}} three {{versions of}} this engine - [...] with a single 4-barrel carburetor, [...] with twin 4-barrels, and [...] with two <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> and a high-lift camshaft.|$|R
50|$|At Bonneville {{during the}} September session, the R3-powered car (which was supercharged), {{designated}} #5, ran the flying kilometer {{at a speed}} of 157.29 mph. The R4-powered car (naturally aspirated, but with dual <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors),</b> car #4, set a fastest average speed of 147.86 mph.|$|R
25|$|The Bendix system's public {{debut in}} December 1956 was {{followed}} by a March 1957 price bulletin listing it as a US$395 option, but because of supplier difficulties, EFI Rebels would only be available after June 15. This was to have been the first production EFI engine, but Electrojector's teething problems meant only pre-production cars were so equipped: thus, very few cars so equipped were ever sold, and none were made available to the public. The Rambler's EFI was more advanced than the mechanical types then appearing on the market and the engines ran fine in warm weather, but suffered hard starting in cooler temperatures. As a result, all of the production Rebels used a <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor.</b> Nevertheless, the EFI option remained in the published owner's manual.|$|E
500|$|The 1950s jump {{started an}} {{industry}} of aftermarket add-ons for cars that continues today. The oldest aftermarket wheel company, American Racing, started in 1956 and still builds [...] "mag wheels" [...] (alloy wheels) for almost every car made. [...] Holley introduced the first modular <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor,</b> which Ford {{offered in the}} 1957 Ford Thunderbird, and versions are still used by performance enthusiasts. Edelbrock started during the Great Depression and expanded after the war. They provided a variety of high performance parts for the new hot rodders, which was popular equipment for setting speed records at Bonneville Salt Flats. Owners were no longer restricted to the original equipment provided by manufacturers, helping not only create the hot rod culture but also the foundation for cosmetic modifications. The creation and rapid expansion of the aftermarket {{made it possible for}} enthusiasts to personalize their automobiles.|$|E
2500|$|The {{price was}} reduced {{and the power}} was {{increased}} by way of AMC's new [...] V8 that was rated at [...] with a <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and dual exhausts. Consumers reacted by buying only 4,108 units.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors,</b> {{with two}} primary bores and two {{secondary}} bores, were the Carter WCFB and identical Rochester 4GC simultaneously introduced on the 1952 Cadillacs, Oldsmobile 98, Oldsmobile Super 88 and Buick Roadmaster. Oldsmobile referred the new carburetor as the “Quadri-Jet” (original spelling) while Buick {{called it the}} “Airpower”.|$|R
50|$|The 324 CID L {{version was}} {{produced}} from 1954 until 1956. Bore was increased to 3.875 in (same as the later 283 Chevy) and stroke {{remained the same}} at 3.4375 in. Two-barrel carburetion was standard; all high performance 324s came with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors.</b> The 324 was shared with GMC trucks.|$|R
2500|$|For 1967, the G.T. 350 {{carried over}} the K-Code high {{performance}} 289 with a 'COBRA' aluminum hi-rise. The G.T. 500 {{was added to}} the lineup, equipped with a [...] "Ford Cobra" [...] V8 (FE Series 428 cu.in.) engine with two 600 CFM Holly <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> sitting atop a mid-rise Aluminum intake manifold.|$|R
2500|$|Starting in mid-1964, the Chevelle {{could be}} ordered with the division’s 327-cubic-inch V8, in either 250 or [...] Both used a <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and 10.5:1 compression. For 1965, Chevrolet also added the 350-hp 327 V8 as Regular Production Option (RPO) L79.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] 343 has a [...] bore and [...] stroke. The basic 343/2V {{produced}} [...] and {{was built}} from 1967 through 1969. Output for the optional <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> version is [...] and produces [...] of torque (gross). This version has a 10.2:1 compression ratio.|$|E
2500|$|An engine {{option was}} the 455CID V8 with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor,</b> 8.4 to 1 {{compression}} ratio and 325hp (242kW) at 4,400 rpm, {{which was only}} available with the Turbo Hydra-matic TH-400 transmission. It had [...] SAE net at 4,000 rpm in the GTO and [...] SAE net in the Firebird. This engine was not available with air induction.|$|E
5000|$|Bonneville {{models were}} {{standard}} equipped with Hydra-Matic (through 1964) or Turbo Hydra-Matic (1965-on) automatic transmissions. Other options included power steering and power brakes {{as well as}} air conditioning. Other popular options included power windows, power seats, radio, cruise control, and 8-lug aluminum wheels that included integral brake drums for improved stopping power. The Bonneville also had more powerful standard V8 engines than other full-sized Pontiacs including the 389 cid L or 400 cid L V8s with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> (power ratings of [...] depending on year) with many optional V8 offerings available including Tri-Power (three two-barrel carburetor) options on both the 389 cid L and 421 cid L V8s that offered up to [...] through 1966. For 1962, Pontiac also offered the 421 cid L Super Duty with two <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors,</b> rated at , as a US$2,250 option (when the base Bonneville listed at US$3,349).|$|R
50|$|Drive to Victory Lane Racing School is {{a racing}} school in Thompson, Connecticut {{operated}} by 1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the Year Ken Bouchard. The school uses actual NASCAR modified cars, featuring 358 cubic-inch engines, <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> and four-speed manual transmissions. All courses {{take place at}} Thompson International Speedway, a 5/8-mile high-banked oval.|$|R
50|$|The largest DeSoto {{engine for}} 1957 was the DeSoto Adventurer {{offering}} 344.6 cuin L with square {{bore and stroke}} dimensions of 3.80 inches. The DeSoto Adventurer used dual Carter WCFB <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> for a rating of , again producing one horsepower per cubic inch utilizing a similar intake manifold to the 1956 341 Adventurer and a similar camshaft. Compression ratio remained at 9.5:1.|$|R
2500|$|Other changes {{included}} {{dropping the}} SC/360 compact muscle car, but the two-barrel {{version of the}} [...] remained optional {{in addition to the}} [...] V8 engine. For those desiring more performance, a <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> was a dealer-installed option on the 360 V8. Automatic transmissions were now the TorqueFlites sourced from Chrysler, and AMC called it the [...] "Torque-Command".|$|E
2500|$|In 1952, {{the base}} 88 shared the Super 88s rear body panels and wheelbase, and {{came with a}} Rocket V8 and two-barrel {{carburetor}} while Super 88s came with a new <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> upping the output to [...] Other mechanical features were unchanged with styling changes amounting to new grilles, taillights, and interior revisions. New was the optional automatic headlight control.|$|E
2500|$|For 1980, all 88s got new {{and more}} {{aerodynamic}} sheetmetal for improved fuel economy highlighted by rounded square taillights similar to mid-70s 88s, but overall dimensions stayed the same and coupes received a revised roofline. New to the engine lineup was the 307 cubic-inch Rocket V8 with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and [...] All other engines except the now-discontinued 403 were carried over from 1979.|$|E
50|$|A special 1957-'58 version {{called the}} V-800 used two <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors</b> to produce , {{making it the}} highest-output A engine. It {{was used in the}} 1957 and 1958 Plymouth Fury, but was also an option on Plymouth models lower in the model range. The Bristol 409 and 410 {{continued}} to use this engine until 1969. From 1962 until early 1965, Checker used this engine for their Aerobus limousines.|$|R
5000|$|... === 331 === This first FirePower engine, {{used from}} 1951 to 1955, has a bore of 3.8125 in and {{a stroke of}} 3.625 in for a piston {{displacement}} of 331 cuin L, and a deck height of 10.32" [...] ("low deck"). Most used a two-barrel carburetor and produced , with the famous exception of the 1955 Chrysler C-300 equipped with dual Carter WCFB <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 1978 Cutlass was {{downsized}} to the {{new version}} of GM's A-body with a shorter, 108 in wheelbase. This Cutlass was lighter than earlier versions at around 3300 lb, {{and it could be}} ordered with any of several engines built by GM's different divisions; a Buick 231 V6, Oldsmobile 260 V8, Pontiac 301 V8 or Chevrolet 305 V8s with either two- or <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The 1965 Galaxie was an all-new design, {{featuring}} vertically stacked dual headlights. The {{cars were}} taller and bulkier {{than the previous}} year's. The new top-of-the-line designation was the Galaxie 500 LTD. Engine choices {{were the same as}} 1964, except for an all-new [...] six-cylinder engine replacing the 1950s-era 223 [...] "Mileage-Maker" [...] six and the 352 was now equipped with dual exhausts and a <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The new-generation AMC V8 {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1966. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Gen-2" [...] AMC V8. The first version was the completely new [...] "Typhoon" [...] V8 introduced in a special mid-1966 model year [...] "Rogue" [...] hardtop. Available in [...] two-barrel carburetor version or producing [...] with a <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor</b> and high compression, the new engines utilized [...] "thin-wall" [...] casting technology and weighed only [...]|$|E
2500|$|Under the hood, the 389 V8 was {{replaced}} by a new [...] V8 with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetor,</b> dual exhausts and [...] Similarly, the 421 V8 {{was replaced}} by a new [...] V8 rated at [...] or an HO version with [...] - both with four-barrel carburetors. Both the 400 and 428 V8s were basically bored out versions of the older 389/421 block but with various internal improvements including bigger valves and improved breathing capabilities.|$|E
50|$|Economy. Unlike {{most other}} <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors,</b> the Quadrajet has a {{drastically}} different sized {{primary and secondary}} bores. The much smaller primaries act as a small two-barrel carburetor until the accelerator is pressed far enough to start to open the secondaries. The small primaries allow the primary throttle plates to be opened wider, and thus making the carburetor more efficient than a large two barrel, or square bore four-barrel.|$|R
5000|$|Engines {{were also}} detuned {{to meet the}} 1975 {{emission}} regulations with the compression ratio dropping to a new low of 7.6 to 1 on some engines. Standard was the [...] 400 cuin L V8 with two-barrel carburetor, optional were a [...] 400, or a [...] 455 cuin L - both with <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors.</b> Turbo Hydra-matic was standard equipment and the only transmission offered this year. Performance from 0-60 was 7.7 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|A 409 CID L {{version was}} Chevrolet's top regular {{production}} engine from 1961 to 1965, {{with a choice}} of single or dual <b>four-barrel</b> <b>carburetors.</b> Bore and stroke were both up from the 348 to 4.312 in by 3.50 in. On December 17, 1960, the 409 engine was announced along with the Impala SS (Super Sport) model. The initial version of the engine produced , with a single <b>four-barrel</b> Carter AFB <b>carburetor.</b> The same engine was upped to [...] in 1962. A [...] version of this engine was also available, developing 1 hp per cubic inch with a dual four-barrel aluminum intake manifold and two Carter AFB carburetors. It had a forged steel crankshaft. [...] This dual-quad version was immortalized in the Beach Boys song titled [...] "409".|$|R
