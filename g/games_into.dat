Canada {{finished}} the tournament with five wins and two losses, putting {{the team in}} a three-way tie for second place with Sweden and Czechoslovakia. Before 1964, the tie-breaking procedure was based on goal difference in games against teams in the medal round; under that system, Canada would have placed third ahead of the Czechoslovakian team. During the tournament the procedure was changed to take all <b>games</b> <b>into</b> consideration, which meant that the Canadians finished fourth. At the time, the Olympics counted as the World Championships; under their (unchanged) rules, Canada should have received bronze for the World Championships.|$|E

Seven <b>games</b> <b>into</b> the 1985 season, Leon Roberts, {{who started the}} season as a Nashville outfielder, became the acting manager for seven games due to manager Lee Walls coming down with an illness. Roberts was {{replaced}} by Gordon Mackenzie and returned to playing for the Sounds. After later retiring from playing, Roberts was hired to manage the 1986 team. Wayne Garland, who pitched for the Sounds in 1982, managed the team briefly during the 1988 managerial shuffle. Marty Brown managed the Sounds from 2001 to 2002 after having played for Nashville in 1988 and 1989.|$|E
5|$|After {{two seasons}} in Kansas City, the {{franchise}} moved to Denver and was renamed the Colorado Rockies it {{played at the}} McNichols Sports Arena. The team won its first game as the Rockies, 4–2, against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rockies were in position {{to qualify for the}} playoffs 60 <b>games</b> <b>into</b> the 1976–77 season, but a streak of 18 games without a win caused them to fall from contention. The Rockies ended the campaign last in the division with a 20–46–14 record and 54 points, and improved to 59 points the next season. Despite having the sixth-worst record in the League, the Rockies beat-out the Vancouver Canucks for second in the Division by two points and gained a playoff berth. The Philadelphia Flyers eliminated the Rockies from the playoffs in the preliminary rounds.|$|E
5|$|Eleven <b>games</b> <b>into</b> the 2010–11 season, Duncan {{became the}} Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played. Along the way, the Spurs {{compiled}} a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors. 12 days later, {{in a game}} against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
50|$|In Game 1, the Spurs won 117-115 at home {{in double}} overtime.
