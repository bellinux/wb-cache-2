40|$|Serious {{forms of}} crime have {{abandoned}} the merely national dimension and become transnational: think of terrorism, organized crime, computer crime, trafficking in human beings, {{just to name a}} few. In order to adequately fight this kind of phenomena, criminal law should do the same and not be so tied to the merely national dimension. European citizens ask for security and their request should be interpreted as expressing the need for regulatory interventions in the criminal field. Of course they deserve certainty as to the fact that appropriate sanctioning measures will be taken by all the Member States of the European Union (EU) in order to effectively deal with crime. Anyway, one should remember that criminal law must not be dissociated from the protection of fundamental rights because that would result in the denial of basic values inherent in democratic societies, first of all the rule of law. Then, the need for an axiological horizon and principles which found and limit the EU criminal system arises. So, my research question is: what are the axiological horizon and the principles which found and limit the EU criminal system? This work focuses on the precedents of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), so on a judge-made law whose development has basically been made possible thanks to the preliminary ruling procedure. No one denies that case law should remain bound to the specific case, inasmuch the extension of the ratio decidendi to other cases always is the result of selective operations. However, the presentation of the topics in this PhD thesis shows not only that the judgments of the ECJ in the criminal field are numerous, but also that they are characterized by the progressive emergence of a criminal law consciousness, a criminal law sensibility, and the will to create a system which is intrinsically consistent. The case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) is also taken into account in light of the phenomenon called cross-fertilization. The works of Italian and European legal scholars are considered too. So, after an Introduction on the relationship between globalization, crime, and competences of the EU in criminal matters, the thesis deals with the concept of criminal law (First Chapter), the principles of legality of criminal offences and penalties (Second Chapter), offensiveness (Third Chapter), guilt (Fourth Chapter), and proportionality (Fifth Chapter) in the case law of the ECJ. In the Conclusion, an assessment of the results is provided. As problematic as it seems, the search for an axiological horizon and principles of EU criminal law has proven fruitful. In the first chapter, I found out {{that it is possible to}} identify two notions of criminal law which have been developed by the ECJ in the last twenty-five years. According to the former, criminal law is that branch of law which aims at protecting the values that are deemed fundamental by national communities. According to the latter, the criminal nature of a sanction should be asserted in light of the so-called Engel criteria as developed by the EctHR (legal classification of the offence under national law, very nature of the offence, and degree of severity of the sanction). The latter approach is now prevailing. At first sight, they do not look so different, but I think the latter should be preferred because of the different axiological horizon. The former approach relies on the values that are deemed fundamental by national communities, while the latter one implicitly relies on the European Convention on Human Rights. So, it is characterized by an inclusive dimension which may lack in the former one, since fundamental national values may not be consistent with human rights (think of the case of Hungary). The second chapter is devoted to the principle of legality of criminal offences and penalties and takes into account five major issues: the interpretative incidence of EU directives in criminal matters (the prohibition of determining or aggravating the liability in criminal law and the duty of conforming interpretation); the interpretative incidence of EU regulations and frameworks decisions (the duty of conforming interpretation); the integrating incidence of EU law (how EU law shapes the meaning of national legislation); the disapplying incidence (in case national provisions are not consistent with EU law, with in bonam partem effects); the lex mitior principle. The analysis led to the conclusion that the principle of legality of criminal offences and penalties is not dead, as someone said, but has adapted to national and international realities which have changed. The third chapter deals with the principle of offensiveness and is divided into two parts. In the first part, an analysis is provided with reference to those judgments (Amsterdam Bulb, Commission v Hellenic Republic) in which the ECJ ruled that some legal interests which belong to the EU (above all, the financial ones) should be protected by the Member States under conditions, both procedural and substantive, which are analogous to those applicable to infringements of national law of a similar nature and importance and which, in any event, make the penalty <b>effective,</b> <b>proportionate</b> and dissuasive, in light of the principle of sincere cooperation. In the second part, recent judgments concerning criminal law and immigration law (El Dridi, Achughbabian, Sagor) are considered in order to show how the ECJ has questioned national lawmakers' choices which were inconsistent with the principle of sincere cooperation. The fourth chapter is dedicated to the principle of guilt and, more specifically, to six topics: The distinction between intentionally-committed and unintentionally-committed offences, the concept of intentional offence, the concept of negligence, strict criminal liability, Ignorantia legis non excusat, and the concept of force majeure. In the fifth chapter, the case law concerning the principle of proportionality is taken into consideration by highlighting how the ECJ has solved the cases in which a clash between national regulations criminal in nature and one of the four fundamental freedoms had occurred. It is quite interesting to notice that the solution given by the Court has always aimed at finding a balance point between the values at stake by identifying some conditions under which the four fundamental freedoms may be sacrificed. In conclusion, the gradual recognition of competences in criminal matters to the European Union is the result of the emergence of the political identity of the Union, since the creation of criminal law – both at the international and national level – requires the prior identification of a system of shared fundamental values, which are expressive of an identity. Some legal scholars, in analyzing the events and reasons for the failure of the draft European Constitution, spoke of the absence of a European people characterized by common ethnicity, culture, society and language. Such reasoning has been discussed among criminal law scholars for a long time with reference to European criminal law, since the unification of criminal law presupposes the cultural unification of Europe. The point is that, without assuming a world legal commonality, one can hypothise a European legal commonality. In my opinion, it is very convincing the reasoning of those who state that the foundation of human rights must be sought not – or not only – in the human nature, but also – and most of all – in the history and culture of peoples, considering, at least at the European level, the set of ideas and principles of the tradition of the old continent, through the reference to the Christian roots of Europe and the Enlightenment. So, those values already exist. Undoubtedly, the culture of the Europeans is the culture of human rights, and the lingua franca of Europe is the language of rights as declined in the Nice Charter and the European Convention of Human Rights. As demonstrated in the thesis, the jurisprudential experience of the Court of Justice has been mature enough to get to deal with the issues of protection of fundamental rights and, most of all, the protection of those rights through criminal law. The Court did so by progressively becoming aware of the nature of that branch of law – as explained in the first chapter – which has been considered not as a simple tool of repression, but as a means through which affirm and reaffirm freedoms. I believe that can reasonably be confirmed by turning the attention to the essence of the principles of legality, offensiveness, guilt, proportionality. As a matter of fact, they represent the limits to the use of criminal methods of repression, the observance of which leads to the outcome of legitimization and re-legitimization of criminal law, both at the national and international level; they indicate the existence of criminal awareness and sensitivity of the Court; they mark the road that will lead to the final result of the emergence of a criminal law of the European Union, made up of both a general part and a special part, both inspired, supported and controlled by those principles...|$|E
40|$|Exceeding speed limits, {{drink or}} distracted driving {{and failure to}} wear a seat belt are still the leading causes of death and serious injury on European roads. Despite {{legislation}} designed to prevent all four, many drivers involved in fatal traffic collisions clearly failed to comply {{with one or more}} road traffic laws {{at the time of their}} collision. Improvements in traffic law enforcement should be part of an integrated road safety policy and have been shown to lead to rapid reductions in deaths and injuries when applying best practice. Excessive or inappropriate speed is a primary factor in about one third of road deaths and an aggravating factor in many more. Speed enforcement will remain essential as long as the speed problem is not solved in a structural way by road design, engineering measures and in-vehicle technology. Efficiency of speeding enforcement is enhanced if the handling of fines for detected violations is largely automated. Efficiency is also higher if the vehicle owner and not the vehicle driver is held liable, since it is easier and faster to identify the owner than the driver. It is argued that speed enforcement is most appropriate on specific road stretches where collisions are concentrated. Such targeted action brings road safety benefits in the most dangerous road sections and makes it easier to explain the reasons of enforcement to the general public. In general, there appears to be an overall increase in speed offences detected throughout the EU, mainly due to the extension of safety camera networks, in particular in Central and Eastern European countries. Out of the 20 countries that could provide data on the number of speeding tickets issued over the period 2010 - 2015, the number went up in 12 countries, while 8 registered a decrease. The number of speeding tickets has increased on average by 14 % annually in Serbia, 10 % in Lithuania and Estonia, around 9 % in Poland, 8 % in Portugal, 6 % in Croatia and Denmark. All except two of these countries achieved better—than-average reductions in the number of road deaths over the same period. Serbia and Estonia have also reduced road deaths but not better than the EU average. The annual number of speeding tickets dropped in Sweden, the Netherlands and Finland, countries that have also witnessed some of the biggest slow-downs in reducing road deaths since 2010. Similarly, the UK and Germany have also seen a big slow-down in reductions of road deaths. In the UK, the number of tickets reduced after 2010 when the new government made cuts that affected enforcement levels; but ticket numbers have started to increase again. As many as 70 % of speeding offenders detected by safety camera do not receive a speeding ticket in Poland and Sweden and 29 % of all speeding offenders in France. It is highly possible that other EU countries are facing similar challenges to follow up and sanction automatically-detected violations, but the majority of EU countries are either not collecting the data or not making them public While drink-driving is relatively infrequent compared to other traffic offences, it is highly dangerous. It is estimated that up to 2 % of kilometres travelled in the EU are driven with an illegal Blood Alcohol Concentration but around 25 % of all road deaths in the EU are alcohol related. Out of the 14 countries that could provide data over the period 2010 - 2015, the number of alcohol checks increased in seven countries and seven registered a decrease. The number of alcohol road-side checks grew by 39 % each year in Poland, 24 % in Estonia and 12 % in Portugal. The number of alcohol checks dropped by 13 % annually in Sweden, 10 % in Cyprus and 5 % in England and Wales. Among the countries that could provide up-to-date data, police in Estonia, Poland and Finland are most active in the fight against drink-driving with respectively 677, 466 and 279 driver checks per thousand inhabitants in 2015. The number of checks are also high in Austria (189) and Slovenia (156). The lowest probability of being checked for drink driving is in Lithuania and Romania with less than one hundred in a thousand inhabitants being checked for drink driving per year. Research has shown that increased drink driving enforcement contributes to a decrease in drink driving deaths and injuries. Increases in the number of checks in 2014 and 2015 in Poland are starting to pay off. Despite the legal obligation to wear a seat belt across the EU 28, seat belt use in cars in the EU is estimated to be only 90 % for front seat and 71 % for rear seat passengers in countries that are monitoring wearing rates. ETSC estimates that 900 deaths could have been prevented in 2012 if 99 % of occupants had been wearing a seat belt, a rate that could be reached with seat belt reminders (SBR) on all car seats. Seat belt wearing rates are highest in Germany, Sweden, GB and Estonia with 98 % passengers in the front seat belting up. Seat belt wearing rates in front seats remain as low as 61 % in Croatia, 62 % in Italy, 74 % in Serbia, 82 % in Latvia and 83 % in Hungary. Disparities between countries are even bigger when it comes to wearing seat belts on rear seats: from 98 % in Germany and the Czech Republic to only 1 % in Croatia. Wearing the seat belt on rear seats is still exceptional in Serbia with 7 % rear seat passengers belting up, in Italy (15 %) and in Lithuania (33 %). The biggest increase in the last five years in rear seat belt wearing rates were recorded in Austria, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden. Despite the fact that the proportion of killed vehicle occupants who were not wearing their seat belt is disproportionately high, seat belt enforcement is not a primary target for the police in many EU member states. In some of them, it is still considered a minor violation that may not even be recorded or incorporated in demerit point systems. The number of tickets for failure to wear a seat belt is highest in Serbia and Romania with 25 and 24 tickets per 1000 inhabitants, followed by Croatia with 23 tickets per 1000 inhabitants and Slovenia with 20 tickets per 1000 inhabitants last year. Distracted driving is a growing problem in road safety. Data on how many collisions involve distraction is poor but experts estimate that it plays a role in 10 - 30 % of them. Studies also suggest that drivers using a mobile phone are approximately four times more likely to be involved in a collision than a driver not using a phone. There is a long list of distractions that undermine the driver’s or the rider’s ability to perform the driving task, but the use of mobile phones while driving appears to be widespread and growing. Police enforcement, combined with publicity campaigns, has the potential to reduce illegal use of a mobile phone while driving. But even though the phenomenon of using a mobile phone while driving is widespread, enforcement levels remain low. Out of 19 countries that provided data on the number of tickets for illegal use of mobile phone over the period 2010 - 2015, 8 countries saw an increase and 11 countries saw a decrease in the number of tickets. The number of tickets for illegal use of mobile phones increased by 22 % each year on average in Poland over the period 2010 - 2015, by 17 % in Croatia, 12 % in Serbia and 8 % in Greece. In contrast, ticket numbers have declined over the same period in the Netherlands by 22 % on average each year and by 20 % in Cyprus. More work is needed to improve the systematic collection of mobile phone use in collision data to assess the extent and distribution of a growing problem of driver distraction in countries. This will allow prevention efforts to be effectively targeted. According to the European Commission, non-resident drivers account for approximately 5 % of road traffic in the EU, but a foreign-registered car is around three times more likely to commit a traffic offence than a domestically-registered one. The proportion of offences by non-resident road users is difficult to evaluate as only Belgium, France, Hungary, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Poland and Spain have sent data. Offences committed by foreign-registered vehicles represented 13 % of all speeding offences detected by safety cameras over the period 2013 - 2015 in Poland. Differences in the proportion of non-resident drivers depend on the geographical position of the country (i. e. whether or not it is a transit country), the level of tourism in the country and the type of road section (international or local route). As many as 99 % of all offences committed by non-resident drivers detected by safety cameras were followed up in Hungary, 96 % in the Netherlands and 73 % in France. Only 8 % were followed up by the Lithuanian authorities in 2015, 11 % in Poland, 35 % in Spain and 41 % in France. Main recommendations to Member States: Set enforcement plans with yearly targets for numbers of checks and compliance with traffic laws, in particular addressing the priority areas of speeding, drink and drug driving, illegal use of mobile phone, red-light running, failing to wear seat belts, child restraints or helmets. Share those enforcement plans with the European Commission to facilitate the exchange of best practice on enforcement across the EU. Adhere to a ‘zero tolerance’ approach for enforcing priority areas of road safety legislation, as mentioned above. Run annual enforcement campaigns, coordinated with information activities involving other stakeholders, and making use of social media. Set up a transparent system for the allocation of revenues generated by fines and channel revenues from enforcement back into road safety work. Set up and implement a demerit point system which includes a set of fixed penalties for at least the eight major road safety related offences included in the Directive 2015 / 413 concerning cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences as recommended by the research project BESTPOINT. Participate in TISPOL cross border enforcement actions. 21 Collect and monitor the enforcement effort and the number of offences over time by violation type. Collect and monitor number of relevant fatal collisions in order to be able to evaluate progress against objectives in the enforcement plans. Publish the efforts (e. g. number of checks) and results (number of violations detected and sanctioned) of dedicated enforcement actions on the relevant police websites. Main recommendations to the EU: Within the context of the revision of Directive 2015 / 413 concerning cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences: Revise the Directive to strengthen the enforcement chain, including mandatory notification by the country of offence of the owner of the vehicle. In case of non-payment of fines, encourage member states to apply the Council Framework decision 2005 / 214 on the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. Recast the Framework Decision 2005 / 214 to include civil/administrative offences as this would provide an important final part in the enforcement chain. Publish best practice guidelines on enforcement and sanctions in the field of road safety and thereby encourage member states to achieve high standards on enforcement methods and practice and a greater convergence of road-safety-related traffic rules building on the EC Recommendation on Enforcement in the field of Road Safety. Promote sanctions that are <b>effective,</b> <b>proportionate</b> and dissuasive. Develop common minimum standards on enforcement equipment. Collect and publish EU countries’ enforcement plans to facilitate the exchange of best practice on enforcement across the EU and work towards developing a common road safety enforcement strategy as outlined by the Road Safety Policy Orientations 2011 - 2020 under Objective 2. Within the context of the revision of Regulation 2009 / 661 concerning Type-Approval Requirements for the General Safety of Motor Vehicles: Adopt legislation for fitting all new vehicles with an overridable assisting Intelligent Speed Assistance system. Extend the mandatory fitment of advanced seat belt reminders as standard equipment to all seats. As a first step towards wider use of alcohol interlocks, legislate their use by professional drivers and ensure that such a device can be fitted easily to all new vehicles through implementation of a standard interface.

We also maintain that without adequately addressing problems with access and affordability to content the problem of piracy will persist regardless of regulation. ACCAN’s submission will highlight the impact this Bill may have on consumers if it exceeds its intended scope and explore possible ways to make it fit for purpose. ACCAN notes that the Standing Committee on Infrastructure and Communications is currently dealing with similar concerns around website blocking. We believe much could be gained from reviewing submissions made to that Committee in developing policy targeted at curbing online piracy.

40|$|Background: Active {{surveillance}} for {{transmissible spongiform encephalopathies}} {{in small}} ruminants has been an EU regulatory requirement since 2002. A number of European countries have subsequently reported cases of atypical scrapie, similar to previously published cases from Norway, which have pathological and molecular features distinct from classical scrapie. Most cases have occurred singly in flocks, associated with genotypes considered to be more resistant to classical disease. Experimental transmissibility of such isolates {{has been reported in}} certain ovinised transgenic mice, but has not previously been reported in the natural host. Information on the transmissibility of this agent is vital to ensuring that disease control measures are <b>effective</b> and <b>proportionate.</b> Results: This report presents the successful experimental transmission, in 378 days, of atypical scrapie to a recipient sheep of homologous genotype with preservation of the pathological and molecular characteristics of the donor. This isolate also transmitted to ovinised transgenic mice (Tg 338) with a murine phenotype indistinguishable from that of Nor 98. Conclusion: This result strengthens the opinion that these cases result from a distinct strain of scrapie agent, which is potentially transmissible in the natural host under field conditions...|$|R

First, the debate about state sovereignty and human rights protection was presented and the relevant fields of research were defined.

However, whereas the issues are in common, the perspective is different.

40|$|This article {{looks at}} one of the {{potential}} {{for the establishment of a}} right to delete personal data. It asks whether a right to delete would be an appropriate, <b>effective</b> and <b>proportionate</b> tool in the context of personal data and if so what form should it take and what kind of an impact might it have. One version of the idea of a right to delete, the 'right to be forgotten', is of particular current interest: its mooted inclusion in the forthcoming revision of the Data Protection Directive has produced much debate and comment, some of it extremely negative, some emotional and some displaying both ignorance and misunderstanding. This article will argue that the right to be forgotten needs to be renamed and recast in order to address these negative reactions and the real concerns that underlie them. The article further argues that a qualified 'right to delete' should reflect a paradigm shift in attitudes to personal data on the internet: that the default should be that data can be deleted, and that those holding the data should need to justify why they hold it. This could help to shape a more privacy-friendly future for the internet, one that could provide a better balance between the needs to individuals for privacy, businesses for financial success and governments for security than currently exists...|$|R

40|$|Across Europe, the {{question}} of whether quotas should be enforced for the highest ranking corporate positions as a means to addressing gender injustice is under vigorous discussion. Much of the debate has focused on the Directive drafted by the European Commission in 2012, which would place an ‘obligation of means’ on listed companies to ensure that at least 40 % of non-executive directors (or 30 % of all directors) of each corporate board are female by 2020. In this policy brief, Jude Browne, Director of the University of Cambridge Centre for Gender Studies, assesses the three main objections to gender quotas on corporate boards, and seeks to overcome these objections by offering an alternative to EC policy {{in the form of a}} new proposal called the Critical Mass Marker approach. This new approach provides a mechanism for identifying situations in which a disproportionate number of women occupy positions at a certain level within an organization and yet the natural progression one might expect to see does not materialize — where there is, in other words, a ‘thwarted critical mass’. She argues that the Critical Mass Marker approach could prove a much more <b>effective</b> and <b>proportionate</b> response to gender imbalance in corporate boardrooms than EC policy, since it ensures that people who are equipped with the relevant skills and experience would be able to move up and across institutional structures, irrespective of characteristics such as race or sex. The effects of such a policy effort would also be felt much more widely than simply at the very top ends of organizations, instead benefitting workers across the whole of their employing institutions. Furthermore, the Critical Mass Marker approach offers a more nuanced and flexible way to tackle segregation patterns than blanket quotas aimed only at boards, and provides a clear objective for equality which requires specific actions. © The Foundation for Law, Justice and Society 2014.

40|$|Context and aims: Internationally, the {{repertoire}} of alcohol pricing policies {{has expanded to}} include targeted taxation, inflation-linked taxation, taxation based on alcohol-by-volume (ABV), minimum pricing policies (general or targeted), bans of below-cost selling and restricting price-based promotions. Policy makers clearly need to consider how options compare in reducing harms at the population level, but are also required to demonstrate proportionality of their actions, which necessitates a detailed understanding of policy effects on different population subgroups. This paper presents selected findings from a policy appraisal for the UK government and discusses the importance of accounting for population heterogeneity in such analyses. Method: We have built a causal, deterministic, epidemiological model which takes account of differential preferences by population subgroups defined by age, gender and level of drinking (moderate, hazardous, harmful). We consider purchasing preferences {{in terms of the}} types and volumes of alcoholic beverages, prices paid and the balance between bars, clubs and restaurants as opposed to supermarkets and off-licenses. Results: Age, sex and level of drinking fundamentally affect beverage preferences, drinking location, prices paid, price sensitivity and tendency to substitute for other beverage types. Pricing policies vary in their impact on different product types, price points and venues, thus having distinctly different effects on subgroups. Because population subgroups also have substantially different risk profiles for harms, policies are differentially effective in reducing health, crime, work-place absence and unemployment harms. Conclusion: Policy appraisals must account for population heterogeneity and complexity if resulting interventions are to be well considered, <b>proportionate,</b> <b>effective</b> and cost-effective...|$|R
40|$|Part {{of efforts}} to have Ireland tobacco free by 2025 Minister for Health, Simon Harris and Minister of State, Marcella Corcoran Kennedy today {{announced}} that the legislation for the standardised packaging of tobacco is to come into force in September 2017. This follows {{the signing of the}} commencement order today by Minister Corcoran Kennedy for the standardised packaging provisions of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015. The aim of standardised packaging is to make all tobacco packs look less attractive to consumers, to make health warnings more prominent and to prevent packaging from misleading consumers about the harmful effects of tobacco. The signing of this order means that all tobacco products manufactured for sale in Ireland from 30 th September 2017 must be in standardised retail packaging. There will be a wash through period allowed, meaning any products manufactured and placed on the market before the September date will be permitted to stay on the market for a 12 month period (i. e. until 30 th September, 2018). Standardised packaging means that: •	all forms of branding – trademarks, logos, colours and graphics – are to be removed from tobacco packs, •	The brand and variant names would be presented in a uniform typeface for all brands and •	the packs would all be in one plain neutral colour Minister Harris said “Smoking is a significant cause of ill-health in Ireland. Almost 6, 000 people die from tobacco related disease and tobacco use. That is 6, 000 families who go through the pain of losing a loved one when the stark reality is that these deaths are unnecessary and avoidable. It has been estimated to cost Irish society a total of € 10. 7 billion annually in healthcare, productivity and other costs. The Government is committed to changing that and standardised packaging of tobacco products is one such evidence-based measure that will assist in achieving our overarching goal of having Ireland tobacco free by 2025 ″. Minister Corcoran Kennedy said “The tobacco pack is the last advertising medium for the tobacco industry in Ireland and so is a critically important form of promotion. Standardised packaging is the next step in tackling the promotion and advertising of tobacco. There is strong evidence emerging from Australia, that introducing standardised packaging is both <b>effective</b> and <b>proportionate</b> in reducing the toll of tobacco use on the population. Research has shown that younger people are more influenced by brands. Ireland has the lowest age of children starting to smoke among all the EU Member States and almost 80...|$|R
40|$|The {{momentum}} behind {{development of}} global online fast track low value high volume dispute resolution (hereafter ODR) continues to accelerate. Consumer and business {{groups around the}} world are promoting fair, <b>proportionate,</b> <b>effective,</b> online, fast track redress for low value high volume cross border e-commerce disputes. As a result, there will continue to be increasing demand for a variety of effective ODR systems design and procedural rules. Best practices developed by entities like eBay and lessons learned from the work of UNCITRAL Working Group III can be helpful in developing framework models for fast track low value high volume e-commerce ODR systems. E-commerce ODR systems like eBay’s provide a marketplace for e-commerce as well as an electronic system for fast track resolution of disputes which arise on their e-commerce marketplace. Ordinary ODR systems do not provide an e-commerce marketplace but only provide for resolution of disputes. Accordingly, best practices developed by eBay’s e-commerce ODR system discussed in this article are generally applicable and needed by e-commerce ODR systems, but generally inapplicable and not needed by ordinary ODR systems. This article addresses development by eBay of its highly successful fast track low value high volume e-commerce ODR system by application of the following four best practices: (i) Low Value Parameters: Adoption of a generally applicable de facto low value workable monetary “standard” (for example, the Purchase Price “Money Back Guarantee” discussed infra) rather than a “numeric” (i. e. $ 15, 000) monetary description for disputes which are eligible for resolution on the providers’ platforms facilitates global development of fast track low value high volume ODR systems. A $ 15, 000, $ 10, 000 or $ 5, 000 monetary ceiling for low value disputes might constitute low value in a developed economy. It will not in an underdeveloped economy. Hence the need for a low value workable monetary “standard” rather than an unworkable “numeric” monetary description. As indicated, the eBay Purchase Price “Money Back Guarantee” cap on the amount of a permissible claim provides a workable standard in developed and underdeveloped economies. (ii) Limitation of Types of Claims: Leaving resolution of disputes involving high value and complicated legal issues to other forums, eBay’s fast track ODR eligibility requirements also limit the complexity and scope of permissible claims (i. e. claims eligible for resolution on its platform) by giving buyers a “Money Back Guarantee,” which, as noted supra, caps the amount a buyer may claim to recovery of purchase price paid, and also limits the types of claims to “Items not received” or “Items not as described. ” These limitations on the amount and types of claims permitted facilitate fast track and fair resolution of disputes and enables eBay to handle 60, 000, 000 e-commerce disputes annually averaging $ 70 -$ 100 in value. (iii) Buyers’ On-Demand Access to Automated Trustmark Evaluation/Feedback Information Needed to Identify Reliable Sellers: Vital to facilitating e-commerce between buyers and sellers, often {{in different parts of the}} world and speaking different languages, is developing trust between buyers and sellers to give them the confidence they need to enter into electronic transactions. eBay’s solution to developing this trust between buyers and sellers is the Automated Trustmark Evaluation/Feedback System. This system enables buyers involved in electronically purchasing low value high-volume items to quickly identify on demand a reliable seller without doing extensive research. Buyers seeking to make purchases using the eBay platform are able to assess the reliability of sellers with whom they anticipate doing business based on ratings and feedback derived from performance data supplied electronically by previous buyers after each transaction they completed on the eBay platform. (iv) Private Enforcement After discussing (i) Low Value Parameters, (ii) Limitation of Types of Claims, and (iii) Buyers’ On Demand Access to Automated Trustmark Evaluation/Feedback Information Needed to Identify Reliable Sellers, we address (iv) Private Enforcement measures available to enforce settled claims and rulings of neutrals to successfully implement fast track low value high volume e-commerce systems...|$|R
