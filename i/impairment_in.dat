The athletes are classified into three groups: group 1 is for athletes with no sitting balance or with major <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> both upper and lower limbs, group 2 is for athletes with some sitting balance and moderate <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> their extremities and athletes in group 3 have good balance and mild <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> their upper and lower limbs.|$|E

5|$|As a {{pervasive}} developmental disorder, Asperger syndrome is distinguished by {{a pattern of}} symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative <b>impairment</b> <b>in</b> social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language. Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided verbosity, restricted prosody, and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis. Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.|$|E

30|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} (PFC) is {{connected}} with nearly every cortical structure of {{the central nervous system}} [42] and is involved in nearly all aspects of human personality and cognition. The PFC has received much attention in the ADHD literature given a large body of research on <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> tests thought to tap PFC functioning [43, 44]. For example, the PFC has been implicated in complex behavior relevant to central <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> ADHD such as inhibitory control [45, 46], attention, working memory, and planning [42, 47]. Furthermore, specific differences within the frontal pole and orbital frontal cortex observed here may provide further evidence for <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> frontal limbic structures and emotional disorders which often co-occur in children with ADHD [48].|$|R
40|$|Many {{older adults}} develop {{restrictions}} {{in the performance}} of 				activities that are essential to daily living, referred to as 				functional limitations. Functional limitations can lead to 				disability, the inability to complete tasks necessary to 				function in society. A better understanding of how <b>impairments</b> 				<b>in</b> body systems affect functional limitations and disability in 				older adults could lead to improved medical management of older 				adults. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine how <b>impairments</b> 				<b>in</b> lower extremity muscle performance (strength, power, and 				endurance) are related to functional limitations and disability 				in community dwelling older adults. Thirty-four subjects were 				recruited to participate in this cross-sectional analysis study 				with 30 individuals completing the study. The Keiser 420 Leg 				Press was used to measure <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> lower extremity muscle 				performance. Functional limitations were classified through the 				Short Physical Performance Battery, the Six-Minute Walk Test, 				the Late Life Function and Disability Index (LLFDI) Functional 				Limitation Component, and average walking speed, average walking 				distance and average number of steps per day over a six-day 				period obtained from the AMP 331 physical activity monitor. 				Disability was measured through the LLFDI Disability Component 				Limitation Category. Regression analysis was used to examine the 				direct effect between <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> muscle performance and 				functional limitations. Mediation analysis was used to examine 				the indirect effect of impairments on disability. The results of 				this study support a relationship between <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> lower 				extremity strength and power to functional limitations and 				disability in community dwelling older adults. <b>Impairments</b> <b>in</b> 				lower extremity power consistently demonstrated a stronger 				relationship than strength to all measures of functional 				limitations and disability. The results of this study did not 				support a relationship of <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> endurance to functional 				limitations or disability. The overall findings of this study 				would indicate that community dwelling older adults should focus 				on maintaining and improving lower extremity strength and power 				across a range of relative intensities in order to decrease 				functional limitations and disability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide a critical overview of available instruments to assess <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> patients with rheumatic disorders, and to recommend reliable and valid instruments for use in allied health care and rehabilitation medicine. A com-puter-aided literature search (1982 – 2004) in several da-tabases was performed to identify studies focusing on the clinimetric properties of instruments designed to assess <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> function in patients with rheu-matic disorders. Data on intra-rater reliability, inter-rater reliability and construct validity were extracted in a standardized way. Explicit criteria were applied for reliability and validity. Results: The search identified a total of 49 instruments to assess <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> func-tions in patients with rheumatic disorders; 19 met the criteria for reliability, 22 met the criteria for validity, and 11 out of the 49 appeared to meet the criteria for both reliability and validity. In summary, evidence of both reliability and validity was only found for 11 out of 49 instruments for the assessment of <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> pa-tients with rheumatic disorders. Only a limited number of the identified instruments for the assessment of impairments is both reliable and valid.

Results indicated that when compared with healthy controls, individuals at familial high risk for schizophrenia {{were significantly more likely}} to overattribute emotions to neutral faces, with such individuals frequently misinterpreting neutral faces as negative. In addition, at-risk individuals had significantly greater reaction times when completing emotion recognition tasks, regardless of valence. <b>Impairments</b> <b>in</b> neurocognition were largely independent of social cognitive performance, and emotion recognition impairments persisted after adjusting for deficits in neurocognitive function. Further, social cognitive <b>impairments</b> <b>in</b> the interpretation of neutral faces were significantly associated with greater positive and general prodromal psychopathology, whereas neurocognitive impairments were only associated with disorganization.
