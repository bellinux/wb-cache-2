5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity of ski <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
5|$|Eric Stanley Lock {{was born}} in 1919 to a farming and {{quarrying}} family, whose home was in the rural Shropshire village of Bayston Hill. He was privately educated at Prestfelde Public School, London Road. On his 14th birthday his father treated him to a five-shilling, 15-minute flight with Sir Alan Cobham's Air Circus. Unlike most teenagers, Lock was unimpressed by <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> had soon lost interest. At 16 he left school and joined his father's business.|$|E

5|$|General {{aviation}} {{activities at the}} airport gradually increased. In the early 1960s, sailplanes became popular at the airport. The aerodrome is located with good wind and air pressure conditions for sailplane <b>flying,</b> <b>and</b> Oslo Flyklubb stationed two of its sailplanes at Tuven. Ronald Stensrud established a pilot school in 1966, but was forced to close after failing to make ends meet.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, Galland {{returned}} to operational <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> {{was permitted to}} form a jet fighter unit which he called Jagdverband 44. He flew missions over Germany {{until the end of}} the war in May. After the war, Galland was employed by Argentina's Government and acted as a consultant to the Argentine Air Force. Later, he {{returned to}} Germany and managed his own business. Galland also became friends with many former enemies, such as RAF aces Robert Stanford Tuck and Douglas Bader. Adolf Galland died on 9 February 1996.|$|E
5|$|In September 1933, Galland {{returned}} to Germany and flew in some minor competitions as a glider pilot, winning some prizes. Soon afterwards he {{returned to}} the ZVS to learn instrument <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> receive training in piloting heavy transport aircraft logging another 50 hours. As a part of his training, beginning in October 1933, Galland flew Lufthansa airliners. Flying the Junkers G24 from Stuttgart to Barcelona in Spain, via Geneva and Marseilles. In December 1933, Galland was recalled to the ZVS headquarters and offered the chance to join the new Luftwaffe. Galland found the choice hard as he wanted the adventure of a military flying career, but as an airline pilot, Galland had enjoyed the life style of <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> visiting exotic places and was reluctant to give it up. Nevertheless, he decided to officially join the Luftwaffe.|$|E

5|$|Richmond {{excelled in}} sports; {{he set a}} conference record in high hurdles and his high school {{football}} career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his gridiron days were over. Miami Military Academy named him Athlete of the Year in 1970. Richmond's other interests included <b>flying,</b> <b>and</b> he earned his private pilot license at age 16. Following high school graduation, Richmond attended Ashland University for about one year before dropping out.|$|E
5|$|The FIS 'race director' and 'jury' are a {{core team}} of {{personnel}} {{in charge of}} the entire event. Walter Hofer has been the FIS chief race director of ski <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> ski jumping events since 1992. Borek Sedlák, himself a former ski jumper, has been the assistant race director and second-in-command to Hofer since 2017. Spectators at the venue watching from large screen displays, as well as viewers watching on TV, are able to see instant replays and on-screen graphics provided by the FIS, which display a multitude of detailed information.|$|E

5|$|The Mount Washington Cog Railway ascends {{the western}} {{slope of the}} {{mountain}}, and the Mount Washington Auto Road climbs to the summit from the east. The mountain is popular with hikers (the Appalachian Trail crosses the summit). Other common activities include glider <b>flying,</b> <b>and</b> annual cycle and running races such as the Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb and Road Race.|$|E
5|$|The Operations Research Section (ORS) {{was also}} set up {{in light of the}} success of such {{programs}} in Fighter and Bomber Commands. Many scientists were appointed to the ORS Coastal Command. Some acted as advisors to Air Marshal Bowhill. Four sections were set up; planned <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> maintenance, ASO, A/S, and weather and navigation. Resources were spread evenly. However, A/S received more attention. The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and a certain degree of ascendancy achieved.|$|E
5|$|The RAF {{committed}} No. 3 Group RAF to the attack. Usually {{the group}} consisted of 9 Squadron, 37 Squadron, 38 Squadron, 99 Squadron, 115 Squadron, 149 Squadron together with 214 Squadron and 21 Squadron in reserve. However, the Group was hastily set up for daylight missions, having been intended for night bombing attacks. The quality of the training was dubious, many of the crews had not been given proper tuition for formation flying. Only 9 and 214 squadrons were able to fly in perfect formations. In an effort to improve formation <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> give crews experience of combat conditions, No. 3 Group's No. 37 Squadron practised mock combats with RAF Fighter Command Supermarine Spitfires from RAF Tangmere. Warnings were given by the Spitfire pilots {{that they could have}} decimated the squadron within ten minutes because of their poor formation <b>flying</b> <b>and</b> lack of fighter escort, but were ignored.|$|E
