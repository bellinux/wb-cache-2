He served as representative of the university at a Paris ecclesiastical council, 30 November 1413, which debated and denounced the arguments of theologian Jean Petit. During the same period, Crannach was a popular teacher of Scottish and other students at the university, but did not return there after January 1418 when he left for the papal court at Constance.|$|E
2500|$|A node may be {{the child}} of another node; in such a case, it becomes logical that {{multiple}} steps {{must be taken to}} carry out an attack. [...] For example, consider classroom computers which are secured to the desks. [...] To steal one, the securing cable must be cut or the lock unlocked. [...] The lock may be unlocked by picking or by obtaining the key. [...] The key may be obtained by threatening a <b>key</b> <b>holder,</b> bribing a keyholder, or taking it from where it is stored (e.g. under a mousemat). [...] Thus a four level attack tree can be drawn, of which one path is (Bribe Keyholder,Obtain Key,Unlock Lock,Steal Computer).|$|E

2500|$|Zionists linked Sokolow and Weizmann to Sykes. [...] Sacher {{tried to}} get the Foreign Secretary to redraft a {{statement}} rejecting Zionism. [...] The irony was not lost accusing the government of anti-semitism. [...] Edwin Montagu opposed it, but Samuel and Lloyd George favoured Zionism. [...] Montagu did not regard Palestine as a [...] "fit place for them to live". [...] Montagu believed that it would let down assimilationists and the ideals of British Liberalism. [...] The Memorandum was not supposed to accentuate the prejudice of mentioning 'home of the Jewish people'. [...] Weizmann was a <b>key</b> <b>holder</b> at the Ministry of Supply by late 1917. [...] By 1918 Weizmann was accused of combating the idea of a separate peace with Turkey. [...] He considered such a peace at odds with Zionist interests. [...] He was even accused of [...] "possibly prolonging the war".|$|E

50|$|Physical {{access control}} {{is a matter of}} who, where, and when. An access control system determines who is allowed to enter or exit, where they are allowed to exit or enter, and when they are allowed to enter or exit. Historically, this was {{partially}} accomplished through keys and locks. When a door is locked, only someone with a key can enter through the door, depending on how the lock is configured. Mechanical locks and keys do not allow restriction of the <b>key</b> <b>holder</b> to specific times or dates. Mechanical locks and keys do not provide records of the key used on any specific door, and the keys can be easily copied or transferred to an unauthorized person. When a mechanical key is lost or the <b>key</b> <b>holder</b> is no longer authorized to use the protected area, the locks must be re-keyed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of {{document}} signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document: The attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private <b>key</b> <b>holder</b> to sign the innocuous document.

50|$|The Internet of People graphchain stores {{information}} concerning both nodes (people's profiles) and edges (profile links or profile relationship links) of a graph. Nodes are identified {{by a public}} key and their information is controlled by a private <b>key</b> <b>holder</b> (profile owner). Edges represent relationships between the entities (people) controlling nodes. Certain relationships can only {{be added to the}} graphchain when they are signed by the private keys of both connected nodes.|$|E

They were passed from mothers to daughters as tokens {{of the responsibility}} women bear for ensuring the good management of household affairs. It was customary for families to celebrate special occasions by adorning their walls with the auspicious animal motifs that often were incorporated into the design of key charms.|$|R

50|$|Nodes {{are owned}} by their private <b>key</b> <b>holders</b> (people own their profiles) and the {{information}} stored can be modified only by signing with the respective private key (no one can modify a profile other than the profile’s owner). Edges are co-owned by the entities holding the private keys of the connected nodes (people can control the kind of relationships they have). The relationship type and conditions agreed upon when the relationship was established determine the possible actions co-owners can individually perform on edges' information.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{concerns}} surrounding {{the return of}} clinically significant results to research participants {{in the context of}} translational projects, P3G has developed the DataTrust (DT) service. This service supports the process of re-contacting participants and returning individual-level results in translational research projects, when appropriate. The DataTrust (DT) proposes to provide P3G as an honest and independent, third party broker to act as the <b>key</b> <b>holder</b> of personal information and associated unique ID (codes). P3G-DT safeguards the independence of the research project team, while enhancing ethical compliance with privacy and confidentiality standards in the research setting.|$|E

After an investigation, the Speaker concluded there was no information which justified regarding the events as a possible breach of Parliamentary privilege.|$|E

40|$|Quantum {{encryption}} {{is a well}} studied {{problem for}} both classical and quantum information. However, {{little is known about}} quantum encryption schemes which enable the user, under different keys, to learn different functions of the plaintext, given the ciphertext. In this paper, we give a novel one-bit secret-key quantum encryption scheme, a classical extension of which allows different <b>key</b> <b>holders</b> to learn different length subsequences of the plaintext from the ciphertext. We prove our quantum-classical scheme secure under the notions of quantum semantic security, quantum entropic indistinguishability, and recent security definitions from the field of functional encryption.
