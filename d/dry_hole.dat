25|$|Exploration boomed. By 1950, Alberta {{was one of}} the world's {{exploration}} hot spots, and {{seismic activity}} grew until 1953. After the Leduc strike, it became clear that Devonian reefs could be prolific oil reservoirs, and exploration concentrated on the search for similar structures. A series of major discoveries followed, and the industry began to appreciate the diversity of geological structures in the province that could contain oil. Early reef discoveries included Redwater in 1948, Golden Spike in 1949, Wizard Lake, Fenn Big Valley and Bonnie Glen in 1951 and Westerose in 1952. In 1953, Mobil Oil made a discovery near Drayton Valley, in a sandstone formation. By 1956, more than 1,500 development wells dotted what became the Pembina oil field (the largest field in western Canada) with hardly a <b>dry</b> <b>hole</b> among them, and the oil bearing Cardium Formation was dubbed the Cardium Freeway. The Swan Hills field, discovered in 1957, exploited a carbonate rock formation.|$|E
2500|$|Imperial's chief geologist, Ted Link, {{was among}} those who {{believed}} oil could be found at a much greater depth and had already met with success drilling at Norman Wells in the Northwest Territories. He had his staff determine the best location for the new well. [...] The majority of the team favoured a triangular area that stretched between Calgary and Edmonton in central Alberta, up to Grande Prairie in the northwest. [...] The company then set out to acquire surface lease rights to tracts of land in the region. [...] Imperial acquired rights to over 200,000 acres of land southwest of Edmonton by the end of spring and began surveying the area for the best place to begin drilling. [...] Seismic tests produced two possible candidates: one near the village of Leduc and another farther to the southwest near Pigeon Lake. [...] Though the Pigeon Lake spot was viewed by geologists as a more promising location, the team chose Leduc due to the location's proximity to major roadways and the North Saskatchewan River. [...] This decision proved fortuitous, as a later effort by Imperial to drill at Pigeon Lake resulted in another <b>dry</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
