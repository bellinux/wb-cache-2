40|$|A {{systematic}} {{soil survey}} of Belgium was conducted from 1948 to 1991. Field surveys were {{done at the}} detailed scale of 1 : 5000 with the final maps published at a 1 : 20, 000 scale. Soil surveyors were classifying soils in the field according to physical and morphogenetic characteristics such as texture, drainage class and profile development. Mapping units are defined as {{a combination of these}} characteristics but to which modifiers can be added such as parent material, stoniness or depth to substrata. Interpretation of the map towards predicting soil properties seems straight forward. Consequently, since the soil map has been digitized, it has been used for e. g. hydrological modelling or for estimating soil organic carbon content at sub-national and national level. Besides the explicit information provided by the legend, a wealth of implicit information is embedded in the map. Based on three cases, we illustrate that by decoding this information, properties pertaining to soil drainage or soil organic carbon content can be assessed more accurately. First, the presence/absence of <b>fragipans</b> affects the soil hydraulic conductivity. Although a dedicated symbol exits for <b>fragipans</b> (suffix “ [...] . m”), it is only used explicitly in areas where <b>fragipans</b> are not all that common. In the Belgian Ardennes, where <b>fragipans</b> are common, their occurrence is implicitly implied for various soil types mentioned in explanatory booklets. Second, whenever seasonal or permanent perched water tables were observed, these were indicated by drainage class “. h. ” or “. i. ”, respectively. Stagnic properties have been under reported as typical stagnic mottling – i. e. when the surface of soil peds are lighter and/or paler than the more reddish interior – were not distinguished from mottling due to groundwater gley. Still, by combining information on topography and the occurrence of substratum layers, stagnic properties can be inferred. Thirdly, soils with deep anthropogenic enriched organic matter (Anthrosols) are distinguished for their specific profile development (code “ [...] m”). Obviously, when assessing soil organic carbon content these soil types need particular consideration. Soils in the Campine region with anthropogenic layers only 30 to 40 cm thick, not being Anthrosols, got a specific suffix code (“... 3 ”). Still, as these soils may have a buried Ah horizon of up to 20 cm, their soil organic carbon content can be comparable to those of Anthrosols. The buried Ah horizon is however not explicitly mapped; its presence needs to be inferred from other environmental information. In conclusion, conventional soil maps convey more information than what transpires from just the explicit legend’s semantics. Although a challenge, decoding the implicit information should be particularly useful for spatial modeling. The cases also point to the importance of classifying soil characteristics explicitly, wherever possible, and in particularly when soil maps are integrated into geographical information systems.

50|$|Because {{the soil}} biomantle {{is the main}} zone of bioturbation, it is {{invariably}} permeable and of low density. It thus plays several essential hydropedological roles in the environment. For example, it promotes the downward percolation of rainwater and snowmelt through often-abundant biochannels and interconnected biopores. The biomantle also promotes downslope soil-water (throughflow, interflow) movements if it is formed above a clay-enriched Bt (argillic) horizon, or above some other dense subsoil horizon (e.g., duripan, <b>fragipan,</b> etc.) or bedrock - all of which generally function as aquitards or aquicludes to vertical soil water flow. In such cases the stonelayer, if present, can actually function as an aquifer for free water flow. Hence {{it is not uncommon}} to see soil water seepage above Bt horizons on slopes where soil stonelayers outcrop. Ground water recharge can occur through any of these biomantle-related processes. Recharge, of course, can also occur when the soil dries appreciably and shrinks, as during droughts, which allows vertical leakage to temporarily occur immediately after drought-breaking rainfalls.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fragipan</b> {{horizon is}} a natural, {{subsurface}} soil layer exhibiting higher bulk density and lower porosity {{in comparison with}} the overlying horizons significantly restricting infiltration of water and root penetration. In contrast to hard and cemented horizons (e. g. duripan), clods of the <b>fragipan</b> horizon (Btx) slake or fracture immediately when placed in water. The most interesting issue concerning genesis and properties of the <b>fragipan</b> horizon is its reversible cementation, i. e. very hard consistence in dry state and brittle consistence in moist state. The main objective {{of the present study was}} to explain and improve the understanding of the specific consistence of the <b>fragipan</b> horizon in moderately humid climate on the example of Albeluvisols of the Carpathian Foothills in Poland basing on mineral and chemical composition of bridges linking coarse soil material. Quantitative X-ray diffraction shows that the studied <b>fragipan</b> horizon contains high concentration of swelling clay minerals. Soil material from the <b>fragipan</b> horizon exhibits numerous clay and iron–clay coatings and clay infillings indicating translocation of colloidal clay and iron oxides from overlying horizons. In addition, bridges between coarse grains of the soil material occur. The <b>fragipan</b> cementing material is composed mainly of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and Fe 2 O 3 with lower concentration of K 2 O, MgO, CaO, and Na 2 O. The chemical composition of bridges within the pan is similar to that of clay coatings and clay infillings suggesting that clay minerals are major bonding agents and are responsible for brittleness and more friable consistence of the pan in the moist state. Additionally, free iron, aluminium, and silica may play some role in specific cementation of the investigated <b>fragipan</b> horizon but these elements are not main bonding agents...|$|E

40|$|Interpreting slope {{failure in}} the early Holocene has {{traditionally}} focused on climatic change. Little research considers the role of soil-profile characteristics, in particular the effect of <b>fragipan</b> occurrence. <b>Fragipan</b> formation {{has been associated with}} periglacial processes in northwest Europe, but recent evidence suggests that fully developed fragipans did not exist until 2000 - 3000 years after the close of the Lateglacial. Fragipans have been widely reported as having reduced permeability and altered soil moisture retention curves. The implications of such hydrological properties for slope stability is considered in this paper, by comparing stability of a soil profile containing a <b>fragipan</b> with one that is freely draining using a physically based soil hydrology-slope stability model. The results suggest differences in angles of limiting stability of 15 ° between the two soil profiles, while differences resulting from likely climatic variation are only 3 - 4 °. Modelling results of maximum stable slope angles for fragipans are consistent with those reported in the landscape, placing confidence in model outputs. This is used as a basis for suggesting that pedologic factors might be more significant than climatic factors when interpreting early Holocene slope instability. The potential utility of physically based modelling is explored more generally, and suggestions are made for future research to elucidate more fully the role of fragipans in slope stability...|$|E

Maximum rise of effluent in the standard and modified standard came within 11 and 19 cm of the soil surface, respectively. Performance of these systems indicates filter fields should be designed to function during climatic stresses, i. e. when the soil has a maximum hydraulic load and surfacing may occur. Filter fields should be designed to withstand a stress period of specified intensity. The filter fields {{in this study were}} observed under less than normal stress. Therefore, their long range performance is less clear. Our observations indicate that filter field performance is related more to rates of water movement than to stone content.

40|$|This PNVG is {{situated}} on {{second and third}} Pleistocene Terraces above larger drainages. Lower levels are flooded at varying frequencies. These terraces are often topographically flat. Clayey subsoils lead to formation of permanent and semi-permanent wetlands. Mima mounds are also present in some situations. The Deweyville Terrace Pine Flatwoods (DPFW) also lie within this type. Pine flatwoods generally occur on the middle and highest Deweyville terraces in the study area, on Guyton and Pheba soils. The lower (and younger) Deweyville surfaces that occur below 26 m (87 ft.) mean sea level (msl) are subject to Ouachita or Saline River flooding at least once every ten years, on average, but their wetland character is primarily maintained by precipitation. Above 26 m msl, precipitation is the sole source of wetland hydrology in the pine flatwoods. Guyton soils occur in units of 10 to 400 ha. These soils are level and poorly drained.

Eight soil profiles with spodic characteristics were collected and described in order to evaluate differences in the formation process of Barreiras and Restinga Spodosols in the South of Bahia. The soil profiles were also characterized chemically, physically and mineralogically. Additionally, texture and chemical analysis, Fe and Al extraction by sodium dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DBC), acid ammonium oxalate and sodium pyrophosphate, ammonium oxalate extract optic density (DOox), sulphuric acid attack, and X ray difractometry of the clay fraction were performed.

40|$|Plant {{growing in}} {{greenhouses}} and plastic tunnels has some advantages: obtaining early production, plant protection against hail, hoarfrost, late {{spring and early}} autumn frosts. The main criteria considered for setting greenhouses are the existence of heating and water sources. Due to the compulsory location imposed by the above conditions, many greenhouses were placed on soils having low capability. After application of ameliorative measures some satisfactory results could be obtained on a relatively short period. Our studies on some soils in greenhouses and plastic tunnels in Romania have shown that after 15 - 20 years of the intensive exploitation an impermeable soil horizon with brittle blocky angular structure aggregates was formed at depth of circa 25 - 37 cm. The formation of this horizon is due to some pedogenenetic factors excluding compaction by soil tillage. The impermeable horizon shows some similar features to a <b>fragipan</b> (dense and brittle pan) that have been identified both in acid, neutral and even slight alkaline greenhouses soils: (i) evidence of pedogenesis within the aggregates; (ii) firm or firmer rupture-resistance class and a brittle manner of failure when soil is moist; (iii) restrict the entry of roots into (inactive and etiolated roots are distributed only on the structural aggregates). Nevertheless, some properties are not similar with a typical fragipan: (i) the diameter of soil aggregates frequently is lower than 5 cm; (ii) the structural aggregates are brittle on the moist state but are not submerged in water.

40|$|In this paper, {{a set of}} physical, geochemical and mineralogical {{indicators}} are proposed for the correlation of soil age. The parameters studied allowed the highlighting of trends in soil aging {{as well as the}} relating of these trends to specific soil forming processes. Soil aging was marked by a progressive increase in clay content and a decrease in silt/clay ratio, a slight reduction in the CEC of clay and a striking increase in free iron content. Clay mineralogy transformation over time was marked by a progressive increase in kaolinite and vermiculite, as well as a decrease in illite and chlorite. The most outstanding pedological processes, i. e. crystalline free iron content increase, clay neo-genesis and illuviation, glossic horizon and <b>fragipan</b> formation, were all found to be related to kaolinite content. Element content, namely that of Fe, Cr, Pb, Zn, Ti and K increased from the Holocene to the Upper and Middle Pleistocene soil horizons and, as far as Fe, Cr, Pb and Zn are concerned, up to those attributed to the Lower Pleistocene. Al and Ca content decreased along with time, especially in soils older than Holocene. The trends of silt/clay ratio, CEC of clay and free iron were linear, that is not influenced by changes of weathering conditions during Pleistocene, while vermiculite and kaolinite content, total iron, chromium and lead distinguished the stronger weathering environment occurring during Lower Pleistocene in southern Europe.
