50|$|A {{substantial}} {{hand knitting}} industry {{is believed to}} have developed in Scotland by the late 15th century: bonnetmakers produced broad, flat knitted caps in <b>imitation</b> of the <b>velvet</b> caps popular amongst the upper classes of the time. Dyed with blue or grey vegetable dyes, they became popular with the peasantry {{and by the end of}} the 16th century - as noted by Fynes Moryson - the bonnet had been adopted nearly universally by men throughout the Lowlands, although it did not become widely worn in the Highlands until the following century. Martin Martin, writing around 1700, describes Highlanders as mainly wearing thick woollen bonnets of blue or grey. It was the bonnet's blue colour, as well as, perhaps, its Lowland and peasant origins, that influenced its adoption as a badge of the Covenanters, who used blue to distinguish themselves from their Royalist opponents and their red cockades and ribbons.|$|R
