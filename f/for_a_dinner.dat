5|$|By 1962, the American {{government}} was becoming increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dinner</b> for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that he might make use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.|$|E

25|$|In {{the role}} of the state personified, the monarch has worn {{clothing}} symbolic of the country and his or her distinct role in it. For instance, the gown worn by Queen Elizabeth II at both her coronation in London and the opening of the Canadian parliament in 1957 was decorated with the floral emblems of her realms, including maple leaves for Canada. During the same 1957 visit to Ottawa, the Queen also wore to a banquet held at Rideau Hall the Maple-Leaf-of-Canada dress; it was a pale green satin gown, edged with a garland consisting of deep green velvet maple leaves appliquéd with crysals and emeralds. Afterwards, the dress was donated to the Crown Collection and is now held at the Canadian Museum of History.

500|$|In {{his final}} years, Benjamin {{suffered}} from health issues. In 1880, he was badly {{injured in a}} fall from a tram in Paris. [...] He also developed diabetes.

His health improved enough to allow him to travel to London in June 1883 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dinner</b> in his honor attended by the English bench and bar. He returned to Paris and suffered a relapse of his heart trouble in early 1884.

Hopeful of a reconciliation, Mark assumes that his friends are trying to smooth things over between them. They spend the evening trying to keep Mark and Trevor apart, each not knowing that the other is also there. Episode five makes extensive use of what Moffat labels [...] "techno-farce", which uses technology, predominantly telephones, to facilitate the farcical situations. Moffat considers this episode {{the best of the}} show. Discussing the series as a whole, he feels that the story ends after this episode. It begins when Mark attempts to return Robert's [...] "portable telephone" [...] and ends with Robert threatening to shoot Mark after the latter has slept with Tracy.

500|$|The new {{material}} for the album saw her collaboration with a well-known producer David Foster, {{who had worked with}} the likes of Barbra Streisand, Al Jarreau and Earth, Wind & Fire. Foster recalled the first time Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg contacting him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dinner</b> with the singer: [...] "When Madonna first called, I was a little surprised—my music isn't really hip enough for her—but I guess her camp thought we should meet, and I got a call from Liz Rosenberg, the PR maven who has been with Madonna from the beginning." [...] Not long after the dinner, Madonna and Foster began the recording session in his Malibu studio. During the album conception, Madonna was also asked by her Bedtime Stories producer Nellee Hooper to collaborate with British trip hop group Massive Attack for a Marvin Gaye tribute album. Previously, the band had offered the collaboration to several artists, including Chaka Khan who rejected it. Madonna and Massive Attack covered Gaye's 1976 hit [...] "I Want You", which finished among the {{new material}} for Something to Remember and was also included on the [...] released by Motown Records.|$|E
500|$|Hearing of Sid Luckman's {{exploits}} as a single-wing tailback at Columbia University, Chicago Bears {{owner and}} coach George Halas believed Luckman {{had the ability}} to become an effective T-formation quarterback, and traveled to New York to watch him play. Halas then convinced the Pittsburgh Pirates (later the Steelers) to draft Luckman second overall and then trade him to the Bears because he was interested in using Luckman's skills to help him restructure the offensive side of the game. [...] However, despite his successes at Columbia University, Luckman initially declined any further interest in pro football, instead preferring to work for his father-in-law's trucking company. Halas went to work on convincing him otherwise. After gaining an invitation to Luckman's tiny apartment <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>dinner</b> which Luckman's wife Estelle prepared, Halas produced a contract for $5,500 ($ today) which Luckman immediately signed. [...] At that time both at the college and pro levels, offenses were a drab scrum of running the ball with only occasional passes. In what was then the predominant single-wing formation, the quarterback was primarily a blocking back and rarely touched the ball. Most passing was done by the tailback, and then usually only on third down with long yardage to go. Halas and his coaches, primarily Clark Shaughnessy, invented a rather complex scheme building on the traditional T-formation, but needed the right quarterback to run it properly.|$|E
