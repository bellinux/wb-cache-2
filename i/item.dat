5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an <b>item</b> depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon the <b>item</b> itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same <b>item</b> that needs repairs (or a comparable <b>item),</b> and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

The player can make Simon perform actions such as giving an <b>item</b> to another character, talk to another character, {{and pick up}} (add to inventory), examine, use, move, consume, wear, or open or close an <b>item.</b> Some actions are binary: they involve two objects and the player sometimes, after telling Simon to use an <b>item,</b> needs to specify what to use it with. A map that enables Simon to instantly transport to a major landmark (if it has been discovered) is provided. The postcard is used to load, save, or quit the game.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The primary {{objective}} of the present research, which investigated consumer behavior regarding the storage of clothing <b>items</b> no longer worn, {{was to develop a}} model that describes and explains the process of consumer clothing inventory management. Data were collected via in-depth interviews of twenty-two adult female and male informants. Guided by a moderately structured interview guide, informants displayed and discussed clothing <b>items</b> they wear and clothing <b>items</b> they no longer wear. For <b>items</b> they wear, informants explained how they feel while wearing them, as well as why they might stop wearing them and what they might do with the <b>items.</b> For <b>items</b> they no longer wear, but still have, informants explained how they felt while wearing the <b>items,</b> why they stopped wearing the <b>items,</b> why they still have the <b>items,</b> and how they would feel if the <b>items</b> disappeared. For <b>items</b> they no longer have, they explained how they felt while wearing the <b>items,</b> why they stopped wearing the <b>items,</b> how they disposed of the <b>items,</b> and how they felt about their disposal decisions. Data show that consumers’ clothing inventories can be categorized accordingly: active, permanent inactive, temporary inactive, invisible inactive, and transitional inactive. Within permanent inactive inventories were <b>items</b> that informants believed they would never dispose; such <b>items</b> often symbolized various connections and/or held hedonic value. Within temporary inactive inventories were <b>items</b> that informants believed they would eventually dispose; such <b>items</b> were often stored because informants were waiting to find future opportunities to use the <b>items</b> or the best disposal outlets. Occasionally, clothing <b>items</b> were invisible to informants, made so either unintentionally or intentionally. Clothing <b>items</b> within transitional inactive inventories were those <b>items</b> that informants had taken psychological and behavioral steps towards disposing of, yet still retained possession. Data collected were used to develop a Consumer Clothing Inventory Management Model. The model explains what causes consumers to store versus dispose of inactive clothing <b>items</b> and provides direction regarding the identification of ways to encourage consumers to pass inactive <b>items</b> on to others who can use them...|$|R
