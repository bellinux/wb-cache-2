Inside the MaGrid, single electrons travel straight through the null point, due to their infinite gyroradius in regions of no magnetic field. Next, they head towards {{the edges of the}} MaGrid field and corkscrew tighter along the denser magnetic field lines. This is typical electron cyclotron resonance motion.

50|$|One very {{important}} {{way to increase}} photographic sensitivity is to manipulate the <b>electron</b> <b>traps</b> in each crystal. A pure, defect-free crystal exhibits poor photographic sensitivity, since it lacks a shallow <b>electron</b> <b>trap</b> that facilitates {{the formation of a}} latent image. In such a case, many of the photoelectrons will recombine with the silver halide crystal and be wasted. Shallow <b>electron</b> <b>traps</b> are created by sulfur sensitization, introduction of a crystalline defect (edge dislocation), and incorporating a trace amount of non-silver salt as a dopant.

40|$|Abstract—SiO 2 /high-κ {{dielectric}} stacks {{will soon}} replace the conventional SiO 2 -based dielectric stacks in Flash memory cells, as {{the thickness of}} SiO 2 -based stacks is approaching its funda-mental limit. The <b>electron</b> <b>trap</b> density in high-κ layers is orders of magnitude higher than that in SiO 2, which may introduce ex-cessive leakage via trap-assisted tunneling current and become the limiting factor for the retention of memory cells. Understanding the properties of <b>electron</b> <b>traps</b> throughout the dielectric stack is essential for estimating the leakage current and for selecting materials and processes {{in order to reduce}} the leakage. However, detailed information on trap properties in the bulk of high-κ lay-ers is still missing. A recently developed two-pulse C–V measure-ment technique is used in this paper to investigate the energy and spatial distribution of <b>electron</b> <b>traps</b> throughout the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 dielectric stacks. Four energy regions of <b>electron</b> <b>traps</b> have been observed. The shallower traps mainly above the Si conduction band bottom ECB are found distributed across the Al 2 O 3 layer. A narrow band of traps below Si ECB with a bandwidth of about 0. 1 eV can be observed near the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 interface.

Dehmelt's autobiography: [...] "I began to focus on the magnetron/Penning discharge geometry, which, in the Penning ion gauge, had caught my interest already at Göttingen and at Duke. In their 1955 cyclotron resonance work on photoelectrons in vacuum Franken and Liebes had reported undesirable frequency shifts caused by accidental <b>electron</b> <b>trapping.</b> Their analysis made me realize that in a pure electric quadrupole field the shift would not depend on the location of the electron in the trap. This is an important advantage over many other traps that I decided to exploit. A magnetron trap of this type had been briefly discussed in J.R. Pierce's 1949 book, and I developed a simple description of the axial, magnetron, and cyclotron motions of an electron in it. With the help of the expert glassblower of the Department, Jake Jonson, I built my first high vacuum magnetron trap in 1959 and was soon able to trap electrons for about 10 sec and to detect axial, magnetron and cyclotron resonances.

50|$|We {{mention the}} {{theoretical}} calculation that incomplete ionization occurs whenever there is parallel resonant excitation into a common level with ionization loss. We consider a state such as 6f of Xe whidi consists of 7 quasi-degnerate {{levels in the}} range of the laser bandwidth. These levels along with the continuum constitute a lambda system. The mechanism of the lambda type trapping is schematically presented in figure. At the rising part of the pulse (a) the excited state (with two degenerate levels 1 and 2) are not in multiphoton resonance with the ground state. The electron is ionized through multiphoton coupling with the continuum. As the intensity of the pulse is increased the excited state and the continuum are shifted in energy due to the Stark shift. At the peak of the pulse (b) the excited states go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. As the intensity starts to decrease (c), the two state are coupled through continuum and the population is trapped in a coherent superposition of the two states. Under subsequent action of the same pulse, due to interference in the transition amplitudes of the lambda system, the field cannot ionize the population completely and a fraction of the population will be trapped in a coherent superposition of the quasi degenerate levels. According to this explanation the states with higher angular momentum- with more sublevels- would have a higher probability of trapping the population. In general the strength of the trapping will be determined by the strength of the two photon coupling between the quasi-degenerate levels via the continuum.In 1996, using the very stable laser and by minimizing the masking effects of the focal region expansion with increasing intensity, Talebpour et al. observed structures on the curves of singly charged ions of Xe, Kr and Ar.
