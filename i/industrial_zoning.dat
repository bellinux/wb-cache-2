5|$|Stadium Station is {{situated}} {{at the intersection of}} the SODO Busway and Royal Brougham Way, under the ramps of Interstate 90, in the SODO neighborhood of Seattle. The station is adjacent to a King County Metro employee parking garage, which includes a pedestrian bridge over the platform to the Metro Ryerson Base, and the Seattle Greyhound bus station. The area surrounding Stadium Station contains a mixture of light <b>industrial</b> <b>zoning,</b> primarily home to the manufacturing and warehousing industry employing over 13,000 workers, with some retail uses. CenturyLink Field and Safeco Field are located one block west of the station on the north and south sides of Royal Brougham Way, respectively. The light rail line is paralleled to the east by a mixed-use bicycle trail called the SODO Trail, which connects Stadium Station to SODO station at South Lander Street. The Seattle Department of Transportation plans to extend the trail further south to Spokane Street, connecting it to a bike trail on the Spokane Street Viaduct, serving West Seattle.|$|E

50|$|The Maritime <b>Industrial</b> <b>Zoning</b> Overlay District (MIZOD) {{was created}} in Baltimore, Maryland in 2004 to {{preserve}} deepwater access for port and maritime industrial uses. As waterfront residential and commercial development encroached on maritime industrial uses within the city, waterfront industries were finding it harder to receive loans from banks to upgrade and expand their operations. MIZOD is an zoning district overlaid across existing industrial zones along the water to allow only industries that use or need deep water access. The Overlay district was set to expire in 2014, but was recently extended to expire in 2024.|$|E

50|$|The District’s new zoning {{system of}} 1920 optimistically brought <b>industrial</b> <b>zoning</b> to the Point, {{followed}} by the 1929 National Capitol Parks and Planning Commission’s development planning report envisioning the area covered with railroad spurs and new large-scale manufacturing and utility uses that were unwelcome {{in other parts of}} town. This concerted effort destroyed what little was left of the old rural area without bringing in more than the railroad lines, the magnificent 1933 PEPCO power plant, and an oil/gas storage facility. Through the mid- and late-twentieth century these two major facilities and adjoining smaller ones mostly closed as new development loomed from the nearby Navy Yard area. Some boat yards and marinas maintained themselves on National Park Service-owned land along the Anacostia River.|$|E
50|$|Hard wood paving cobbles, {{that were}} {{originally}} used for roading {{on the waterfront}} of Auckland, were in the 1970s dumped on {{the eastern edge of}} the park in preparation to filling in a ramp that would carry a road through to Dominion and New North Road. One source states that the intention of the Auckland City Council was to build a fly-over the Park. Because of <b>Industrial</b> <b>zoning</b> there was an uneasy co-existence between industry and housing. This is alluded to in copies of Flash, the Grey Lynn, Westmere, Newton Community newsletter/newspaper, of the late 1970s when the reserve was to the southern edge of a wasteland of old housing that was deliberately allowed to decay so that the North Western Motorway could be put through without opposition.|$|E
5000|$|Salt Spring Coffee {{applied for}} {{rezoning}} of a residential lot on Salt Spring Island {{in the summer}} of 2008. The company wanted to relocate its offices and roasting facility into a new 1,115-square-metre building. Residents of the rural neighbourhood, including artist Robert Bateman, expressed concerns about the introduction of <b>industrial</b> <b>zoning</b> (a half-kilometre from Ford Lake) including: commercial and industrial sprawl along the main road, odour concerns, and emissions effecting a nearby protected wetland. An Islands Trustee has [...] "cited outstanding odour concerns, the large number of proposed covenants, and the threat of commercial and industrial sprawl in the rural neighbourhood as her main reasons for opposing the application."

The 243 -acre property is currently in operation as a gravel and sand operation and asphalt processing plant in Lenox Dale, north of Lee center. Identified {{as one of the}} largest <b>industrial</b> <b>zoned</b> parcels in New England, the Lane site has great economic potential in the future development of the town and the surrounding region. However, the site also presents significant environmental challenges including its location near sensitive natural resources such as the bordering Housatonic River and an underlying major aquifer. Consequently, future recommendations for the property will need to consider site-specific environmental issues as well as cultural issues such as the economic and recreational needs of Lee and the surrounding Berkshire County. Recommendations for the site also require sensitivity to the Town of Lee and the current proprietary conditions of Lane Construction Corporation...|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} sector to the municipality's economy is industry despite its decline {{since the very}} late 20th century. Industry accounts for about 72% of the municipality's production with commerce and services accounting for the rest. The industrial zone in Azcapotzalco {{is one of the}} {{most important}} in the Federal District. This zone is centered on Colonia Industrial Vallejo extending into San Salvador Xochimanca, Coltongo, Santo Tomas, San Martin Xochinahuac, Santa Ines, Santo Domingo, Ampliacion Petrolera, Industrial San Antonio, San Miguel Amantla, San Pablo Xalpa and San Juan Tlihuaca. Much of the industry has slowed or halted due to competition abroad which can make them cheaper. This has led to efforts to reorient the municipality's economy because of the high rates of unemployment and migration out of the area. About sixty percent of the Federal District’s heavy industry is in the municipality. The municipality accounts for about 40% of the Federal District’s <b>industrial</b> <b>zoning</b> and provides over 15% of industrial employment.|$|E
5000|$|For example, multi-family is {{not only}} {{permitted}} in [...] "higher order" [...] multi-family zoning districts, but also permitted in high order commercial and <b>industrial</b> <b>zoning</b> districts as well. Protection of land values is maintained by stratifying the zoning districts into levels according to their location in the urban society (neighborhood, community, municipality, and region). Euclidean II zoning also incorporates transportation and utilities as new zoning districts in its matrix dividing zoning into three categories: public, semi-public and private. In addition, all Euclidean II Zoning permitted activities and definitions are tied directly to the state's building code, Municode, and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) assuring statewide uniformity. Euclidean II zoning fosters the concepts of mixed use, new urbanism and [...] "highest and best use" [...] and, simplifies all zoning classifications into a single and uniform set of activities. It {{is relatively easy to}} make a transition from most existing zoning classification systems to the Euclidean II Zoning system.|$|E

5000|$|Outline Zoning Plans are the {{standard}} zoning maps adopted for {{different areas of}} the city. Land within these maps is divided into different zones denoting different land uses, like Residential, Commercial, or <b>Industrial.</b> A <b>zoning</b> like [...] "Residential" [...] can be broken down into different subtypes, to accommodate different types or intensity of residential development. The function of each zone is to specify which land uses may be permitted on the site.

40|$|In {{support of}} a modal shift towards rail for goods movement, a reconceptualization of urban and {{interurban}} mobility frameworks leads to the proposed infrastructural fitting for the urban periphery. Keller Easterling’s notion of Situating serves {{as a tool for}} engaging the serial aspects of the project territory in order to leverage widespread change. The intervention is born of the premise that while the ‘last mile’ of the supply chain must remain predominantly road based, the ‘second-last mile’ between concentrated distribution clusters is an opportune target for modal shifting initiatives. Towards this end the thesis envisions alternative, elaborated templates for distribution cluster design which optimize instrumental capacity as well as generate new performative possibilities through the conflation of productive, consumptive, and logistical activities. The hybridized type is demonstrated on a greenfield, <b>industrial</b> <b>zoned</b> site in the outer fringes of the Greater Toronto Area. Standard warehouse morphologies are retooled to serve the unfolding trends of agglomeration and just-in-time delivery while functioning as revolutionized, streamlined terminals of inland intermodal exchange. A unique urban condition is created where the freight-intensive logistics cluster interfaces a transit-supportive arterial corridor in the surrounding suburban fabric. Here, a thickened seam is developed to engage pedestrian-scaled experience, offer richness through surprising functional juxtaposition, and capitalize on the potentials for efficient local connections to regional distribution agents...|$|R
50|$|The Marcellus Shale Law (House Bill 1950) {{was signed}} on February 14, 2012, by Governor Tom Corbett. Despite {{warnings}} from the EPA {{about the safety}} of wastewater, the law changed the zoning laws applicable to Marcellus Shale Well Drilling. The law was slated to take effect in April 2012, but legal challenges from a growing group of Pennsylvania municipalities and organizations led Commonwealth Senior Judge Keith Quigley to order that the implementation of parts of Act 13 be delayed for 120 days. Some of its provisions are that all municipalities must allow Marcellus Shale well drilling (in all zoning districts, including residential and may not limit hours of operation), water and wastewater pits (in all zoning district, including residential), compressor stations (in industrial and agricultural zoning districts and may not limit hours of operation), gas processing plants (in <b>industrial</b> <b>zoning</b> districts and cannot limit hours of operation), and gas pipelines (in all zoning districts, including residential). The law helped pave the way for a new pipeline across Pennsylvania to export terminals in Maryland.|$|E

40|$|Competing risks {{survival}} analysis is used to investigate tax and zoning policy impacts on residential, commercial, and industrial development timing in a rapidly growing Midwestern county. Industrial development appears both to precede and occur concurrently with residential development, while commercial development follows other types. Although residences appear to locate away from <b>industrial</b> land, <b>zoning</b> decisions favoring industry may attract rather than deter residential development within a jurisdiction. Regions with higher infrastructure taxes experience development later. Because school taxes fund local public goods important to homeowners, they have little influence on residential timing, but strong influences on industrial and commercial timing.
