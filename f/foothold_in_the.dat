5|$|Stuart {{ended his}} 18-year stay in Britain and Ireland in 1793, leaving behind {{numerous}} unfinished paintings. He {{returned to the}} United States and settled briefly in New York City. In 1795, he moved to Germantown, Pennsylvania, near (and now part of) Philadelphia, where he opened a studio. It was here that he gained a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> art world and lasting fame with pictures of many important Americans of the day.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{now that}} the Greeks (and {{therefore}} {{the rest of the}} region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Greek world, and divided the Kingdom of Macedonia into four client republics. Yet, Macedonian agitation continued. The Fourth Macedonian War, 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilizing Greece by trying to re-establish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the Second battle of Pydna.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 Juan Cutillas, {{selected}} four Spanish {{players and}} one Chinese {{in an effort}} to boost the Philippine national team. The national team joined the tournaments such as the Pestabola Merdeka, Pesta Sukan, Jakarta Anniversary Tournamentp and the President Park Tournament. The Philippines managed to cause upsets results against Thailand, Singapore and South Korea. When the Spanish players, Tomas Lozano, Mannuel Cuenca, Juan Guitierrez and Julio Roxas left the football team due to financial reasons, football in the country saw another decline and basketball gained <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
25|$|Byzantium also {{incurred}} {{substantial loss}} of territory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, to the Serbs, {{as well as}} losing its final <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Italy, to <b>the</b> Normans.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> same period, the Sicilian Muslims also {{established}} <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Italian mainland. The Muslims {{were asked to}} assist the beleaguered Duchy of Naples against Sicard of Benevento in 839, but then they sacked Brindisi and, following Sicard's murder and the outbreak of civil war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Principality of Benevento, seized Tarentum in 840 and Bari in 847, which they made their bases. Until well into the 880s, the Muslims would launch destructive raids along the coasts of Italy and into the Adriatic Sea from their bases on the Italian mainland — most notably from the Emirate of Bari, until its destruction in 871.|$|R
25|$|Whether Assad stays or goes, jihadism now has {{a strong}} <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Syria. <b>The</b> Free Syrian Army may wish to dismiss its al-Qaeda allies as {{irrelevant}} in order to reassure the West and continue receiving Western support, but the jihadi websites and footage of al-Qaeda fighting in Damascus and Aleppo tell a different story.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{defenses}} were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> steppe transitional zone. Despite the {{withdrawal from the}} steppe, the Ming military remained in a strong position against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused {{the collapse of the}} early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed and given pause to the Mongols {{since the beginning of the}} dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after.|$|E
5|$|Nathu La {{played a}} vital role in the 1903–1904 British {{expedition}} to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet.|$|E
5|$|The Sunbeam was {{originally}} conceived by Chrysler as a stopgap model, developed {{to keep the}} Linwood works running—it {{was based on the}} running gear of the earlier Avenger made there—while helping the company to maintain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing small car market. Aware that a more modern design was needed to compete with upcoming front-wheel drive rivals, Chrysler undertook some development work on a shortened version of the Chrysler Horizon (which had the development code C2), dubbed C2-short, but it was cut short by the company's financial problems and plans to divest Chrysler Europe.|$|E
2500|$|The Reserve Army {{was ordered}} to return to trench warfare and X Corps to push forward, from its <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German front line. On 4 July, German artillery-fire fell on the X Corps area, {{followed}} by bombing attacks on <b>the</b> 25th Division <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Leipzig Salient and against the 49th Division further north which failed, as did raids during the night by the 49th Division. At [...] on 5 July, the 25th Division attacked on a [...] front at the Leipzig Salient; the 1st Battalion Wiltshire Regiment of the 7th Brigade got a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Hindenburg Trench, then repulsed a determined counter-attack. Early on 7 July a German attack by two companies of the 3rd Guard Division a company of Infantry Regiment 185 and four more attacked the 49th Division positions north of Thiepval, recaptured the last positions taken by the 36th Division on 1 July.|$|R
2500|$|Judging by archaeological finds, Christianity {{gained a}} <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Finland during <b>the</b> 11th century.

5|$|Several {{street gangs}} operate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bay Area, {{including}} the Sureños and Norteños in San Francisco's Mission District. African-American street gangs familiar in other cities, including the Crips, {{have struggled to}} establish <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city, although gangs with shotcallers in China, including Triad {{groups such as the}} Wo Hop To, have been reported active. In 1977, an ongoing rivalry between two Chinese gangs led to a shooting attack at the Golden Dragon restaurant in Chinatown, which left five people dead and eleven wounded. Five members of the Joe Boys gang were arrested and convicted of the crime. Oakland, which also sees organized gang violence, implemented Operation Ceasefire in 2012 in an effort to reduce the violence.|$|R
5|$|The game sold a {{total of}} 300,000 units for the ZX Spectrum and {{generated}} £1 million in revenue for Ultimate Play the Game, which enabled the Stamper brothers to gain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early video gaming market. After the game's release, Jetpac was parodied in a long-running Crash comic strip named Lunar Jetman. The strip, designed by John Richardson, lasted from July 1984 to October 1991 and gained popular reception from readers. To develop the comic, photographs had to be processed manually on a photo-mechanical tone and then transferred to paper, later being fully colourised in the late 1980s.|$|E
5|$|After {{studying}} {{architecture and}} then drama, Cartier {{began his career}} as a screenwriter and then film director in Berlin, working for UFA Studios. After a brief spell in the United States he moved to the United Kingdom in 1935. Initially failing to gain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British film industry, he began working for BBC Television in the lae 1930s (among other productions he was involved in the making of Rehearsal for a Drama, BBC 1939). The outbreak of war, however, meant that his contract was terminated; his television play The Dead Eye was stopped in the production stage. After the war, he occasionally worked for British films before he was again hired by the BBC in 1952. He soon became one of the public service broadcaster's leading directors and went on to produce and direct over 120 productions in the next 24 years, ending his television career with the play Loyalties in 1976.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} {{attempting}} {{to gain a}} <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acting industry, Merryman worked simultaneously {{as a model for}} lingerie, and a waitress, and was featured in Playboy. The show chronicled her audition process for a horror film, and a role in the television soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful. She successfully landed a role during Desperately Seeking Stardom, on the television show Baywatch. Merryman subsequently gained a part on the television series Veronica's Closet. In 2000, Merryman was selected for a photo shoot by American photographer Mark Daughn; her pictures were used to advertise the Internet company Bomis. Daughn's photographs of Merryman also appeared in Mystique Magazine in January 2003, alongside models including: Aria Giovanni, Sunny Leone, Lisa Marie Scott, Natasha Yi, and Kalin Olson. She was featured in the book Mystique: Models of Mystique in the same year, photographed by Daughn.|$|E
50|$|A {{monopolist}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highly profitable saltpetre trade (one of {{the most}} important commodities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> export list of the European companies) since 1753, this Armenian merchant conducted most of the negotiations between the Company and Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah. Conducting his trading from Hugli, he dominated the commercial scene of Bangal as one of the merchant princes along with Mahtab Chand and Sawaroop Chand known as the two Jagat Sayts (bankers of the world), as well as Omichand. Son of Khojah Mahmet Fazel, an influential Armenian merchant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid 18th century, he obtained <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> durbar of the Nawab as a vakil for his community in 1740s and eventually rose {{to be a member of}} the Nawab's inner-circle.|$|R
50|$|Ice {{hockey is}} the fourth leading {{professional}} team sport. Always a mainstay of Great Lakes and New England-area culture, the sport gained tenuous <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> regions like <b>the</b> American South since the early 1990s, as the National Hockey League pursued a policy of expansion.|$|R
40|$|Late Mover Also {{called a}} late {{follower}} or a later market entrant, a late mover is {{a firm that}} enters a market some time after both the market pioneer(s) and after early follower firms. While there are no set guidelines <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> passage of chronological time that clearly differentiate late movers from early movers, it is generally acknowledged that late-mover firms enter markets characterized by significant numbers of existing competitors and, as such, the markets are often relatively mature in terms of growth rate. Kodak, for example, was labeled a very late mover <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inkjet printer market when the company decided to enter this market with its own brand of inkjet printer many years after numerous other firms had established strong <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market...|$|R
5|$|From the 10th century BC onwards, Assyria {{fought for}} control of the {{southern}} Levant. Frequently, cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aid in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army. Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Near East. Taharqa aided the Judean King Hezekiah when Hezekiah and Jerusalem was besieged by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem. Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to divine intervention to surrender to disease. Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years). Some argue that disease was the primary reason for failing to actually take the city; however, Senacherib's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's defeat {{also changed}} the {{religious}} {{balance in the}} northwestern states. Although the Peace of Augsburg (1555) had addressed earlier the problem of religious pluralism, the solution potentially converted simple, and usually local, legal disputes into dynastic and religious warfare, as the Cologne War itself demonstrated. The result of the Cologne War gave the Counter Reformation a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower Rhine. Ernst {{was a product of}} Jesuit education. Once his position was secured, he invited Jesuits into the territory to help re-establish Catholicism, a task which the Order approached zealously. They ejected Protestant pastors from parishes, sometimes by force, and re-established catechism education and pastoral visitations. Even when communities appeared to be reconverted, the Jesuits maintained strict supervision to identify recalcitrant Protestants or backsliders. The Jesuit reintroduction of Catholicism postponed the solution of Germany's religious problems for another half century.|$|E
5|$|Italy began {{operations}} in the Mediterranean, initiating a siege of Malta in June, conquering British Somaliland in August, and making an incursion into British-held Egypt in September 1940. In October 1940, Italy started the Greco-Italian War because of Mussolini's jealousy of Hitler's success but within days was repulsed with few territorial gains and a stalemate soon occurred. The United Kingdom responded to Greek requests for assistance by sending troops to Crete and providing air support to Greece. Hitler decided that when the weather improved he would take action against Greece to assist the Italians and prevent the British from gaining a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Balkans, to strike against the British naval dominance of the Mediterranean, and to secure his hold on Romanian oil.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} get a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match after 30 minutes, their best chance came in the 36th minute when a shot by Murphy went over the crossbar. Three minutes later, their {{approach}} paid off as they scored. A long-range shot from Steven Gerrard deflected off United midfielder David Beckham and into the United goal to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Three minutes after the goal, United {{had a chance to}} equalise: A shot by midfielder Juan Sebastián Verón was saved by Dudek, but the ball rebounded to Scholes, but his subsequent shot was blocked by Henchoz. After a free-kick by Beckham just before half-time was saved by Dudek, Liverpool counter-attacked through midfielder El Hadji Diouf down the right-hand side of the pitch, though his subsequent cross into the penalty area was intercepted by Keane.|$|E
5|$|Trucks {{were first}} used {{extensively}} {{by the military}} during World War I. With the increase in construction of paved roads, trucking began to achieve a significant <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. Public safety concerns made it necessary to implement various government regulations (such as the 1965 hours of service rule; recently revised with a compliance date of July 1, 2012) of how long drivers were allowed to work and drive each day/week. In 1956, Taxpayers provided funds to build the Interstate Highway System, an extensive network of highways and freeways that linked major cities across the continent. The addition of Interstate Highway System also {{made it possible for}} the trucking industry to grow substantially in the late 1950s and early 1960s and trucking has come to dominate the freight industry in the latter portion of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Worldwide Saturn sales include {{at least}} the {{following}} amounts in each territory: 5.75 million in Japan (surpassing the Genesis' sales of 3.58 million in the country), 1.8 million in the United States, 1 million in Europe, and 530,000 elsewhere. With lifetime sales of 9.26 million units, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure, although its install base in Japan surpassed the Nintendo 64's 5.54 million. Lack of distribution has been cited as a significant factor contributing to the Saturn's failure, as the system's surprise launch damaged Sega's reputation with key retailers. Conversely, Nintendo's long delay in releasing a 3D console and damage caused to Sega's reputation by poorly supported add-ons for the Genesis are considered major factors allowing Sony to gain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the archaeological}} finds, Christianity gained a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Finland during <b>the</b> 11th century. According {{to the very}} few written {{documents}} that have survived, <b>the</b> church <b>in</b> Finland was still in its early development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12th century.

25|$|The late 19th {{century had}} {{a huge impact on}} {{developments}} occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Horn of Africa.

25|$|Later that year, South African Airways made a {{successful}} {{bid for a}} 49% stake <b>in</b> Air Tanzania. <b>The</b> move highlighted SAA's wish to gain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> eastern Africa. <b>The</b> bid was worth $20million, and was SAA's first acquisition of a foreign airline. <b>The</b> merger failed <b>in</b> 2006 when new SAA management felt that the arrangement was fruitless.|$|R
5|$|Bad {{weather in}} Turin created doubt {{about whether the}} match could be completed. However, the referee {{decided to go ahead}} with the match. Liverpool were without striker Kenny Dalglish who was suspended. Liverpool {{struggled}} to gain a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match in the first half and were behind when Juventus scored in the 40th minute. A mishit pass by Massimo Briaschi found Zbigniew Boniek whose subsequent shot from the edge of the Liverpool penalty area beat goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar to give Juventus a 1–0 lead. Liverpool had a chance to equalise before the end of the first half, but midfielder John Wark put his shot wide of the Juventus goal. Liverpool started the second half without defender Mark Lawrenson who had injured himself during the first half, he was replaced by Gary Gillespie. Liverpool tried to level the match in the second half, but their best chances came from midfielder Ronnie Whelan whose shots from distance did not result in any goals. Juventus extended their lead late in the second half when Boniek scored again. A cross from Briaschi found Boniek, whose shot beat Grobbelaar to extend Juventus' lead to 2–0. Five minutes later, Juventus nearly extended their lead again. However, striker Paolo Rossi's shot was saved by Grobbelaar. Juventus held onto their lead to win the match 2–0 and win the Super Cup.|$|E
5|$|European attitudes {{began to}} change in the mid-1260s, from perceiving the Mongols as enemies to be feared, to {{potential}} allies against the Muslims. The Mongols sought to capitalize on this, promising a re-conquered Jerusalem to the Europeans in return for cooperation. Attempts to cement an alliance continued through negotiations with many leaders of the Mongol Ilkhanate in Persia, from its founder Hulagu through his descendants Abaqa, Arghun, Ghazan, and Öljaitü, but without success. The Mongols invaded Syria several times between 1281 and 1312, sometimes in attempts at joint operations with the Franks, but the considerable logistical difficulties involved meant that forces would arrive months apart, never able to coordinate activities in any effective way. The Mongol Empire eventually dissolved into civil war, and the Egyptian Mamluks successfully recaptured all of Palestine and Syria from the Crusaders. After the Fall of Acre in 1291, the remaining Crusaders retreated to the island of Cyprus. They made a final attempt to establish a bridgehead at the small island of Ruad off the coast of Tortosa, again in an attempt to coordinate military action with the Mongols, but the plan failed, and the Muslims responded by besieging the island. With the Fall of Ruad in 1302 or 1303, the Crusaders lost their last <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed the Greeks to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, the Greeks selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shipbuilding market. The Greeks, for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E
50|$|A ditch {{partially}} {{filled with}} water surrounded Fort Gregg. After crossing a field of deadly fire to reach the fort, many of the attackers ran into the ditch only to be mired in water and mud. Wounded men risked drowning unless helped out of the water. Soldiers of the 67th Ohio Infantry Regiment reached the ditch first but could not work their way around to the rear entrance due to <b>the</b> water <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ditch. The 62nd Ohio Infantry Regiment lost many men in their advance and struggled to gain <b>footholds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> muddy ditch to climb the parapet. Colonel Dandy's brother, Major James H. Dandy, commanding the 100th New York Infantry Regiment, was killed {{trying to reach the}} rear of the fort.

50|$|Christianity {{gained a}} <b>foothold</b> <b>in</b> Finland during <b>the</b> 11th century. The oldest churches and chapels were built of wood, which {{remained}} {{the most common}} material until the late 19th century.
