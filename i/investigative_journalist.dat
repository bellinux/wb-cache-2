5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The <b>investigative</b> <b>journalist</b> Brian Toohey ran a series of stories in the Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E

40|$|Title: “Så här har vi gått tillväga” – En kvalitativ studie av hur svenska undersökande journalister förhåller sig till transparens Authors: Michael Larsson and Rasmus Lygner Subject: Undergraduate {{research}} paper in journalism studies, Department of journalism, media and communication (JMG), University of Gothenburg Term: Fall 2016 Supervisor: Nicklas Håkansson, JMG, University of Gothenburg Pages/words: 54 pages/ 19 485 words (including abstract and appendix) Purpose: The {{main purpose of}} the study is to examine how Swedish <b>investigative</b> <b>journalists</b> relate to the notion of transparency and apply it in their everyday work routine. Method: Qualitative in-depth interviews with Swedish <b>investigative</b> <b>journalists.</b> Procedure: Seven interviews with <b>investigative</b> <b>journalists</b> were transcribed and analyzed using Erving Goffman’s dramaturgical perspective, Michael Karlsson’s rituals of transparency and professional theory. Results: The results of the study show that although transparency have not been accepted as a new occupational norm by all <b>investigative</b> <b>journalists,</b> it affects their relationship with the audience and way of working. Transparency was associated {{with a wide variety of}} practices employed by <b>investigative</b> <b>journalists</b> – such as making source material public, getting the public involved in the news process or using transparency as a form of storytelling – and regarded as a way to enhance credibility with audiences. Furthermore, in some cases transparency was described as increasing self-regulation among <b>investigative</b> <b>journalists</b> and being in conflict with the confidentiality of sources...|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly of cocaine. In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, <b>investigative</b> <b>journalist</b> Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Finch's successes have aroused media {{attention}}— in particular, {{the attention}} of <b>investigative</b> <b>journalist</b> Sarah Jane Smith. While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance (but is barely able to restrain his pleasure at seeing her again), when Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS during the night, he reveals his identity to her. Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. As the group searches the school, they find thirteen bat-like creatures asleep in Finch's office. Returning to Sarah Jane's car, the journalist reveals a battered, inactive K9 Mark III, who—once repaired—identifies the chip oil as Krillitane oil. Rose, unaware that the Doctor had even had past companions, confronts him; he replies sadly that, while she can {{spend the rest of}} her life with him, he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, so he must remain aloof.|$|E
