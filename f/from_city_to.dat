5|$|After Bara's {{contract}} with Fox ended, Woods approached her about appearing in a play. She had performed on stage {{early in her}} career, working with touring companies and in summer stock, but had not performed on Broadway. Bara told a reporter that she was offered a few scripts to consider, and chose The Blue Flame (at that time titled The Lost Soul) because it allowed her to play {{two versions of the}} character, one good and the other bad. She also hoped moving to the stage would bring her new career opportunities. Woods gave Bara a lucrative contract. Each week she received a salary of $1500. This was considerably less than the $4000 per week she had earned in her last year with Fox, but Bara was also promised half the production's net profits. For example, the play's two-week run in Boston netted Bara $10,700. Woods also provided a finely appointed private railroad car to take her <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city when the show toured.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1877, {{tensions}} erupted in stoppages and civil unrest across the nation in what would {{become known as the}} Great Railroad Strike or simply the Great Strikes. Violence began in Martinsburg, West Virginia and spread along the rail lines through Baltimore and on to several major cities and transportation hubs of the time, including Reading, Scranton and Shamokin, Pennsylvania; a bloodless general strike in St. Louis, Missouri; and a short lived uprising in Chicago, Illinois. In the worst case, rioting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania left 61 dead and 124 injured. Much of the city's center was burned, including more than a thousand rail cars destroyed. What began as the peaceful actions of organized labor attracted the masses of working discontent and unemployed of the depression, along with others who took opportunistic advantage of the chaos. In total, an estimated 100,000 workers participated nationwide. State and federal troops followed the unrest as it spread along the rail lines <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city, beginning in Baltimore, where the movement of troops itself provoked a violent response that ultimately required federal intervention to quell.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{structure}} of institutions can be vary <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city.

Again, all these agencies are supervised by the PSBs of higher level.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} moving <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city was mainly political. Although his {{experiment}} was short-lived, Frederic successfully {{created the first}} modern state in Europe, run by an efficient bureaucracy: its members were neither appointed from the aristocracy nor the clergy with good reason, since the former were far more interested in defending their own privileges than {{the welfare of the}} country and often plotted against him in the hope of regaining their power, while the latter were basically faithful to the Pope, his biggest enemy.|$|E

In 1946 he became an American citizen. Unlike the European phase of his life, where he moved <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city every few years, in the United States Debye remained at Cornell for the remainder of his career. He retired in 1952, but continued research until his death.|$|E

25|$|Marius Petipa {{spent his}} early {{childhood}} traveling throughout Europe with his family, as his parents' professional engagements took them <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city. By the time Marius {{was six years}} old, his family had settled in Brussels {{in what was then}} the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where his father was appointed Maître de ballet and Premier danseur to the Théâtre de la Monnaie. The young Marius received his general education at the Grand College in Brussels, while also attending the Brussels Conservatory where he studied music and learned to play the violin.|$|E
25|$|Writing {{was from}} right to left except in archaic inscriptions, which {{occasionally}} used boustrophedon. An example found at Cerveteri used left to right. In the earliest inscriptions, the words are continuous. From the sixth century BC, they are separated by a dot or a colon, which symbol might also be used to separate syllables. Writing was phonetic; the letters represented the sounds and not conventional spellings. On the other hand, many inscriptions are highly abbreviated and often casually formed, so the identification of individual letters is sometimes difficult. Spelling might vary <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city, probably reflecting differences of pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|Abdul Rahman's son planned {{from there}} to move <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city, fortifying as they went, and if Charles wished {{to stop them from}} making a {{permanent}} enclave for expansion of the Caliphate, he would have to come to them, in the open, where, he, unlike his father, would dictate the place of battle. All worked as he had planned, until Charles arrived, albeit more swiftly than the Moors believed he could call up his entire army. Unfortunately for Rahman's son, however, he had overestimated the time it would take Charles to develop heavy cavalry equal to that of the Muslims.|$|E

25|$|According to the FBI, a {{city to city}} {{comparison}} of crime rates is not meaningful, because recording practices vary <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city, citizens report different percentages of crimes from one city to the next, and {{the actual number of}} people physically present in a city is unknown. With that in mind, Dallas' violent crime rate (12.06 per 1,000 people) is lower than that of St Louis (24.81), Detroit (24.22), Baltimore (16.96), Philadelphia (15.62), Cleveland (15.47), Miami (15.09), Washington, D.C. (14.48), Kansas City (14.44) and Boston (13.39). However, Houston (11.69), Los Angeles (7.87), and New York City (6.38) have lower violent crime rates than Dallas.|$|E
25|$|How cities {{implement}} {{human rights}} ideals varies <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city. This allows for each city {{to develop a}} plan that is specific to its capacities, needs, problems, and concerns. Formally designated “Human Rights Cities” typically create a leadership body made up of community activists, residents, and public officials (or their appointees) working in partnership. Other cities may adopt human rights language and standards without officially adopting the name of Human Rights City. For instance, Barcelona is a leading human right city in Europe, and it created an Office of Non-Discrimination to implement the EU anti-racial discrimination policy within its borders as part of becoming a Human Rights City.|$|E
25|$|Citizens enjoyed legal {{protection}} {{of life and}} property from their governing body. Again, {{it should be noted}} that a legal system encompassing the whole population of the republic did not yet exist. As in the 17th century the extent of this protection of life and property, varied <b>from</b> <b>city</b> <b>to</b> city. Meaning that if one burgher was to travel from his hometown to another territory, he was not protected by the law of the territory that he was on, but by the law of the territory that he was a burgher of. If there was infringement on his rights, the court would treat him in accordance with the rights relevant to him.|$|E
