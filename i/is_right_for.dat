5|$|For {{many years}} the {{horticulture}} industry focussed on registered selections of Banksia spinulosa, {{but since the}} late 1990s more and more cultivars of Banksia ericifolia have come on the market, including colour variants and dwarf forms. The latter are particularly attractive as the original plant may reach 6metres in height, and the new cultivars help enthusiasts choose a plant that <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> their conditions and tastes. Banksia ericifolia is also grown for the cut flower industry in Australia, though not {{to the degree that}} the western Australian species such as B.coccinea and B.menziesii are.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits roll, a visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> <b>For</b> if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

25|$|Kenneth Cranham as Pompey Magnus (Season 1) – A legendary general, {{past the}} days of his prime, who tries to {{recapture}} the glories of his youth {{as well as to}} do what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the Republic. The real Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus was a Roman general and politician who was as ambitious as Caesar and just as unorthodox in his youth. He chose to ally himself with the optimates in opposing Caesar and supporting the traditional Roman Republic.|$|E
25|$|Relativity and {{ambiguity}} {{are prominent}} {{ideas in the}} play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature {{of many of the}} characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Tikkun olam (Repairing the World) {{is central to}} modern Rabbinic Judaism. Tikkun olam is {{accomplished}} through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, {{as well as through}} example persuading {{the rest of the world}} to behave morally. According to some views, Tikkun Olam would result in the beginning of the Messianic Age. It has been said that in every generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual Messiah. If the time <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).|$|E

25|$|In rebreather diving, bailout to {{open circuit}} is a {{procedure}} where the diver switches from breathing from the rebreather loop to open circuit. This is done when the loop is compromised for any reason, {{and is often}} done temporarily when there is some doubt that the gas in the loop <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> the depth. Bailout to open circuit may be a local switch-over at the bailout valve (BOV) to breathe gas directly from the diluent cylinder, or may be a switch to off-board gas, which is carried in an independent cylinder and is directly equivalent to open circuit bailout. This may be done through an off-board supply connected to the BOV or through a regular fully independent bailout set carried for the purpose. Both options may be available on deep dives with long decompression obligations. Occasionally rebreather divers will carry a bailout rebreather, {{when it is not}} practical to carry the required gas volume for open circuit bailout.|$|E

He expressed {{the view that}} while he regretted his involvement in them, he was not ashamed of having done so: [...] "though some of my former beliefs were mistaken, I will never acknowledge that there was anything dishonourable about holding them." [...] As leader of the NF he continued to openly approve of Hitler's social and economic program and well as his policies of German territorial expansion. In his 1988 autobiography The Eleventh Hour, he stated that while he thought that [...] "many of [...] intentions were good ones {{and many of his}} achievements admirable", he did not think [...] "that it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> a British movement belonging to an entirely different phase of history to model itself on the movement of Hitler".|$|E
500|$|Following Sonny Bono's {{death in}} a skiing {{accident}} in 1998, Cher delivered a tearful eulogy at his funeral, calling him [...] "the most unforgettable character" [...] she had met. She paid tribute to him by hosting the CBS special Sonny & Me: Cher Remembers, which aired on May 20, 1998. That month, Sonny and Cher received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television. Later that year, Cher published The First Time, a collection of autobiographical essays of [...] "first-time" [...] events in her life, which critics praised for revealing the singer to be down to earth and genuine. Although the manuscript was almost finished when Sonny died, she could not decide whether to include his death in the book; she feared being criticized for capitalizing on the event. She later told Rolling Stone, [...] "I couldn't ignore it, could I? I might have if I cared more about what people think than what I know <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|E
500|$|Finding the Persian fleet {{gone from}} Samos, the Allies were thrown into uncertainty. Eventually they {{resolved}} {{that they would}} sail to the mainland, and equipped themselves for a naval battle. However, when the Allies approached Mycale, the Persians {{did not attempt to}} engage them, and remained guarding their camp. Leotychides therefore sailed as close to the camp as possible, and had a herald make an appeal to the Ionians: [...] "Men of Ionia, you who hear us, understand what I say, for by no means will the Persians understand anything I charge you with when we join battle; first of all it <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> each man to remember his freedom and next the battle-cry Hebe: and let him who hears me tell him who has not heard it." [...] Herodotus suggests that the purpose of this message was twofold; firstly to encourage the Ionians, unbeknownst to the Persians, to fight for the Allies (or at least not to fight against them); or, if the message became known to the Persians, to make the Persians mistrust the Ionians.|$|E

500|$|Mario Kart DS is {{the first}} Mario Kart {{iteration}} to support online play. Konno remarked that although both Mario Kart DS and the Halo series of games feature online play, he noted {{that most of the}} people who use the feature in Halo games were [...] "hardcore gamers". With Mario Kart DS, Konno wants [...] "everyone to go online, and the technology and time <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> that to happen". Continuing with the tradition of introducing a new gameplay mechanic in each Mario Kart game, Mario Kart DS {{is the first}} in the series to support up to eight players at the same time with game cartridges. New to the series, the game also includes a single-player Battle Mode, which does not require that there be at least two human participants. As the first Mario Kart game for the Nintendo DS, the developers tested several features that took advantage of the device's bottom touchscreen. They considered letting players place items anywhere on the track instead of just behind their kart. However, the developers found it too confusing because the game already had too many distractions, making it difficult to control where to place items while racing.|$|E
500|$|My French Coach and My Spanish Coach {{were two}} of the first three games Ubisoft {{released}} for the My Coach series; the other game was My Word Coach. During the course of their development by Sensory Sweep Studios, the lessons and minigames were created with the help of French and Spanish language teachers. Ubisoft announced {{the creation of a new}} division to create the My Coach series on May 21, 2007, and that Pauline Jacquey, the producer of the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon and Rayman series, would lead the division. When commenting on the direction of the My Coach series, Jacquey said that she was [...] "developing projects that make people feel that playing games is worth their while, allowing them to spend quality time with family and friends, learn a new skill, or improve their daily lives". Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot commented that, “The timing <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>for</b> us to leverage our creativity and to open up the video games market to new consumers who will be attracted by content that can help them learn, grow and feel better in an entertaining way". All three games were released on November 6, 2007 in North America. Ubisoft followed with a PlayStation Portable version of My Spanish Coach, releasing it in North America on October 7, 2008; Wii versions of My French Coach and My Spanish Coach were released in Europe on November 30, 2007. The European releases for My French Coach, titled My French Coach Level 1: Beginners, and My Spanish Coach, renamed My Spanish Coach Level 1: Beginners, were accompanied by My French Coach Level 2: Intermediate and My Spanish Coach Level 2: Intermediate, the next games in the series.|$|E
