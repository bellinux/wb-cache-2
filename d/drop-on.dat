The sensor is a thermistor composed silver (Ag) deposited on a Polyimide substrate (Kapton HN). The meander was patterned by inkjet printing with a <b>drop-on</b> demand Jetlab 4 (Microfab Technologies Inc.). The resistance temperature coefficients have been studied in the temperature range of 20 - 60 degrees C with a range of voltage between 0 and 1 V. The stability versus time has also been measured without a sensor layer protection. The sensitive area of the sensor, silver lines width and the gap between the electrical conductors were, respectively 6. 2 cm(2), 300 mu m, 60 mu m. The mean temperature sensor sensitivity found was 2. 23 x 10 (- 2) degrees C- 1. The results show a good linearity and less than 5 % hysteresis in the extended measurement. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V.
