500|$|Taking {{matters into}} his own hands, Bennett started his own record company, Improv. He cut some songs that would later become favorites, such as [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love?", and made two well-regarded albums with jazz pianist Bill Evans, The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album (1975) and Together Again (1976), but Improv lacked a {{distribution}} arrangement with a major label and by 1977, {{it was out of}} business.|$|E
500|$|... "What <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love?" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Cole Porter for the musical revue Wake Up and Dream. It was {{introduced}} by Elsie Carlisle in London. Ben Bernie's and Fred Rich's recordings made the charts in 1930. One of the best-known instrumental versions was recorded by Clifford Brown and Max Roach with Sonny Rollins in 1956. The song's chord progression has inspired several later compositions, including Tadd Dameron's bebop standard [...] "Hot House".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} man {{with an air of}} reflection, [...] "it might <b>be.</b> <b>This</b> <b>thing's</b> quick. Leaves you or wipes you out right away. There's very little {{strength}} in him." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{his last}} {{contribution}} to acting in 2003 [...] a guest role on Will & Grace {{for which he}} received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor [...] Wilder {{turned his attention to}} writing. He produced a memoir in 2005, Kiss Me Like a Stranger: My Search for Love and Art; a collection of stories, What <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love? (2010); and the novels My French Whore (2007), The Woman Who Wouldn't (2008) and Something to Remember You By (2013).|$|E
500|$|Some {{compositions}} {{written by}} jazz artists have endured as standards, including Fats Waller's [...] "Honeysuckle Rose" [...] and [...] "Ain't Misbehavin'". The most recorded 1920s standard is Hoagy Carmichael and Mitchell Parish's [...] "Stardust". Several songs written by Broadway composers in the 1920s have become standards, such as George and Ira Gershwin's [...] "The Man I Love" [...] (1924), Irving Berlin's [...] "Blue Skies" [...] (1927) and Cole Porter's [...] "What <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love?" [...] (1929). However, {{it was not}} until the 1930s that musicians became comfortable with the harmonic and melodic sophistication of Broadway tunes and started including them regularly in their repertoire.|$|E
500|$|Various interpretations {{have been}} {{suggested}} for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of The New York Times noted several suggestions made about the feather: [...] "Does the white feather symbolize the unbearable lightness of being? Forrest Gump's impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?" [...] Hanks interpreted the feather as: [...] "Our destiny is only defined by {{how we deal with}} the chance elements to our life and that's kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge." [...] Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: [...] "It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?" [...] Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: [...] "It can mean so many things to so many different people." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1944 {{he formed}} the vocal quintet Mel Tormé and His Mel-Tones, modeled on Frank Sinatra and The Pied Pipers. The Mel-Tones, which {{included}} Les Baxter and Ginny O'Connor, had several hits fronting Artie Shaw's band {{and on their}} own, including Cole Porter's [...] "What <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love?" [...] The Mel-Tones {{were among the first}} jazz-influenced vocal groups, blazing a path later followed by The Hi-Lo's, The Four Freshmen, and The Manhattan Transfer.|$|E
2500|$|Paltrow filmed small {{roles for}} the 2006 films Love and Other Disasters, Running With Scissors and Infamous, where she sang Cole Porter's [...] "What <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love?". Her brother Jake Paltrow {{directed}} {{her in his}} feature debut, the romantic comedy The Good Night (2007), in which she starred opposite Penélope Cruz, Martin Freeman, Danny DeVito and Simon Pegg as {{the wife of a}} former keyboard player (Freeman). The film received a two-theater run in North America and garnered mixed reviews from critics. View London felt the actress was [...] "clearly only playing her part as a courtesy to her director brother and it just makes you wish she'd go back to playing lead roles again".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 36, Porter reintroduced {{himself to}} Broadway in 1928 with the musical Paris, his first hit. It was {{commissioned}} by E. Ray Goetz at the instigation of Goetz's wife and the show's star, Irène Bordoni. She had wanted Rodgers and Hart to write the songs, but they were unavailable, and Porter's agent persuaded Goetz to hire Porter instead. In August 1928, Porter's work on the show was interrupted {{by the death of}} his father. He hurried back to Indiana to comfort his mother before returning to work. The songs for the show included [...] "Let's Misbehave" [...] and one of his best-known list songs, [...] "Let's Do It", which was introduced by Bordoni and Arthur Margetson. The show opened on Broadway on October 8, 1928. The Porters did not attend the first night because Porter was in Paris supervising another show for which he had been commissioned, La Revue, at a nightclub. This was also a success, and, in Citron's phrase, Porter was finally [...] "accepted into the upper echelon of Broadway songwriters". [...] Cochran now wanted more from Porter than isolated extra songs; he planned a West End extravaganza similar to Ziegfeld's shows, with a Porter score and a large international cast led by Jessie Matthews, Sonnie Hale and Tilly Losch. The revue, Wake Up and Dream, ran for 263 performances in London, after which Cochran transferred it to New York in 1929. On Broadway, business was badly affected by the 1929 Wall Street crash, and the production ran for only 136 performances. From Porter's point of view, it was nonetheless a success, as his song [...] "What <b>Is</b> <b>This</b> <b>Thing</b> Called Love?" [...] became immensely popular.|$|E

6000|$|The pupils of The Infant's eyes {{contracted}} to two pin-points. [...] "I beg your pardon," [...] {{he said slowly}} and stiffly, [...] "but I <b>am</b> telling <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> as it happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo!" [...] he said. [...] "Somebody has <b>been</b> peppering <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> with shot, after all, {{and quite}} lately, too. Why, I believe old Jink's {{been trying to}} improve his bad {{shooting}} here." ...|$|R
2500|$|Jobs {{told his}} {{official}} biographer that after meeting Simpson, {{he wanted to}} become involved in her ongoing search for their father. When Jandali was found working in Sacramento, Jobs decided that only Simpson would meet him. Jandali and Simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching to join the restaurant business. He also said that he and Schieble had given another child away for adoption but that [...] "we'll never see that baby again. That baby's gone." [...] (Simpson did not mention that she had met Jobs). Jandali further told Simpson that he once managed a Mediterranean restaurant near San Jose and that [...] "all of the successful technology people used to come there. Even Steve Jobs... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy, and a big tipper." [...] After hearing about the visit, Jobs recalled that [...] "it was amazing... I had been to that restaurant a few times and I remember meeting the owner. He was Syrian. Balding. We shook hands." [...] However, Jobs did not want to meet Jandali because [...] "I was a wealthy man by then, and I didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it... I asked Mona not to tell him about me." [...] Jandali later discovered his relationship to Jobs through an online blog. He then contacted Simpson and asked [...] "what <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> about Steve Jobs?" [...] Simpson told him that it was true and later commented, [...] "My father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive... he never contacted Steve." [...] Because Simpson, herself, researched her Syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that Jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. Simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, The Lost Father. She would also create a fictional portrait of Jobs in the 1996 novel, A Regular Guy.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, Bertrade, my Bertrade," [...] he cried, [...] "what <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> that I have done! Forgive me, and let {{the greatness}} and the purity of my love for you plead in {{extenuation}} of my act." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "People {{thrashing}} {{out three}} chords didn't really interest us musically. Reggae was accepted in punk circles and musically more sophisticated, {{and we could}} play it, so we veered off in that direction. I mean let's be honest here, 'So Lonely' was unabashedly culled from 'No Woman No Cry' by Bob Marley. Same chorus. What we invented <b>was</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> of {{going back and forth}} between thrash punk and reggae. That was the little niche we created for ourselves." [...] Sting ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, not too late! From {{what you}} say they will tell me, I should think, perhaps, worse of you than you deserve. What <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> you hide? What is this mystery? Tell me, monsieur. Tell me." ...|$|E

After his great victory over the Midianites, he slew at this place the captive kings (...) [...] He then assumed the function of high priest, and sought to make Ophrah what Shiloh should have <b>been.</b> <b>This</b> <b>thing</b> [...] "became a snare" [...] to Gideon and his house. After Gideon's death his family resided here until they were put to death by Gideon's son Abimelech (...) [...] It is identified with Ferata.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mark {{the agony}} in his waning eye," [...] said Yoomy;--"alas, poor Babbalanja! <b>Is</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> of madness {{conscious}} to thyself?

6000|$|... "See here, Jane," [...] he said bluntly. [...] "How long <b>is</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> {{going on}} like this? You haven't refused to marry me, but you haven't promised either.
