Treat-ment with recombinant GDF- 9, but not FSH, stimulated thymi-dine incorporation into cultured <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> from both early antral and preovulatory follicles, accompanied by increases in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> number. Although GDF- 9 treatment alone stim-ulated basal steroidogenesis in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells,</b> cotreatment with GDF- 9 suppressed FSH-stimulated progesterone and estradiol production. In addition, GDF- 9 cotreatment attentuated FSH-induced LH receptor formation. The inhibitory effects of GDF- 9 on FSH-induced <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation were accom-panied by decreases in the FSH-induced cAMP production. These data suggested that GDF- 9 is a proliferation factor for <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> from early antral and preovulatory follicles but suppresses FSH-induced differentiation of the same cells. Thus, oocyte-derived GDF- 9 could account, at least partially, for the oocyte factor(s) previously reported to control cumulus and <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation...|$|R

Experiments with conditioned media {{showed that the}} expansion-promoting action of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> is due to diffusible factor(s) released into the culture medium. Studies with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors and direct measurements of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) released by <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> in the culture medium have also been performed. The results strongly suggest that the cumulus oophorus expansion-promoting action of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> is mediated by PGE 2, and support the hypothesis (Downs and Longo, 1983) that <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> might play a similar role in the mechanism of cumulus expansion in vivo. The suggestion is advanced that coculture with <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> might be of help to allow physiologic expansion in culture of immature cumuli {{obtained from}} preovulatory follicles in in vitro fertilization programs...|$|R
40|$|The {{cross-talk}} between oocyte {{and somatic}} cells plays {{a crucial role}} in the regulation of follicular development and oocyte maturation. As a result, <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis causes follicular atresia. In this study, sheep <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> were cultured under thermal stress to induce apoptosis, and melatonin (MT) was examined to evaluate its potential effects on heat-induced <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> injury. The results demonstrated that the Colony Forming Efficiency (CFE) of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> was significantly decreased (heat 19. 70 % ± 1. 29 % vs. control 26. 96 % ± 1. 81 %, p < 0. 05) and the apoptosis rate was significantly increased (heat 56. 16 % ± 13. 95 % vs. control 22. 80 % ± 12. 16 %, p < 0. 05) in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> with thermal stress compared with the control group. Melatonin (10 − 7 M) remarkably reduced the negative effects caused by thermal stress in the <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells.</b> This reduction was indicated by the improved CFE and decreased apoptotic rate of these cells. The beneficial effects of melatonin on thermal stressed <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> were not inhibited by its membrane receptor antagonist luzindole. A mechanistic exploration indicated that melatonin (10 − 7 M) down-regulated p 53 and up-regulated Bcl- 2 and LHR gene expression of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> under thermal stress. This study provides evidence for the molecular mechanisms of the protective effects of melatonin on <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> during thermal stress...|$|R

40|$|Polycystic ovarian {{syndrome}} (PCOS) is a multi-factorial infertility disorder whose etiology and pathogenesis is {{not completely}} understood. Although there is an association between dysregulation of mitochondrial fission and fusion to cell death (apoptotic and autophagic) and the pathogenesis of various diseases, this had not {{been reported in the}} context of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> death, follicular growth arrest and PCOS. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> survival factor, is used during gonadotropin therapy to assist in follicular maturation and ovulation in women with PCOS. Whether FSH can modulate the possible dysregulation of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> mitochondrial dynamics and cell death in PCOS had not been elucidated. Chemerin is an adipokine that has been associated with PCOS and <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis in follicle cultures. Its role in cell death (apoptotic and autophagic) of primary <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> had not been confirmed. In this thesis, we investigated the dysregulation of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> mitochondrial dynamics in PCOS pathogenesis by using an androgenized rat model, and its modulation by exogenous gonadotropin. The mechanisms involved in gonadotropic regulation were investigated using primary <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells.</b> Our data suggest that increased mitochondrial fission leads to early antral <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> death, follicular growth arrest and anovulation in women with PCOS. FSH can regulate the phosphorylation of mitochondrial fission protein Drp 1, which may lead to its suppression of mitochondrial fission and apoptosis in PCOS. Finally, chemerin had no effect on <b>cell</b> death in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> cultures. These findings provide a greater understanding of the processes involved in PCOS pathogenesis and the regulatory role of FSH in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells,</b> laying the foundation for future study into the development of potential biomarkers and new treatment strategies...|$|R

40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) {{are closely related}} to the {{follicular}} <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis. Grape seed procyanidin B 2 (GSPB 2) has been reported to possess potent antioxidant activity. However, the GSPB 2 -mediated protective effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis process remain unknown. In this study, we showed {{for the first time that}} GSPB 2 treatment decreased FoxO 1 protein level, improved <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> viability, upregulated LC 3 -II protein level, and reduced <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis rate. Under a condition of oxidative stress, GSPB 2 reversed FoxO 1 nuclear localization and increased its level in cytoplasm. In addition, FoxO 1 knockdown inhibited the protective effects of GSPB 2 induced. Our findings suggest that FoxO 1 plays a pivotal role in regulating autophagy in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells,</b> GSPB 2 exerts a potent and beneficial role in reducing <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis and inducing autophagy process, and targeting FoxO 1 could be significant in fighting against oxidative stress-reduced female reproductive system diseases...|$|R
40|$|STUDIES OF THE {{physiological}} {{functions of the}} human ovaries have recently made significant progress, and important findings on the regulation mechanisms of oogenesis, folliculogenesis, ovarian atresia, and steroidogenesis continue to increase (1). Primary culture systems of human <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from ovarian follicles have often been used for the studies of <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> (2 – 11). Human <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> are obtainable mainly from in vitro fertilization programs. However, they are only obtainable in small numbers, {{and they do not}} survive in culture for extended cell generations. Such difficulties in obtaining and maintaining primary culture systems and also in preparing uniform cell populations in sizable amounts have often prevented the performance of the detailed analyses on molecular and cell biological levels. During the last 2 decades, although several animal ovarian <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> lines, mostly immortalized by oncogenes and oncoviruses have been reported (12 – 25), only five human <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> lines have been established (26 – 30).

40|$|ABSTRACT We used co-cultures of porcine ovarian <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> {{and mouse}} adrenocortical tumor cells (Y- 1) {{to examine the}} {{kinetics}} of contact-dependent intercellular signal transfer and to assess the molecular mechanisms employed by this process. Exposure to follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) caused CAMP-dependent protein kinase dissociation in <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> and, with time, in Y- 1 cells if, and only if, they contacted a responding <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell.</b> Y- 1 cells close to a <b>granulosa</b> <b>cell</b> but not touching it failed to respond similarly. In reciprocal experiments, co-cultures were stimulated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Y- 1 cells dissociated protein kinase as did <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> in contact with Y- 1 cells; however, <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells</b> that were not in contact with Y- 1 cells {{failed to respond to}} the hormone. Fluorogenic steroids were secreted by Y- 1 cells cultured alone and stimulated with ACTH, but were not secreted by cultures exposed to FSH. Neither hormone caused fluorogenic steroid production by <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells.</b> On the other hand these steroids were secreted in co-cultures stimulated with ACTH and to a lesser degree in co-cultures exposed to FSH. Autoradiography revealed that 1 125 -FSH bound only to <b>granulosa</b> <b>cells,</b> never to Y- 1 cells, even if they were in contact with an ovarian cell.
