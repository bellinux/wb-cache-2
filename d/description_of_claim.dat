40|$|ISBN 07340 3576 4 This paper {{considers}} the modeling of claim durations for existing claimants underincome protection insurance policies. A claim {{is considered to}} be terminated when theclaimant returns to work. Data used in the analysis was provided by the Life and RiskCommittee of the Institute of Actuaries of Australia. Initial analysis of the datasuggests the presence of a long run probability, of the order of 7 %, that a claimantwill never return to work. This phenomenon suggests the use of mixed parametricregression models as a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> duration which include the prediction of along-run probability of not returning to work. A series of such parametric mixturemodels were investigated and {{it was found that the}} Generalised F mixture distributionprovided a good fit to the data and also highlighted the impact of a number ofstatistically significant predictors of claim duration.

40|$|An unsound claim can misdirect a field, {{encouraging}} {{the pursuit of}} unworthy ideas and the abandonment of promising ideas. An inadequate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> a <b>claim</b> can {{make it difficult to}} reason about the claim, for example to determine whether the claim is sound. Many practitioners will acknowledge the threat <b>of</b> un- sound <b>claims</b> or inadequate <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> to their field. We believe that this situation is exacerbated and even encouraged by the lack of a systematic approach to exploring, exposing, and addressing the source <b>of</b> unsound <b>claims</b> and poor exposition. This paper proposes a framework that identifies three sins of reasoning that lead to unsound claims and two sins of exposition that lead to poorly described <b>claims.</b> Sins <b>of</b> exposition obfuscate the objective of determining whether or not a claim is sound, while sins of reasoning lead directly to unsound claims. Our framework provides practitioners with a principled way of critiquing the integrity of their own work and the work of others. We hope that this will help individuals conduct better science and encourage a cultural shift in our research community to identify and promulgate sound claims...|$|R

The aim of this work was detailed <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims,</b> then show the control system <b>of</b> the <b>claims</b> <b>of</b> ENVIRO-EKOANALYTIKA and propose improvements to the existing claims management system. The main reasons why claims come into existence are business relations, but they can be caused by provided deposits, loans and bank credits. Claims from business relations are necessary parts of belongings, because every businessman needs goods and services from others. A company can analyse high earnings and profit in accounting but his financial resources can be essentially different. For a company is very important to have a sufficient number of financial resources and to this a company ensures <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and then restricts entrepreneurial risk. The ensuring <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> means that contractual partner is obliged to realise his account payable. General forms to ensure claims are for example: penal clause, liability, acknowledge a debt, bank quarantee or altitude of debt. We can divide claims in risk claims and abandoned claims. During trading a lot of profits are formed, these profits can be evoked by for example: political or economical events, announcing a financial insolvency or natural catastrophe. Between the most frequent cause <b>of</b> risk <b>claims</b> are mainly the absence of morality in business relations. If the payment <b>of</b> <b>claim</b> is not done until fixed date, the claim gets the bad debt. The only way how to anticipate abandoned claims is, that busines men do not let them come into existence. The proceedings also include claims recovery. The main objective of recovery is to get customers to pay, and as early as possible. Most companies use a standard procedure for recovery, which includes telephone reminders, terminating the supply of credit, written reminders, the transmission of judicial or extrajudicial recovery...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{argues for}} a bodily {{approach}} to music cognition. Rather than focussing on the effector {{side of the}} body as a mover and effector, it stresses the role of the input side of dealing with the music. The senses are considered as natural perceptual tools for sense-making, but artificial extensions are possible as well. As such, it is possible to conceive of them as part of an adaptive device, allowing the music user to change his/her epistemic transactions with the sounding world. Dealing with music, on this view, is to be considered as an adaptive process for coping with the sounding world, relying heavily on knowledge construction as the result of interactions with the outer world. Four major issues must be considered here: (i) the fulness of the rich sensory experience‚Äîmusic as a sounding phenomenon‚Äî, (ii) the sensorimotor interactions and transactions at the boundary of the human body‚Äîthe skin and its specialized perceptual organs‚Äî, (iii) the conceptualisations that are the outcome of these interactions; and (iv) the interiorisation of these transactions in terms of bodily resonance and attunement. Additional topics concern the subjective involvement with music and the role of emotions and empathy, with a special effort to provide an operational and explanatory <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> which were rather intuitive up to now. An effort is made, finally, to propose future developments with regard to the implementation of multimedia platforms that allow a multimodal approach to musical involvement. status: accepte...|$|R

This is achieved through finding and removing errors which, if they were present, would detract from the operational efficiency or accuracy of the product and therefore detract from the product 2 ÃÜ 7 s quality. Black box testing is based on knowledge of the specified functionality of a product, whereas white box testing makes use of knowledge of the program code. Regardless of the testing technique employed, the main objective is to derive a set of test cases that will uncover defects in the code. In this thesis my testing approach focuses on an object-oriented model of a software system. The model is constructed through "reverse engineering" a rigorous <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>claimed</b> functionality from the user documentation of the product. The model is represented in the form of objects, attributes and operations. The operations are perceived by the user as being the functionality of the system. My approach uses an object-oriented black box testing technique to exercise the functionality of the model. This is achieved through deriving test cases from the model (which is represented at a different level of abstraction using graph theory notation). The test cases consist of the valid sequences of operations that are allowed, along with the expected output for each such sequence. My objective is to completely exercise the functionality of the model using a minimum set of valid test cases...|$|R
