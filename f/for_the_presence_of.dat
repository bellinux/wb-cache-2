5|$|ANA was of {{the opinion}} that if a small amount of water entered a fuel tank during {{refuelling}} it would only reach the drain cocks when the aircraft was in level flight so it could not be detected immediately after re-fuelling. For 15 years ANA had operated in the knowledge that the only satisfactory time to check fuel tanks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> water was prior to the first flight of the day, after the aircraft had been stationary overnight. Throughout this time ANA checked fuel tanks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> water prior to the first flight of the day.|$|E
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the alkene {{functional group}} is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin {{with some of}} the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. This {{is an example of a}} halogen addition reaction.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or determine the cause of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|Although {{the venom}} {{of a few}} spider and {{scorpion}} species can be very dangerous to humans, medical researchers are investigating {{the use of these}} venoms for the treatment of disorders ranging from cancer to erectile dysfunction. The medical industry also uses the blood of horseshoe crabs as a test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> contaminant bacteria. Mites can cause allergies in humans, transmit several diseases to humans and their livestock, and are serious agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Another sort of {{risk that}} can affect dry cargoes, is {{absorption}} of ambient moisture. When very fine concretes and aggregates mix with water, the mud created {{at the bottom of}} the hold shifts easily and can produce a free surface effect. The only way to control these risks is by good ventilation practices and careful monitoring <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> water.|$|E

5|$|Banksia sessilis {{is highly}} {{susceptible}} to dieback {{caused by the}} introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; {{in fact it is}} so reliably susceptible that it is considered a good indicator species <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Most highly susceptible species quickly become locally extinct in infected areas, {{and in the absence of}} hosts the disease itself eventually dies out. However, B.sessilis, being an aggressive coloniser of disturbed and open ground, often colonises old disease sites. The new colonies are themselves infected, and thus P.cinnamomi survives at these sites indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Banksia speciosa is {{extremely}} sensitive to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks have been drastically reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure. It is an indicator species <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the disease. Nursery plants in Italy perished from root and basal stem rot from the pathogen Phytophthora taxon niederhauserii.|$|E
5|$|During the House of Representatives {{debate on}} the report, the Minister, Larry Anthony, stated that he had already asked fuel {{companies}} to check their tanker wagons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> water after each replenishment, and the relevant Air Navigation Order would be amended to require fuel to be drained into transparent containers. He stated that his Department {{did not intend to}} amend the relevant Air Navigation Order to require pilots of four-engine aeroplanes to perform the periodic checks in a four-engine aeroplane because it considered it was more challenging to fly with one engine inoperative in a two-engine aeroplane than in a four-engine aeroplane.|$|E

5|$|Extremely {{sensitive}} to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, Banksia coccinea is an indicator species <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> the disease. There is no known means of eradicating dieback. Much of the Stirling Range National Park is infested, though Fitzgerald River National Park {{has been largely}} spared. Applying phosphite to infested areas {{has been shown to}} reduce the mortality rates to around 50%. B. coccinea has shown some symptoms of toxicity to application of phosphite, with some patchy necrosis of leaves, but the plant's uptake of the compound is somewhat lower compared with uptake by other shrub species. Unusually, the symptoms {{do not appear to be}} proportional to exposure levels.|$|E
5|$|Ibicella lutea {{is another}} flypaper protocarnivore {{that has been}} the subject of several studies. Early studies {{concluded}} that the plant digested proteinaceous offerings, though the methods were crude.

5|$|Living Hydrogenophilus thermoluteolus {{micro-organisms}} {{have been}} found in Lake Vostok's deep ice core drillings; they are an extant surface-dwelling species. This suggests the presence of a deep biosphere utilizing a geothermal system of the bedrock encircling the subglacial lake. There is optimism that microbial life in the lake may be possible despite high pressure, constant cold, low nutrient input, potentially high oxygen concentration and an absence of sunlight. Jupiter's moon Europa and Saturn's moon Enceladus may also harbor lakes or oceans below a thick crust of ice. Any confirmation of life in Lake Vostok could strengthen the prospect <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> life on icy moons.|$|E

5|$|Poisoning {{symptoms}} are rapid in onset, consisting initially of vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and associated decreased blood volume. Shortly after these initial symptoms appear, hemolysis develops, resulting in reduced urine output, hemoglobin {{in the urine}} or outright absence of urine formation, and anemia. Medical laboratory tests consist of testing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> increasing bilirubin and free hemoglobin, and falling haptoglobins. Hemolysis may lead to numerous complications including acute renal failure, shock, acute respiratory failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. These complications can cause significant morbidity with fatalities having been reported.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} death, the UK's Health Protection Agency (HPA) said tests had {{established}} that Litvinenko had {{significant amounts of}} the radionuclide polonium-210 (210Po) in his body. British and US government officials said the use of 210Po as a poison had never been documented before, and {{it was probably the}} first time anyone had been tested <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> 210Po in their body.

5|$|Since {{the capital}} Halab {{has not been}} excavated, the {{architecture}} of the kingdom is archaeologically best represented by the city of Alalakh, which was subordinate to Halab and ruled by a king belonging to the Yamhadite royal house. The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Baylonian-era palaces. They were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, tiled floors, drainage systems and plastered walls, which suggest the employment of specialized labor.

40|$|Variations in the {{critical}} micelle concentration (CMC) have been determined for sodium dodecyl sulfate and sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) in <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> five drugs and polyethylene glycol (PEG) at temperatures (298. 2, 304. 2 and 310. 2) K. From these data, thermodynamic parameters associated with the micellisation process (DmicG, DmicH and DmicS) were calculated. In <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> some drug-based compounds, the CMC of SDS was affected, <b>for</b> example <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> PEG dramatically reduced the CMC in all cases. Furthermore, PEG appeared to reduce the enthalpy of micellisation for all scenarios with only comparatively minor variations in the change in Gibbs free energy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> processes observed. <b>For</b> NaDC, <b>the</b> calorimetric results were far less predictable.
