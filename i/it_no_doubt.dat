25|$|Steam trams {{relied upon}} their weight and {{adhesion}} for propulsion {{and as the}} town streets were badly paved, dirt, stones, manure and water got into the rail grooves. Water boys and track cleaners were employed {{to clean out the}} rail grooves with long iron bars, which they dragged along the rails, it being essential to ensure the wheel flanges ran fully in the grooves, to allow the wheel tread to grip the track. The specification of performance was strict, the vehicle had to be silent, had to emit no smoke and was required to have no exposed parts which could provide a safety hazard to pedestrians and horses. In Nottingham, only one steam tram was operated and being considerably heavier than a horse-drawn car, <b>it,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> caused considerable damage to the track.|$|E
500|$|Feldman {{was in the}} Rangers' 2007 spring {{training}} camp, and won the final spot in the Texas bullpen. [...] He picked up his first Major League victory on April 11 in his 47th big-league appearance. [...] "I'll always remember <b>it,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> about it", Feldman said.|$|E
500|$|The hysterical coda tacked {{onto the}} end of [...] "Revenge and Finale" [...] is almost {{worth the price of}} the disc, as <b>it</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> sums up Small's opinion of the film. It's sad that the great Michael Small was {{delegated}} utter crap like Jaws the Revenge in the late '80s– and even worse that he never found {{his way back to the}} material that he deserves.|$|E

500|$|Dvoretsky comments: Here, {{we should}} touch on one {{delicate}} question. I {{am sure that}} this unique endgame position was discovered {{with the help of}} Thompson’s famous computer database. Is this a 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? [...] Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of <b>it,</b> <b>no</b> <b>doubt,</b> we could probably extract yet more unique positions – there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.|$|E
500|$|No Doubt {{released}} five studio albums {{throughout its}} career {{before going into}} hiatus. Their debut album, No Doubt, was released on March 17, 1992. It sold only 30,000 copies on its initial release, and the band's record company, Interscope Records, refused to fund {{the release of a}} single from <b>it.</b> <b>No</b> <b>Doubt</b> therefore financed the production of a music video for the song [...] "Trapped in a Box", which was received local airplay in Orange County, California but did not attract mainstream attention. No Doubt recorded their second album, The Beacon Street Collection, in March 1995. It was released independently, because No Doubt had recorded many songs that they knew would not make it onto Tragic Kingdom and were frustrated by a lack of attention from their label. They released two singles from it: [...] "Squeal" [...] and [...] "Doghouse". The Beacon Street Collection sold 100,000 copies. No Doubt's independence shocked their company representative and ensured that the label would finance a third album.|$|E
