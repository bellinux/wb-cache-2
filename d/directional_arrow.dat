2500|$|Other common frustrations {{include a}} lack of multi-key mapping for {{character}} behaviors, such as pressing Z + a <b>directional</b> <b>arrow</b> to jump in the direction pressed (a problem stemming from {{a lack of}} standardized keyboard electrical layouts at that time); the extreme simplicity of monster behaviors (partially due to a desire to eliminate programming from the design tools); a lack of persistent flags for game events [...] (partially due to memory constraints); and the lack of on-screen displays for health, lives, and other counters (due to Andrew's emphasis on full-screen rendering).|$|E
2500|$|The Bukit Panjang LRT {{opened in}} 1999 {{and was given}} the colours purple and orange to {{represent}} its direction of travel. Due to the alignment of the route, which was a loop track around Bukit Panjang New Town, the map was different. The stations were given the alphanumeric code A1 to A14, with numbering starting from Choa Chu Kang interchange and going anti-clockwise direction on the loop. The <b>directional</b> <b>arrow</b> on the shared service track (between stations A1 to A6) was split, half purple coloured and half orange coloured. From Bukit Panjang station, the orange arrows travelled in an anti-clockwise direction [...] while the purple arrows travelled in a clockwise direction (service A) towards Senja. These were standardised into grey colour since 2001 because of additional LRT lines such as Sengkang and Punggol LRT.|$|E

50|$|Play {{control is}} simpler than most {{fighting}} games. Each of the SNES controller's buttons (plus the up arrow) could {{be assigned to}} activate one of four moves: jump, block, normal attack, and power attack. Different normal and power attacks could be triggered depending {{of a variety of}} factors, such as how far the attacker is from the opponent, if he is ducking, or if a <b>directional</b> <b>arrow</b> is pressed along with the attack button.|$|E

Unlike earlier Macs, the Mac Plus's keyboard includes a numeric keypad and <b>directional</b> <b>arrow</b> keys and, as with previous Macs, it has a one-button mouse and no fan, making it extremely quiet in operation. The lack of a cooling fan in the Mac Plus led to frequent problems with overheating and hardware malfunctions.|$|E

50|$|The SV-318 is {{the basic}} model of the Spectravideo range. It was fitted with a chiclet style keyboard, {{difficult}} to use, alongside which sat a combination cursor pad/joystick. This is a disc-shaped affair {{with a hole in}} the centre; put a red plastic 'stick' in the hole and it is a built-in joystick, remove the stick and it is a <b>directional</b> <b>arrow</b> pad for word processing etc. This machine also had only 16 kb of user RAM (plus an additional 16 kb of video RAM), which limited its usefulness, though this could be expanded via an external peripheral box.|$|E
50|$|The AnyKey {{keyboard}} {{is easily}} distinguished from other generic keyboards by an extra double column of F keys {{on the left}} side, a unique eight <b>directional</b> <b>arrow</b> key pad {{as opposed to the}} traditional inverted T, and a quartet of extra keys directly above the numeric pad that control the programmable aspects of the keyboard. They are labeled “Program Macro”, “Suspend Macro”, “Repeat Rate”, and “Remap”, reading left to right. All versions of the AnyKey are white or very light gray with some keys (notably the programming keys, extra function keys, and arrows) in a darker gray.|$|E
50|$|The {{world of}} Ultima is {{presented}} {{in a variety of}} different ways. The overworld is projected in a topdown, third person view, while dungeons are displayed in first person, one-point perspective. In both scenarios the player character is controlled with the keyboard <b>directional</b> <b>arrows,</b> and shortcut keys are used for other commands, such as A for attack and B for board.|$|R

Player controls Mimpi. with <b>directional</b> <b>arrows</b> and interacts with surroundings by tapping, swiping, and dragging on it. He has to solve puzzles he comes across. Player can use bulbs for hints if he gets stuck at a puzzle. These bulbs can be collected along the way. He can also collect bones and Easter eggs that unlock special content.|$|R
50|$|Signposts, waymarks and {{information}} boards direct the walker along the route. In countryside locations the waymarks consist mostly {{of a simple}} white disc mounted on a wooden post, with a <b>directional</b> <b>arrow</b> and flying kestrel logo in blue and text in green. However, local authorities are responsible for funding these signs, so the quality varies from one borough to the next, with some sections not signed at all. The 54-mile blue route from Erith to Kingston is maintained by the Downlands Countryside Management Project, a joint initiative by several councils, and is complete with signs {{and information}} boards, in addition to maps available from Tourist Information Centres.|$|E

50|$|The game used 3D {{computer}} graphics {{and used a}} game engine identical to the later SSI title Menzoberranzan. Generally, the keyboard or mouse-driven <b>directional</b> <b>arrows</b> were used to move around or change perspective. As an early 3D game engine, it moved slowly and could appear cumbersome. However, there was an omnipresent map in the top corner which helped gamers from becoming too disoriented by the slow and cluttered progress of the game.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} it can optionally {{be ordered}} in Europe on the 1-series and 3-series as [...] "Business navigation", which has basic navigation abilities. Early {{versions of the}} Business navigation could only display <b>directional</b> <b>arrows,</b> but the latest version can also display 2D maps. iDrive Business Navigation uses a different map DVD than iDrive Professional Navigation. In addition, as only one optical drive is available, one cannot use both navigation and listen to a CD simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Players must dance {{against other}} players with songs by {{pressing}} {{each of the}} four available directional buttons when prompted. By default, players use either the <b>Directional</b> <b>Arrows</b> or WASD keys (or a combination of both) to do this, but dance mats are also supported as an input device. There is currently no set list of compatible dance mats, although Acclaim are asking dance mat owners to supply photographs and manufacturer information so that as many dance mats as possible will be compatible with the final release.|$|R
