Charges against Chastain were filed in February 1960, weeks before James Kinne's death.|$|E

500|$|McCann {{notes that}} one of the reasons that Grant was so {{successful}} with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: [...] "You see, he didn't depend on his looks. He wasn't a narcissist, he acted as though he were <b>just</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> young man. And that made it all the more appealing, that a handsome young man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good because we think, 'Well, if he's a Beau Brummel, he can't be either funny or intelligent', but he proved otherwise". Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor, and said that he was just the opposite of that, playing the [...] "basic man".|$|E

500|$|In Outliers, Gladwell {{interviews}} Gates, {{who says}} that unique access to a computer {{at a time when}} they were not commonplace helped him succeed. Without that access, Gladwell states that Gates would still be [...] "a highly intelligent, driven, charming person and a successful professional", but that he might not be worth US$50billion. Gladwell chooses his words carefully to never mention that Gates' mother was on the board of directors of IBM with access to the whole of IBM, and not <b>just</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> daughter of wealthy businessmen as he says. Gladwell explains that reaching the 10,000-Hour Rule, which he considers the key to success in any field, is simply a matter of practicing a specific task that can be accomplished with 20 hours of work a week for 10 years. He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at The American Spectator and his more recent job at The Washington Post.|$|E
500|$|Dorothy gains {{control of}} the Flying Monkeys by giving back the group's Magic Biker Cap to Sal Minella. She has Scarecrow and Tin Thing rebuilt by the Flying Monkeys. Then {{she and her friends}} travel back to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. When they all storm into the Wizard's room, they {{discover}} it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard (Jeffrey Tambor) is <b>just</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that she could not see him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really wanted was to go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City. She does so, saying [...] "take me home to Aunt Em".|$|E
500|$|In {{a segment}} of the Investigation Discovery series Deadly Women {{covering}} the Kinne case, episode entitled [...] "Born bad", James Hays, author of I'm <b>just</b> <b>an</b> <b>Ordinary</b> Girl: The Sharon Kinne Story speculates that Kinne committed her first murder for pecuniary gain, hoping to cash in on James Kinne's life insurance policy, and that she began to derive pleasure from killing at that point. Former FBI profiler Candice DeLong supports this assertion with her theory that Kinne is a sociopath, lacking in remorse and empathy, and therefore had no compunction about killing to get what she wanted — be it life insurance, marriage to her boyfriend, or cash. This idea is echoed by some of those involved in prosecuting Kinne, who feel that she was a [...] "psychopath" [...] and born bad. [...] and that [...] "her solution to a problem was to kill somebody". Even those who believe in her guilt, however, note that Kinne had a certain appeal, describing her as [...] "rather attractive" [...] and admitting that they grew to like her. The Mammoth Book of True Crime describes her as a relative rarity, a [...] "pretty" [...] criminal.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, the PWI and Bernas teams {{concluded}} that Udin {{had been murdered}} by a government official intent on saving face. By late September, Bernas was under political pressure to cease coverage of the case. One of the PWI team members, Putut, reported that his daughter had been nearly kidnapped and his home broken into. Several journalistic and human rights organisations stated their belief that the murder was likely connected with Udin's reporting, including Amnesty International, which expressed its concern that allegations about the involvement of government officials had [...] "not been properly investigated". The Committee to Protect Journalists {{sent a letter to}} President Suharto that demanded a full investigation into Udin's death, with the results made public. An independent report by the Indonesian Alliance of Independent Journalists praised the courage and neutrality of Udin's reporting, stating, [...] "he was not an NGO activist, nor was he involved in the student movement. He was <b>just</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> journalist who did an average job for a regional newspaper."

Irish radio station Spin South West complimented the performance, [...] "Little Mix are killing it , not many pop stars could do this!" [...] Alicia Adejobi of Entertainment Wise praised the version, writing, [...] "Little Mix are not <b>just</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> girl band, they can sing live, perform an acapella and even beat-box." [...] Little Mix performed the single live on the ninth season of The X Factor on 11 November 2012. The group performed the song backed by a troupe of dancers and wore matching black trousers, gold and blue tops with military jackets with ammunition belts. Little Mix's mentor during their time on The X Factor, Tulisa Contostavlos, praised the performance: [...] "You're professional, you're all on point and confident now." [...] Spin South West said that the performance manifested why Little Mix won the competition in 2011. Emily Sheridan of the Daily Mail positively reviewed the performance as well, writing, [...] "The group {{have come a long}} way since [...]" [...] The group performed [...] "DNA" [...] on 13 November 2012 for BBC's Live Lounge. On 23 November 2012, Little Mix performed an acoustic version of the song on ITV show Loose Women. In December 2012, the song was performed by the group at the Jingle Bell Ball and a Radio City 96.7 gig without Perrie Edwards who was suffering from tonsillitis at the time. During the Radio City performance, the group wore 1990s-inspired stonewashed denim outfits. Lucy Buckland of the Daily Mail positively reviewed the performance, [...] " [...] crowds with 'DNA' and their ability to carry off so much jean action in 2012." [...] Buckland went on to praise their look during the performance, describing it as [...] "glam." [...] She also commended, [...] "the girls seem to be doing a good job without [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|On 10 March 1956, Ji confronted Puyi in {{a meeting}} in his office with his siblings, where his sisters spoke of their {{happiness}} with their new lives working as schoolteachers and seamstresses. Puyi was helped with his [...] "remodeling" [...] when the other prisoners began to blame him for everything that happened in Manchukuo, which was a debit for them as in the Chinese system, one is supposed to confess to one's own guilt rather than blaming others; Puyi by contrast by assigning all the guilt to himself won himself Jin's favor. In late 1956, Puyi acted in a play The Defeat of the Aggressors about the Suez Crisis, {{playing the role of}} a left-wing Labour MP who challenges in the House of Commons a former Manchukuo minister playing the British Foreign Secretary Selwyn Lloyd about Britain's reasons for attacking Egypt. Puyi enjoyed the role and ad libbed several lines in English, shouting [...] "No, no, no! It won't do! Get out! Leave this House!". Sometimes, Puyi acted in plays about his life and Manchukuo, and in one theatrical production, playing a Manchukuo functionary, Puyi kowtowed to a portrait of himself as Emperor of Manchukuo. During the Great Leap Forward, when millions of people starved to death in China, Ji chose to cancel Puyi's visits to the countryside lest the scenes of famine undo Puyi's growing faith in communism. Behr wrote that many are surprised that Puyi's [...] "remodeling" [...] worked, with an Emperor brought up as almost a god becoming content to be <b>just</b> <b>an</b> <b>ordinary</b> man, but he noted that [...] "...it is essential to remember that Puyi was not alone in undergoing such successful 'remolding'.
