25|$|As with coppicing, only {{species with}} {{vigorous}} epicormic growth {{may be made}} into pollards. In these species (which include many broadleaved trees but few conifers), removal of the main apical stems releases the growth of many dormant buds under the bark on {{the lower part of}} the tree. Trees without this growth will, of course, die without their leaves and branches. Some smaller tree species do not readily form pollards, because cutting the main stem stimulates growth from the base, effectively forming a coppice stool instead. Examples of trees that do well as pollards include broadleaves such as beeches (Fagus), oaks (Quercus), maples (Acer), black locust or <b>false</b> <b>acacia</b> (Robinia pseudoacacia), hornbeams (Carpinus), lindens and limes (Tilia), planes (Platanus), horse chestnuts (Aesculus), mulberries (Morus), redbud (Cercis canadensis), tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima), willows (Salix), and a few conifers, such as yews (Taxus).|$|E
6000|$|But {{perhaps the}} most {{extraordinary}} application of {{the theory is that}} which considers spines to be an indication of the [...] "ebbing vitality of a species," [...] and which excludes [...] "mammalian selection altogether." [...] If this were true, spines should occur mainly in feeble, rare, and dying-out species, instead of which we have the hawthorn, one of our most vigorous shrubs or trees, with abundant vitality and an extensive range over the whole Palaearctic region, showing that it is really a dominant species. In North America the numerous thorny species of Crataegus are equally vigorous, as are the <b>false</b> <b>acacia</b> (Robinia) and the honey-locust (Gleditschia). Neither have the numerous species of very spiny Acacias been noticed to be rarer or less vigorous than the unarmed kinds.|$|E
60|$|The trees {{planted by}} a later generation, both shade and fruit, were more varied. The most {{abundant}} was the mulberry, {{of which there}} were many hundreds, mostly in rows, forming walks, and albeit {{of the same species}} as our English mulberry they differed from it in the great size and roughness of the leaves and in producing fruit of a much smaller size. The taste of the fruit was also less luscious and it was rarely eaten by our elders. We small children feasted on it, but it was mostly for the birds. The mulberry was looked on as a shade, not a fruit tree, and the other two most important shade trees, in number, were the acacia blanca, or <b>false</b> <b>acacia,</b> and the paradise tree or pride of China. Besides these there was a row of eight or ten ailanthus trees, or tree of heaven as it is sometimes called, with tall white smooth trunk crowned with a cluster of palm-like foliage. There was also a modern orchard, containing pear, apple, plum, and cherry trees.|$|E

60|$|With the {{activity}} that followed upon the peace came {{a great deal}} of road- making. The present high road between Winchester and Southampton was then made, and the way cut through the hills--Otterbourne Hill and Compton Hill on either side. This led to {{the main part of the}} inhabitants settling in the village street, instead of round the old Church as before. Another great road was made at the same time--that which crosses Golden Common and leads ultimately to Portsmouth. It used to be called Cobbett's Road, because William Cobbett, a clever, self-taught man, had much to do with laying it out. Cobbett had a good many theories which he tried to put into practice, some sensible, others mistaken. The principal traces we see of him now are in the trees that he planted, chiefly introduced from America. He thought the robinia, or <b>false</b> <b>acacia,</b> would make good hedges, because of its long thorns and power of throwing up suckers, and many people planted them, but they proved too brittle to be of much use, though some are still growing. He was a friend of Mr. Harley, who then owned Otterbourne House, and planted many curious trees there, of which two long remained--a hickory nut and a large tree in the drive. There was also an oak with enormous leaves, but it was planted so near the house that it had to be moved, and died in consequence.|$|E

Wood figures significantly in Lira's economy. Apart from tree plantations, Lira is also notable for the surface occupied by vineyards, meadows and cornfields.A few Old-growth forests (known locally as fragas) remain, particularly in the lower parts dominated by the English oak (Quercus robur L.), mixed with other tress like: alders, birches, ashes, hazels, blackthorns, maples, willows, wild cherry trees, wild pear trees, etc. Hills are covered mainly by maritime pine trees (Pinus pinaster). As exotic species are blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus), black locust or <b>false</b> <b>acacia</b> (Robinia pseudacacia) and recently the invasive heaven tree (Ailanthus altissima). It is also frequent the American northern red oak (Quercus rubra) in new forest plantations.

40|$|Oenopia conglobata {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{ladybird}} species in urban green areas of the Mediterranean region. We have obtained data about its prey acceptability and prey preferences. In a laboratory experiment, we investigated the acceptability of seven aphid and one psyllid species as prey for this coccinellid: the aphids Chaitophorus populeti, Aphis gossypii, Aphis craccivora Monelliopsis caryae, Eucallipterus tiliae, Aphis nerii (on white poplar, pomegranate, <b>false</b> <b>acacia,</b> black walnut, lime, and oleander, respectively), and the psyllid Acizzia jamatonica on Persian silk tree. These species are abundant in urban green areas in the Mediterranean region. In addition, we tested the acceptability of Rhopalosiphum padi on barley, an aphid species easily reared in the laboratory. We also tested preferences of the predator in cafeteria experiments with three aphid species and one aphid and the psyllid. Adults and larvae of the coccinellid accepted all of the preys offered, except A. nerii, with a clear preference for M. caryae. The predator also showed preference for M. caryae when it was offered in a cafeteria experiment with other aphid species or with the psyllid. The aphid R. padi obtained a good acceptability and could be used for rearing O. conglobata in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|The nonanthocyanic {{phenolic}} {{composition of}} four red wines, one white, and one rosé aged using barrels and chips of cherry, chestnut, <b>false</b> <b>acacia,</b> ash and oak wood was studied by LC-DAD-ESI/MS, {{to identify the}} phenolic compounds that woods other than oak contribute to wines, and if some {{of them can be}} used as chemical markers of ageing with them. A total of 68 nonanthocyanic phenolic compounds were identified, 15 found only in wines aged with acacia wood, 6 with cherry wood, and 1 with chestnut wood. Thus, the nonanthocyanic phenolic profile could be a useful tool to identify wines aged in contact with these woods. In addition, some differences in the nonanthocyanic phenolic composition of wines were detected related to both the levels of compounds provided by each wood species and the different evolution of flavonols and flavanols in wines during ageing in barrels or in contact with chips. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{phenolic}} {{composition of}} heartwood from Robinia pseudoacacia, {{commonly known as}} <b>false</b> <b>acacia,</b> before and after toasting in cooperage was studied by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS/MS. A total of 41 flavonoid and nonflavonoid compounds were identified, some tentatively, and quantified. Seasoned acacia wood showed high concentrations of flavonoid {{and low levels of}} nonflavonoid compounds, the main compounds being the dihydroflavonols dihydrorobinetin, fustin, tetrahydroxy, and trihydroxymethoxy dihydroflavonol, the flavonol robinetin, the flavanones robtin and butin, and a leucorobinetinidin, none of which are found in oak wood. The low molecular weight (LMW) phenolic compounds present also differed from those found in oak, since compounds with a beta-resorcylic structure, gallic related compounds, protocatechuic aldehyde, and some hydroxycinnamic compounds are included, but only a little gallic and ellagic acid. Toasting changed the chromatographic profiles of extracts spectacularly. Thus, the toasted acacia wood contributed flavonoids and condensed tannins (prorobinetin type) in inverse proportion to toasting intensity, while LMW phenolic compounds were directly proportional to toasting intensity, except for gallic and ellagic acid and related compounds. Even though toasting reduced differences between oak and acacia, particular characteristics of this wood {{must be taken into account}} when considering its use in cooperage: the presence of flavonoids and compounds with beta-resorcylic structure and the absence of hydrolyzable tannins.

40|$|Biological invasions are a {{major threat}} to biodiversity; however, the degree of impact can vary {{depending}} on the ecosystem and taxa. Here, we test whether a top invader at a global scale, the tree Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust or <b>false</b> <b>acacia),</b> which is known to profoundly change site conditions, significantly affects urban animal diversity. As a first multi-taxon study of this kind, we analyzed the effects of Robinia dominance on 18 arthropod taxa by pairwise comparisons of woodlands in Berlin, Germany, that were dominated by R. pseudoacacia or the native pioneer tree Betula pendula. As a negative effect, abundances of five arthropod taxa decreased (Chilopoda, Formicidae, Diptera, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera); 13 others were not affected. Woodland type affected species composition of carabids and functional groups in spiders, but surprisingly did not decrease alpha and beta diversity of carabid and spider assemblages or the number of endangered species. Tree invasion thus did not induce biotic homogenization at the habitat scale. We detected no positive effects of alien dominance. Our results illustrate that invasions by a major tree invader can induce species turnover in ground-dwelling arthropods, but do not necessarily reduce arthropod species abundances or diversity and might thus contribute to the conservation of epigeal invertebrates in urban settings. Considering the context of invasion impacts thus helps to set priorities in managing biological invasions and can illustrate the potential of novel ecosystems to maintain urban biodiversity...|$|E

40|$|The {{change of}} the {{location}} of the beehives on the diverse honeyfull pastures is the usual apiarists activity in the Republic of Croatia. The main reasons are the climatic and vegetation diversity, and richness of the floral composition, with numerous bee forage plants. Our study aimed to detect consequences of honeybee broods (Queen-bee of different lineage) moving, from one habitat to another at various type of beehives. The Alberti-Žnideršič (AŽ), Langstroth-Root (LR) and Dadant-Blatt (DB) beehive types, constructed of (lime-tree), have been used. After the bee forage on the Oilseed Rape in the beginning of April, the honeybee brood has been veterinary inspected (based on the Law of animal health protection in the Republic of Croatia) for varrosis, nosemosis and American foulbrood diseases. The same procedure was done after bee forage (<b>False</b> <b>acacia)</b> at the end of May. All of the honeybees belong to the European race Apis mellifera carnica. The results of the study pointed out that different beehive types and the Queen-bee lineage (natural and selected) affect development of disease inside the honeybee brood, during the relocation and change from one dominant bee forage plants to another. Certain allergy reactions occurring in people can be caused by the pollen of some honefull plants such as birch, grasses, ragweed, goldenrod and hazel. Such cases are also included in our investigations. Beekeepers and nature lovers sensitive to pollen allergens of some honeyfull plants should, in some calendar period, avoid ecological milieu with such plants...|$|E
40|$|Sijsselt Wood, since 1427 {{part of the}} Kernhem Estate, was in the 15 th century an oak coppice and moorland area, {{sufficient}} to supply Kernhem with firewood. The inhabitants of the neighbouring hamlet of Maanen however were of old allowed to graze their sheep and to cut peat in this area. The Sijsselt Moorlands were essential for their farming economy. Sheepfarming prevented all extension of woodlands while the remainder dwindled into thin shrubbery. Conflicts between the Lords of Kernhem and the farmers over their grazing rights were numerous. A general scarcity of timber in Western Europe stimulated forestry in the 18 th century. Afforestation of the Sijsselt started in 1769 by planting of oak coppice and planting as well as sowing of Scots pines. Coppice growing was soon stopped but sowing of Scots pines was continued and succesful. Induced by increasing coppice prices and the damage by the caterpillar Panolis flammea Schiff, afforestation with pine retreated to second place about 1850 in favour of oak coppice and beech. But economic conditions were altering: artificial tan was imported; as fuel wood was replaced by coal and oil and the mines asked for pitprops.

In recent years, {{some papers}} about the {{volatile}} composition of no.,oak heartwoods {{have been shown}} in scientific literature, {{with a view to}} their use in cooperage, although only oak and chestnut are approved by OIV to wine aging. Many volatile compounds were identified in seasoned and toasted no oak heartwoods, among them lignin and carbohydrate and lipid derivatives. On the whole, compared to oak, toasted acacia and chestnut woods showed a very high richness of these compounds, as lignin as lipid and carbohydrate derivatives, while cherry and ash werericher than toasted oak wood in lignin derivatives, but poorer in lipid ahd carbohydrate derivatives, showing sorne compounds that could be considered chemical markers for each one of these woods. In the present work, the wood related volatile composition of six wines (four red, one white, and one rosé) aged using barreis and chips of cherry, chestimt, <b>false</b> <b>acacia,</b> ash and oak wood was studied by GC-MS, to know if the volatile compounds that no oak woods contribute to wines can be used as chemical markers, and to classify the wines according to aging method. A total of more than 80 volatile compounds were studied, among furanic compounds, lactones, enolone stmctures, simple phenols, mono, di and trimethoxyphenols, phenolic aldehydes, ketones, ethers, acids, alkyl esters and alcohols. Most of them have been previotisly described in different varietal wines aged in oak, but some were only detected in wines aged in contact with other wood specie. As a rule, some differences in the wood related volatile composition ofwines were detected regarding both, the levels of compounds provided by each wood species and the different evolution in wines during aging in banels or in contact with chips.

30|$|Marasmius rotula [Scop.] Fr. (Pinwheel mushroom) (deposited at the German {{collection}} of microorganisms and cell cultures--DSMZ, collection number DSM 25031) was isolated from fruiting bodies that had developed on a meadow near Senftenberg (Germany) containing subsurface woody debris of Rubinia pseudoacacia (<b>False</b> <b>Acacia).</b> To confirm the strain affiliation to M. rotula at molecular level, the complete {{internal transcribed spacer}} (ITS) region including the 5.8 S rRNA sequence of the ribosomal DNA was analyzed. For this, the isolated culture was grown on agar containing 1 % malt extract and 0.5 % glucose. Thereafter, genomic DNA was extracted from 100 mg homogenized fungal mycelium using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification of genomic DNA was performed in a total volume of 20 μl containing 2 μl template, 9 μl GoTaq Green Master Mix, and 0.4 μl 25 pmol of each of two general fungal ITS-rDNA primers ITS 1 and ITS 4 (White et al. 1990) using standard cycling conditions. The direct sequencing of resulting 777 bp amplicon cleaned with ExoSAP-IT (USB Europe GmbH, Staufen, Germany) was performed on an ABI PRISM 3730 × l Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) using the Big Dye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems). The quality of the obtained sequence was checked by visual inspection of the electropherogram using a Sequence Scanner v. 1.0 (Applied Biosystems) and edited using BioEdit v. 7.0. 9 (Hall 1999). A nucleotide BLAST search at GenBank database (Zhang et al. 2000) in September 2011 revealed several hundred homologous sequences from Marasmius and related genera.
