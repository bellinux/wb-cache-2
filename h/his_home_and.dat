5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it.

Instead, he personally paid for his commute between <b>his</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> the railroad's offices.|$|E
