40|$|Institutional {{freedom is}} {{considered}} one of the most important factor in the debate of economic growth of nations. The most prominent kinds of institutional freedom which actively take part in economic prosperity are <b>democracy</b> (political liberalization) <b>and</b> economic <b>freedom</b> (business liberalization). The nature of impact of <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>freedom</b> on nationâ€™s economic growth is not crystal clear. The nature of impact of <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>freedom</b> on national well being directly indirectly depends on social, economic, political, geographical and cultural aspects of society. This dissertation presents the overview of significance of <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>freedom</b> for Pakistanâ€™s economic growth. This thesis starts with the explanation of notion of <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> comprehensive review of various measures of level of <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>freedom.</b> Followed by theoretical and graphical analysis of economic <b>freedom</b> economic growth <b>and</b> <b>democracy</b> economic growth trends in Pakistan. For empirical investigation this study measured the indexes of level of economic <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> <b>democracy</b> annually. â€œAlliance for Restoration of Democracy in Asiaâ€� (ARDA) and â€œThe Fraser Institute Canadaâ€� methodologies are adopted for measurement of <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>freedom</b> respectively, while statistics of growth proxies are taken from State Bank of Pakistan and Federal Bureau of Statistics government of Pakistan reports. For study period 1970 to 2007 this thesis has constructed the data set of 38 annual observations. The most recent econometric technique ARDL approach is employed for examination of long run and short run relationships between targeted variables. To observe the comprehensive impact of institutional <b>freedoms</b> (<b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> economic <b>freedom)</b> on economic growth of Pakistanâ€™s economy this study regress a number of regressions. Therefore in sum economic freedom in the presence of poor infrastructure and illiterate society in Pakistan hindered the pace of economic prosperity. Democracy on the other hand approximately enhances the pace of economic growth, but apart from national incomes growth proxiesâ€™ democracy shown insignificant touches toward growth proxies of financial, capital and fiscal markets. The most important finding of this dissertation is that, stable democratization alone is not to key of economic growth in Pakistan but it is necessary condition. Therefore, Pakistan will have to focus on stable democrization, which ultimately will encourage or reinforce the economic <b>freedom</b> <b>and</b> economic growth...|$|R

As opposed to an autocracy with no or limited press freedom, a free press in a democracy can inform voters about the corruption of political representatives, and voters in turn can punish incumbents by electing opposition parties. The empirical investigation carried out in this paper shows that <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> press <b>freedom</b> can have significant impact on corruption. Though corruption may persist in the short- to medium-run, an increase in voters' participation <b>and</b> press <b>freedom</b> can reduce corruption. Political Economy,...|$|R
25|$|The 2015 general {{election}} {{was the fourth}} {{general election}} contested by the governing incumbent Justice and Development Party (AKP). Since the party observes a by-law that imposes a three-term limit on its MPs, AKP parliamentarians elected in 2002, 2007 and 2011 were unable to seek re-election in 2015. Many AKP MPs standing down due to the three-term rule were either former or serving ministers, nine of which were serving in the outgoing First Davutoğlu Cabinet. The Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) observes a two-term limit, meaning that all MPs elected in 2007 from the Thousand Hope Candidates block and re-elected in 2011 from the Labour, <b>Democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>Freedom</b> Block were unable to contest the election from within the HDP party lists.|$|E
25|$|During {{the revolutionary}} {{government}} of colonel Jacobo Árbenz, the opposition - mainly formed by Guatemalan landlords and United Fruit Company executives - was completely against any reform {{that the government}} of Juan José Arévalo had established: social security, creation of commercial and public labor unions, <b>democracy</b> <b>and</b> <b>freedom</b> of press, among others. At the election of Árbenz in 1950, the Guatemalan elite was desperate, but most of its members hoped that the new president would back out of the policies of his predecessor, whom they accused of communism. Árbenz' image convinced them of that: the Guatemalan colonel was married to María Cristina Vilanova, a lady from the Salvadorian elite. He was an Army officer, lived in a mansion in zone 10 in Guatemala City and had the proper aristocratic presence. But their hopes were shattered when Árbenz supported the formation of the Guatemalan Communist Party and then pushed for aggressive agrarian reform. Confronted with the situation, the opposition had only one clear goal: to defend the privileges that they had enjoyed in Guatemala for generations and so they embraced anticommunism to justify their fight against the government. On the other hand, the middle class enjoyed benefits that allowed them to prosper and they were loyal to Árbenz. The peasants were {{for the first time since}} the Rafael Carrera government treated with respect and dignity.|$|E
