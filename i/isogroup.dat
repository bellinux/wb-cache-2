40|$|Zoophytophagous predators can {{substitute}} zoophagy for phytophagy {{to complete their}} development and reproduction. In such predators, variation in feeding behaviour is observed both across and within populations. This {{may be caused by}} genetic variation in diet specialization, some genotypes specializing on plant resources, whereas others rely mostly on prey to meet their energy and nutriment requirements. We tested the hypothesis that genotypes specialize either on prey or plant resources in the zoophytophagous mullein bug Campylomma verbasci. In the laboratory, we reared 11 <b>isogroup</b> lines of the mullein bug and recorded feeding behaviour on two diets. The first diet was composed of two-spotted spider mites and leaves, and in the second we added pollen, a high-quality vegetal resource. Overall differences in zoophagy among <b>isogroup</b> lines remained consistent regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} pollen. While some lines were insensitive to changes in trophic resource composition others switched from prey to pollen feeding when the pollen was available, revealing a negative genetic correlation between the probabilities of feeding on both resources. A significant line by diet interaction in the proportion of time spent feeding on prey in presence or absence of pollen indicated a genetic basis for diet preference. In absence of the preferred resource, nymphs act as generalists, but exhibited individual diet specialisation when facing the choice between high-quality animal and vegetal resources. Results suggest that zoophytophagous predators can exhibit genetic variation in diet preference, which can generate important ecological and economic differences in natural or agricultural systems...|$|E

However, little emphasis {{has been given to}} the description of these arthropods from cellular and evolutionary perspectives. In this report, we describe a transcriptomic analysis of the Mexican scorpion Centruroides noxius Hoffmann, performed with a pyrosequencing platform. Three independent sequencing experiments were carried out, each including three different cDNA libraries constructed from RNA extracted from the whole body of the scorpion after telson removal, and from the venom gland before and after venom extraction. Over three million reads were obtained and assembled in almost 19000 <b>isogroups.</b> Within the telson-specific sequences, 72 <b>isogroups</b> (0. 4 % of total unique transcripts) were found to be similar to toxins previously reported in other scorpion species, spiders and sea anemones. The annotation pipeline also revealed the presence of important elements of the small non-coding RNA processing machinery, as well as microRNA candidates. A phylogenomic analysis of concatenated essential genes evidenced differential evolution rates in this species, particularly in ribosomal proteins and proteasome components. Additionally, statistical comparison of transcript abundance before and after venom extraction showed that 3 % and 2 % of the assembled <b>isogroups</b> had higher expression levels in the active and replenishing gland, respectively. Thus, our sequencing and annotation strategies provide a general view of the cellular and molecular processes that take place in these arthropods, allowed the discovery of new pharmacological and biotechnological targets and uncovered several regulatory and metabolic responses behind the assembly of the scorpion venom. The results obtained in this report represent the first high-throughput study that thoroughly describes the universe of genes that are expressed in the scorpion Centruroides noxius Hoffmann, a highly relevant organism from medical and evolutionary perspectives...|$|R

Many efforts have been devoted to increasing the number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for A. japonicus, but a comprehensive characterization of its transcriptome remains lacking. Here, we performed the large-scale transcriptome profiling and characterization by pyrosequencing diverse cDNA libraries from A. japonicus. Results: In total, 1, 061, 078 reads were obtained by 454 sequencing of eight cDNA libraries representing different developmental stages and adult tissues in A. japonicus.

40|$|Noccaea caerulescens is an extremophile {{plant species}} {{belonging}} to the Brassicaceae family. It has adapted to grow on soils containing high, normally toxic, concentrations of metals such as nickel, zinc and cadmium. Next to being extremely tolerant to these metals, {{it is one of}} the few species known to hyperaccumulate these metals to extremely high concentrations in their aboveground biomass. In order to provide additional molecular resources for this model metal hyperaccumulator species to study and understand the mechanism of heavy metal exposure adaptation, we aimed to provide a comprehensive database of transcript sequences for N. caerulescens. In this study, 23830 transcript sequences (isotigs) with an average length of 1025 bps were determined for roots, shoots and inflorescences of N. caerulescens accession ‘Ganges’ by Roche GS-FLEX 454 pyrosequencing. These isotigs were grouped into 20, 378 <b>isogroups,</b> representing potential genes. This is a large expansion of the existing N. caerulescens transcriptome set consisting of 3705 unigenes. When compared to a Brassicaceae proteome set, 22, 232 (93. 2 %) of the N. caerulescens isotigs (corresponding to 19191 <b>isogroups)</b> had a significant match and could be annotated accordingly. Of the remaining sequences, 98 isotigs resembled non-plant sequences and 1386 had no significant similarity to any sequence in the GenBank database. Among the annotated set there were many isotigs with similarity to metal homeostasis genes or genes for glucosinolate biosynthesis.

40|$|Abstract Background The naid annelids {{contain a}} number of species that vary {{in their ability to}} {{regenerate}} lost body parts, making them excellent candidates for evolution of regeneration studies. However, scant sequence data exists to facilitate such studies. We constructed a cDNA library from the naid Pristina leidyi, a species that is highly regenerative and also reproduces asexually by fission, using material from a range of regeneration and fission stages for our library. We then sequenced the transcriptome of P. leidyi using 454 technology. Results 454 sequencing produced 1, 550, 174 reads with an average read length of 376 nucleotides. Assembly of 454 sequence reads resulted in 64, 522 <b>isogroups</b> and 46, 679 singletons for a total of 111, 201 unigenes in this transcriptome. We estimate that over 95 % of the transcripts in our library are present in our transcriptome. 17. 7 % of <b>isogroups</b> had significant BLAST hits to the UniProt database and these include putative homologs of {{a number of}} genes relevant to regeneration research. Although many sequences are incomplete, the mean sequence length of transcripts (isotigs) is 707 nucleotides. Thus, many sequences are large enough to be immediately useful for downstream applications such as gene expression analyses. Using in situ hybridization, we show that two Wnt/β-catenin pathway genes (homologs of frizzled and β-catenin) present in our transcriptome are expressed in the regeneration blastema of P. leidyi, demonstrating the usefulness of this resource for regeneration research. Conclusions 454 sequencing is a rapid and efficient approach for identifying large numbers of genes in an organism that lacks a sequenced genome. This transcriptome dataset will be a valuable resource for molecular analyses of regeneration in P. leidyi and will serve {{as a starting point for}} comparisons to non-regenerating naids.

So far limited genetic research has focused on this group of animals largely due to the lack of sufficient genetic or genomic resources. Here, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to produce the most comprehensive expressed sequence tag resource for Zhikong scallop (Chlamys farreri), and conducted the first transcriptome comparison for scallops. RESULTS: In a single 454 sequencing run, 1, 033, 636 reads were produced and then assembled into 26, 165 contigs. These contigs were then clustered into 24, 437 isotigs and further grouped into 20, 056 <b>isogroups.</b> About 47 % of the <b>isogroups</b> showed significant matches to known proteins based on sequence similarity. Transcripts putatively involved in growth, reproduction and stress/immune-response were identified through Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses. Transcriptome comparison with Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) revealed similar patterns of GO representation. Moreover, 38 putative fast-evolving genes were identified through analyzing the orthologous gene pairs between the two scallop species. More than 46, 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 350 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also detected. CONCLUSION: Our study provides the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource currently available for C. farreri. Based on this resource, we performed the first large-scale transcriptome comparison between the two scallop species, C. farreri and P. yessoensis, and identified a number of putative fast-evolving genes, which may {{play an important}} role in scallop speciation and/or local adaptation.

40|$|Background The {{reproductive}} {{mechanisms of}} mollusk {{species have been}} interesting targets in biological research because of the diverse reproductive strategies observed in this phylum. These species have also been studied {{for the development of}} fishery technologies in molluscan aquaculture. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying the reproductive process have been well studied in animal models, the relevant information from mollusks remains limited, particularly in species of great commercial interest. Crassostrea hongkongensis is the dominant oyster species that is distributed along the coast of the South China Sea and little genomic information on this species is available. Currently, high-throughput sequencing techniques have been widely used for investigating the basis of physiological processes and facilitating the establishment of adequate genetic selection programs. Results The C. hongkongensis transcriptome included a total of 1, 595, 855 reads, which were generated by 454 sequencing and were assembled into 41, 472 contigs using de novo methods. Contigs were clustered into 33, 920 isotigs and further grouped into 22, 829 <b>isogroups.</b> Approximately 77. 6 % of the <b>isogroups</b> were successfully annotated by the Nr database. More than 1, 910 genes were identified as being related to reproduction. Some key genes involved in germline development, sex determination and differentiation were identified {{for the first time in}} C. hongkongensis (nanos, piwi, ATRX, FoxL 2, beta-catenin, etc.). Gene expression analysis indicated that vasa, nanos, piwi, ATRX, FoxL 2, beta-catenin and SRD 5 A 1 were highly or specifically expressed in C. hongkongensis gonads. Additionally, 94, 056 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 1, 699 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were compiled.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe term {{dangerous}} universal {{blood donor}} refers to potential agglutination of the erythrocytes of non-O recipients due to plasma of an O blood group donor, which contains high titers of anti-A and/or anti-B hemagglutinins. Thus, prior titration of anti-A and anti-B hemagglutinins is recommended to prevent transfusion reactions. ObjectiveThe {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the frequency of dangerous universal donors in the blood bank of Belo Horizonte (Fundação Central de Imuno-Hematologia – Fundação Hemominas – Minas Gerais) by determining the titers of anti-A and anti-B hemagglutinins in O blood group donors. MethodA total of 400 O blood group donors were randomly selected, from March 2014 to January 2015. The titers of anti-A and anti-B hemagglutinins (IgM and IgG classes) were obtained using the tube titration technique. Dangerous donors were those whose titers of anti-A or anti-B IgM were ≥ 128 and/or the titers of anti-A or anti-B IgG were ≥ 256. Donors were characterized according to gender, age and ethnicity. The hemagglutinins were characterized by specificity (anti-A and anti-B) and antibody class (IgG and IgM). ResultsAlmost one-third (30. 5 %) of the O blood group donors were universal dangerous. The frequency among women was higher than that of men (p-value= 0. 019; odds ratio: 1. 66; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 08 – 2. 56) and among young donors (18 – 29 years old) it was higher than for donors between 49 and 59 years old (p-value= 0. 015; odds ratio: 3. 05; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 22 – 7. 69). There was no significant association between dangerous universal donors and ethnicity, agglutinin specificity or antibody class.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, de novo {{transcriptome}} assembly {{of these two}} pepper varieties Saengryeg 211 and Saengryeg 213 were performed by GS Roche Assembler Newbler, which, unlike other assemblers, created isotigs from contigs that are consistently connected by a subset of reads and correspond to alternative transcripts (owing to splicing variants). The reads obtained from the sequencing runs were assembled into isotigs and singletons and were organized into 'isogroups’. Isotigs, which shared the reads, were categorized into the same <b>isogroup.</b> Average lengths of these isotigs were observed to be larger than lengths obtained previously, namely 100  bp for maize (Barbazuk et al. 2007), 247  bp for eucalyptus (Novaes et al. 2008) because of the enhanced performance owing to improvements for longer reads {{and that of the}} efficient Roche 454 instrumentation assembler software (Parchman et al. 2010). The majority of pepper EST sequences used in the current project as reference had been first assembled by Kim et al. (2008) in which 22, 011 unigenes were assembled with an average consensus sequences length of 1, 688  bp. The 454 system generates long sequences but suffers from low sequence depth. However, in recent studies for diploid genome systems in plants, where genome duplication and polyploidy are prevalent, whole genomic samples from large mapping populations are sequenced for complex traits association studies. These have mostly relied on low sequencing coverage at lower depth (2 - 4 x) (Li et al. 2011; Deschamps et al. 2012) which is an attractive strategy for marker discovery from de novo characterized samples (Altshuler et al. 2010). The performance of the NGS technologies at low sequence coverage is correlated with per-base sequence coverage uniformity; where Roche 454, with the most uniform coverage, performs the best and suggests that for all the NGS technologies, achieving more uniform sequence coverage would result in considerably higher performance at lower coverage. It provides a powerful and cost-effective alternative to sequencing smaller numbers of individuals at high depth (Flannick et al. 2012).|$|E

To gain functional knowledge of D. gallinae transcripts, sequences were mapped to Gene Ontology terms, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathways and parsed to InterProScan. The transcriptome dataset provides new insights in general mite genetics and lays a foundation {{for future studies on}} stage-specific transcriptomics as well as genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic explorations and might provide new perspectives to control this parasitic mite by identifying possible drug targets or vaccine candidates. It is also worth noting that in different tested species of the class Arachnida no 28 S rRNA was detectable in the rRNA profile, indicating that 28 S rRNA might consists of two separate, hydrogen-bonded fragments, whose (heat-induced) disruption may led to co-migration with 18 S rRNA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Amaranthus hypochondriacus, a grain amaranth, is a C 4 plant {{noted by}} {{its ability to}} {{tolerate}} stressful conditions and produce highly nutritious seeds. These possess an optimal amino acid balance and constitute {{a rich source of}} health-promoting peptides. Although several recent studies, mostly involving subtractive hybridization strategies, have contributed to increase the relatively low number of grain amaranth expressed sequence tags (ESTs), transcriptomic information of this species remains limited, particularly regarding tissue-specific and biotic stress-related genes. Thus, a large scale transcriptome analysis was performed to generate stem- and (a) biotic stress-responsive gene expression profiles in grain amaranth. Results A total of 2, 700, 168 raw reads were obtained from six 454 pyrosequencing runs, which were assembled into 21, 207 high quality sequences (20, 408 isotigs + 799 contigs). The average sequence length was 1, 064 bp and 930 bp for isotigs and contigs, respectively. Only 5, 113 singletons were recovered after quality control. Contigs/isotigs were further incorporated into 15, 667 <b>isogroups.</b> All unique sequences were queried against the nr, TAIR, UniRef 100, UniRef 50 and Amaranthaceae EST databases for annotation. Functional GO annotation was performed with all contigs/isotigs that produced significant hits with the TAIR database. Only 8, 260 sequences were found to be homologous when the transcriptomes of A. tuberculatus and A. hypochondriacus were compared, most of which were associated with basic house-keeping processes. Digital expression analysis identified 1, 971 differentially expressed genes in response to at least one of four stress treatments tested. These included several multiple-stress-inducible genes that could represent potential candidates for use in the engineering of stress-resistant plants. The transcriptomic data generated from pigmented stems shared similarity with findings reported in developing stems of Arabidopsis and black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa). Conclusions This study represents the first large-scale transcriptomic analysis of A. hypochondriacus, considered to be a highly nutritious and stress-tolerant crop. Numerous genes were found to be induced in response to (a) biotic stress, many of which could further the understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to multiple stress-resistance in plants, a trait that has potential biotechnological applications in agriculture. </p...|$|R

Although the coastal and interior varieties of Douglas-fir (vars. menziesii and glauca) are native to North America, the coastal variety is also widely planted for timber production in Europe, New Zealand, Australia, and Chile. Our main goal was to develop a SNP resource large enough to facilitate genomic selection in Douglas-fir breeding programs. To accomplish this, we developed a 454 -based reference transcriptome for coastal Douglas-fir, annotated and evaluated the quality of the reference, identified putative SNPs, and then validated a sample of those SNPs using the Illumina Infinium genotyping platform. Results: We assembled a reference transcriptome consisting of 25, 002 <b>isogroups</b> (unique gene models) and 102, 623 singletons from 2. 76 million 454 and Sanger cDNA sequences from coastal Douglas-fir. We identified 278, 979 unique SNPs by mapping the 454 and Sanger sequences to the reference, and by mapping four datasets of Illumina cDNA sequences from multiple seed sources, genotypes, and tissues. The Illumina datasets represented coastal Douglas-fir (64. 00 and 13. 41 million reads), interior Douglas-fir (80. 45 million reads), and a Yakima population similar to interior Douglas-fir (8. 99 million reads). We assayed 8067 SNPs on 260 trees using an Illumina Infinium SNP genotyping array. Of these SNPs, 5847 (72. 5...|$|R
40|$|Some {{plants can}} {{tolerate}} and accumulate unusually {{high levels of}} toxic metals, and the analysis of such plants can provide insights into the ecology of environments that are polluted with heavy metals due to human industrial activities. The study of heavy metal hyperaccumulators such as Noccaea caerulescens can show how plants cope with excess metals and increase their fitness when growing in metalliferous environments. In this thesis, I compared the molecular mechanisms of zinc (Zn) homeostasis and cadmium (Cd) response in the hyperaccumulator species N. caerulescens and its non-accumulator relative Arabidopsis thalianaby investigating the regulation of the ZNT 1 /ZIP 4 gene that promotes Zn uptake and Zn/Cd tolerance. I also studied the ecological advantages of metal hyperaccumulators in nature and determined the DNA sequences of the N. caerulescens transcriptometo find candidate genes that control metal hyperaccumulation and provide an evolutionary perspective on the emergence of this trait. The functional characterization of the N. caerulescens and A. thaliana Zn-transporter genes NcZNT 1 and AtZIP 4 (and their promoters) showed how their differential expression pattern contributed to their role in metal tolerance and accumulation. The NcZNT 1 gene is induced by Zn deficiency and the NcZNT 1 protein is localized in the plasma membrane. Transgenic N. caerulescens roots containing a transgene for the green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the NcZNT 1 promoter revealed GFP fluorescence localized to pericycle and vascular tissues. This suggests that NcZNT 1 contributes to metal loading into the xylem and long-distance metal transport. The overexpression of NcZNT 1 in A. thaliana increased Zn and Cd tolerance {{and the capacity to}} accumulate these metals compared to wild-type plants. These results suggest that NcZNT 1 {{plays an important role in}} Zn and Cd hypertolerance and hyperaccumulation in N. caerulescens, where it is expressed in both Zn-sufficient and Zn-excess conditions. The differential activity of the NcZNT 1 and AtZIP 4 promoters in N. caerulescens and A. thaliana implies that different cis-regulatory elements and trans-regulatory factors are present in both species. The ecological advantage of hyperaccumulators in metal-contaminated soils was investigated by studying a natural nas 1 mutant, in which the Nicotianamine Synthase 1 gene is disrupted by a transposon insertion. This mutant allele was found in three natural N. caerulescens populations, which were compared to wild-type plants in terms of phenotype and adaptive advantage. Although the transposon disrupted the gene, the loss of NAS 1 gene activity was compensated by enhanced expression of NAS 3 and NAS 4, resulting in increased nicotianamine (NA) production, which enhanced the Zn and Cd accumulation in the nas 1 mutants. This increased their metal sensitivity compared to wild-type plants, but also made them more toxic towards Pieris rapae caterpillars, which developed more slowly and gained less weight when fed on mutant plants exposed to excess Zn or Cd. Therefore, the possible selective advantage of the nas 1 mutant in nature is high metal accumulation and the protection of plants from herbivores. Differences in nas 1 allele frequency among the three natural populations suggests that nas 1 alleles experience different degrees of natural selection or may be at different stages on the route to fixation. Molecular evolutionary studies involve the identification of candidate genes that play a role in adaptation. Therefore, a comprehensive set of transcript sequences was obtained from N. caerulescens accession Ganges (GA) by 454 pyrosequencing. In total, the collected 23, 836 isotigs (putative transcripts) were grouped into 20, 378 <b>isogroups</b> and 93. 2 % of them could be matched to Brassicaceae protein sequences, which allowedtheir functional annotation. A total of 87 <b>isogroups</b> was annotated as metal homeostasis related genes, including metal transporter families, metal chelator biosynthesis families, and metal tolerance gene families, which are candidate genes for the molecular analysis of heavy metal homeostasis mechanisms. A group of genes required for the synthesis of glucosinolates, which are important secondary metabolites that protect plants against herbivores, were also shown to be expressed in N. caerulescens. The METALLOTHIONEIN 3 (MT 3) gene was found to have been duplicated in the N. caerulescens genome, when compared to related Brassicaceae. These transcript sequences will provide an important tool to annotate the genome sequence of the N. caerulescensGanges accession, which is in progress. This genome sequence will also be the basis of genome comparisons between the different N. caerulescens accessions that have different levels of metal accumulation and metal tolerance and which may therefore differ in terms of gene expression levels or modes of actions that affect metal homeostasis...|$|R
