This situation was compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less than anticipated because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Construction in Norway {{has always}} been {{characterized}} {{by the need to}} shelter people, animals, and property from harsh weather, including predictably cold winters and frost, heavy precipitation in certain areas, wind and storms; and {{to make the most of}} scarce building resources. Until modern times, transportation infrastructure was also primitive, and builders largely <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> locally available materials.|$|E

Rowers {{sat on the}} weather deck {{on either side of}} the main armament with the oar ports placed on a rectangular outrigger which improved their leverage. However, they were positioned {{on either side of the}} centerline battery and could not row under fire; in action, the udema <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> its sails for propulsion.|$|E
5|$|Militarily, it is {{difficult}} to draw many lessons from Salamis, because of the uncertainty about what actually happened. Once again the Allies chose their ground well in order to negate Persian numbers, but this time (unlike Thermopylae) <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> the Persians launching an unnecessary attack for their position to count.

5|$|Severus Alexander {{held him}} in high esteem {{and made him}} his consul again. His Roman History spans nearly a millennium, from the arrival of Aeneas in Italy until the year 229. As a {{contemporary}} of Elagabalus, Cassius Dio's account of his reign is generally considered more reliable than the Augustan History, although {{by his own admission}} Dio spent the greater part of the relevant period outside of Rome and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> second-hand information.|$|E

5|$|The French {{primarily}} {{viewed the}} colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> {{the dregs of}} the French civil service. Only the Sara of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} Fort Duperre, the commandos received {{reports that}} a force of some 2,000 Zouaves were moving up to recapture the position. The French attack did not eventuate, however, {{and in the end}} the commandos marched all the way to Maison Blanche. Having only been issued with rations for a day, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> fruit and bread that they obtained by bartering with the locals on the way. Eventually they arrived at the port, where they embarked upon the destroyers HMS Wheatland and Lammerton and in company with a force of US Rangers they set out to capture the airfields at Allerlick and Duzzerville, near Bone.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{found little}} success after 1978 in Formula One– {{he failed to}} win another grand prix.

In 1980, he was paired with the young Italian Elio de Angelis, and briefly with test driver Nigel Mansell, but the team was again unsuccessful.|$|E

They <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> journalists from many news agencies, especially those in the BBC News's Baghdad Bureau high-risk team, to smuggle the tapes out of Iraq. When curfews were enforced, weeks passed before the producers received new footage because it was impossible for anybody to leave their homes or the country.|$|E
5|$|Task Force Kean {{kicked off}} its attack on 7 August, moving out from Masan. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade surged forward to Pansong, quickly inflicting 350 {{casualties}} on the North Koreans as it overran the North Korean 6th Division's headquarters. The other {{units of the}} Task Force, however, were slowed by North Korean resistance. Task Force Kean pressed on the Chindong-ni area, resulting in a confused battle where the fragmented force <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> air strikes and airdrops to keep it effective. Task Force Kean's offensive had collided with one being delivered simultaneously by the North Korean 6th Division.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean People's Army {{forces were}} {{organized}} into a mechanized combined arms force of ten divisions, originally numbering some 90,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops in July, {{with hundreds of}} T-34 Tanks. However, defensive actions by U.S. and South Korean forces had delayed the North Koreans significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops {{and a large number}} of tanks. In order to recoup these losses, the North Koreans <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> less experienced replacements and conscripts, many of whom had been taken from the conquered regions of South Korea.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies were {{selected}} to represent the Coastal Division by virtue of a tie-breaking head-to-head victory against division rival Georgia Tech and came into the game with an 8–4 record (5–3 in ACC play). Representing the Atlantic Division was Boston College, which had a 9–3 record (5–3 ACC). The two teams were the victors of a closely contested season in the ACC. Neither team clinched {{a spot in the}} game until the final week before the championship, and both <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> conference tie-breaking rules to earn a spot. The game was a rematch of the previous year's contest, which Virginia Tech won, 30–16.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} Burgoyne's {{campaign}} was significant. Not only had he lost nearly 1,000 men, of which half were regulars, {{but he also}} lost the crucial Indian support. In a council following the battle, many of the Indians (who had traveled with him from Quebec) decided to go home. This loss severely hampered Burgoyne's reconnaissance efforts {{in the days to}} come. The failure to bring in nearby supplies meant that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> supply lines that were already dangerously long, and that he eventually broke in September. The shortage of supplies was a significant factor in his decision to surrender at Saratoga, following which France entered the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} funded {{flood control}} projects involving {{the building of}} , thus aiding the speed of waterborne transport and allowing undeveloped areas to become irrigated farmlands. These conscription labor projects allowed for the building of new hamlets which were dependent on the government for their livelihoods. When {{the authority of the}} central government declined in the late Eastern Han period, many commoners living in such hamlets were forced to flee their lands and work as tenants on large estates of wealthy landowners. The people of older hamlets which never <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> central government projects for their wellbeing or existence often sought support from powerful local families.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the new perspective, SFS also addresses some commonly raised limitations of other distributed file systems. For example, NFS and SMB clients <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> the server for file system security policies, and NFS servers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> the client computer for authentication. This often complicates security, as one compromised computer could breach {{the security of the}} entire organization. The NFS and SMB protocols also do not by themselves provide confidentiality (encryption) or tamper resistance from other computers on the network, without encapsulation layers such as IPsec.|$|R
5|$|Although {{its total}} {{strength}} {{was estimated at}} 185,500 men in late May 1944, the 2nd Panzer Army {{was not able to}} rally more than 16,000 troops for Operation Rösselsprung due to ever-increasing Partisan activity throughout the country. The Germans <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> special forces and improved tactics. The Partisans defended the territory they controlled with significant demolition and mining of roads. Roadblocks were manned by patrols and smaller detachments, whose task was to hold off the enemy until reinforcements arrived. During Operation Rösselsprung, the Germans rendered these tactics ineffective by combining strong and fast motorised columns with adequate pioneer support. This combination was especially successful for the column led by the 92nd Motorised Regiment. The second German tactical innovation was the employment of five reconnaissance battalions for independent operations deep inside Partisan-controlled territory.|$|E
5|$|During {{these early}} {{performances}} Verdi made substantial {{changes to the}} score. For some of these he altered his manuscript, but for others musicologists have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> the numerous full and piano scores put out by Ricordi. Further changes were made for the Paris premiere in 1894, which are also inadequately documented. Ricordi attempted {{to keep up with}} the changes, issuing new edition after new edition, but the orchestral and piano scores were often mutually contradictory. The Verdi scholar James Hepokoski considers that a definitive score of the opera is impossible, leaving companies and conductors to choose between a variety of options. In a 2013 study Philip Gossett disagrees, believing that the autograph is essentially a reliable source, augmented by contemporary Ricordi editions for the few passages that Verdi omitted to amend in his own score.|$|E
5|$|Hill and Cape {{appealed to}} the London Court of Quarter Sessions.

The panel of twelve magistrates who heard the appeal <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>rely</b> <b>on</b> passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the Director of Public Prosecutions had refused to release copies for them to read. After deliberating for only five minutes, they upheld Biron's decision.|$|E
