To evaluate the perceptions of the <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> involved in affordable rehabilitation housing with Corporation X, face-to-face or Skype interviews were carried out. The results showed positive aspects, as well as attributes to be improved, from the <b>general</b> <b>contractors?</b> perspective. Although the contractors do not expect a sizable return on investment, their morale is high due to the satisfaction they feel knowing they are helping underprivileged communities. The cost constraint compounded by the poor existing condition of the houses challenge the ability of <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> to attain quality standards.

40|$|Abstract—Many {{small and}} medium {{contractors}} have experienced liquidity crisis due to recession of construction business according to global financial crisis in 2008. Those got to soon fall into serious financial difficulty because of profitability worsening and short-term debt, so many poor and dishonored <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> appeared due to strengthening of loan conditions of bank/financial sector. Comparatively large <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> could cope with liquidity crisis by using diversification and various financing methods, but small and medium <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> has relatively experienced bigger difficulty due to unified business structure and nonexistence of financing methods. Accordingly, {{this study has}} analyzed relationship on financial structure by an enterprise scale through empirical analysis by targeting <b>general</b> <b>contractors</b> under global financial crisis in last 2008. Based on Financial Statements {{of a total of}} 358 <b>general</b> <b>contractors,</b> this study has performed correlation analysis and T-Test analysis by extracting an enterprise scale variable, a composition variable of current liabilities and long-term liabilities. As a result of this study, financing status of small and medium contractors is relatively poor, compared to a large company, and it was analyzed that direct financing is mostly impossible. Besides, it was analyzed that direct financing through banks and financial sectors is also difficult. Based on the analysis results like this, this study has suggested a method for solving liquidity crisis of small and medium <b>general</b> <b>contractors.</b> The first method is to secure transparency of financial activity of <b>general</b> <b>contractors,</b> and the second method is to ease lending practice of banks and financial sectors. The third method is to introduce Government’s direct financing techniques and activate it...|$|R

The Loews Hotels chain agreed to co-finance construction of the property with L'Enfant Plaza Corp., although details of the agreement were not provided. The hotel would occupy the top four floors and lobby of the 12-story building, with separate elevators for office tenants and hotel guests. The 378-room hotel, designed by Koubek, had a rooftop swimming pool, two restaurants, a cocktail lounge, and meeting rooms.

5|$|Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, the Golden Age of Trucking Museum was a {{non-profit}} organization dedicated to trucking. The Guerreras owned and operated R.J. Guerrera, a liquid transportation trucking company. Originally, a collection of trucks were restored and stored in barns and garages throughout Connecticut. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum was opened to bring the collection under a single roof. After the property for the museum was purchased in July 1998, Richard Guerrera was diagnosed with cancer. In June 1999, he was transported to the site for an unofficial groundbreaking event. Richard Guerrera died a month later and the facility was completed in 2002. The museum was designed by Francis Guerrera's son-in-law, a <b>general</b> <b>contractor.</b> On September 23, 2002, the museum was formally opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony in the complete 32,000 square foot building.|$|E

The new building was designed by KKE Architects with significant input from a citizen advisory committee. Ebert, Inc. was hired as the <b>general</b> <b>contractor.</b> The old building's last day of operation was September 12, 2009, at which time it was reported in the Longfellow/Nokomis Messenger that the renovated library was expected to reopen sometime in the fall of the next year.

5|$|The {{convention}} center was plagued {{from the start}} by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a <b>general</b> <b>contractor</b> having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes {{to be used in}} the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises. The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.|$|E

5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the <b>general</b> <b>contractor</b> with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{revolves}} around the lives of three close friends: Keong (Jack Neo), a spendthrift white-collar worker, Ong (Mark Lee), a <b>general</b> <b>contractor,</b> and Hui (Henry Thia), a kopi tiam waiter. After an argument with his boss (Chen Zhao Jin), Keong quits his job and is unable to get another due to his poor command of English, lack of academic qualifications and computer illiteracy. With bills (especially instalments) to pay and a family to support, he goes heavily into debt whereupon his wife leaves him, taking their daughter with her. Ong borrows S$40,000 from loan sharks, and plans to repay them after collecting a debt owed him by a friend who subsequently runs away. The loan sharks beat up Ong for not repaying the loan within the two-week deadline, so he flees to Johor Bahru. Hui, who is single and lives with his elderly mother, wastes his meagre salary on 4D and pursuing an insurance agent who he has a crush on.|$|E
