5|$|Ali Abu Nuwar (surname also spelled Abu Nuwwar, Abu Nawar or Abu Nowar; 1925 – 15 August 1991) was a <b>Jordanian</b> army officer, {{serving as}} chief of staff in May 1956 – April 1957. He participated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War as an {{artillery}} officer in the <b>Jordanian</b> army's predecessor, the Arab Legion, but his vocal opposition to British influence in Jordan led to his virtual exile to Paris as military attaché in 1952. There, he forged close ties with <b>Jordanian</b> crown prince Hussein, who promoted Abu Nuwar after his accession to the throne.|$|E
5|$|As a Fatah field commander, {{he fought}} Israeli forces at the Battle of Karameh, gaining a {{reputation}} as an unyielding commander. Abu Ali Iyad was also a leading organizer and participant in guerrilla raids against Israeli localities. He {{was one of the}} last Palestinian commanders to fight the <b>Jordanian</b> Army in the aftermath of the Black September conflict. He was killed in the countryside around Ajlun and Jerash by <b>Jordanian</b> forces in July 1971. His partisans claimed that he was executed, and as retaliation, they assassinated <b>Jordanian</b> prime minister Wasfi al-Tal four months after Abu Ali Iyad's death.|$|E
5|$|Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, 34, a <b>Jordanian</b> {{military}} intelligence officer, {{was killed in}} the attack. He was the <b>Jordanian</b> handler of al-Balawi and the liaison between him and the CIA. Bin Zeid was a cousin to King Abdullah II of Jordan. Bin Zeid's wake was held in the Royal Palace. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania attended his funeral. Official <b>Jordanian</b> news reports said that he died while performing humanitarian service in Afghanistan. His death shed light on the U.S.-Jordanian intelligence partnership, which is rarely acknowledged publicly, yet seen by U.S. officials as highly important for their counter-terrorism strategy.|$|E

5|$|Jordan {{was home}} to 2,117,361 Palestinians in 2015, most of them <b>Jordanian</b> citizens. The first wave of Palestinian {{refugees}} arrived during the 1948 Arab Israeli war and peaked in the 1967 Six Day War and the 1990 Gulf War. In the past, Jordan had given many Palestinian refugees citizenship, however recently <b>Jordanian</b> citizenship is given only in rare cases. 370,000 of these Palestinians live in UNRWA refugee camps. Following the capture of the West Bank by Israel in 1967, Jordan revoked the citizenship of thousands of Palestinians to thwart any attempt to permanently resettle from the West Bank to Jordan. West Bank Palestinians with family in Jordan or <b>Jordanian</b> citizenship were issued yellow cards guaranteeing them all the rights of <b>Jordanian</b> citizenship if requested.|$|E

5|$|On 26 September 1957, Abu Nuwar, Rimawi and al-Hiyari {{were sentenced}} to 15 years {{imprisonment}} in absentia. During his exile from Jordan, Abu Nuwar initially resided in Damascus, along with other <b>Jordanian</b> dissidents, including al-Hiyari and Rimawi. However, in 1958, Abu Nuwar moved to Egypt following that country's union with Syria forming the United Arab Republic (UAR) under Nasser's presidency (Syria seceded in 1961). Thenceforth, Abu Nuwar lived much of {{the remainder of his}} exile in Cairo. In 1958, {{under the aegis of the}} UAR and with assistance from the head of Syrian intelligence, Abd al-Hamid al-Sarraj, the <b>Jordanian</b> dissidents in exile formed the <b>Jordanian</b> Revolutionary Council. It consisted of <b>Jordanian</b> Baathists, left-leaning politicians and dissident army officers, including Abu Nuwar, al-Hiyari and Abdullah al-Tal, a friend of Abu Nuwar who had been exiled by Hussein before him. The group attempted to recruit a university students in Jordan to form the vanguard of the nationalist movement in the country, funded the smuggling of weapons to Palestinian dissidents in the West Bank and the refugee camps around Amman, financially assisted <b>Jordanian</b> officers and politicians dismissed by Hussein, and organized assassination attempts against leading royalist politicians, including al-Rifai, Talhouni and Hazza al-Majali. There were disputes between al-Tal and Abu Nuwar over leadership of the group.|$|E
50|$|According to the Israeli government, 50 <b>Jordanians</b> were killed, but {{the true}} number was never {{disclosed}} by the <b>Jordanians,</b> {{in order to}} keep up morale and confidence in King Hussein's regime.

25|$|On 22 May, Arab forces {{attacked}} kibbutz Ramat Rachel {{south of}} Jerusalem. After a fierce battle in which 31 <b>Jordanians</b> and 13 Israelis were killed, {{the defenders of}} Ramat Rachel withdrew, only to partially retake the kibbutz the following day. Fighting continued until 26 May, until the entire kibbutz was recaptured. Radar Hill was also taken from the Arab Legion, and held until 26 May, when the <b>Jordanians</b> retook it in a battle that left 19 Israelis and 2 <b>Jordanians</b> dead. A total of 23 attempts by the Harel Brigade to capture Radar Hill in the war failed.|$|R
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} <b>Jordanian</b> dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish {{is a symbol}} for <b>Jordanian</b> hospitality and {{is influenced by the}} Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a <b>Jordanian</b> meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for Ramadan. In <b>Jordanian</b> cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavoured with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E
5|$|A large {{force of}} Israeli {{infantry}} and armor went east {{to block the}} road from Salt to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the <b>Jordanian</b> 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, the Jordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then withdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes against <b>Jordanian</b> armor and artillery positions, {{but was unable to}} stop the firing. Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against <b>Jordanian</b> defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp. A total of 175 houses were blown up.|$|E

Instead, al-Balawi used this trust {{to gain access to}} the CIA base in Afghanistan unsearched and perpetrate the attack. The Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda claimed responsibility, saying they helped al-Balawi with the attack.|$|E

5|$|At 6:30AM, Israeli {{helicopters}} started landing {{the bulk}} of the paratrooper battalion north of Karameh. An Israeli aircraft was supposed to drop leaflets addressed to Fatah, after the paratroopers had surrounded the town; however, due to difficult weather conditions, the helicopters flying the paratroopers arrived twenty minutes too late. Met with resistance by Fatah commandos and <b>Jordanian</b> regulars supported by <b>Jordanian</b> artillery, the paratroopers suffered heavy losses. When the southern task force began their drive north towards Karameh, they encountered a <b>Jordanian</b> infantry brigade supported by armor, artillery and antitank weapons. The Israeli Air Force launched airstrikes, but was only able to inflict minor damage on the dug-in Jordanians. Fighting from their entrenched positions, the Jordanians repelled several Israeli assaults.|$|E

5|$|By 25 September, the <b>Jordanian</b> army {{achieved}} dominance, and {{two days}} later Arafat and Hussein agreed to a ceasefire in Amman. The <b>Jordanian</b> army inflicted heavy casualties on the Palestinians—including civilians—who suffered approximately 3,500 fatalities. After repeated violations of the ceasefire from both the PLO and the <b>Jordanian</b> Army, Arafat called for King Hussein to be toppled. Responding to the threat, in June 1971, Hussein ordered his forces to oust all remaining Palestinian fighters in northern Jordan, which they accomplished. Arafat {{and a number of}} his forces, including two high-ranking commanders, Abu Iyad and Abu Jihad, were forced into the northern corner of Jordan. They relocated near the town of Jerash, near the border with Syria. With the help of Munib Masri, a pro-Palestinian <b>Jordanian</b> cabinet member, and Fahd al-Khomeimi, the Saudi ambassador to Jordan, Arafat managed to enter Syria with nearly two thousand of his fighters. However, due to the hostility of relations between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad (who had since ousted President Salah Jadid), the Palestinian fighters crossed the border into Lebanon to join PLO forces in that country, where they set up their new headquarters.|$|E
5|$|Habes al-Majali {{is quoted}} as the only Arab {{commander}} to have defeated the Israelis in 1948 and who restored a little honour to the Arabs. By his version of events, he would even have caught Ariel Sharon {{in the course of}} the battle and it is Colonel Ashton (his British superior from 3rd Brigade) would have forbidden him to use the artillery against the Burma road, action by which he could have prevented its construction. After the war, he was appointed bodyguard of Abdallah and in 1957 Chief-of-Staff of the <b>Jordanian</b> Army. He became <b>Jordanian</b> Minister of Defence in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Jordan {{contains}} {{some of the}} oldest Christian communities in the world, dating {{as early as the}} 1st century AD after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Christians today make up about 4% of the population, down from 20% in 1930, however their absolute number grew. This is due to high immigration rates of Muslims into Jordan, higher emigration rates of Christians to the west and higher birth rates for Muslims. <b>Jordanian</b> Christians number around 250,000, all of whom are Arabic-speaking, according to a 2014 estimate by the Orthodox Church. The study excluded minority Christian groups and the thousands of western, Iraqi and Syrian Christians residing in Jordan. Christians are exceptionally well integrated in the <b>Jordanian</b> society and enjoy a high level of freedom, though they are not free to evangelize Muslims. Christians traditionally occupy two cabinet posts, and are reserved 9 seats out of the 130 in the parliament. The highest political position reached by a Christian is deputy prime minister, held by Marwan al-Muasher in 2005. Christians are also influential in media. Smaller religious minorities include Druze and Bahá'ís. Most <b>Jordanian</b> Druze live in the eastern oasis town of Azraq, some villages on the Syrian border, and the city of Zarqa, while most <b>Jordanian</b> Bahá'ís live in the village of Adassiyeh bordering the Jordan Valley.|$|E
