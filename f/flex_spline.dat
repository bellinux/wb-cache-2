5000|$|The {{circular}} spline is a rigid circular ring with teeth on the inside. The <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> and wave generator are placed inside the {{circular spline}}, meshing {{the teeth of}} the <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> and the circular spline. Because the <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> is deformed into an elliptical shape, its teeth only actually mesh with {{the teeth of the}} circular spline in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> (located on the major axis of the ellipse).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> {{is shaped}} like a shallow cup. The sides of the spline are very thin, but the bottom is {{relatively}} rigid. This results in significant flexibility of the walls at the open end due to the thin wall, and in the closed side being quite rigid and able to be tightly secured (to a shaft, for example). Teeth are positioned radially around {{the outside of the}} <b>flex</b> <b>spline.</b> The <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> fits tightly over the wave generator, so that when the wave generator plug is rotated, the <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> deforms to the shape of a rotating ellipse and does not slip over the outer elliptical ring of the ball bearing. The ball bearing lets the flex spine rotate independently to the wave generator's shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Assume {{that the}} wave {{generator}} is the input rotation. As the wave generator plug rotates, the <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> teeth which are meshed {{with those of}} the circular spline slowly change position. The major axis of the flex spline's ellipse rotates with wave generator, so the points where the teeth mesh revolve around the center point {{at the same rate as}} the wave generator's shaft. The key to the design of the strain wave gear is that there are fewer teeth (often for example two fewer) on the <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> than there are on the circular spline. This means that for every full rotation of the wave generator, the <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> would be required to rotate a slight amount (two teeth in this example) backward relative to the circular spline. Thus the rotation action of the wave generator results in a much slower rotation of the <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> in the opposite direction.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{if there}} are 202 teeth on the {{circular}} spline and 200 on the <b>flex</b> <b>spline,</b> the reduction ratio is (200 &minus; 202)/200 = &minus;0.01 ...|$|E

50|$|The {{strain wave}} gearing theory {{is based on}} elastic {{dynamics}} and utilizes the flexibility of metal. The mechanism has three basic components: a wave generator (2 / green), a <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> (3 / red), and a circular spline (4 / blue). More complex versions have a fourth component normally used to shorten the overall length or to increase the gear reduction within a smaller diameter, but still follow the same basic principles.|$|E
50|$|Thus the <b>flex</b> <b>spline</b> spins at 1/100 {{the speed}} of the wave {{generator}} plug and in the opposite direction. Different reduction ratios are set by changing the number of teeth. This can either be achieved by changing the mechanism's diameter or by changing the size of the individual teeth and thereby preserving its size and weight. The range of possible gear ratios is limited by tooth size limits for a given configuration.|$|E
