25|$|Currently, {{people with}} Medicare can get {{prescription}} drug coverage through a Medicare Advantage plan or through the standalone private prescription drug plans (PDPs) established under Medicare Part D. Each plan established its own coverage policies and independently negotiates the prices it pays to drug manufacturers. But because each plan has a much smaller coverage pool than the entire Medicare program, many argue that this system of paying <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> undermines the government’s bargaining power and artificially raises the cost of drug coverage.|$|E

25|$|Telepharmacy is the {{delivery}} of pharmaceutical care via telecommunications to patients in locations where {{they may not have}} direct contact with a pharmacist. It is an instance of the wider phenomenon of telemedicine, as implemented in the field of pharmacy. Telepharmacy services include drug therapy monitoring, patient counseling, prior authorization and refill authorization <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs,</b> and monitoring of formulary compliance with the aid of teleconferencing or videoconferencing. Remote dispensing of medications by automated packaging and labeling systems can also be thought of as an instance of telepharmacy. Telepharmacy services can be delivered at retail pharmacy sites or through hospitals, nursing homes, or other medical care facilities.|$|E
25|$|Of the Medicare {{beneficiaries}} {{who are not}} dual {{eligible for}} both Medicare (around 20%) and Medicaid or that do not receive supplemental insurance via a former employer (40%) or a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan (about 30%), almost all elect to purchase a type of private supplemental insurance coverage, called a Medigap plan (20%), to help fill in the financial holes in Original Medicare (Part A and B). Note that the percentages add up to over 100% because many beneficiaries {{have more than one}} type of supplement. These Medigap insurance policies are standardized by CMS, but are sold and administered by private companies. Some Medigap policies sold before 2006 may include coverage <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs.</b> Medigap policies sold after the introduction of Medicare Part D on January 1, 2006 are prohibited from covering drugs. Medicare regulations prohibit a Medicare beneficiary from being sold both a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan and a private Medigap Policy. As with public Part C health plans, private Medigap policies are only available to beneficiaries who are already signed up for benefits from Original Medicare Part A and Part B. These policies are regulated by state insurance departments rather than the federal government though CMS outlines what the various Medigap plans must cover at a minimum. Therefore, the types and prices of Medigap policies vary widely from state to state and the degree of underwriting, open enrollment and guaranteed issue also varies widely from state to state.|$|E

500|$|On August 13, 2000, Gore {{announced}} that he had selected Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut as his vice presidential running mate. Lieberman became [...] "the first person of the Jewish faith to run for the nation's second-highest office." [...] Many pundits saw Gore's choice of Lieberman as further distancing him from the scandals of the Clinton White House. Gore's daughter, Karenna, together with her father's former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones, officially nominated Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. Gore accepted his party's nomination and spoke about the major themes of his campaign, stating in particular his plan to extend Medicare to pay <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> and to work for a sensible universal health-care system. Soon after the convention, Gore hit the campaign trail with running mate Joe Lieberman. Gore and Bush were deadlocked in the polls. They participated in three televised debates. While both sides claimed victory after each, Gore was critiqued as either too stiff, too reticent, or too aggressive in contrast to Bush.|$|E

2500|$|Jackman reprised {{his role}} as Wolverine in another solo-film titled Logan in 2017, but has {{confirmed}} {{that this will be}} his final appearance as the character. The film is set in 2029; by this point Logan's healing factor has deteriorated, causing him to age rapidly. He is also slowly dying from adamantium poisoning. He spends his days working as a chauffeur and hustling <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> along the border between Texas and Mexico. He and fellow mutant Caliban live in an abandoned smelting plant across the border in Mexico, where they care for a senile Charles Xavier, who had inadvertently killed several of his X-Men in a seizure-induced psychic attack one year earlier. He is tasked by Gabriela, a nurse for Transigen, to escort an 11-year-old girl, Laura, to a place in North Dakota called [...] "Eden." [...] Logan, Charles, and Laura escape the Transigen hunters called the [...] "Reavers," [...] and discover that Laura is Logan's [...] "daughter", as she was bred with his DNA. After accepting shelter from a family they helped on the highway, Xavier is killed by X-24, a perfect clone of Logan. Logan and Laura escape and bury Xavier's body near a lake. Eventually, Logan and Laura arrive at Eden, which is a safe haven run by Rictor and former Transigen test subjects. There, Logan learns that the children will make an eight-mile journey across the forest to the Canadian border and entrusts Laura to them before departing on his own. However, when the children are located and captured by the Reavers, Logan uses a mutant serum given to him by Rictor to restore his strength and healing factor. He then plows through the Reavers, but the serum quickly wears off before he meets Zander Rice, the head of the Transigen project, who sought to avenge his father's death during the Weapon X program by creating the virus. Logan kills Rice and confronts X-24. However, with his healing factor now gone, Logan is no match for X-24, who impales him through a tree. Laura shoots X-24 in the head with an adamantium bullet that Logan had kept with him for years, destroying his brain and half his skull. After Logan succumbs to his wounds and dies in Laura's arms, Laura and the children bury him before continuing their journey across the border. As they all leave, Laura returns to Logan's grave, removes the cross, and places it on its side to create an [...] "X" [...] to honor Logan as the last of the X-Men.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Prescription</b> <b>drug</b> {{abuse in}} Southwest Virginia {{is a serious}} problem {{affecting}} indi-viduals, families, and communities. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize and understand the extent of the <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse problem in Southwest, Virginia as well as the dynamics that surround that abuse. More specifically, the study focused on learning the extent of the problem along with which <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> are typically used prior to entering treatment, reasons <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> and methadone abuse, and the sources <b>for</b> <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> use, misuse and abuse. Methods: Mixed methodology was employed which included surveying methadone clinic con-sumers at two treatment clinics in Southwest, Virginia and seven focus field interviews of key community stakeholders. Results: The extent of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse is high and that the demographics of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> users are getting younger and now involve more males than females. Oxycodone, hydroco-done, methadone, and morphine were the most commonly used drugs prior to enrollment in the clinics with over one-half of methadone-maintained consumers reporting that they had abused benzodiazepines along with opioids. Focus groups and clinic consumer data highlighted the key etiological factors in <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse: use (due to workforce related injuries) turning to abuse, wanting to get high, overprescribing and physician issues, lack of information, and cultural acceptance of drug taking as problem solving behavior. The two most common sources <b>for</b> the abused <b>prescription</b> <b>drugs</b> were physicians and street dealers. Conclusions: A constellation of conditions have led to the epidemic of <b>prescription</b> <b>drug</b> abuse in Southwest Virginia, including poverty, unemployment and work-related injuries, besides, public health education programs on the dangers of prescription opiate misuse and abuse are urgently needed...|$|R
