40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the use of hedge funds ‟ 13 (f) filings by market participants. While many argue {{disclosure}} of equity holdings in these filings could harm investment funds, we find hedge funds largely benefit from disclosure while providing little private information to the marketplace. We detect abnormal trading volume around disclosure dates and also find significant, positive abnormal returns immediately after disclosure, suggesting the presence of copy-cat traders. Fund companies have a period of time, usually up to 45 days {{after the end of}} the quarter, to announce their quarter end holdings. We find evidence of significant trading in the days leading up to the public announcement, which raises the possibility that some traders are taking positions in anticipation of the possible market impact of the 13 (<b>f)</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Indeed, a long-short portfolio of these companies ‟ expanded-contracted positions purchased prior to the disclosure date earns positive, significant abnormal returns through the disclosure period. Finally, we find no evidence disclosed holdings offer long-term investors access to profitable information...|$|E

40|$|Financial {{institutions}} globally {{have received}} {{considerable amount of}} pressure from stakeholders to act responsibly and ethically and to be more involved in corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices. However, the ability for financial institutions to fulfill such demands from stakeholders is dependent upon the availability of resources to meet these social causes. It is expected that the involvement of financial institutions in CSR practices can enhance the organizations’ value. As such, this study seeks {{to examine the relationship}} between stakeholders’ pressure and internal resources on CSR reporting from the perspective of stakeholder and resource-based theories and the effect o <b>f</b> such <b>disclosure</b> on value creation. The sample for the study was selected from 20 financial institutions in Malaysia over a four-year period from 2008 - 2011 resulting in 76 firms-year observations. Content analyses o f annual and sustainability reports were undertaken to measure the quantity and quality o <b>f</b> CSR <b>disclosure.</b> Value creation was measured using a value-creation index that incorporates both financial and non-financial measures. The results of the study indicate that there is an improvement in the quantity and quality o <b>f</b> CSR <b>disclosure</b> over the four-year period with community dimension being the focus of the CSR activities. Customers were found to be the more influential stakeholders driving the CSR disclosures while concentrated ownership structure inhibits CSR reporting among financial institutions. The quality o f CSR reporting was found to be the determining factor that contributed to firms’ value...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{fraud and}} {{litigation}} are extreme {{events in the}} life of the corporation for they contain those elements which are most threatening to securities markets – potentially unbounded moral hazard, agency cost, information asymmetry and reputation effects. Fraud events are very serious—on the announcements of fraud and litigation shareholders in the announcing firm typically withdraw their funds en-masse, almost irrespective of price. On the surface, these events may seem to be idiosyncratic, or firm-specific, with local effects. But a question that logically follows is—since corporate fraud and litigation is so devastating for the affected firms—is there potential for pure intra-industry contagion to occur? This is the topic of this paper. The study’s principal finding is that strong pure contagion responses are evident following both fraud (<b>F)</b> <b>disclosures</b> and class action (C) litigation filings. In further analysis, we identify that the intensity of the contagion reactions is generally linked to well recognized measures of risk, notably: BM (Fama & French, 1993); leverage (Fama & French, 1988), up markets (or time varying risk premia (Fama & French, 1988)) and the level of regulatory protection (which has long been viewed as a means to control information asymmetry and agency risks, Ali and Kallapur, 2001). This link to risk parameters suggests that contagion susceptibility may be predictable...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays examining how corporate fraud and litigation impact on financial markets. The first essay examines the direct effects of these events and the second essay examines the indirect, or contagion, effects. The underlying theme behind both essays is that corporate fraud is a classic manifestation of agency cost/information asymmetry problems. The study consists of an examination of over 451 fraud and litigation cases between 1993 and 1999. Essay I reports that announcing firms experience serious wealth, volume, bid-ask spread, firm specific risk and systematic risk shifts in relation to both the fraud (F) and law-suit (C) disclosures. Moreover, these influences persist {{for an extended period}} beyond the events. Interestingly, systematic risk measures drop sharply following the events. The results suggest that these extreme agency events seriously “dislocate” normal market relationships (beta) and that firm specific risk becomes a pricing factor. We also find support for the argument that PSLRA represented a weakening in the monitoring and bonding regime available to shareholders. In the second essay we examine the pure contagion effects of the fraud and litigation cases. We start from the premise that as fraud events are firm-specific, which is the tenor of any lawsuit, then, if any industry wide contagion reaction were to occur it would be of the pure contagion form. Essay II 2 ̆ 7 s principal finding is that strong pure contagion responses are evident following both fraud (<b>F)</b> <b>disclosures</b> and class action (C) filings. In further analysis, we identify that the intensity of the contagion reactions is generally linked to well recognized measures of risk, notably: book-to-market ratios (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1993); leverage (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1988), up markets (or time varying risk premia (Fama 2 ̆ 6 French, 1988)) and the level of regulatory protection (Ali and Kallapur, 2001). This link to risk is interesting as it suggests that contagion susceptibility may be predictable. These pure contagion results underline the continued threat that fraud and litigation represent to well functioning financial markets. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the relative {{frequency of the}} genetic causes of the Schubert-Bornschein type of congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB) and to determine the genotype-phenotype correlations in CSNB 1 and CSNB 2. Design: Clinic-based, longitudinal, multicenter study. Participants: A total of 39 patients with CSNB 1 from 29 families and 62 patients with CSNB 2 from 43 families. Methods: Patients underwent full ophthalmologic and electrophysiologic examinations. On the basis of standard electroretinograms (ERGs), patients were diagnosed with CSNB 1 or CSNB 2. Molecular analysis was performed by direct Sanger sequencing of the entire coding regions in NYX, TRPM 1, GRM 6, and GPR 179 in patients with CSNB 1 and CACNA 1 F and CABP 4 in patients with CSNB 2. Main Outcome Measures: Data included genetic cause of CSNB, refractive error, visual acuity, nystagmus, strabismus, night blindness, photophobia, color vision, dark adaptation (DA) curve, and standard ERGs. Results: A diagnosis of CSNB 1 or CSNB 2 was based on standard ERGs. The photopic ERG was the most specific criterion to distinguish between CSNB 1 and CSNB 2 because it showed a "square-wave" appearance in CSNB 1 and a decreased b-wave in CSNB 2. Mutations causing CSNB 1 were found in NYX (20 patients, 13 families), TRPM 1 (10 patients, 9 families), GRM 6 (4 patients, 3 families), and GPR 179 (2 patients, 1 family). Congenital stationary night blindness 2 was primarily caused by mutations in CACNA 1 F (55 patients, 37 families). Only 3 patients had causative mutations in CABP 4 (2 families). Patients with CSNB 1 mainly had rod-related problems, and patients with CSNB 2 had rod- and cone-related problems. The visual acuity on average was better in CSNB 1 (0. 30 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR]) than in CSNB 2 (0. 52 logMAR). All patients with CSNB 1 and only 54 % of the patients with CSNB 2 reported night blindness. The dark-adapted threshold was on average more elevated in CSNB 1 (3. 0 log) than in CSNB 2 (1. 8 log). The 3 patients with CABP 4 had a relative low visual acuity, were hyperopic, had severe nonspecific color vision defects, and had only 1. 0 log elevated DA threshold. Conclusions: Congenital stationary night blindness 1, despite different causative mutations, shows 1 unique CSNB 1 phenotype. Congenital stationary night blindness 2 caused by mutations in CABP 4 merely shows cone-related problems and therefore appears to be distinct from CSNB 2 caused by mutations in CACNA 1 <b>F.</b> Financial <b>Disclosure(s)</b> : The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article. © 2013 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology...|$|R
