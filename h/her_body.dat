5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put <b>her</b> <b>body</b> {{near the}} fireplace, and a wind {{came down the}} chimney. <b>Her</b> <b>body</b> {{disappeared}} amid the embers, with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking <b>her</b> <b>body,</b> unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

40|$|In this. study, we {{attempted}} to test whether tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the first ratelimiting enzyme of catecholamine synthesis, is confined to the perikarya of activated magnocellular vasopressinergic (VPergic) neurons or is also present in their distal axons in the pituitary posterior lobe (PL). In addition, we evaluated the possible correlation between TH and VP turnover in the axons of rats drinking 2 % NaCl for 1, 2, and 3 weeks. To this aim, we examined the large swellings of VPergic axons, the so-called <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies,</b> using the doubleimmunofluorescent technique and the avidinbiotin technique, combined with image analysis. Here we have demonstrated {{for the first time}} a colocalization of TH and VP in <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies,</b> which is a strong argument in favor of TH transport from the perikarya of VPergic neurons via axons toward their terminals. THimmunoreactive (IR) and VP-IR materials were distributed in <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> with seeming zonality. The number of VP-IR <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> decreased by a factor of four over the first week of osmotic stimulation, remaining at almost the same low level until the end of the experiment. Conversely, the content of the VP-IR material within the individual <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> fell gradually during the three weeks of saltloading. The results suggest that VP depletion from <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> prevails in its transport into these structures during the whole period of osmotic stimulation. In contrast to VP-IR <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies,</b> the number of TH-IR <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> and the content of TH-IR material within the individual <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> increased progressively during the entire experiment. The synchronization of the VP depletion and TH accumulation in <b>Herring</b> <b>bodies</b> during longterm osmotic stimulation raised the question about a possible functional interaction between both substances...|$|R

Bayliss wants to question an arabber who he maintains is the killer, but Pembleton believes that lead has already been exhausted. Pembleton instead pursues a theory posed by Felton (Daniel Baldwin) that Watson was killed one day earlier than they first believed, and rigor mortis was slowed because <b>her</b> <b>body</b> was stored in a cool place. Felton and Pembleton identify a possible suspect who lived near the murder scene, and learn his car was impounded shortly after <b>her</b> <b>body</b> was found. As they search impound lots for the car, the two detectives bicker {{with each other and}} Pembleton accuses Felton of racism.
