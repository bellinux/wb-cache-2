30|$|Recipe Upload View. Fig.  2 and sub-plots (A)–(B) {{presents}} the upload view, {{which is more}} complex than the one provided by Allrecipes.com. Besides the standard recipe parameters such as title, description and preparation time, difficulty level or price level, it also features an elaborate ingredients definition widget. The ingredients widget supports the user with ingredient suggestions based on the input provided. Along with the <b>ingredient</b> <b>name,</b> it has two separate input fields for the amount and the unit. Presumably, this improves the automatic ingredient parsing, on which the nutrient information is based on. Nevertheless, there are still many misspellings and word variants in this data set (see Sect.  4.1). This could either be explained with incorrect usage of the ingredient widget, misspelled ingredients that are already in the Kochbar.de database, or that the widget has not been always been part of the upload form. The cooking instructions are also captured in a more structured manner. The form provides separate text fields for every step. Photographs of the meal can also be uploaded. In contrast to Allrecipes.com, the Kochbar.de upload form allows the user to manually overwrite the automatically calculated nutritional information. It is also possible to assign descriptive tags and categories to the recipe, which is not possible in Allrecipes.com.|$|E

Forster plant, commonly known as kava kava. This and other kava-derived ingredients are used as skin-conditioning agents at concentrations from 0. 0001 % to 0. 1 %. The Food and Drug Administration issued a consumer advisory in 2002 expressing concern about liver damage in individuals who have ingested kava products. The available oral toxicity data sup-port the concern about liver damage on ingestion but do not resolve the question, for example, whether these ingredients would be substantially absorbed through the skin. Other data needs are described, including toxicology data for yangonin, methysticin, and kavain, which may be present in kava-derived ingredients.

40|$|The CIR Expert Panel {{assessed}} {{the safety of}} dicarboxylic acids and their salts and esters as used in cosmetics. Most dicarboxylic acids function in cosmetics as pH adjusters or fragrance ingredients, but the functions {{of most of the}} salts in cosmetics are not reported.

The Expert Panel noted gaps in the available safety data for some of the dicarboxylic acid and their salts and esters in this safety assessment.

40|$|Chitosonic® Acid, {{carboxymethyl}} hexanoyl chitosan, {{is a novel}} chitosan {{material that}} has recently been accepted by the Personal Care Products Council as a new cosmetic ingredient with the INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic <b>Ingredients)</b> <b>name</b> Carboxymethyl Caprooyl Chitosan. In this study, we analyze several important cosmetic characteristics of Chitosonic® Acid. Our results demonstrate that Chitosonic® Acid is a water-soluble chitosan derivative with a high HLB value. Chitosonic® Acid can form a nano-network structure when its concentration is higher than 0. 5 % and can self-assemble into a nanosphere structure when its concentration is lower than 0. 2 %. Chitosonic® Acid has potent antimicrobial activities against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and fungus. Chitosonic® Acid also has moderate DPPH radical scavenging activity. Additionally, Chitosonic® Acid exhibits good hydration activity for absorbing and retaining water molecules with its hydrophilic groups. From a safety point of view, Chitosonic® Acid has no cytotoxicity to L- 929 cells if its concentration is less than 0. 5 %. Moreover, Chitosonic® Acid has good compatibilities with various normal cosmetic ingredients. Therefore, we propose that Chitosonic® Acid {{has the potential to}} be a widely used ingredient in various types of cosmetic products...|$|R
