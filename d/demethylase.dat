5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA <b>demethylase</b> TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis is that such epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E

25|$|Histones H3 and H4 {{can also}} be {{manipulated}} through demethylation using histone lysine <b>demethylase</b> (KDM). This recently identified enzyme has a catalytically active site called the Jumonji domain (JmjC). The demethylation occurs when JmjC utilizes multiple cofactors to hydroxylate the methyl group, thereby removing it. JmjC is capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and tri-methylated substrates.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{supporting}} this claim identified that decreased m6A {{levels in the}} transcriptome lead to significantly reduced HNRNPC binding, thus alternative splicing is co-regulated by methylation and HNRNPC binding activity. However, the m6A modification does not directly cause protein binding. Rather, it alters the loop structure to regulate gene expression by acting as a switch that exposes the HNRNPC region. It is essentially a two-step, co-regulatory mechanism prevalent in biochemistry in controlling alternative splicing. Note that <b>demethylase</b> enzyme can indeed “erase” the methyl group, thus inhibiting alternative splicing which is the reverse of the two-step regulation mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Environmental {{influences}} {{may also}} cause, or interact with genetics to produce, orofacial clefting. An {{example of how}} environmental factors might be linked to genetics comes from research on mutations in the gene PHF8 that cause cleft lip/palate (see above). It was found that PHF8 encodes for a histone lysine <b>demethylase,</b> and is involved in epigenetic regulation. The catalytic activity of PHF8 depends on molecular oxygen, a fact considered important with respect to reports on increased incidence of cleft lip/palate in mice that {{have been exposed to}} hypoxia early during pregnancy. In humans, fetal cleft lip and other congenital abnormalities have also been linked to maternal hypoxia, as caused by e.g. maternal smoking, maternal alcohol abuse or some forms of maternal hypertension treatment. Other environmental factors that have been studied include: seasonal causes (such as pesticide exposure); maternal diet and vitamin intake; retinoids— which are members of the vitamin A family; anticonvulsant drugs; nitrate compounds; organic solvents; parental exposure to lead; alcohol; cigarette use; {{and a number of other}} psychoactive drugs (e.g. cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin).|$|E

50|$|The {{double bond}} of cycloartenol (compound 7 in diagram) is {{methylated}} by SAM {{to give a}} carbocation that undergoes a hydride shift and loses a proton to yield a compound with a methylene side-chain. Both of these steps are catalyzed by sterol C-24 methyltransferase (Step E1 in diagram). Compound 8 is then catalyzed by sterol C-4 <b>demethylase</b> (E2) and loses a methyl group to produce cycloeucalenol. Subsequent to this, the cyclopropane ring is opened with cycloeucalenol cycloisomerase (E3) to form 10. Compound 10 loses a methyl group and undergoes an allylic isomerization to form Gramisterol 11. This step is catalyzed by sterol C-14 <b>demethylase</b> (E4), sterol Δ14-reductase (E5), and sterol Δ8-Δ7-isomerase (E6). The last methyl group is removed by sterol <b>demethylase</b> (E7) to form episterol 12. Episterol 12 is methylated by SAM to produce a second carbocation, which loses a proton to yield 13.
