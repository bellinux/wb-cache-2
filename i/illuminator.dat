5|$|The {{original}} {{church was}} built in the early fourth century—between 301 and 303 according to tradition—by Armenia's patron saint Gregory the <b>Illuminator,</b> following the adoption of Christianity as a state religion by King Tiridates III. It replaced a preexisting temple, symbolizing the conversion from paganism to Christianity. The core of the current building {{was built in}} 483/4 by Vahan Mamikonian after the cathedral was severely damaged in a Persian invasion. From its foundation until {{the second half of the}} fifth century, Etchmiadzin was the seat of the Catholicos, the supreme head of the Armenian Church.|$|E
5|$|The murals {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of the murals bear scriptures in Greek. The murals were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between the murals and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of the murals is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. New and Old Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the <b>Illuminator</b> are depicted on the murals. A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, the Communion is shown where Jesus is depicted twice, turning on the right and left sharing bread with the Apostles. The images of the Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below the Communion scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the <b>Illuminator,</b> Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. The murals on the western wall depict the Kingdom of Heaven. The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of the murals were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E
5|$|The upper {{portions}} of the Last Judgement panel are generally considered {{as the work of}} a weaker painter with a less individual style. It is thought that van Eyck left the panels unfinished with completed underdrawings, and the area was finished by workshop members or by followers after he died. Maryan Ainsworth of the Metropolitan takes a different view. She highlights the close relationship known to have existed between contemporary workshops in the Low Countries and France, and speculates that a French miniaturist or <b>illuminator,</b> perhaps from the workshop of the Bedford Master, travelled to Bruges to assist van Eyck on the right hand panel.|$|E
30|$|Multi-static passive radar with {{multiple}} transmitters can provide both space diversity and frequency diversity. In general, a passive radar uses multiple spatially separated commercial <b>illuminators</b> of opportunity as the transmitters. The observations from different directions by exploiting these different <b>illuminators</b> {{can provide the}} space diversity, whereas the frequency diversity in multi-static passive radar is achieved as these <b>illuminators</b> are usually operated at different carrier frequencies.|$|R
50|$|According to Donald Drew Egbert, the <b>illuminators</b> {{belong to}} the same group that {{illuminated}} the Tickhill Psalter. Art historian Ellen Beer, however, states that while there are similarities, Egbert is too quick to identify the <b>illuminators</b> (whom he connects to four other manuscripts as well). According to Beer, two of the <b>illuminators</b> responsible for the Psalter of St. Louis can be recognized in the Isabella Psalter.|$|R
40|$|Space target {{surveillance}} generally uses active radars. To {{take full}} advantage of passive radars, the idea of using spaceborne <b>illuminators</b> of opportunity for space target detection is presented in this paper. Analysis of the detectable time and direct wave suppression shows that passive radar using spaceborne <b>illuminators</b> of opportunity can effectively detect a Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) target. Meanwhile, Ku and L band bi-static radar cross section of passive radars that use spaceborne <b>illuminators</b> of opportunity are presented by simulation, providing the basis of choosing space target forward scatter. Finally the key parameters, mainly system gain, accumulation time and radiation source selection are studied. Results show that system size using satellite TV signals as <b>illuminators</b> of opportunity is relatively small. These encouraging results should stimulate the development of passive radar detection of space targets using spaceborne <b>illuminators</b> of opportunity...|$|R

25|$|John Paul II {{had good}} {{relations}} with the Armenian Apostolic Church. In 1996, he brought the Catholic Church and the Armenian Church closer by agreeing with Armenian Archbishop Karekin II on Christ's nature. During an audience in 2000, John Paul II and Karekin II, by then the Catholicos of All Armenians, issued a joint statement condemning the Armenian genocide. Meanwhile, the pope gave Karekin the relics of St. Gregory the <b>Illuminator,</b> the first head of the Armenian Church that had been kept in Naples, Italy, for 500 years. In September 2001, John Paul II went on a three-day pilgrimage to Armenia to take part in an ecumenical celebration with Karekin II in the newly consecrated St. Gregory the <b>Illuminator</b> Cathedral in Yerevan. The two Church leaders signed a declaration remembering the victims of the Armenian genocide.|$|E
25|$|As late as {{the later}} Parthian period, Armenia was a {{predominantly}} Zoroastian adhering land. However, this was soon to change.
