50|$|The game {{allowed the}} player to explore open space while {{switching}} between three monitors, each one <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> different perspective. The first monitor <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> top-down perspective used mainly for navigation, the second monitor <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> first-person perspective {{which can be}} used to explore through space or engage enemies in first-person shooter combat, and the third monitor is used for servicing the player's mecha.|$|R
5|$|A similar {{system for}} the Church of England was {{approved}} in 1976. The traditions of Eastern Christian heraldry have less developed regulation. Eastern secular coats of arms often <b>display</b> <b>a</b> shield before a mantle topped with a crown. Eastern clergy often display coats of arms according to this style, replacing the crown with an appropriate hat drawn from liturgical use.|$|E
5|$|Archpriests {{and priests}} {{would use a}} less ornate mantle in their arms, and an ecclesiastical hat of the style they wear liturgically. Although an Orthodox monk (not an abbot) {{displaying}} personal arms is rare, a hieromonk (monk who has been ordained a priest) would appropriately <b>display</b> <b>a</b> monastic hat (klobuk) and a black cloak or veil suggestive of his attire, and a hierodeacon (monastic deacon) would display an orarion behind the shield.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's polonaises show {{a marked}} advance on {{those of his}} Polish {{predecessors}} in the form (who included his teachers Zywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically <b>display</b> <b>a</b> martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.|$|E

50|$|The Bar <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> field cannon in its centre. When ribbons {{alone are}} worn, <b>a</b> {{separate}} button <b>displaying</b> <b>a</b> field cannon {{would have been}} worn on the ribbon bar. The Bar was never awarded.|$|R
5|$|Circumstantial {{evidence}} supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, {{have been found}} to <b>display</b> <b>a</b> preparedness for social interaction. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of socialization or social construction. Rather, newborns most likely inherit to some extent social behavior and identity through genetics.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University's Reserve Officer Training Corps is the {{official}} officer training and commissioning program at Florida State University. Dating back to Civil War days, the ROTC unit at Florida State University {{is one of four}} collegiate military units with permission to <b>display</b> <b>a</b> battle streamer, in recognition of the military service of student cadets during the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865.|$|E
5|$|In 3D video games, {{a virtual}} camera system aims at {{controlling}} a camera or {{a set of}} cameras to <b>display</b> <b>a</b> view of a 3D virtual world. Camera systems are used in videogames where their purpose is to show the action at the best possible angle; more generally, they are used in 3D virtual worlds when a third person view is required.|$|E

50|$|Signs in The Sims games {{usually do}} not contain text, but consist entirely of graphics. For example, a pet shop sign in Unleashed <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> paw, a stop sign in Hot Date <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> white hand, and in The Sims 2 the sign for a grocery store depicts a cornucopia.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{other presidents}} never <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> {{tree in the}} White House. First U.S. President George Washington held office {{at a time when}} there was no White House, thus it is {{impossible}} for him to have <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> tree there. There is no evidence that Abraham Lincoln ever <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> Christmas tree in the White House. In 1922 First Lady Florence Harding's illness led to a more subdued Christmas celebration at the White House and no Christmas tree.|$|R
5|$|Over the years, botanical gardens, as {{cultural}} and scientific organisations, {{have responded to}} the interests of botany and horticulture. Nowadays, most botanical gardens <b>display</b> <b>a</b> mix of the themes mentioned and more; having a strong connection with the general public, there is the opportunity to provide visitors with information relating to the environmental issues being faced {{at the start of the}} 21st century, especially those relating to plant conservation and sustainability.|$|E
5|$|Some noctuid moths, such as {{the large}} red underwing (Catocala nupta), are cryptic at rest, but <b>display</b> <b>a</b> flash of startlingly bright colours when disturbed. Others, such as many species of genus Speiredonia and Spirama, look {{threatening}} while at rest. Also saturniid moths of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia display snake heads, but not from the frontal position.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle is}} {{referred}} to in the coat of arms of the London Borough of Barnet which <b>display</b> <b>a</b> red and a silver rose {{in the top of the}} shield and two crossed swords in the crest.|$|E
50|$|Stop {{errors are}} {{comparable}} to kernel panics in macOS, Linux, and other Unix-like systems, and to bugchecks in OpenVMS. Windows 3.1 <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> Black Screen of Death instead of a blue one. Windows 98 <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> red error screen raised by Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) when the host computer's BIOS has a problem. The bootloader of the first beta version of Windows Vista also <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> red error screen {{in the event of}} a boot failure.|$|R
50|$|Hurley <b>displays</b> <b>a</b> {{trademark}} story-telling style considered similar {{by some to}} American humorists such as Andy Griffith and Garrison Keillor, combining a down-home yarn-spinning {{style with}} public comedy. His early work often <b>displayed</b> <b>an</b> impish giggle throughout his routines, which later vanished.|$|R
50|$|As of 1992 Colossus was lit by 2200 lights which <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> 24-pattern {{performance}} with a starburst finale. During {{the months that}} the park was closed they <b>displayed</b> <b>a</b> giant clock face which was visible to those passing on nearby Interstate 44.|$|R
5|$|The mitre may {{be shown}} {{in all sorts of}} colours. It may be {{represented}} either gold or jewelled, the former more common in English heraldry. A form of mitre with coronet is proper to the Bishop of Durham because of his role as Prince-Bishop of the palatinate of Durham. For similar reasons the Bishop of Durham and some other bishops <b>display</b> <b>a</b> sword behind the shield, pointed downward to signify a former civil jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Today all {{cardinals}} {{are required}} to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for an exception to this rule. Bruno Heim says that since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only bishops {{have the right to}} bear, cardinals who are not bishops do not use it. Notable examples are Cardinals Albert Vanhoye and Avery Dulles; the latter's arms do <b>display</b> <b>a</b> cross.|$|E
5|$|When tufted males clap, females look {{towards them}} and <b>display</b> <b>a</b> {{greater number of}} tap {{displays}} to them than to the gray morph. Females also respond to tufted morphs' clapping more often by settling than for gray males. However, after the females look towards the males, gray males approach the female more often than the tufted male. Females often tip their abdomens from side to side.|$|E
50|$|Located on the harbour breakwaters of Büsum are {{two other}} lights. On the west mole is a 9 metre high red tower which <b>displays</b> <b>an</b> {{occulting}} red light. The east mole has a similar tower, painted green that <b>displays</b> <b>an</b> occulting green light.|$|R

5|$|A B {{movie or}} B {{film is a}} low-budget {{commercial}} movie, but one {{that is not an}} arthouse film. In its original usage, during the Golden Age of Hollywood, the term more precisely identified films intended for distribution as the less-publicized bottom half of a double feature (akin to B-sides for recorded music). Although the U.S. production of movies intended as second features largely ceased {{by the end of the}} 1950s, the term B movie continues to be used in its broader sense to this day. In its post–Golden Age usage, there is ambiguity on both sides of the definition: on the one hand, the primary interest of many inexpensive exploitation films is prurient; on the other, many B movies <b>display</b> <b>a</b> high degree of craft and aesthetic ingenuity.|$|E
5|$|A shield {{in front}} of a mantle or cloak may be found among bishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches. However, some Eastern ecclesiastical {{variations}} omit the mantle but retain the mitre, cross and staff. Maronite bishops traditionally <b>display</b> <b>a</b> pastoral staff behind the shield, topped with a globe and cross or a cross within a globe. Eastern Catholic bishops may follow the Roman style with a low crowned, wide brimmed ecclesiastical hat, although the shield itself is often rendered in a Byzantine artistic style, and a mitre if present would be in the appropriate liturgical style.|$|E
5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work {{with a touch of}} social irony. His New York paintings <b>display</b> <b>a</b> great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
