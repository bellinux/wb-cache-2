The castle was built, along with its twin at St Mawes, to protect the deep water of Carrick Roads from attack. This natural haven <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> Falmouth such an important harbour, it being the last good shelter for ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E

But eliminating all possible irregular arrangements is very difficult, and this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> the Kepler conjecture so hard to prove. In fact, there are irregular arrangements that are denser than the cubic close packing arrangement over a small enough volume, but any attempt to extend these arrangements to fill a larger volume always reduces their density.|$|E

25|$|The Mughals {{were perhaps}} the richest single dynasty to have ever existed. During the Mughal era, the {{dominant}} political forces {{consisted of the}} Mughal Empire and its tributaries and, later on, the rising successor states– including the Maratha Empire – which fought an increasingly weak Mughal dynasty. The Mughals had a policy of integration with Indian culture, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> them successful where the short-lived Sultanates of Delhi had failed. This period marked vast social change in the subcontinent as the Hindu majority were ruled by the Mughal emperors, most of whom showed religious tolerance, liberally patronising Hindu culture.|$|E
25|$|A special form of {{boundaryless}} {{organization is}} virtual. Hedberg, Dahlgren, Hansson, and Olve (1999) consider the virtual organization as not physically existing as such, but enabled by software to exist. The virtual organization exists within {{a network of}} alliances, using the Internet. This means while {{the core of the}} organization can be small but still the company can operate globally be a market leader in its niche. According to Anderson, because of the unlimited shelf space of the Web, the cost of reaching niche goods is falling dramatically. Although none sell in huge numbers, there are so many niche products that collectively they make a significant profit, and that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> highly innovative Amazon.com so successful.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of cities before 1983 was solely {{at the discretion}} of the national legislature; there were no requirements for achieving 'city' status other than an approved city charter. No income, population or land area requirements had to be met in order to incorporate cities before Batas Pambansa Bilang 337 (Local Government Code of 1983) became law. This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> it possible for several current cities such as Tangub or Canlaon to be conferred such a status despite their small population and locally generated income, which do not meet current standards. The relatively low income standard between 1992 and 2001 (which was 20 million) also allowed several municipalities, such as Sipalay and Muñoz, to become cities despite not being able to meet the current 100 million local income standard.|$|E

DeWitt stated, [...] "They were {{at the end of}} casting, and hadn't found the right Midge yet. Originally they had a scene where she opens the door wearing a red kimono, and I remember thinking 'I'm not that', so I wasn’t sure I was right for the part.

500|$|Clark had {{converted}} to Catholicism, his wife Gertrude's religion, while in Vietnam. He saw his son, Wesley Clark, Jr., {{for the first}} time while at the Valley Forge Hospital. Clark commanded C Company, 6th Battalion, 32nd Armor, 194th Armored Brigade, a company composed of wounded soldiers, at Fort Knox. Clark has said this command <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> him decide to continue his military career past the five-year commitment required by West Point, which would have concluded in 1971. Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Fort Knox, taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award. His next posting was {{to the office of the}} Army Chief of Staff in Washington, D.C., where he worked in the [...] "Modern Volunteer Army" [...] program from May to July 1971.

500|$|Third Way {{contributor}} Graham Cray {{wrote that}} the song [...] " [...] more directly a culture which consists of a cacophony of voices and images but which has neither soul nor direction." [...] Hot Press editor Niall Stokes noted that the lyrics were ambiguous in whether they took place in reality or fantasy, which he likened to the overarching theme of the album. Author David Kootnikoff believed that [...] "the pop melody conceals the lyric's dark theme about a victim of physical abuse who reasons her pain away with the line 'When he hurts you, you feel alive.'" [...] Mark Brown of The Orange County Register described it as [...] "the desperate tale of an abused woman with {{nowhere to go but}} back to her home." [...] He compared it to U2's 1987 song [...] "Running to Stand Still", saying [...] "That same sort of descriptive but distanced narrative <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> [...] so powerful." ...|$|E

500|$|The Avalanches have {{described}} the album as a [...] "road trip" [...] in a [...] "big, wide, expansive country like Australia." [...] For inspiration, the group looked back on their teenage years of driving {{around the country and}} suburbia listening to music. The record is supposed to [...] "capture that feeling of growing up...jumping in the car and hitting the road with a six-pack and heading out to the bush." [...] The album attempts to capture the [...] "halfway between happy and sad" [...] feeling similar to old Beach Boys records which are a constant inspiration for the group. Chater felt that this feeling <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> Since I Left You a success, and they have continuously strived to create that feeling. Di Blasi thinks of Wildflower as a free-spirited person who does what they wish regardless of conventionality.

500|$|The {{compilation}} {{album was}} a success, topping the charts in four countries. In the United States, Barbra Streisand's Greatest Hits Volume 2 debuted at number seven on the Billboard 200 chart {{for the week}} ending December 2, 1978 (also serving as the week's highest new entry). The following week it rose to number three and on January 6, 1979, it topped the chart. The record spent a total of 46 weeks on the Billboard 200, and by December 1984, the album and Streisand's Guilty (1980) had both sold over 4 million physical copies in the United States, becoming quadruple certified by the RIAA. It would later be re-certified to 5x Platinum on October 28, 1994. It was {{the one of the}} United States' best-selling albums in 1979, coming in at number 28 on Billboards annual year-end chart. Billboards Fred Bronson wrote in The Billboard Book of Number One Hits that the commercial and critical achievements of [...] "You Don't Bring Me Flowers" [...] <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> Barbra Streisand's Greatest Hits Volume 2 a certified Platinum album in the US.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick would devote his {{personal}} breaks to having lengthy discussions with actors. Among those who valued his attention was Tony Curtis, star of Spartacus, who said Kubrick {{was his favorite}} director, adding, [...] "his greatest effectiveness was his one-on-one relationship with actors." [...] He further added, [...] "Kubrick had his own approach to film-making. He {{wanted to see the}} actor's faces. He didn't want cameras always in a wide shot twenty-five feet away, he wanted close-ups, he wanted to keep the camera moving. That was his style." [...] Similarly, Malcolm McDowell recalls the long discussions he had with Kubrick to help him develop his character in A Clockwork Orange, noting that on set he felt entirely uninhibited and free, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> Kubrick [...] "such a great director". Kubrick also allowed actors at times to improvise and to [...] "break the rules", particularly with Peter Sellers in Lolita, which became a turning point in his career as it allowed him to work creatively during the shooting, as opposed to the preproduction stage.|$|E

500|$|In {{deciding}} {{to combine the}} two story ideas, the writers decided that the time travel element could play out as the Borg attempt to prevent humanity from ever reaching space and becoming a threat. [...] "Our goals at that point were to create a story that was wonderful and a script that was [...] producible within the budget confines of a Star Trek film", said Berman. One major question was identifying the time period to which the Borg would travel. Berman's suggestion was the Renaissance; the Borg would attempt to prevent the dawn of modern European civilization. The first story draft, titled Star Trek: Renaissance, had {{the crew of the}} Enterprise track the Borg to their hive in a castle dungeon. The film would have featured sword fights alongside phasers in 15th-century Europe, while Data became Leonardo da Vinci's apprentice. Moore was afraid that it risked becoming campy and over-the-top, while Stewart refused to wear tights. Braga, meanwhile, wanted to see the [...] "birth of Star Trek", when the Vulcans and humans first met; [...] "that, to me, <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> the time travel story fresh", he said.|$|E
500|$|On May 28, 2003, {{the first}} {{performance}} of Wicked {{was held at}} the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, as the start of SHN pre-Broadway tryouts. After officially opening on June 10, 2003, it ran there for the month and finished on June 29, 2003. Audience reaction was mostly positive and although critics tended to compliment the aesthetic and spectacle of the show, they disparaged the state of its book, score, and choreography. Dennis Harvey of Variety commented positively of the [...] "sleekly directed", [...] "snazzily designed" [...] and [...] "smartly cast" [...] production yet still disapproved of its [...] "mediocre" [...] book, [...] "trite" [...] lyrics and [...] "largely generic" [...] music while Karen D'Souza of the San Jose Mercury News wrote that [...] "Style over substance is the real theme in this Emerald City." [...] Noting mixed response, the creative team started making extensive changes, tweaking it before its transfer to Broadway. Winnie Holzman stated, [...] "Stephen [...] wisely had insisted on having three months to rewrite in-between the time we closed in San Francisco and when we were to go back into rehearsals in New York. That was crucial; that was the thing that made the biggest difference {{in the life of the}} show. That time <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> the show work." ...|$|E
500|$|The Model 1897 {{was popular}} before World War I, {{but it was}} after the war broke out that sales of the Model 1897 picked up. This was because many were {{produced}} {{to meet the demands of}} the military. When the United States entered World War I, there was a need for more service weapons to be issued to the troops. It became clear to the United States just how brutal trench warfare was, and how great the need was for a large amount of close-range firepower while fighting in a trench, after they had observed the war for the first three years. The Model 1897 Trench grade was an evolution of this idea. The pre-existing Winchester Model 1897 was modified by adding a perforated steel heat shield over the barrel which protected the hand of the user from the barrel when it became over-heated, and an adapter with bayonet lug for affixing an M1917 bayonet. [...] This model was ideal for close combat and was efficient in trench warfare due to its 20-inch cylinder bore barrel. Buckshot ammunition was issued with the trench grade during the war. Each round of this ammunition contained nine 00 (.33-caliber) buckshot pellets. This gave considerable firepower to the individual soldier by each round that was fired. [...] This shorter barrel and large amount of firepower <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>made</b> this grade ideal for trench warfare.|$|E
