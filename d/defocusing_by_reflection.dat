40|$|The AWAKE {{experiment}} at CERN aims {{to drive}} strong plasma wakefields with a self-modulated proton drive bunch, {{and to use}} these wakefields for electron acceleration. During the self-modulation process, protons are <b>defocused</b> <b>by</b> the transverse plasma wakefields and form a halo around the focused bunch core. The two-screen setup integrated in AWAKE measures the transverse, time-integrated proton bunch distribution downstream the [10]m long plasma to detect <b>defocused</b> protons. <b>By</b> measuring the maximum radii of the defocused protons we attempt calculate properties of the self-modulation. In this article, we develop a routine to identify the maximum radius of the defocused protons, based on a standard contour method. We compare the maximum radius to the logarithmic lineouts of the image {{to show that the}} radius identifies the edge of the signal. Comment: 3 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Coxeter groups {{arise in}} a wide variety of areas, so every {{mathematician}} should know some basic facts about them, including their connection to “Dynkin diagrams. ” Proofs about these “groups generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections</b> ” mainly use group theory, geometry, and combinatorics. This talk will briefly explain: • what it means to say that G is a “group generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections</b> ” (or, equivalently, that G is a “Coxeter group”); • what it means to say that G is “of type An, Bn, or Dn”, and • that all but finitely many of the “irreducible ” finite groups generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections</b> are either dihedral groups or belong to these types. For further reading, see [1, Chap. 1], [2], or [3]. 1. What is a group generated <b>by</b> <b>reflections?</b> Example.

40|$|AbstractDuring development, the eye grows under visual {{feedback}} control, {{as shown by}} its compensating for <b>defocus</b> imposed <b>by</b> spectacle lenses. Under normal conditions the sign and magnitude of defocus vary with viewing distance, accommodative status and other factors. To explore how periods of myopic and hyperopic defocus are integrated over time we presented rapidly alternating episodes of myopic and hyperopic <b>defocus</b> <b>by</b> sequentially illuminating a nearby scrim and the wall beyond it to chick eyes wearing lenses that put the far point between the two surfaces. We found that equal periods of myopic and hyperopic defocus generally led to compensatory hyperopia, showing that myopic defocus had a disproportionate effect. Furthermore, the degree of hyperopia depended on the frequency of alternation: low frequencies (1 cycle/ 30 min) resulted in more hyperopia, whereas at high frequencies (1 cycle/s) the myopic and hyperopic defocus nearly cancelled each other. If similar temporal integration effects apply to humans, they {{may help explain why}} brief accommodation events may not influence lens-compensation and why a child’s total reading time may be a poor predictor of myopic progression...|$|R
