25|$|In {{the years}} it was an active {{veterans}} facility, it provided a hospital, nursing care, food, entertainment, and religious services for up to 350 veterans at a time, providing a home for 700 former Confederate soldiers in its years of operations. The requirements to be {{a resident of the}} home was to not only be a former Confederate soldier, but to have been a resident of Kentucky <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> be mentally stable, and to have no problems with alcoholism. Many of the veterans once served under John Hunt Morgan. A fire on March 25, 1920 destroyed the main building, as well as an infirmary ward and laundry. Fortunately, no lives were lost, {{and the rest of the}} facility was enough to house those residents still using the home. Eventually, the number of veterans who could be served dwindled, and by 1934 the hospital was no more, with the remaining five residents being transferred to the nearby Pewee Valley Sanitorium.|$|E

According to a behind-the-scenes interview with Entertainment Tonight, Madonna stated that the inspiration behind the video was from the 1997 Arthur Golden novel Memoirs of a Geisha. She later stated, [...] "The whole idea of a geisha is a straight metaphor for being an entertainer because, on one hand you're privileged to be a geisha, {{but on the other}} hand you're a prisoner [...] " [...] Madonna choreographed her own moves in the video, since she [...] " [...] like how other people say how I should move, I'm my own best choreographer."

60|$|Sir Marmaduke {{had walked}} to the park gates with his wife, {{not so much because}} he was anxious for her safety, but chiefly because he meant to retire within the pavilion, there to cast aside forever the costume and {{appurtenances}} of Prince Amédé d'Orléans and to reassume the sable-colored doublet and breeches of the Roundhead squire, which proceeding he had <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> invariably accomplished in the lonely little building on the outskirts of his own park.|$|E

60|$|Now {{the three}} fat toads had also smelled the spring {{down in a}} soft spot under the lawn, whither, in the {{previous}} autumn, they had burrowed for their winter sleep. When the Reverend James stirred the sod, the warm sun thawed them out and brought them the spring's message, and they scrambled {{up to the surface}} promptly, as full of new life as if they had not been frozen into insensible clods <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> As for the big turtle, the smell of the fresh earth had probably brought her up from the neighboring pond to search out a nest for herself where she might lay her eggs. Finding the soft warm earth of the portulaca bed, she had squirmed and twisted her way down into it, the loose earth tumbling in on her and hiding her as she went down.|$|E

"As you said, {{according}} to your British notions you {{are too young to}} think of marrying; and, at any rate, my wife has sounded Myra, and the girl has assured her that you have never said a word to her that would lead her to believe you entertained other than what I may call a brotherly affection for her. Now, I can tell you frankly, that one of our reasons for remaining here <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> has been that we desired that the matter should be arranged one way or the other. It has struck us that it was not your youth only that prevented you from coming to me and asking for Myra's hand, but a foolish idea that she is, as is undoubtedly the case, a very rich heiress. Before I go farther, may I ask if that is the case, and if you really entertain such an affection for my daughter as would, putting aside all question of money and of your youth, lead you to ask her hand?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Duke of Warrington, having journalistic {{matters to}} discuss with Joseph Loveredge, arrived at half-past seven, wearing on his shirt-front a silver star, {{purchased}} in Eagle Street the day before for eight-and- six. There accompanied him the Lady Alexandra, wearing the identical ruby necklace that every night <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months,</b> and twice on Saturdays, [...] "John Strongheart" [...] had been falsely accused of stealing. Lord Garrick, having picked up his wife (Miss Ramsbotham) outside the Mother Redcap, arrived with her on foot at a quarter to eight. Lord Mount-Primrose, together with Sir Francis Baldwin, dashed up in a hansom at seven-fifty. His Lordship, having lost the toss, paid the fare. The Hon. Harry Sykes (commonly called [...] "the Babe") was ushered in five minutes later. The noble company assembled in the drawing-room chatted blithely while waiting for dinner to be announced. The Duke of Warrington was telling an anecdote about a cat, which nobody appeared to believe. Lord Mount-Primrose desired to know whether by any chance {{it might be the}} same animal that every night at half-past nine had been in the habit of climbing up his Grace's railings and knocking at his Grace's door. The Honourable Harry was saying that, speaking of cats, he once had a sort of terrier--when the door was thrown open and Willis announced the Lady Mary Sutton.|$|E

6000|$|... "Look here, Will," [...] he resumed, [...] "I {{have three}} men {{standing}} in my outer {{office at the}} present moment. Two of them have come back after having questioned the past servants of the Grosvenor Square household. There was the butler Parker, and an elderly housekeeper, {{both of whom are}} in service in the West End. The woman tried to screen Luke and to make light of the many quarrels which broke out between the cousins on all possible occasions; but she broke down under our fellows' sharp questions. She had to admit that the arrogance of the one man often drove the other to unguarded language, and that she had {{on more than one occasion}} heard the men servants of the house say that they would not be astonished if murder ensued one day. Well, we have these two witnesses, and can easily get hold of the two or three footmen who expressed those particular views. So much <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Now for last night. The third man who is out there waiting for me to see him is Frederick Power, hall porter at the Veterans' Club. The story which he told to our Mr. Travers is so important in its minutest detail, that I have decided to question him myself so that I may leave no possible loop-hole to doubt or to inaccuracy in the retelling. I am going to send for the man now. You come and sit round here, the other side of my desk; from this position you will be able to watch the man's face, as well as hear what he has got to say.

60|$|Newman's telegrams were {{answered}} with interest. Having dispatched but three electric missives, he received {{no less than}} eight gratulatory bulletins in return. He put them into his pocket-book, {{and the next time}} he encountered old Madame de Bellegarde drew them forth and displayed them to her. This, it must be confessed, was a slightly malicious stroke; the reader must judge in what degree the offense was venial. Newman knew that the marquise disliked his telegrams, though he could see no sufficient reason for it. Madame de Cintre, on the other hand, liked them, and, most of them being of a humorous cast, laughed at them immoderately, and inquired into the character of their authors. Newman, now that his prize was gained, felt a peculiar desire that his triumph should be manifest. He more than suspected that the Bellegardes were keeping quiet about it, and allowing it, in their select circle, but a limited resonance; and it pleased him to think that if he were to take the trouble he might, as he phrased it, break all the windows. No man likes being repudiated, and yet Newman, if he was not flattered, was not exactly offended. He had not this good excuse for his somewhat aggressive impulse to promulgate his felicity; his sentiment was of another quality. He wanted for once to make the heads of the house of Bellegarde FEEL him; he knew not when he should have another chance. He had had <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months</b> a sense of the old lady and her son looking straight over his head, and he was now resolved that they should toe a mark which he would give himself the satisfaction of drawing.|$|E
