40|$|The {{unexpectedly}} strong {{suppression of}} high p_T heavy-quarks in heavy-ion collisions {{has given rise}} to the idea that partons propagating through a medium in addition to <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> by induced radiation also undergo substantial <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> due to elastic collisions. However, the precise magnitude of this elastic <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> component is highly controversial. While it is for a parton inside a medium surprisingly difficult to define the difference between elastic and radiative processes rigorously, the main phenomenological difference is in the dependence of <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> on in-medium pathlength: in a constant medium radiative <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> is expected to grow quadratically with pathlength, elastic <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> linearly. In this paper, we investigate a class of <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> models with such a linear pathlength dependence and demonstrate that they are incompatible with measured data on hard hadronic back-to-back correlations where a substantial variation of pathlength is probed.

High-drain loads such as digital cameras can reduce total capacity, as happens with alkaline batteries.

25|$|While {{snow and}} ice act to {{insulate}} the surface from large <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> in winter, they also act to retard warming {{in the spring and}} summer because of the large amount of energy required to melt ice (the latent heat of fusion, 3.34 x 105 J/kg at 0°C). However, the strong static stability of the atmosphere over areas of extensive snow or ice tends to confine the immediate cooling effect to a relatively shallow layer, so that associated atmospheric anomalies are usually short-lived and local to regional in scale. In some areas of the world such as Eurasia, however, the cooling associated with a heavy snowpack and moist spring soils is known to play a role in modulating the summer monsoon circulation. Gutzler and Preston (1997) recently presented evidence for a similar snow-summer circulation feedback over the southwestern United States.|$|E

Generation capacity was not enough to meet peak demand, which translated into continuous supply constrains and widespread blackouts lasting up to 20 hours. In the mid-1990s, in order to address generation capacity shortages, several Independent Power Producers (IPPs) where encouraged by the government to sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the CDE.

We aimed to correlate <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> with ascending aortic aneurysm size and histopathologic findings to elucidate the pathophysiology of aneurysm complications. MethodsAneurysmal ascending aortic specimens were obtained during surgery. Control specimens were obtained from autopsy and organ donors. Biaxial tensile tests were performed on the 4 quadrants of the aortic ring. <b>Energy</b> <b>loss</b> was calculated using the integral of the stress–strain curve during loading and unloading. It was compared with the size and the traditional biomechanical parameter, stiffness (apparent modulus of elasticity). Elastin, collagen, and mucopolysaccharide content were quantified using Movat pentachrome staining of histology slides. ResultsA total of 41 aortas were collected (34 aneurysmal, 7 control). The aneurysms exhibited increased stiffness (P < . 0001) and <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> (P < . 0001) compared with the controls. <b>Energy</b> <b>loss</b> correlated significantly with aortic size (P < . 0001, r 2  = . 60). A hinge point was noted at a diameter of 5. 5 cm, after which <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> increased rapidly. The relationship between <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> and size became strongly linear once the size was indexed to the body surface area (P < . 0001, r 2  = . 78). <b>Energy</b> <b>loss</b> correlated with the histopathologic findings, especially the collagen/elastin ratio (P = . 0002, r 2  = . 49). High <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> distinguished patients with pathologic histologic findings from others with similar diameters. ConclusionsAs ascending aortas dilate, they exhibit greater <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> that rapidly increases after 5. 5 cm.

25|$|While {{there are}} many types of PV systems known to be effective, {{crystalline}} silicon PV accounted for around 90% of the worldwide production of PV in 2013. Manufacturing silicon PV systems has several steps. First, polysilicon is processed from mined quartz until it is very pure (semi-conductor grade). This is melted down when small amounts of Boron, a group III element, are added to make a p-type semiconductor rich in electron holes. Typically using a seed crystal, an ingot of this solution is grown from the liquid polycrystalline. The ingot may also be cast in a mold. Wafers of this semiconductor material are cut from the bulk material with wire saws, and then go through surface etching before being cleaned. Next, the wafers are placed into a phosphorus vapor deposition furnace which lays a very thin layer of phosphorus, a group V element, which creates an N-type semiconducting surface.

25|$|Alternating current {{systems can}} use {{transformers}} to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowing generation and consumption at low voltages but transmission, possibly over great distances, at high voltage, with savings {{in the cost}} of conductors and <b>energy</b> <b>losses.</b> A bipolar open-core power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884. However these early induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.|$|E
