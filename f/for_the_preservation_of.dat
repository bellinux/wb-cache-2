5|$|In the Aegean Sea, Greece has {{allocated}} a {{large area}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean monk seal and its habitat. The Greek Alonissos Marine Park, that extends around the Northern Sporades islands, is the main action ground of the Greek MOm organisation. MOm is greatly involved in raising awareness in the general public, fundraising for the helping of the monk seal preservation cause, in Greece and wherever needed. Greece is currently investigating the possibility of declaring another monk seal breeding site as a national park, and also has integrated some sites in the NATURA 2000 protection scheme. The legislation in Greece is very strict towards seal hunting, and in general, the public is very much aware and supportive of the effort <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the Mediterranean monk seal.|$|E

5|$|As of 2006, 3487 {{locations}} of rock art {{had been discovered}} in Cundinamarca alone, of which 301 on the Bogotá savanna. Other locations have been found over the years. The rock art of the Archaeological Park of Facatativá is heavily vandalised. Plans <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the unique cultural heritage have been formulated since the mid 2000s. The petrographs of Soacha are endangered by the mining activities in the fastly growing suburb of Bogotá, as is happening with other mining districts; Chía, Sibaté, Tunja, Sáchica and others.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} toxicity, chromium(VI) salts are used <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> wood. For example, {{chromated}} copper arsenate (CCA) {{is used in}} timber treatment to protect wood from decay fungi, wood-attacking insects, including termites, and marine borers. The formulations contain chromium based on the oxide CrO3 between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 metric tons of CCA solution were used in 1996.|$|E

5|$|On 9 November 2008, Chelsea Football Club were {{reported}} to be considered moving to a new purpose built stadium at the power station. The proposed stadium was to hold between 65,000 and 75,000 fans and feature a retractable roof. The proposals were designed by HOK Sport, the same company who designed Wembley Stadium. However, the Chelsea FC scheme was seriously in doubt due to concerns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the site {{and the collapse of}} the REO scheme in late November 2011.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was damaged}} during World War II, but efforts {{to restore the}} castle began in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war. Once again, and thanks to local non-profit organizations like the Wüstenrot Foundation and Community Fund <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Preservation</b> <b>of</b> Lichtenstein Castle, the walls were restored in 1980, followed by the second floor in 1998. The upper floor and roof were restored in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Underground Egyptian tombs {{built in}} the desert provide {{possibly}} the most protective environment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> papyrus documents. For example, there are many well-preserved Book of the Dead funerary papyri placed in tombs to act as afterlife guides for {{the souls of the}} deceased tomb occupants. However, it was only customary during the late Middle Kingdom and first half of the New Kingdom to place non-religious papyri in burial chambers. Thus, the majority of well-preserved literary papyri are dated to this period.|$|E
5|$|A popular tourist destination, Ambohimanga {{received}} 97,847 {{visitors in}} 2011. Visitors to the World Heritage Site are charged a fee (10,000 ariary for foreigners and 400 ariary for locals), which is largely {{used to pay}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the site. The commune of Ambohimanga Rova is a small but thriving rural village that lives on agriculture and services provided to tourists and pilgrims who visit the royal city. Multilingual tour guides can be hired at the site to provide detailed descriptions of its features and history. Photographs are permitted outdoors but prohibited inside the historic buildings. Tourism has been negatively affected at the site {{as a consequence of}} the 2009 Malagasy political crisis; management of the site has also been hampered by political instability and reduced revenues since 2009.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{literature}} has been preserved {{on a wide}} variety of media. This includes papyrus scrolls and packets, limestone or ceramic ostraca, wooden writing boards, monumental stone edifices and coffins. Texts preserved and unearthed by modern archaeologists represent a small fraction of ancient Egyptian literary material. The area of the floodplain of the Nile is under-represented because the moist environment is unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> papyri and ink inscriptions. On the other hand, hidden caches of literature, buried for thousands of years, have been discovered in settlements on the dry desert margins of Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the {{suffrage}} campaign, Dudley became the first woman associate chairman of the Tennessee Democratic Committee. She was also selected as the first female delegate-at-large to the Democratic National Convention in 1920. Dudley's involvement in politics declined significantly in subsequent years, with her efforts being focused on civic and charitable causes during the remainder of her life. She was an active worker for the American Red Cross during World War II and later served as board chairman of the Association <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Preservation</b> <b>of</b> Tennessee Antiquities.|$|E
5|$|From the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the Christian {{authors who}} would become the Latin Church Fathers were in active {{dialogue}} with the Classical tradition, within {{which they had been}} educated. Tertullian, a convert to Christianity from Roman Africa, was the contemporary of Apuleius and one of the earliest prose authors to establish a distinctly Christian voice. After the conversion of Constantine, Latin literature is dominated by the Christian perspective. When the orator Symmachus argued <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> Rome's religious traditions, he was effectively opposed by Ambrose, the bishop of Milan and future saint—a debate preserved by their missives.|$|E

In the social sphere, Lecrae has advocated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> responsibility and fatherhood as a value among men in the United States, and in 2013 partnered with Dwyane Wade and Joshua DuBois in the multimedia initiative This Is Fatherhood as part of the Obama administration's Fatherhood and Mentoring Initiative.

5|$|On 19 November 2006, the Civic Party, Democratic Party, Harbour-front Enhancement Committee, Hong Kong Institute of Architects, People's Sustainable Development Committee, Clear the Air, and Earth Care jointly met to {{urge the}} public to fight <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the pier. Over 1,000 {{signatures}} were collected on that one day alone, in a petition to be submitted to Chief Executive Donald Tsang and other senior officials. In addition, a group of protesters began a peaceful sit-in that day. So Sau Chung, veteran campaigner (now a monk), whose hunger strike against Star Ferry fare increases triggered the riots in 1966, came by to lend his support.|$|E
5|$|On April 1, 1998, seven {{counties}} in Minnesota were declared federal disaster areas: Brown, Le Sueur, Nicollet, Rice, Cottonwood, Blue Earth and Nobles. The money allotted {{from the federal}} government allowed the affected towns to clean up the damage and begin the rebuilding process. In addition to the federal dollars, the state of Minnesota contributed $27.6million to the cleanup and rebuilding effort, with $1.35million designated specifically <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> the historical buildings in St. Peter. Most of St. Peter's buildings that were on the National Historic Register were damaged, but only one—a French Second Empire school building built in 1871 (St. Peter Central School)—had to be demolished. Three years after the tornado, the City of St. Peter reported that its population had grown by 2%; an unusual feat for a town that had so recently endured a natural disaster.|$|E
