[...] The assailant {{told her she was}} lying and that she had a purse. Larey told him that she did not and was knocked to the ground. She said she felt like she was hit with an iron pipe. The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see if anyone could help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E
60|$|His tone {{made me feel}} not {{a little}} ridiculous. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looking at me sideways, with a sardonic smile.|$|E
60|$|He let {{his hand}} {{rest for a}} moment upon my shoulder, and, {{though he did not}} say so, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> pleased. Then he glanced at the clock.|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is here.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> likes me.|$|R
6000|$|Therefore we can say, not merely,--I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> a God {{made the}} world, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what <b>that</b> God is like. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is not merely}} a great God, a wise God, but a good God; that {{goodness}} is his very essence. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is gracious and merciful, long suffering, and of great kindness. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is loving to every man, and that his mercy is over all his works. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> upholds those who fall, and lifts up those who are down; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> careth for the fatherless and widow, and executes judgment and justice for all those who are oppressed with wrong. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will fulfil the desire of those who call upon him; and will also hear their cry and will help them. <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> in short, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a living God, and a loving God; a God in whom men may trust, to whom they may open their hearts, as children to their father: and I am sure that those who come to him he will in no wise cast out; for he himself has said, with human voice upon this earth of ours,--'Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and I will give you rest.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> right, {{and that}} I should {{not try to}} {{reconcile}} him with Roman history; so I asked for news concerning other ancients {{with whom he had}} walked familiar.|$|E
60|$|Seeing him relapse into silence, I did not speak. For {{the space}} of half an hour he stared down the river, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looking vainly for the Willing.|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil {{take it and}} thee! I {{never heard}} a man yet begin to prate of his conscience, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about to do {{something}} more than ordinarily cruel or false." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{his look}} of interest, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had heard {{something}} about the place.|$|R
60|$|From {{the first}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would yield, {{but he did}} it with an ill grace.|$|R
60|$|Indeed, Mulvaney seemed needlessly anxious; but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{looked after}} Ortheris in a fatherly way.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he crawled}} {{back into the}} machine again and drew a little black cloth over himself. This time he was very quiet in there. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> praying and I kept still.|$|E
60|$|Beverly-Jones {{shook hands}} with great warmth as we parted for the night. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} that my character {{was about to be}} triumphantly vindicated, and that he was glad for my sake.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to know}} what's {{happening}} on Wall Street," [...] I heard Jimmy Wombold say as I passed along. I could imagine his anxiety, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deep in the big Consolidated-Western deal.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see that, O'Grady," [...] Ryan said, dolefully. [...] "I don't envy Terence a bit. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has quite}} {{deserved}} {{what he has}} got, and that if I had had his start, I should never have got any farther. Still, I wish I could go with him. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has always been the}} one who invented our plans. Still, I have had a good idea sometimes." ...|$|R
60|$|So I sat {{and told}} him, ox by ox, cow by cow, and heifer by heifer, forgetting none; and Chaka listened silently {{as one who}} is asleep. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not sleep, for all the while the firelight flickered in his fierce eyes. Also <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did but torment me, or <b>that,</b> perhaps, <b>he</b> would learn of the cattle before he killed me. At length all the tale was told.|$|R
6000|$|... "Also I had a {{regard for}} Mr. Eustace Meeson, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{had lost his}} {{inheritance}} through a quarrel about myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For myself I am an habitu√©," [...] {{the little}} man continued, [...] "I might almost say a resident. Therefore, all faces soon become {{familiar}} to me. Directly I saw monsieur, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not a frequenter." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last the}} dead man walked no more Amongst the Trial Men, And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} up In the black dock's dreadful pen, And that never would I see his face In God's sweet world again.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped and}} sat down on his feet, as a lucivee {{generally}} does when you surprise him, and stared at me steadily. When I went on again <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> after me, though he had disappeared from the trail.|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{relationship}} to Gian Maria <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>That</b> <b>he</b> pretends {{to the throne}} of Babbiano I was not aware. But whither are we straying?" ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did {{expect a}} battle, {{by the way}} he came back and back again to embrace me and his child.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly; but <b>he</b> says <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{will not}} stay long. He {{does not like}} Scroope at all. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that.</b> <b>He</b> always says that,--that--" ...|$|R
60|$|So when I met him {{one night}} in the cloak room of the club putting on his {{raincoat}} and his galoshes with a peculiar beaming look on his face, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> up {{to some sort of}} benevolence.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of that," [...] {{said the}} girl, [...] "as I should be if you were still scolding me. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a jay, well enough, and I'd just seen him {{behaving}} very like a cad to Mrs. Bevidge." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{last the}} dead man walked no more [...] Amongst the Trial Men, [...] And <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{standing}} up [...] In the black dock's dreadful pen, [...] And that never would I see his face [...] For weal or woe again.|$|E
60|$|Delora bowed. I {{caught the}} gleam of his white teeth {{underneath}} his black moustache. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had {{made up his mind}} to fight.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] {{said the}} doctor. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> entirely devoted to them. The fact is, Putney's a very dear friend of mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{will not}} murder you, friend?" [...] asked the king. [...] "This {{man is a}} snake whom few can nurse with safety." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should have}} to go back to him, as I did last time,' she answered, shaking her head. 'I thought I was free then, but {{gradually}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> calling me. I tried to resist, but I couldn't. I simply had to go to him.' ...|$|E
60|$|In answer Horrod {{laid his}} finger across {{his lips and}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deaf and dumb. I am not nervous (I think I said that), but the {{realization}} that my sole companion in the empty house was a deaf mute struck a cold chill to my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "These pagan stoics," [...] said Brown reflectively, [...] "always fail {{by their}} strength. There came a crash and a scream down the street, {{and the priest}} of Apollo did not start or look round. I {{did not know what}} it was. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> expecting it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean Hernando Pereira, Allan, Marais's nephew, {{who they}} say {{is one of the}} richest men in the Colony. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wishes to marry Marie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never could}} quite {{understand}} or feel <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was dead when everybody said so, {{and now that}} I've heard this story <b>I</b> <b>KNOW</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is living." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was sure}} he had. I should not have asked unless I had been quite sure. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would tell you {{anything}} of that kind. Well?" ...|$|R
