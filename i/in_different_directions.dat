5|$|Alvarez {{proposed}} Muon tomography in 1965 {{to search}} the Egyptian pyramids for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring cosmic rays, his scheme was to place spark chambers, standard equipment in the high-energy particle physics of this time, beneath the second pyramid of Chephren in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions</b> the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric expansion {{is shown by}} direct observational evidence of the Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|E

5|$|Damage to nerves III, IV, or VI {{may affect}} the {{movement}} of the eyeball (globe). Both or one eye may be affected; in either case double vision (diplopia) will likely occur because the movements of the eyes are no longer synchronized. Nerves III, IV and VI are tested by observing how the eye follows an object <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions.</b> This object may be a finger or a pin, and may be moved at different directions to test for pursuit velocity. If the eyes do not work together, the most likely cause is damage to a specific cranial nerve or its nuclei.|$|E

5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that {{held that the}} form of the perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that held that the eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of the}} eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions,</b> thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E
5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} (LCs) are {{matter in}} a state which has properties between those of conventional liquids and those of solid crystals. For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its molecules may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are {{many different types of}} liquid-crystal phases, which can be distinguished by their different optical properties (such as birefringence). When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures. The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions.</b> Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal phase (just as water may turn into ice or steam).|$|E
5|$|The {{companies}} under Pitcairn's command got {{beyond their}} officers' control {{in part because}} they were unaware of the actual purpose of the day's mission. They fired <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions</b> and prepared to enter private homes. Colonel Smith, who was just arriving with the remainder of the regulars, heard the musket fire and rode forward from the grenadier column to see the action. He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly. The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter, and once order was restored among the soldiers, the light infantry were permitted to fire a victory volley, after which the column was reformed and marched on toward Concord.|$|E

5|$|A short {{distance}} to the north, NY78 and NY104 fork <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions,</b> with NY104 following Ridge Road to the northeast and NY78 running along LockportOlcott Road to the northwest. Still {{in the town of}} Newfane, NY78 proceeds northwest as a four-lane (quickly changing to two-lane) residential street. The route passes east of Bent-Wing Airport, continuing northwest through Newfane. The route remains residential for a distance, crossing over a brook on its way into the hamlet of Corwin. In Corwin, NY78 remains a two-lane residential road, crossing over Somerset Railroad tracks that are operated by CSX Transportation (heading for the Somerset Power Plant near Camp Kenan) north of Jacques Avenue. Now paralleling Eighteenmile Creek, NY78 intersects with the western terminus of CR105 (Hatter Road). While winding northwest, the route soon enters the hamlet of Newfane.|$|E
5|$|Ferris offers {{himself in}} {{exchange}} to Aisha's kidnappers, and {{is brought to}} the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions,</b> is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a video camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Hani Salaam's security officer.|$|E

5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical respiratory pigment in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions</b> and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions,</b> pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E
5|$|The House of Orpheus in the {{southern}} part of the city thus takes its name from the large mosaic depicting Orpheus playing his harp to an audience of trees, animals and birds. As Paul MacKendrick puts it, the mosaic is rather artlessly executed, as the animals are all of different sizes and face <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions</b> with no relationship to Orpheus. It appears that the mosaicist simply copied patterns from a book without attempting to integrate the different elements. The mosaic is situated in the triclinium, the dining room, where the diners would have reclined on couches set against the walls and admired the central mosaic. Other mosaics can be seen in the atrium, which has a depiction of Amphitrite in a chariot pulled by a seahorse and accompanied by other sea creatures, and in the bathing rooms. One room off the main courtyard has a mosaic of a dolphin, considered by the Romans to be a lucky animal.|$|E

5|$|The Ottoman army did not {{march into}} Albania in one group. The first {{detachments}} to arrive were the Akıncı who marched through Dibra. Skanderbeg stalled this force's advance, but, once the main force arrived, the Albanians {{were not able}} to offer further resistance and withdrew. Realizing that both Ottoman commanders, Isak bey and Hamza, were familiar with the Albanian terrain and his tactics, Skanderbeg decided to adopt a new means of engagement. Normally, he would lure his enemy into a trap and then ambush them. His new tactic was very similar to his normal; however, he chose to approach it in a different manner. To make it impossible to be followed, Skanderbeg split his forces into several groups and ordered their respective commanders to march through the forests and mountains <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions</b> and to never assemble or assault the Ottomans unless instructed to do so. The Albanian warriors were supplied by the locals and supply depots set throughout the mountains as they marched.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} use other Batman characters in the game, but these were removed when it was decided they would not work within the story. For example, Batman's enemy Mr. Freeze did not fit because the character has different motivations to the Joker. Unlike the Riddler, who is obsessed with proving his superiority over Batman, Mr. Freeze does not hold a personal grudge against Batman, and Mr. Freeze would not care about the other villains' plans. A garden maze under Poison Ivy's control was considered as a location; she could grow it <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions.</b> In its center, Batman would find the Mad Hatter hosting a tea-party, but the developers decided these ideas would not match the game's tone. Batman's vehicles, the Batmobile and Batwing, were considered {{for inclusion in the}} game, but developing unique control mechanics and gameplay segments for them would have taken too much time, and compromised its quality; the vehicles appear in the game, but players cannot control them.|$|E
5|$|The final French {{operation}} in the Atlantic during the campaign {{was an attempt to}} send seven frigates and corvettes to the French West Indies in September, laden with supplies to help maintain the strength and morale of the garrisons. With Willaumez believed to be still at sea, September 1806 seemed a good time to send a squadron into the Atlantic, but in fact the force was spotted within hours of leaving Rochefort by the British blockade force under Commodore Sir Samuel Hood. Hood's force gave chase and the large ships of the line soon caught up the frigates in heavy weather. Sending four of his ships off <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>directions,</b> Soleil attempted to give them cover with his three largest vessels, but after a hard-fought battle in which Hood lost an arm, four of the French frigates were captured.|$|E
