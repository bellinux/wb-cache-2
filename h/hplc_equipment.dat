The only phase of drug {{development}} under direct control of a pharmaceutical company is the R&D stage. The goal of analytical work is to obtain {{as much information as}} possible from the sample. At this stage, high-throughput and analysis of tiny sample quantities are critical. Pharmaceutical companies are looking for tools that will better enable them to measure and predict the efficacy of candidate drugs in shorter times and with less expensive clinical trials.

50|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} {{as we know}} {{it today}} really got its start in 1969, when the first modern HPLC was designed and marketed as a nucleic acid analyzer. Columns throughout the 1970s were unreliable, pump flow rates were inconsistent, and many biologically active compounds escaped detection by UV and fluorescence detectors. Focus on purification methods in the '70s morphed into faster analyses in the 1980s, when computerized controls were integrated into <b>HPLC</b> <b>equipment.</b> Higher degrees of computerization then led to emphasis on more precise, faster, automated equipment in the 1990s. Atypical of many technologies of the '60s and '70s, the emphasis in improvements was not on “bigger and better,” but on “smaller and better”. At the same time the HPLC user-interface was improving, it was critical to be able to isolate hundreds of peptides or biomarkers from ever decreasing sample sizes.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{for analysis of}} melanin-pigmented tissues based on alkaline hydrogen peroxide degradation coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ultraviolet determination of pyrrole- 2, 3, 5 -tricarboxylic acid (PTCA) for eumelanin and 6 -(2 -amino- 2 -carboxyethyl) - 2 -carboxy- 4 -hydroxybenzothiazole (BTCA) and 1, 3 -thiazole- 2, 4, 5 -tricarboxylic acid for pheomelanin was recently developed. Despite advantages related to the degradation conditions and sample handling, a decrease of the reproducibility and resolution was observed after several chromatographic runs. We report herein an improved chromatographic methodology for simultaneous determination of PTCA and BTCA as representative markers of eumelanin and pheomelanin, respectively, based {{on the use of}} an octaclecylsilane column with polar end-capping with 1 % formic acid (pH 2. 8) /methanol as the eluant. The method requires conventional <b>HPLC</b> <b>equipments</b> and gives very good peak shapes and resolution, without need of ion pair reagents or high salt concentrations in the mobile phase. The intra-assay precision of the analytical runs was satisfactory with CV values <= 4. 0 % (n = 5) for the two markers which did not exceed 8 % after 50 consecutive injections on the column over 1 week. The peak area ratios at 254 and 280 nm (A(280) /A(254) : PTCA = 1. 1, BTCA = 0. 6) proved a valuable parameter for reliable identification of the structural markers even in the most complex degradation mixtures. The method can be applied to various eumelanin and pheomelanin pigmented tissues, including mammalian hair, skin and irides, and is amenable to be employed in population screening studies...|$|R

5000|$|On {{the eve of}} the publication, the University of Eindhoven {{made the}} news public. It {{resulted}} in excited media attention in the Netherlands, and under the pressure Buck publicly stated that he assumed that AIDS would be of the past in a couple of years, although it was agreed not to make such claims. Afterwards he explained, he deliberately had said this to raise more funds for his research, although much later he defended himself by saying that he was provoked by the reporter. Doubts raised immediately after the article appeared in Science. The next day, the Leiden University professor Van Boom, expert in the field of DNA synthesis, said in a leading Dutch newspaper, that pure phosphate methylated DNA is very difficult to produce, and easily contaminated. Six days after the publication internal criticism came to the surface. Buck colleague, professor Van Boeckel, also an expert in this field, had already criticized Bucks research a year before, and resigned because his warnings were not taken seriously. Van Boeckel had also been working on synthesis of phosphate methylated DNA, and knew how difficult it was to make such DNA-strands. A year before Bucks downfall, he {{came to the conclusion that}} Bucks longer strands could not be pure, because Van Boeckels research-assistant Kuijpers noticed that even a short phosphate methylated DNA wasn't stable. In May 1989 he invited one of Bucks research assistants to test their material on <b>HPLC</b> <b>equipment</b> in the lab of Organon, a Dutch pharmaceutical company. The measurement showed that the test material was not at all pure, but Buck refused to accept this fact. When Van Boeckel showed Buck a draft of the publication of his own research at the end of 1989, it resulted in a confrontation in which the University chose Bucks side. Van Boeckel and Kuijpers were ordered to stop their research, because [...] "it was too expensive and not productive". The doubts and criticism following the publication in Science led to a heated public debate in several Dutch newspapers and science magazines, and the University eventually acknowledged that the purity of the phosphate methylated DNA was still to be investigated. A committee was formed to investigate the proceedings and their conclusion (30 August 1990) was, that no phosphate methylated DNA could be traced. Also the committee reproached Buck for not paying attention to criticism from within his faculty. As a result Buck was dismissed as dean of the faculty. Goudsmit was requested to test the antisense material once again, but his enthusiasm had cooled, and Buck could not produce the pure phosphate methylated DNA in time. The publication in Science therefore had to be retracted.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the recent}} advances, the {{availability}} of 68 Ga radiopharmaceuticals to patients is still relatively limited. An estimated 10, 000 scans are being performed yearly in Europe at about 100 centres using 68 Ga-labelled somatostatin analogues; for the USA, only 2 university sites have begun to undertake human studies [10]. In the Netherlands, 68 Ga radiopharmaceuticals for routine clinical use are currently available in three hospitals only, {{two of which are}} university medical centres. Several factors for this past-hampered clinical introduction of 68 Ga radiopharmaceuticals can be identified and include a scarcity of 68 Ga generators, absence of 68 Ga radiopharmaceuticals with a marketing authorisation (absence of radiopharmaceutical cold kits) and lack of PET radiopharmaceutical regulations [7]. Presently, several Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)-grade generators are commercially available, as well as different (semi-)automated synthesis modules [7, 11]. In 2014, the first generator received a marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU). Moreover, with the publication of the European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monographs on 68 Ga-chloride and 68 Ga-edotreotide (DOTA-TOC) injection and the EANM guideline on the small-scale ‘in-house’ preparation of radiopharmaceuticals which are not kit procedures (cGRPP) and the existing EU-GMP annexes’ very specific guidance and quality requirements are currently provided [12 - 15]. Although these developments have reduced the number of barriers to implement 68 Ga radiolabelling for routine clinical use, several still remain. The major barriers involve the required investment in hot cells, a synthesis module and quality control equipment (e.g. gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) suitable for and dedicated to radiopharmaceuticals) and validation efforts. These prerequisites are more easily met in well-equipped (often university hospital) radiopharmacy departments but less often in conventional small-scale radiopharmacies. This situation could hamper the widespread utilization of 68 Ga-radiopharmaceuticals in the future, thereby denying large numbers of patients access to state-of-the-art nuclear medicine diagnostics. Our aim was to set up the preparation of 68 Ga-DOTA-NOC in compliance with all current EU-GMP, cGRPP and Ph. Eur. guidance but without {{the availability of}} a hot cell and GC, <b>HPLC</b> and AAS <b>equipment.</b>|$|R

The assays of total phospholipids and phospholipid subclasses {{are important}} for signal transduction studies. ### Reagents 1. Sol I: 1. 6 g of ammonium molybdate ((NH 4) 6 Mo 7 O 24  4 H 2 O; M. W. = 1235. 86) is dissolved in 12 mL water. - Sol II: 4 mL concentrated HCl and 1. 0 mL of mercury are shaken with 8 mL of Sol I for 60 min and filtered through glass wool. - Sol III: 20 mL of concentrated H 2 SO 4 {{is added to the}} remainder of Sol I, then, Sol II is added to the resultant solution to give Sol III. - Chromagenic solution: 45 mL methanol, 5 mL chloroform, and 20 mL water are added to 25 mL Sol III. It is stable for 3 months at 5 C. - CM mixture 2 : 1 : chloroform: methanol w/BHT = 2 L: 1 L: 100 mg - Mobile phase: - 1. Use 1000 mL graduate cylinder to add 3 L of HPLC grade acetonitrile to a 4 L bottle; - 2. Use 100 mL graduate cylinder to add 150 mL of HPLC grade methanol to the 4 L bottle; - 3. Use 50 mL graduate cylinder to add 27 mL of HPLC (or ACS) grade phosphoric acid to the 4 L bottle; - 4. Use 1000 µL automatic pipette to add 760 µL of to HPLC (or ACS) grade 98 % sulfuric acid to the 4 L bottle; - 5. Use stir bar to degas the mixture. Shake the bottle upside down vigorously several times. - CM mixture:chloroform:methanol:butylated hydroxytolune (BHT) = 2 L: 1 L: 100 mg. - CM mixture:chloroform:BHT= 100 mL: 900 mL: 100 mg. ### <b>Equipment</b> <b>HPLC</b> priming: 1. Check if mobile phase is enough. - Check if the washing solvent bottle in 507 E autosampler is enough. It is recommended to use degassed methanol as washing solvent (Ref 3 : pp 2 - 9). - Wash the autosampler syringe to get rid of air bubbles. Click the button of “ 507 E wash” 2 - 3 times. - Check if the autosampler tubing is leaking. - Change to the method for use. Click “single run” botton. Check if the mobile phase line is in the right solvent bottle. - Prime the pumps (First prime lines, then prime pumps). - Check if batch file options are right. Check the shutdown method {{to make sure that it}} uses the same mobile phase as the running method. - Check the hard disk space in Windows File Manager. - Check if the waste solvent bottle is full. ### Procedure I. Total PL assay 1. Check the automatic pipette before sample pipetting. Add 100 µL lymph/bile/serum with automatic pipette into a 16 × 100 mm PTFE capped test tube, wash the pipette tip with 100 µL D. I. water, and add 4 mL of CM mixture with 5 mL dispenser. - Vortex the tube vigorously. Wait at least 1 h for proteins in the sample to denature. There will be white stuff emerging gradually. - Add 800 µL D. I. water into the tube. Shake the tube upside down 3 times. Wait until there are two clear layers. Siphon off the upper layer with the negative water pressure instrument. - Evaporate the tube under a gentle stream of N 2 at 40 C. - Add 400 µL chloroform to the tube. Cap tightly. Vortex the tube with Vortex-Genie gently 3 times at # 3. - Add 100 µL chromagenic solution and shake the tube 3 times with fingers. - Cap the tube tightly. Otherwise the chloroform will evaporate and the absorbance will be very high. Boil the tube in the boiling water bath for 1 min 10 sec. Wait 5 min for the tube to cool down to room temperature. - Add 4 mL of chloroform gently into the tube and shake the tube 3 times with fingers. (Crucial point!!!) - Allow the tube to stand for 30 min at room temperature. - Take the lower solution quickly with a pasteur pipette. - Determine the absorbance at 710 nm. Use chloroform as the blank. II. PL subclasses assay 1. Prepare a set of 16 × 100 mm tubes. - Use 100 µL autopipette to add 100 µL of lymph/bile/serum. Wash the pipette tip with 100 µL of fresh D. I. water. - Add 5 mL of CM (2 : 1) mixture to the tube. Vortex vigorously. - Use multiple automatic pipette to add 25 µL of concentrated HCl to lower PH. Lower PH to separate phospholipids from proteins and deactive proteins. Optimum amount of concentrated HCl needs to be determined in the future studies. - After overnight deproteinization, cotton-like residue will appear. - Add 1 mL of fresh D. I. water (20 %). Shake gently upside down. Don’t vortex vigorously to break the protein residue to make sure easy separation of the residue. - Wait until two clear layers appear. - Siphon off the upper water layer. - Wait 30 min to let the leftover clear, then some white residue will appear on the surface, siphon off the residue again. - Evaporate the lower CM mixture layer. Check the temperature of the evaporator before using. - After drying, add 500 µL of inject solvent to dissolve the lipids. Methanol causes a negative peak close to PE peak. Acetonitrile causes a negative peak close to chloroform peak. - Too much chloroform is detrimental to the column and cause big solvent peaks. Small amount of chloroform is needed to dissolve the PI and PS. - To the best knowledge of this lab, acetonitrile (10) :chloroform (1) (v/v) is considered the most suitable inject solvent. - Pour the final mixture into the autosampler vials for HPLC running.

Currently, the procedure for the isolation of heptane asphaltenes and the determination of the amount of asphaltenes soluble in cyclohexane spans three days. A more rapid method to measure asphaltene solubility was explored using a novel on-column asphaltene precipitation and re-dissolution technique. This was automated using high performance liquid chromatography (<b>HPLC)</b> <b>equipment</b> with a step gradient sequence using the solvents: heptane, cyclohexane, toluene:methanol (98 : 2). Results for four series of original and pyrolyzed residua were compared with data from the gravimetric method. The measurement time was reduced from three days to forty minutes. The separation was expanded further with the use of four solvents: heptane, cyclohexane, toluene, and cyclohexanone or methylene chloride. This provides a fourth peak which represents the most polar components, in the oil...|$|E

Typically, protein-ligand complexes {{to be analyzed}} contain buffer salts, detergents, and other additives to enhance protein solubility, all of which make the sample unable to be analyzed directly by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. This work describes an in-line gel-filtration method that has been automated and optimized. Automation was achieved using commercial <b>HPLC</b> <b>equipment.</b> Gel column parameters that were optimized include: column dimensions, flow rate, packing material type, particle size, and molecular weight cut-off. Under optimal conditions, desalted protein ions are detected 4 min after injection and the analysis is completed in 20 min. The gel column retains good performance even after > 200 injections. A demonstration for using the in-line gel-filtration system is shown for monitoring the exchange of fatty acids {{from the pocket of}} a nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator activator-δ (PPARδ) with a tool compound.

40|$|If {{students}} in undergraduate analytical chemistry education analyze samples of known composition, their {{results can be}} verified. If the students get a 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 sample with an unknown composition {{in the frame of}} a problem-posing approach to teaching, it is difficult to check whether the students work accurately or not. Thus it is advisable to apply at least two different analytical methods. In this way the students gain a better insight into the differences and similarities of the diverse analytical methods and, by comparing the analytical results obtained with these methods, they get a better idea of the possibilities and accuracies. An important advantage in this approach is that students stimulate themselves to repeat experiments if different values are obtained from different analytical methods. This approach is demonstrated by the determination of caffeine in coffee applying a UV spectrophotometer, <b>HPLC</b> <b>equipment,</b> and CE apparatus. Some representative results are given showing the accuracy of the methods and showing the differences between the separation methods HPLC and CE versus UV spectrophotometry...|$|E

40|$|Biogenic amines (particularly {{histamine}} in {{the presence}} of putrescine and cadaverine) can lead to scombroid food poisoning if levels become too high. Low levels of these biogenic amines occur naturally, but high levels (FDA sets 50 ppm of histamine in fish as the maximum allowable level) can lead to scombroid poisoning. A number of analytical methods have been employed to analyze biogenic amines, especially High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Amines in general are difficult to analyze by Gas Chromatography (GC) due to their lack of volatility and their interaction with the GC column often leading to significant tailing and poor reproducibility. GC methods could be simpler and cheaper than <b>HPLC</b> <b>equipment</b> in some cases. Biogenic amines need to be derivatized before both GC and HPLC analyses. The objective of this research was to develop a relatively fast, reproducible method to derivatize and quantitate biogenic amines in fish at trace levels using GC/FID. The derivatizing reagent used in the experiments was propyl chloroformate, useful for aqueous samples. A method for GC/MS was also developed and used to confirm the identity of six derivatized biogenic amines. To our knowledge no reference spectra fo...|$|E

Soil solution samplers (lysimeters) are placed at specific locations to collect water from 1. 5 meters, 3. 0 meters and 10 meters from the soil surface. Suction provided by a vacuum pump was applied to the lysimeters for three hours prior to collection. After this time, the soil solution, if any was collected and placed into 20 ml HDPE scintillation vials and stored at - 15 C for later analysis. These samples were analyzed for pH with a Ross Sure Flow Combination Electrode. Electrical conductivity for each sample was measured with the use of an Accumet Conductivity Cell. Both electrodes were connected to an Accumet Model 50 pH/ion/conductivity meter. High Performance Liquid Chromatography was employed in an attempt to determine the amount of Biosurfactant present in each sample.

Samples of commercial sour cassava starch collected in South and Southeast Brazil were prepared for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The <b>HPLC</b> <b>equipment</b> had a Biorad Aminex HPX- 87 H column for organic acid analysis and a refractometric detector. Analysis was carried out with 0. 005 M sulfuric acid as mobile phase, 0. 6 ml/min flow rate and column temperature of 60 ° C. The acids quantified were lactic (0. 036 to 0. 813 g/ 100 g), acetic (0 to 0. 068 g/ 100 g), propionic (0 to 0. 013 g/ 100 g) and butyric (0 to 0. 057 g/ 100 g), that are produced during the natural fermentation of cassava starch. Results showed large variation among samples, even within the same region. Some samples exhibited high acid levels, mainly lactic acid, but in these neither propionic nor butyric acids were detected. Absence of butyric acid was not expected {{because this is an}} important component of the sour cassava starch aroma, and the lack of this acid may suggest that such samples were produced without the natural fermentation step...|$|E

40|$|Flavonoids are a {{class of}} {{secondary}} plant metabolites existing in great variety in nature. Due to this variety, identification can be difficult, especially as overlapping compounds in both chromatographic separations and mass spectrometric detection are common. Methods for distinguishing isobaric flavonoids using MS 2 and MS 3 have been developed. Chromatographic separation of various plant extracts was done with RP-HPLC and detected with positive ESI-MS operated in information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode. Two methods for the determination of flavonoid identity and substitution pattern, both featuring IDA criteria, were used together with the <b>HPLC</b> <b>equipment.</b> A third method where the collision energy was ramped utilized direct infusion. With the developed strategies, {{it is possible to}} differentiate between many isobaric flavonoids. Various classes of flavonoids were found in all of the plant extracts, in the red onion extract 45 components were detected and for 29 of them the aglycone was characterized, while the substituents were tentatively identified for 31 of them. For the strawberry extract, those numbers were 66, 30 and 60, and for the cherry extract 99, 56 and 71. The great variety of flavonoids, several of them isobaric, found in each of the extracts highlights the need for reliable methods for flavonoid characterization.

Seed extracts were derivatized by reaction with diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate and analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Calibration curves showed very good linearity of the response. The limit of detection and quantification were 0. 15 and 0. 50 μM, respectively. The method has a high intra- (RSD= 0. 35 %) and inter-repeatability (RSD= 2. 86 %), and a remarkable accuracy with a 99 % recovery in spiked samples.
