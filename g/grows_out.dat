5|$|Jaws is a 1974 {{novel by}} American writer Peter Benchley. It {{tells the story}} of a great white shark that preys upon a small resort town and the voyage of three men trying to kill it. The novel <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> of Benchley's {{interest}} in shark attacks after he learned about the exploits of shark fisherman Frank Mundus in 1964. Doubleday commissioned him to write the novel in 1971, a period when Benchley struggled as a freelance journalist.|$|E
5|$|The {{respiratory}} tract has a branching structure {{like that of}} a tree. In the embryo this structure is developed in the process of branching morphogenesis, and is generated by the repeated splitting of the tip of the branch. In the development of the lungs (as in some other organs) the epithelium forms branching tubes.The lung has a left-right symmetry and each bud known as a bronchial bud <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> as a tubular epithelium that becomes a bronchus. Each bronchus branches into bronchioles. The branching {{is a result of the}} tip of each tube bifurcating. The branching process forms the bronchi, bronchioles, and ultimately the alveoli. The four genes mostly associated with branching morphogenesis in the lung are the intercellular signalling protein – sonic hedgehog (SHH), fibroblast growth factors FGF10 and FGFR2b, and bone morphogenetic protein BMP4. FGF10 is seen to have the most prominent role. FGF10 is a paracrine signalling molecule needed for epithelial branching, and SHH inhibits FGF10. The development of the alveoli is influenced by a different mechanism whereby continued bifurcation is stopped and the distal tips become dilated to form the alveoli.|$|E
5|$|Two thick {{folds of}} skin {{encircle}} the body {{behind the front}} legs and before the hind legs. The rhino has a smaller fold of skin around its neck. The skin itself is thin, , and in the wild, the rhino appears to have no subcutaneous fat. Hair can range from dense (the most dense hair in young calves) to scarce, and is usually a reddish brown. In the wild, this hair is hard to observe because the rhinos are often covered in mud. In captivity, however, the hair <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> and becomes much shaggier, likely because of less abrasion from walking through vegetation. The rhino has a patch of long hair around its ears and a thick clump of hair {{at the end of}} its tail. Like all rhinos, they have very poor vision. The Sumatran rhinoceros is fast and agile; it climbs mountains easily and comfortably traverses steep slopes and riverbanks.|$|E

Katie thinks of herself {{as something of a}} WAG and wants to usurp Effy's place as queen bee of the group. Katie's homophobic attitudes cause problems between them, as Emily comes to terms with her homosexuality. The quieter of the two, Emily is used to being in her sister's shadow, and is sulky but perceptive. She tends to not stand out in a crowd due to her insecurities, but later <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> within the show. She is in love with Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless), a fiery, politically charged and passionate young woman with idealistic views and an abundance of ambition. Emily also develops a good friendship with JJ, becoming close confidantes to one another.|$|E
25|$|Josephus {{interpreted}} the Tabernacle and its furnishings {{to represent the}} universe. He saw the Tabernacle's two parts accessible to the priests (the Holy and the Courtyard) to denote {{the land and the}} sea, the third division set aside for God (the Holy of Holies) to represent heaven, inaccessible to people. He saw the 12 loaves to denote the year divided into months. He saw the Menorah divided into 70 parts, representing the 70 divisions of the planets, and the seven lamps on the Menorah to refer to the course of the seven planets (then known). He saw the veils, composed of four things, to declare the four elements: the fine linen signified the earth, because the flax <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> of the earth; the purple signified the sea, because purple was dyed by the blood of shellfish from the sea; the blue signified the air; and the scarlet signified fire.|$|E

500|$|Cicadas are {{commonly}} eaten by birds and sometimes by squirrels, {{as well as}} bats, wasps, mantises, spiders and robber flies. In times of mass emergence of cicadas, various amphibians, fish, reptiles, mammals and birds change their foraging habits so as {{to benefit from the}} glut. Newly hatched nymphs may be eaten by ants, and nymphs living underground are preyed on by burrowing mammals like moles. In Australia, cicadas are preyed on by the Australian cicada killer wasp (Exeirus lateritius), which stings and stuns cicadas high in the trees, making them drop to the ground where the cicada-hunter mounts and carries them, pushing with its hindlegs, sometimes over a distance of a hundred metres, until they can be shoved down into its burrow, where the numb cicada is placed onto one of many shelves in a [...] "catacomb", to form the food-stock for the wasp grub that <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> of the egg deposited there.|$|E

The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff felt that the music was the worst aspect of the episode, similarly criticizing song selections based on their [...] relationship to religion. He felt that Kurt's performance was the only number which worked even slightly, commenting, [...] "it genuinely <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> of the moment, although the fact that Kurt is singing it to his dad never stops being kind of weird." [...] Both Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV's Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] brought new meaning to the song, with Semigran naming it her favourite number of the episode. She felt that [...] "I Look to You" [...] was the episode's weakest song, preferring Riley's [...] "more powerful" [...] rendition of [...] "Bridge over Troubled Water". Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times expressed disappointment in both of Riley's songs, which left her [...] "strangely unmoved".

Gay men's website AfterElton placed Ianto as their seventh best gay and bisexual character in modern science fiction (encompassing television, film and comic books), with Torchwoods Jack, Ianto's love interest, receiving first place. Wired magazine {{was impressed with the}} way Ianto's romantic storyline was handled in the third series, and praised Davies's writing for the [...] "deft, sympathetic handling" [...] of the Harkness-Jones romance, compared with the [...] "clumsiness" [...] of the show's homoerotic overtones in previous series. Because Ianto's storyline <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> of the reality of the show, [...] "it plays with such genuine sympathy and pathos that Jones's eventual fate is easily the miniseries' most powerful moment." [...] Wired describes David-Lloyd's performance as Jones as [...] "a key element in the success of the five-episode story arc." [...] One AfterElton contributor disliked the death scene partially for the loss of a [...] "beloved gay character", and because Ianto's death was caused by Jack's stupidity, goading on the aliens. They compared the death scene to that of Tara (Amber Benson) in Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer which he felt was more satisfying, although [...] "unbearably sad" [...] because of its pivotal role in {{the character}} arc for Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and as being [...] "possibly the single most significant event in the whole seven-season series." [...] He feels that both Joss Whedon and Russell T Davies toyed with their LGBT fans' affections, and claim [...] "neither Whedon nor Davies seem aware of the impact that these characters were having on viewers starved for such representations." [...] Later, AfterElton published an opposing view, which analysed the character's death in view of the character's earlier refusal to admit to his relationship with a man, and claimed that, instead of being an expression of homophobia, the death was a sign that the LGBT community was leaving behind its image of victimhood. In 2012 David Brown of the Radio Times described Ianto's demise as one of televisions five most shocking death scenes and [...] "surely [...] finest hour".|$|E
500|$|A {{common law}} rule from Great Britain permits {{searches}} incident to an arrest without a warrant. This rule {{has been applied}} in American law, and has a lengthy common law history. The justification for such a search is to prevent the arrested individual 1.) from destroying evidence or 2.) using a weapon against the arresting officer by disarming the suspect. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that [...] "both justifications for the search-incident-to-arrest exception are absent and the rule does not apply", when [...] "there is no possibility" [...] that the suspect could gain access to a weapon or destroy evidence. In Trupiano v. United States (1948), the Supreme Court held that [...] "a search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been {{considered to be a}} strictly limited right. It <b>grows</b> <b>out</b> of the inherent necessities of the situation {{at the time of the}} arrest. But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest." [...] In United States v. Rabinowitz (1950), the Court reversed Trupiano, holding instead that the officers' opportunity to obtain a warrant was not germane to the reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest. Rabinowitz suggested that any area within the [...] "immediate control" [...] of the arrestee could be searched, but it did not define the term. In deciding Chimel v. California (1969), the Supreme Court elucidated its previous decisions. It held that when an arrest is made, it is reasonable for the officer to search the arrestee for weapons and evidence. However, in Riley v. California (2014), the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that police must obtain a warrant to search an arrestee's cellular phone. The Court said that earlier Supreme Court decisions permitting searches incident to an arrest without a warrant do not apply to [...] "modern cellphones, which are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy," [...] and noted that US citizens' cellphones today typically contain [...] "a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives — from the mundane to the intimate." ...|$|E
