40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the effects of the institution-based <b>family</b> <b>training</b> programs on the attitudes of parents. The study was conducted at Tüpraş Elementary School in Batman in 2011. The participants of the study are 66 parents (33 parents in the experimental group and 33 parents in the control group). The research is carried out with the quasi-experimental model and as an experimental model the “pre test and post test with control group” was used. In the research for collecting the data, “Parent Attitude Scale” was given to both groups as pre test and post test before and after the <b>family</b> <b>training</b> program. In the analysis of data, paired sample t-test and independent sample t-test analysis were used. In this study, there was no significant difference between pre-test mean scores of the families who are participating and not participating to family education. However, there is a significant difference between post-test mean scores of the families and it showed a significant difference in favor of the experimental group. According to this result, it was revealed that the average scores of the democratic attitudes of parents, participating <b>family</b> <b>training</b> program, significantly increased. In this case, the <b>family</b> <b>training</b> program is an effective program for families in gaining positive attitudes...|$|R
