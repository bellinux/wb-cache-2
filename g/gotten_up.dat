25|$|The {{clock in}} the {{building}} tower was originally mechanical in nature, and kept accurate time via gravity. A cable was wrapped around a drum, and a large weight attached {{to the end of}} the cable. As the cable unwound due to the force of gravity, the clock hands turned. The cable was rewound once or twice a day. On October 10, 1956, the weight came loose from the cable and plunged through two floors (narrowly avoiding killing a man, who had just <b>gotten</b> <b>up</b> from his desk). The mechanical clock was later replaced with an electric one.|$|E

500|$|It is {{revealed}} that the real Don was alive, and was pretending to be Vijay the whole time. While in the hospital, Don had recovered quickly from his injuries, and had overheard Vardhan/DeSilva's conversation with Vijay. After Vijay's operation, Don had <b>gotten</b> <b>up</b> from the room {{at a moment when}} Vardhan and Dr.Ashok were absent and gone to the room where Vijay lay. He had switched places with Vijay and taken Vijay off life support, causing him to die. It is also {{revealed that the}} disc Don had given to the police was fake. Now, with both Vardhan and Singhania removed from his path, Don becomes the master of the entire Asian drug dealing ring.

The song begins {{to turn into a}} jam after about the first two minutes, prominently including a choir of singers chanting [...] "Bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - (<b>get</b> <b>up)</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance - bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - (<b>get</b> <b>up</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance - bite your lip - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> - <b>get</b> <b>up</b> and dance, dance, dance! (Dance, dance...) (Dance, dance, daaaaaance!)". Like the amount of vocals, the amount of instrumentation increases significantly during this portion, but with John on piano, the piano is obviously the dominant instrument; there are three piano solos in the song. As a result of the musical free-for-all, the song is six minutes and forty-three seconds, making it one of John's longest.|$|R

2500|$|On February 2, 2000, George W. Bush, as {{candidate}} for President, spoke during school's chapel hour. Bush gave a standard stump speech making no specific {{reference to the}} university. His political opponents quickly noted his non-mention of the university's ban on interracial dating. During the Michigan primary, Bush was also criticized for not stating {{his opposition to the}} university's anti-Catholicism. (The John McCain campaign targeted Catholics with a [...] "Catholic Voter Alert," [...] phone calls reminding voters of Bush's visit to BJU.) Bush denied that he either knew of or approved what he regarded as BJU's intolerant policies. On February 26, Bush issued a formal letter of apology to Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor of New York for failing to denounce Bob Jones University's history of anti-Catholic statements. At a news conference following the letter's release, Bush said, [...] "I make no excuses. I had an opportunity and I missed it. I regret that....I wish I had <b>gotten</b> <b>up</b> then and seized the moment to set a tone, a tone that I had set in Texas, a positive and inclusive tone." [...] Also during the 2000 Republican primary campaign in South Carolina, Richard Hand, a BJU professor, spread a false e-mail rumor that John McCain had fathered an illegitimate child. (The McCains have an adopted daughter from Bangladesh, and later push polling also implied that the child was biracial.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the capture}} of Island No. 10, the next Federal {{objective}} on the Mississippi was Fort Pillow, upstream of and defending Memphis, Tennessee. Rather than assault the fort, Major General Henry Wager Halleck, commanding the Army west of the Appalachians, had moved into {{the interior of the}} states of Tennessee and Mississippi. Consequently, the struggle for Fort Pillow was reduced to a mortar bombardment like that at Island No. 10. However, the Confederate forces were augmented by eight cottonclad rams of the River Defense Fleet, and these surprised the bombarding mortar boat and its single accompanying gunboat [...] on the morning of 10 May 1862. Mound City was with other gunboats at anchor a short distance upstream when the sounds of battle were heard, and she promptly got up steam and was the first to {{come to the aid of}} the vessels already involved in the fray. Because the Union ships entered the fight one at a time, the Rebels were able to concentrate on each in its turn. Cincinnati had already been rammed several times and was out action, fleeing to shallow water to avoid sinking. With no other support, Mound City was rammed by CSS Earl Van Dorn. The blow was so severe that her bow was almost wrenched off. She, like Cincinnati, had to seek refuge in shoals where the deep-draft rams could not follow. By this time, several other Federal gunboats had <b>gotten</b> <b>up</b> steam and were entering the battle, so Confederate commander James E. Montgomery withdrew his fleet.|$|E

40|$|Cattle have {{a species}} {{specific}} movement pattern when lying down and <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> They need sufficient space for {{their heads to}} perform these movements normally. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the lying down and <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> behaviour of beef bulls at a Swedish farm operation. The hypothesis was that bulls older than 10 months (over approximately 400 kg) were disturbed by a horizontal front rail and that the time to lie down and <b>get</b> <b>up</b> differed from what can be regarded as normal based on earlier scientific studies. The bulls were Swedish Red and White (SRB), Swedish Friesian (SLB) or crossbreeds of these two, and were kept in a cubicle system with a stall front design where there was a horizontal rail 40 cm above the stall floor. The age of the bulls ranged from 4 to 18 months. A group consisting of 33 bulls with weights 424 - 615 kg was chosen for the study. During one week in July 2008, behavioural observations were made daily from 7. 30 to 11. 30 hrs. Thirty-one of the 33 bulls were observed when lying down or <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> The total number of observations for lying down was 175 and for <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> 157. The median total time for lying down was 27 s and for <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> 6. 9 s, including interrupted sequences. According to a separate regression analysis, body weight was not significantly associated with time for lying down (P> 0. 05). The recorded times for lying down and <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> corresponded well with other studies. The bulls had 21 % interrupted lying down and 3 % interrupted <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> behaviours. During 12 % of the <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> movements they were slipping, whereas this was not recorded during lying down. There were 3 recordings of abnormal lying down and 5 recordings of abnormal <b>getting</b> <b>up.</b> The head was held over the rail during 38 % of the lying down movements and during 76 % of the <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> movements. In conclusion this study did not show any longer times for lying down and <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> in bulls with a head rail at 40 cm above the floor, but there were some interrupted lying down behaviours and slipping at <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> and the head position during these movements may be of importance...|$|R
