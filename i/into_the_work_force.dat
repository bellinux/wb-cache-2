25|$|The {{origins of}} trade unions {{can be traced}} back to 18th century Britain, where the rapid {{expansion}} of industrial society then taking place, drew women, children, rural workers and immigrants <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>force</b> in large numbers and in new roles. This pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour spontaneously organized in fits and starts throughout its beginnings, and would later be an important arena for the development of trade unions. Trade unions have sometimes been seen as successors to the guilds of medieval Europe, though the relationship between the two is disputed, as the masters of the guilds employed workers (apprentices and journeymen) who were not allowed to organize.|$|E

Steimel objected to an increase in the minimum wage, a measure which he said would [...] "wreak havoc [...] with the very individuals it is designed to help most -- new entrants <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>force</b> and new minority workers in particular." [...] He called the 1988 legislative session the [...] "John Galt Congress", borrowing from Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged, in which uninformed people merely shrug their shoulders and ask [...] "Who is John Galt"?" [...] whenever they are questioned about the grip of expanded government on their lives and liberty. A few days later, Steimel wrote that in the United States [...] "political power usually gravitates to where public money is most available. ... We need our own money spent in our own community for things we need or want to improve our quality of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Great Britain, a {{shortage}} of small denomination coinage had been reported {{as early as the}} late 14th century. [...] Such {{a shortage}} made it difficult for workers to be paid, and for transactions of daily life to be carried out. [...] The shortages persisted and worsened through the late 17th century and became particularly problematic {{by the middle of the}} 18th century. [...] The shortage of small denomination coinage reached a critical mass with the move of many workers away from agricultural jobs and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>force</b> in factories during the Industrial Revolution. [...] The growing payrolls of factories were nearly impossible to meet for employers with no supply of coins. [...] At the same time, the population growth rate of Great Britain between 1750 and 1800 nearly quadrupled. The situation was only made worse by the outflow of British silver coins via Gresham's law, the preponderance of counterfeit copper coins in circulation, and the Royal Mint's sporadic production of non-gold coins from the late 17th century to the late 18th century. [...] For many years, no copper or silver coins were minted at all, and in 1775 King George III had halted the production of copper coinage at the Royal Mint.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{statistically}} {{analyzes the}} transferability of military skills to civilian job {{markets and the}} relationship between acquired military training and civilian wages.

The relationship between veteran status and post-service civilian wages is examined using linear regression methods. The models test the existence of either a veterans premium or penalty with respect to civilian earnings as a function of various military training, occupation, background, and other variables. Results show that veterans receive a significant wage premium over their civilian counterparts. Additionally, veterans who use their military training in their current civilian job receive higher wages than either non-veterans or veterans who do not use their military skills in civilian occupations.

40|$|ABSTRACT) Technological and {{strategic}} developments {{have changed the}} role of human operators in the manufacturing environment. <b>The</b> highly specialized <b>work</b> <b>force</b> of <b>the</b> low-tech manufacturing system has evolved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> multi-functional <b>work</b> <b>force</b> of <b>the</b> high-tech manufacturing system. Among the multiple tasks that an operator is expected to conduct in advanced manufacturing systems (AMS) are job scheduling, inventory planning, machine set-up, problem solving, and quality inspection. The quality inspection task in AMS consists of a search component, frequently conducted by a machine, and a decision making component conducted by the operator. This quality inspection system {{is often referred to}} as a hybrid inspection system (HIS). It has been demonstrated that in general the performance of HIS is better than that of pure human or pure automated inspection systems. This research investigated the effects of different types of defects (presented at the same time in the inspected parts), multitasking (concurrently conducting independent tasks), and their interaction on the operator’s performance in the quality inspection task (with a memorized quality criteria) in an AMS...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of numerically controlled machines, group technology, cellular manufacturing and just-in-time (JIT) production systems have revolutionized the way products are designed and manufactured.

Among the multiple tasks that an operator is expected to perform in advance manufacturing systems (AMS) are job scheduling, inventory planning, machine set-up, problem-solving and quality inspection. Throughout this evolution, human sensory detection capabilities have been a vital but often ignored component of the quality inspection task. Although automation is often employed to construct and assemble products within AMS, most inspections and quality checks are still done by human operators due to the inherent problems in machine vision and decision-making. While humans remain responsible for inspection, it has been widely accepted that the quality inspection task performed by humans is prone to error. Some studies indicate human inspectors typically find only ~ 80 % of the defects. Despite the contributions of human factors research {{to the understanding of}} human performance in the quality inspection task, the manufacturing trend has been to design quality schemes that compensate for poor inspector performance instead of trying to improve it (Drury 1992) ...|$|R
500|$|A [...] "major consequence" [...] of the typewriter's {{development}} was {{the entrance of}} women <b>into</b> <b>the</b> clerical <b>work</b> <b>force.</b> Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings. Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881, women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper <b>work</b> that demanded <b>the</b> efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work. In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%. Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, [...] "I do feel that I have done something for {{the women who have}} always had to work so hard.

Two opposing lenses are commonly used to explain the gender income gap, human capital theory and feminist theory. The former focuses on the role played by women 2 ̆ 7 s choices such as educational level or commitment to family. The later looks to the broader society and the ideology of patriarchy as the root for this disparity. This study explores a number of general hypotheses. Is there a gender income gap among Ontario Social Workers? If so what variables can explain that gap? Is there a perception of discrimination or oppression in this population? Is there a disparity in administrative status between males and females and if so what explains that disparity? A mailed survey to a sample of the alumni of two large Ontario social work programmes, one master level and one undergraduate, provided 1075 responses.

Morally, it is the greatest menace to our social order ” (Roosevelt 1934). “The real problem, fundamental yet essentially simple [is] to provide employment for everyone ” (Keynes 1980 : 267). “The voices which, in such a conjuncture, {{tell us that the}} path of escape {{is to be found in}} strict economy and in refraining, wherever possible, from utilizing the world’s potential production, are the voices of fools and madmen ” (Keynes, 1982, XXI: 61). Abstract: Since 2008, the U. S. economy has been mired in the second worst economic crisis in its history. Conceivably, massive government spending could bring the economy out of this slump as massive war spending ultimately ended the Great Depression of the 1930 s. However, a far superior strategy exists: Guaranteeing employment accompanied by retraining to enable all unemployed workers to become absorbed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> regular <b>work</b> <b>force.</b> Beyond ending <b>the</b> crisis, the superiority of this strategy is that it would institutionalize a procedure for insuring that, in an increasingly technologically dynamic and open economy, workers would possess the necessary skills for available jobs. Guaranteeing employment would also eliminate the ecological costs associated with the need to seek growth to generate employment at practically any cost. Finally, it would establish a new moral social contract whereby everyone is granted the dignity that accompanies being a productive member of society. Welfare for those able to work could disappear, along with the degradation and humiliation that accompanies it...|$|R
