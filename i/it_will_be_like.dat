But I just sat back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.|$|E
500|$|Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, [...] "I don't {{know how}} to put into words how {{fortunate}} I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> saying I played with Babe Ruth." [...] Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, [...] "I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.' ...I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "I Worship You" [...] was {{described}} as [...] "falling somewhere between adult contemporary and rock", and utilizes acoustic guitars and synthesizers. [...] "Here Am I" [...] relates the story {{of people who are}} not being reached by Christians, and [...] "challenges the listener {{to go out into the}} world and stand up for their King". [...] "On My Way to You" [...] is a worship song, requesting [...] "wisdom, purity, and humility in our pursuit of holiness". [...] "How Great is Your Love" [...] incorporates both string and electronic instruments; Millard's vocals in the song utilize [...] "effect–laden delays". [...] "I Can Only Imagine" [...] is a ballad, opening with just piano before building to include drums and guitar. Lyrically, it asks what <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> in Heaven, standing before God.|$|E

500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{displays}} Milo's growth; Leonard S. Marcus in {{his notes}} to its annotated edition {{writes that the}} boy learns to think in the abstract, pledging after his unintentional jump to Conclusions {{that he will not}} make up his mind again without a good reason. [...] Milo does not accept the word of the demon of insincerity that he is a threat and is rewarded by learning he is not. Just for a moment, Milo is able to float in the air beside Alec Bings and see things from the perspective he will have as an adult, allowing the young reader to contemplate what <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to do the same. According to Liston, Milo [...] "transforms himself from an unthinking and compliant Lethargarian to a young adult with greater consciousness, a firmer sense of self, and a newly found set of responsibilities".|$|E
500|$|The album's songs also feature offbeat sounds, improvisational elements, and {{conversational}} vocals {{derived from}} rap. The Revival {{begins with a}} directive from a grave voice: [...] "Play this record as frequently as possible, Then, as it becomes easier for you, play the record once a day, or as needed." [...] The album also features dialogue between an old lady who asks the group whether <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> their last album, on which she was also featured; they respond to her question [...] "No, ma'am". [...] "All the Way" [...] has a scrambling beat, whistle sounds, and the rhythmic call and response [...] "What are we, what are we, what are we? ... Just a bunch of brothers having a party". The end of [...] "Feels Good" [...] features witty jazz keyboard playing behind a lively voice saying [...] "it feels good ... in the hands, feet, bones, heart, and soul". Ed Hogan of Allmusic writes that [...] "the last part sounds like a Sunday morning testimonial." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy" [...] {{was written}} by Beyoncé as well as Mark Batson. It is the final song on Dangerously in Love, and is a hidden track on some copies. Beyoncé {{initially}} {{was not going to}} include the song on the album, however after undergoing multiple push-backs, she was able to work on extra material for the album which included [...] "Daddy". Over forty-three songs were recorded for Dangerously in Love, all of which were overseen by father Mathew, however Beyoncé secretly planted the song on the album as a hidden track which left Mathew speechless out of shock and appreciation. He later revealed during an interview with Billboard magazine in 2009: [...] "My favorite songs is... 'Daddy'... It basically says 'Thank you for all you've given me and when I marry a man, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> my daddy'". Preceding the album's release, the song was released to iTunes Store exclusively in the United States on June 23, 2003, through Columbia Records. It is also featured on the soundtrack of Tyler Perry's Daddy's Little Girls (2007).|$|E

50|$|In February 2017, Marx, when {{speaking}} of the events surrounding this controversy, stated: '“We have discussions in the church, normal discussions, tensions. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> forever <b>like</b> this.” Marx also claimed that support for the Pope within the church was substantial.|$|R
500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that no one else will ever see... I can't imagine {{what they are going to}} do with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} host, Santorum said, [...] "I’m not {{defending}} Newsmax’s decision to put Donald Trump in there. If {{you look at}} the [...] debate where Jim Cramer is screaming at people– maybe Donald will surprise us both." [...] Gingrich said, [...] "I can’t imagine what <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like,</b> which is part of why–– This is very serious business, picking the president of the United States. We all have to be very serious but, {{every once in a while}} on the campaign trail, to have something that just breaks out, is good. I believe that having Donald Trump in that kind of environment will absolutely be amazing." [...] On December 13, Trump withdrew as moderator and the debate was canceled.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the next}} scene, the two gondoliers have married Tessa and Gianetta, {{and as they}} are extolling the virtues of marriage, Don Alhambra arrives and informs them {{that one of them}} is the King of Barataria, but no one knows which. [...] Despite being Republicans, the gondoliers and their new wives are delighted, and agree to go to Barataria at once, acting as one {{individual}} until the actual king is identified. [...] The Grand Inquisitor tells them, however, that ladies are not admitted until the actual king is identified, and then each couple can be reunited. [...] The Grand Inquisitor neglects to mention that the King is married to Casilda, fearing that it would cause the men to refuse to leave their new wives. [...] As the two wives are imagining what <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> to be a queen, their friends enter, and Marco and Giuseppe announce their discovery and promise to reign in a Republican fashion. [...] They announce that in their kingdom, [...] "All shall equal be" [...] and will create new posts such as [...] "the Lord High Coachman on the Box, the Lord High Vagabond in the Stocks". [...] All the men then set sail for Barataria, leaving their wives behind in Venice.|$|E

2500|$|When General Sherman {{decided to}} send the Kiowa war chiefs to Jacksboro for trial, he wanted an example made. [...] What he did not want, and what happened, was that the trial became a circus. [...] First, the two {{attorneys}} appointed to represent the two Kiowa actually represented them, instead of participating {{in the kind of}} civics lesson which the Army had wanted. [...] Their trial strategy of arguing that the two Chiefs were simply fighting a war for their people's survival attracted worldwide attention, and galvanized opposition to the entire process. [...] Moreover, the Bureau of Indian Affairs also opted to oppose the entire process, and also argued that the two chiefs were not subject to civilian jurisdiction since their people were at war with the United States. [...] Nor were the Indians apologetic. [...] At his trail Satanta warned what might happen if he was hanged: [...] " [...] I am a great chief among my people. If you kill me, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a spark on the prairie. It will make a big fire – a terrible fire!" [...] Satanta was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, as was Big Tree; but Edmund Davis, the Governor of Texas, under enormous pressure from leaders of the so-called Quaker Peace Policy, decided to overrule the court and the punishment for both was changed to life imprisonment. [...] Satanta and Big Tree were convicted of murder on 5–6 July in Jack County, Texas. [...] Thanks to the stubborn behaviour of Guipago, who forced the U.S. Government to agree seriously threatening a new bloody war, Satanta and Big Tree were freed after two years of imprisonment at the Huntsville State Penitentiary in Texas.|$|E
