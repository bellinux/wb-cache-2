5000|$|It is {{suggested}} in Scattered Suns that the <b>faeros</b> {{may be the}} [...] "Lightsource" [...] from which the Ildiran thism is derived. This is expanded in Of Fire and Night, in which the pretender to the Imperial Throne, Rusa'h, appears to be linked with the <b>faeros,</b> possibly {{in a similar manner}} to Jess Tamblynn and the wentals, or Beneto and the verdani. Also during the fifth book, a hydrogue emissary unknowingly hints that the Ildirans and <b>faeros</b> were once allies; later in the book, it seems that this bond (should the records be believed) was formed to drive off the evil Shana-Rei.

500|$|On 20 August, her hull {{was badly}} damaged after a {{collision}} with the frigate [...] in Gourock Bay. After repairs at Ardrossan that lasted until 4 September, she resumed local convoy duties between the <b>Faeroes,</b> the Clyde and Scapa Flow until she required major machinery repairs in November. Upon their completion on 30 January 1945, Bulldog escorted convoys between Plymouth and various ports in the Irish Sea {{for the rest of}} the war. On 9 May 1945 she sailed to Guernsey where she participated in the Liberation of the German-occupied Channel Islands who formally surrendered to British representatives aboard the ship. The ship was placed in Category 'B' reserve on 27 May at Dartmouth. She was transferred to Rosyth on 27 November and was reduced to Category 'C' reserve on 13 December. Bulldog was approved for scrapping on 22 December and turned over to Metal Industries, Limited on 17 January 1946.|$|E
500|$|Survivors {{estimated}} that about 900 men abandoned Glorious. The Germans {{did not try}} to pick up survivors. The Royal Navy knew nothing of the sinking until it was announced on German radio. [...] The Norwegian ship , on passage to the Faroe Islands, arrived late on 10 June and picked up survivors, eventually delivering 37 alive to Thorshavn of whom two later died. Another Norwegian ship, Svalbard II, also making for the <b>Faeroes,</b> picked up five survivors but was sighted by a German aircraft and forced to return to Norway, where the four still alive became prisoners of war for the next five years. It is also believed that one more survivor from Glorious was rescued by a German seaplane. Therefore, the total of survivors was 40, including one each from Acasta and Ardent. The total killed or missing was 1,207 from Glorious, 160 from Acasta and 152 from Ardent, a total of 1,519.|$|E
500|$|On {{the first}} day of the war on 3 September 1939, Cardiff was {{assigned}} to the 12th Cruiser Squadron which was fruitlessly searching for returning German merchant ships in the North and Norwegian Seas. Several days later, she was assigned to patrol the gaps between the Shetland and Faeroe Islands and between the <b>Faeroes</b> and Iceland as part of the Northern Patrol. In late November, she fruitlessly searched for the German battleships [...] and [...] after they sank the armed merchant cruiser, , on the 23rd. On 12 June, Cardiff was tasked to suppress the German artillery batteries overlooking Saint-Valery-en-Caux to prevent them from firing on British ships as they evacuated the troops there, but they were no longer visible from the sea when the ship arrived. The cruiser received six wounded men from the coaster Cameo and returned to Portsmouth. Cardiff was converted for use as a gunnery training ship in October and served in that capacity for the rest of the war. The ship was fitted with six [...] Oerlikon light AA guns and a Type 290 surface-search radar by April 1942. By late 1943 a Type 273 long-range search radar had also been fitted. Cardiff was paid off on 3 September 1945 and sold for scrap to Arnott Young on 23 January 1946. The ship was broken up in Dalmuir, Scotland, after she arrived there on 18 March.|$|E
50|$|Not much {{is known}} about the <b>faeros</b> however is known that they travel in {{powerful}} and massive ellipsoid ships. These ships much like the hydrogues are made with an exterior much the same at their environment. The hull is made of a gaseous material that can withstand extreme temperatures of a sun and it also emits heat itself. The weapons consignment on board a <b>faeros</b> ship is unknown. They have previously destroyed hydrogue ships simply by ramming into them at high speeds. A <b>faeros</b> fireball can be seen on the cover of Ashes of Worlds.|$|R

40|$|First {{proposed}} in the 1950 ’s, oblique flying wings offer superior aerodynamic perfor-mance in transonic and supersonic flight. Recent advances in technology have revived interest in such configurations for supersonic transports.

This paper seeks to understand aeroelasticity and its coupling with flight dynamics in oblique flying wing configurations.
