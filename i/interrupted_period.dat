Some sources {{indicate}} that Miyazato began training under Miyagi {{at the age of}} 13, while others state that Miyazato first trained under his own father and only began training under Miyagi at the age of 15. Miyazato's father had been a student of Kanryo Higaonna, who had been Miyagi's teacher, so Miyagi accepted the young Miyazato as his student. Except for an <b>interrupted</b> <b>period</b> due to World War II, Miyazato learned from Miyagi continuously until the death of the latter in 1953. Apart from his karate training, he also studied judo under Shoko Itokazu.|$|E

None of the {{patients had}} had prior anaphylaxis and none were judged atopic. Skin tests to an extract of the drug (0. 02 mg) were uniformly negative, whereas a higher concentration produced a nonspecific irritant reaction.

The effects of interrupted drying on drying rates, cracking enhancement ratios, and the performance of a commercial circulating rice dryer were evaluated.

On the one hand, each population had its own history. On the other hand, communities maintained close contacts with both their neighbors and with those further distant.

40|$|Based on a(n) (<b>interrupted)</b> <b>period</b> of 15 {{years of}} fieldwork, this study explores the {{question}} whether cultural villages in South Africa are to be considered {{an effective way to}} conserve a particular cultural heritage in an authentic way. In order to answer this question, three notions of authenticity are juxtaposed with three types of cultural villages. The outcomes reveal a nuanced answer that suggests that some types of cultural villages do contribute to the conservation of an authentic cultural heritage, but not all. The research also shows how cultural heritage tourism is often haunted and influenced by old colonial stereotypes and exoticism. [URL] and Archaeolog...|$|E
40|$|Attachment disorders, while {{considered}} rare {{within the}} gen-eral population (i. e., 0. 9 %– 1. 4 % of the school-age popula-tion), appear {{at a rate}} between 38 % and 40 % {{of children who are}} adopted or who reside in foster care (Minnis et al., 2013; Skovgaard, 2010; Stinehart, Scott, & Barfield, 2012). Attachment disorders are thought to be attributed to an ini-tial or <b>interrupted</b> <b>period</b> of bonding prior to the age of 5 years, and despite being placed in an appropriate environ-ment that attempts to comfort and meet the child’s needs, the attachment disruptions continue (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013).

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} system for {{monitoring}} surface wheel-grinding by analyzing the dynamic alterations in output variables and the process system state parameters. It analyzes the intervals of the process system state parameter interrupts. State space analysis was employed to describe {{the behavior of the}} grinding process system. The dependencies obtained enable a complete description of how the system behaves at any interval of the main <b>interrupt</b> <b>period.</b> The analysis of such behavior is reduced to sequential calculation of its parameters at times t 1, t 2, …, ti at interrupt intervals T 1, T 2, …, TN. The proposed state space analysis method enables an independent evaluation of output perturbations. Besides, by analyzing the dependencies we had obtained, we concluded that for such evaluation, one would have to calculate not only the absolute values of output variables, but also their first and sometimes even second derivatives...|$|R

40|$|ALASKA The remarkably high {{frequency}} of strong surface winds {{in the region}} of Big Delta, Alaska, is studied with respect to its cause, characteristics, and local effects. During the winter, the winds are predominantly east-southeast and, unlike glacier or valley winds, are caused by a topographically induced convergence of the flow of air down the Tanana Valley which occurs at times of southeast gradient winds aloft. Strong south winds are also experienced the year round. A noteworthy characteristic of the east-southeast winds is their persistence; an extreme case is described in which gusts in excess of 40 m. p. h. endured for 7 % days (January 20 - 28, 1952). Another characteristic of these winds is the marked diurnal variation in the frequency of their commencement, by which a strong control by atmospheric tides is inferred. An important effect of the winds is to <b>interrupt</b> <b>periods</b> of very low temperature, but sometimes to create severe “wind chill. ” The paper concludes with a brief account of the forecast problem. 1...|$|R
50|$|Study Centre for Indian Literature in English and Translation (SCILET) {{was founded}} by Rev. Dr. Paul L.

SCILET is facilitates the translation of regional language writing into English, so that literature written in such local languages as Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telegu can be read {{in all parts of}} the country.

40|$|Detecting {{changes in}} complex {{monitoring}} tasks {{is important for}} situation awareness, yet surprisingly difficult. Interruptions exacerbate this problem. An intuitively appealing {{solution to this problem}} is Instant Replay. Users could replay <b>interrupted</b> <b>periods</b> at high speed to quickly perceive changes. Instant Replay’s appeal seems to rest on its familiarity and realistic re-presentation of the temporal sequence of the interrupted situation. However, current theories of perception, including Naïve Realism (Smallman & St. John, 2005), predict this emphasis on realism to be misguided. We compared two versions of replay against three alternative tools in a naval air warfare simulation in which 35 participants monitored a busy airspace for significant changes. One alternative, CHEX, a situation awareness recovery concept we are developing, automatically detects and logs changes into an interactive table. CHEX provided an effective representation for quickly recovering situation awareness. In contrast, realistic Instant Replay proved worse than no support at all. Many tasks, such as civil emergency operations, air traffic control, and military operations, require consistent and careful monitoring of complex situations and detecting of significant changes. For example, in air warfare, naval operators mus...|$|R
