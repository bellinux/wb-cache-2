As reported on the obi strip on volume 4 of the Shakugan no Shana manga released in January 2008, 1.2 million copies of the manga had been sold. Theron Martin from Anime News Network reviewed the manga and called it [...] "inferior" [...] to the anime, and notes the anime develops characters better than the manga. Martin also critiques the art, saying the background art has little detail, and while the action scenes are handled well enough, they are still sub-par compared to the same scenes in the anime. Martin concludes the review by warning the readers that [...] " [...] this <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> exposure to the franchise, look to the anime version to see it done right." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig began poorly; in ten innings {{before the}} Tests started, he scored only 146 runs at 14.60 without passing fifty. He was {{overlooked}} for the First Test, {{and continued to}} struggle for runs during the tour; he ended with 429runs in 27innings with a top score of 71 not out and an average of 16.50. He was not selected for any Tests. Craig had difficulty adjusting to the English pitch conditions and his confidence plummeted. Craig had particular trouble against off cutters on the seaming pitches. In a reception at Lord's, the home of cricket, Queen Elizabeth II asked him [...] "I understand this <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> visit to England?", which prompted Craig to reply [...] "Yes, your majesty, and unless my batting improves, it will be my last." [...] During the tour, tensions sometimes arose between the senior players, who were war veterans and drinkers, while the younger players including Craig tended to abstain from alcohol. Craig estimated that bus journeys to matches proceeded at an average speed of 16km/h because of persistent stoppages outside pubs, something that frustrated the non-drinkers.|$|E

2500|$|After the Battle of Murfreesboro in Tennessee {{in early}} January 1863, John S. Preston of Columbia, S.C., the {{commanding}} general, rode along the fighting line commending his troops. Before the 60th Regiment from North Carolina, Preston praised them for advancing farther {{than he had}} anticipated, concluding with: [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> battle of any consequence, I believe.

2500|$|In December, in {{what was}} seen as a mild rebuke of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper during the latter's working visit to China, Wen stated, [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> trip to China {{and this is the first}} meeting between the Chinese Premier and the Canadian Prime Minister in almost five years. Five years is too long a time for China Canada relations." [...] However, the {{interpretation}} that Wen rebuked Harper was later disputed in select newspaper editorials. Wen also travelled to the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference, where he met with U.S. President Barack Obama twice to secure an 11th-hour non-binding agreement on emissions cuts.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the thirteenth}} day, [...] {{had become a}} young woman, and on that day she said to First Woman, [...] "Something unusual has passed through me." [...] First woman said, [...] "That <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> race, [...]" [...] They covered {{the floor of the}} hogan with blankets, and Changing Woman lay on them face down. First Man pulled her hair down, and shaped her face, and dressed her in {{beautiful}} goods, beads, bracelets, and earrings, and tied her hair with a strip of perfect buckskin. Then First Man and First Woman stepped outside the hogan and told [...] to run her first race around a cedar tree and return, from east to west, as the sun does. When she returned, they invited all the people to a sing over her in the hogan called , Changeable House, on the mountain called [...] four days later. A great crowd gathered in the evening of the fourth day. A sweet corn cake was made from different colored corn meal sweetened with yeast. The Night Chant was sung, and in the morning the men received some of the maiden's cake as a gift for their chants, and , Changing Woman sat {{in the back of the}} hogan as gifts were piled in front of her. In this way the First Race of every young woman should be celebrated.|$|E

2500|$|The new Pro mode was {{critically}} acclaimed {{as the primary}} feature that distinguished Rock Band 3 from other music games in the field. Minkley stated that the inclusions of Pro features [...] "at once dramatically expand {{the potential of the}} game and fundamentally change the approach required to play and enjoy it". Reviewers appreciated the training modes, including their integration into the overall game's career progression and the breadth of material that is covered. Nina Shen Rastogi of Slate commented that Rock Band 3s training modes [...] helps to overcome the discouraging early period of trying to learn guitar as [...] "the gaming elements will mask the rote, homeworklike nature of the guitar training process". Kuchera noted that the modes were aimed at those who have some understanding of music theory already; [...] "If this <b>is</b> <b>your</b> <b>first</b> introduction to music theory, though, you may need a little more explanation", he concluded. This lament was similarly stated by Machkovech, who felt the lessons had [...] "text that was written by a musical savant" [...] that would be too confusing to those without musical backgrounds and too simple for those trained in music arts. [...] Chris Kohler of Wired described the experience he and a friend had where after playing though Devo's [...] "Whip It" [...] on Pro guitar and keyboard, they were able retain enough muscle memory to play their respective parts on real instruments, albeit not perfectly; Kohler summarized his experience that [...] "Just playing Rock Band 3 taught us a little bit of actual music".|$|E
