50|$|A Joint Industrial Council (JIC) or National Joint Industrial Council (NJIC), {{known as}} a Whitley Council in some fields, {{especially}} white-collar and government, is a statutory council of employers and trade unions established in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. It is a workplace partnership institution that serves for a <b>forum</b> <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> between employees and employers. Councils were established from 1919. They typically worked to determine wage rates, terms and conditions in a specific industry. There were dozens of JICs, one for each industry. Most JICs were established between the 1920s and the 1940s. The larger JICs also had regional councils {{throughout the country and}} some industries had separate JICs for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.|$|E

The applied method in this research is analytic descriptive with judicial normative study. The data from Labor and Transmigration office of Deli Serdang Regency in 2012 indicates that the number of dispute cases in industrial relationship were 84 cases and can be settled by bi party for 47. 61 %. in 2013, the number of case were 108 case and can be settled for 50. 92 %. in 2014, the number of industrial relation disputes were 134 cases and can be settled for 58. 9 %. Based on the number of cases as shown by the data of Labor and Transmigration office of Deli Serdang Regency, bi party mutual cooperation agent (LKS) is required to prevent the dispute in industrial relation. The existence of this agent in the company will minimize the dispute in industrial relation between employer and employee if there is any dispute in industrial relationship that can be settled by by party.

40|$|Background Triage at out-of-hours GP cooperatives (GPCs) {{is aimed}} at {{determining}} medical urgency and guiding decisions. Both medical knowledge and communication skills are required for this complex task. Objective To explore the impact <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> and estimated urgency on the appropriateness of decisions. Methods We performed a secondary analysis <b>of</b> telephone triage <b>consultations</b> by nurses at 29 Dutch GPCs. Consultations were taped and assessed by trained observers, using a validated instrument. Measures concerned quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation,</b> nurse-estimated urgency (four levels) and appropriateness of decisions (urgency, follow-up advice and timing). Bivariate analyses and logistic multilevel regression analyses were used to explore the impact <b>of</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> (controlling for urgency) on appropriateness of decisions. Results The sample included 6739 telephone contacts, most of which (90 %) were non-urgent. The majority of decisions were appropriate (91 % for urgency, 96 % for follow-up advice and 95 % for timing). In bivariate analyses, appropriateness of decisions {{was positively related to}} higher quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Estimated urgency was negatively associated with quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Logistic multilevel analysis showed that higher quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> was related to a more appropriate estimation of urgency [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 82; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 69 - 1. 95], follow-up advice (OR = 2. 69; 95 % CI: 2. 41 - 3. 01) and timing of decisions (OR = 2. 41; 95 % CI: 2. 20 - 2. 63). Conclusions High quality <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> has a positive, but small, impact on the appropriateness of decisions.

This study {{set out to}} {{test the}} face {{validity}} of prioritized criteria <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence in general practice as contained in the Leicester assessment package. METHOD. A questionnaire {{was sent to a}} geographically stratified random sample of 100 members of the United Kingdom Association of Course Organisers to seek their views on the categories, components and weightings contained in the Leicester assessment package and to determine the proportion of respondents who rejected or suggested a new category, component or weighting or reallocated components to other categories or amended weightings. Their views were sought on a six-point scale (strongly approve, approve, tend to approve, tend to disapprove, disapprove and strongly disapprove). RESULTS. There was a 73 % response rate. Of the respondents 99 % either strongly approved or approved of the overall set <b>of</b> categories <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence. Only two respondents (3 %) expressed any disapproval of individual categories. Thirty five of the 39 suggested components <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence were supported by more than 80 % of respondents. There was minimal support for excluding any categories or components <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence, for moving any components to different categories or for the inclusion of new categories or components. Eighty eight per cent of respondents were in favour of the need to identify priorities between any agreed categories <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence and 79 % expressed approval of the suggested weightings. Although 42 % of respondents indicated a wish for some alteration in weightings, the mean values for all consultation categories suggested by all respondents were almost identical to the original weightings in the Leicester package. CONCLUSION. The face validity of the categories and components <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> competence contained in the Leicester assessment package has been established, and the suggested weightings <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> categories have been validated. Consequently, the criteria contained in the Leicester package can be adopted with confidence as measures against which performance can be judged in formative or summative assessment <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> performance in general practice...|$|R

Design: Video-recordings <b>of</b> <b>consultations</b> with consecutive patients in family practice were studied for duration <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> in relation to age, gender and nature of the problem(s). Setting: Primary health care. Subjects: 405 consecutive consultations were video-taped in the practices of 27 family doctors. Main outcome measures: Length <b>of</b> time <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> and its segments was analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. The problems were classified according to the ICPC. Results: The average consultation lasted 9. 0 min (+ - 4. 9). Physical examination was 2. 0 min (+ - 1. 9) and was performed in 79 % <b>of</b> all <b>consultations.</b> Respiratory and circulatory problems were the most common.

40|$|Consultation is a {{prominent}} indirect service delivery method {{in school psychology}} today. Several publications endorsed by the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) have traditionally suggested the mental health, organizational, and behavioral models <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> as the three prominent consultation models {{in the field of}} school psychology. However, no supporting data are cited and it is unclear if these three models are still prominent in school psychology today. The present research examined the consultation literature over the last 22 years in two prominent school psychology journals, Journal of School Psychology and School Psychology Quarterly (originally called Professional School Psychology). This research involved the analysis <b>of</b> 145 <b>consultation</b> articles from the school psychology literature. The data was analyzed to obtain information regarding the frequency <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> articles published, any trend that emerged from this data, the most frequent types <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> mentioned, the type of research conducted, and topics addressed in the articles. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> trends over time indicated a decrease in the frequency <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> articles published over time in both journals. The terms utilized to address consultation models are greatly varied, demonstrated by the 107 different types <b>of</b> <b>consultation</b> referenced in the consultation articles. Clearly, behavioral consultation is the most frequently researched and referenced consultation model in the literature. The results suggested the three traditional prominent models have been modified over time. Mental health consultation and behavioral consultation were consistently found within the top three models researched and referenced; however, organizational consultation was infrequently mentioned in the literature and researched in only 4 % of the articles reviewed for this study. Therefore, it appeared that organizational consultation is no longer considered {{a prominent}} model <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> the articles that were not research oriented indicated that 76 % of the articles focused on application <b>of</b> <b>consultation.</b> The topics <b>of</b> multiculturalism, training, and ethics were the focal point to a lesser extent, with each representing fewer than 5 % of articles. Research focused articles that involved aspects of both questionnaire and intervention research tools were employed more frequently than were research involving only questionnaire research or intervention research.
