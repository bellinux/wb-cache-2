5|$|With Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area, the Norwegian airline market was <b>deregulated</b> from 1 April 1994. While {{airlines}} formerly needed a concession from the Ministry of Transport {{to fly a}} particular route, they could now compete freely on any domestic or international routes. Previously the two major airlines Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE each had their own routes, but from 1994 both established themselves on several of the main-haul routes.|$|E
5|$|Following Norway {{joining the}} European Economic Area (EEA), the airline {{industry}} was <b>deregulated,</b> allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway. However, by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the morning and evening rush hours, {{limiting the number of}} new routes that could be established. After the deregulation, Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to. However, domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent. In addition, Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1997, the European airline {{market was}} fully <b>deregulated.</b> At this time, British Airways {{announced}} increased activity to Scandinavia, {{based in part}} on a cooperation with Braathens SAFE concerning their frequently flyer program; holders of Bracard were allowed to collect frequent flyer points on British Airways' flights. On 3 April, Braathens SAFE, Transwede and Finnair signed an agreement involving codesharing on Finnair's flights from Stockholm and Oslo to Helsinki, Bracard members would be granted points on Finnair flights, and Braathens SAFE took over Finnair's handling services in Oslo.|$|E

5|$|The {{airport was}} officially renamed McCarran International Airport in September 1968. Further {{expansion}} {{took place between}} 1970 and 1974 {{with the construction of}} the A and B gates. After the airline industry was <b>deregulated</b> in 1978, the number of airlines serving McCarran doubled from seven to fourteen in only two years. In response, the county launched an expansion plan named McCarran 2000, detailing expansion projects to be undertaken into the year 2000. Expanded baggage claim facilities, an esplanade, and a parking garage were inaugurated in 1985. The C Gates and the first line of the people mover system followed in 1987.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Denmark was {{a member}} of the European Union (EU), while Sweden and Norway had applied and were {{awaiting}} referenda to determine membership. EU was working to deregulate the airline market from 1995, which could cause problems for the Scandinavian agreements. In preparation for this, Braathens SAFE started negotiations with Linjeflyg of Sweden and Maersk Air of Denmark to crate an alliance to compete with SAS. In particular, the three airlines wanted to capture the two million passengers that travelled between the three Scandinavian capitals: Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Instead, SAS was given permission to purchase Linjeflyg in exchange for the Swedish airline market being <b>deregulated</b> from 1 July 1992. From 23 October 1992, the Norwegian Armed Forces stopped chartering aircraft and started using scheduled flights to fly 240,000 personnel annually. Since most of the transport was between Northern and Southern Norway, this gave reduced revenue for Braathens SAFE.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE's {{domestic}} market was <b>deregulated</b> on 1 April 1994. Since then, any airline within the European Economic Area {{is free to}} operate any domestic or international route. Braathens rejected a proposal from the main competitor Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) for a merger; instead the helicopter division was sold and the company listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. New routes were opened from Oslo Airport, Fornebu to Bodø, Harstad/Narvik and Tromsø, but the routes from Bergen to these cities were terminated. International routes to Rome, Nice and Jersey were introduced. In 1996, Braathens SAFE bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede, and started flying on the Oslo–Stockholm route. The following year, Transwede, with its five domestic routes, was merged into Braathens SAFE. The same year, KLM bought 30% of Braathens SAFE and the airlines started a partnership.|$|E

5|$|From 1987, Braathens SAFE {{was allowed}} to make {{international}} scheduled flights on certain routes. From 1989 to 1993, it opened routes to Billund, Malmö, Newcastle, London and Murmansk. In the same period, the airline replaced its fleet with Boeing 737-400 and -500s. The Norwegian airline market was <b>deregulated</b> in 1994, and Braathens SAFE was free to fly on any domestic and international route; it immediately opened routes to Harstad/Narvik. Within two years, international routes had been started to Jersey, Nice and Rome. In 1996, Braathens bought Sweden's second-largest airline, Transwede Airways, and started a route to Stockholm. The following year, Transwede was merged into Braathens SAFE, and the airline took over its domestic routes to Halmstad, Jönköping, Luleå, Sundsvall and Umeå, using Transwede's Fokker 100s. In 1997, KLM bought part of Braathens SAFE, and the two started a partnership; Braathens SAFE started flying from several Norwegian cities to KLM's hub in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{banks were}} <b>deregulated</b> in Iceland. This {{set the stage}} for banks to upload debts when foreign {{companies}} were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts. It is estimated that the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of €50 billion, or about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks. The króna, which was ranked by The Economist in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world (based on the Big Mac Index), has further suffered from the effects of carry trading.|$|E
5|$|The {{deregulation}} process, {{which would}} {{eliminate the need for}} concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the EU. This was supported by the Labor Party and the right-winged Conservative Party and Progress Party. The plans from the EU indicated that international routes within EU should be <b>deregulated</b> from 1 January 1993, with Norway and Sweden joining from 1 July. Full, domestic liberalization should be performed by 1 April 1997. SAS and Braathens SAFE proposed a solution where only Norwegian airlines could compete until 1997, which was thought to efficiently hinder other airlines, rather than these two, until then. SAS announced its support for competition on 4 February 1993, while Braathens SAFE stated that it no longer was in favor of competition, despite having arguing for this for the whole of the company's history. The company stated that stability was needed and that competition would result in marginalized routes, that were being cross-subsidized, being closed. SAS stated that with competition, prices would fall 20–30%, and that SAS wanted to operate with a loss to force Braathens SAFE close services.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding factors, such as the 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand <b>deregulated</b> its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Import Program {{was created}} in January 1955, {{immediately}} upon the transfer of France's remaining direct influence over the State of Vietnam to the chief of state, former Emperor Bảo Đại and his Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem. The Americans and Diem feared a communist electoral victory and national polls never took place. In October, Diem proclaimed himself {{the president of the}} newly formed Republic of Vietnam after he won a fraudulent referendum, and the aid continued as the US wanted to build a strong and stable anti-communist state in Southeast Asia. When the program was first introduced, it generated turbulence for merchant importers in Vietnam. As {{a large proportion of the}} imports up to that point had been from France, traders who were dependent on selling French products found themselves in difficulties as their wares would now be more expensive than those of import licenseholders who now had access to cheaper American alternatives. The suppliers of French goods threatened to organize a strike, but this never materialized. At the time, South Vietnam was also suffering from a lack of foreign currency reserves and the CIP was seen as an urgent mechanism of remedying this. The introduction of the CIP brought an unprecedented new level of economic liberalism and capitalism, and at first, the entrepreneurial class struggled to meet the challenges of a <b>deregulated</b> market, leading to a series of significant shortages and surpluses of various goods due to their inexperience in judging market forces and resultant imbalances in the economy. Initially 25,000 applications for import licenses were received, many from speculators. In the early years of the initiative, a proportion of the US funding for the CIP came through the proceeds of the sale of surplus American agricultural products to France.|$|E
