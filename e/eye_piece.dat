The motivation for their development was that in the Tandem-Scanning-Microscope only a fraction of 10−7 of the illumination light participates in generating the image in the <b>eye</b> <b>piece.</b> Thus, image quality was not sufficient for most biological investigations.|$|E
50|$|The Maddox Wing test is {{performed}} at near with the instrument held in reading position, slightly inferior (approximately 15° depression and 33 cm away). The room or {{location of the}} test should be brightly illuminated and the patient's optical correction (e.g. glasses, bifocals, multifocals, contact lens) is required to be worn. In the event that correction cannot be worn due to the obstruction of vision through the <b>eye</b> <b>piece,</b> lenses may be placed within the lens holder before each eye. The examiner instructs the patient to hold the Maddox Wing and identify the number that the white (vertical arrow) and red (horizontal arrow) arrows point to on their respective scales.|$|E
50|$|Eye {{relief is}} the {{distance}} from the rear eyepiece lens to the exit pupil or eye point. It is the distance the observer must position his or her eye behind the eyepiece in order to see an unvignetted image. The longer the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the eye relief. Binoculars may have eye relief ranging from a few millimeters to 2.5 centimeters or more. Eye relief can be particularly important for eyeglass wearers. The eye of an eyeglass wearer is typically further from the <b>eye</b> <b>piece</b> which necessitates a longer eye relief in order to still see the entire field of view. Binoculars with short eye relief can also be hard to use in instances where it is difficult to hold them steady.|$|E

50|$|Eye relief — Eye {{relief is}} the {{distance}} from the rear eyepiece lens to the exit pupil or eye point. It is the distance the observer must position his or her eye behind the eyepiece in order to see an unvignetted image. The longer the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the eye relief. Typical telescopic sights may have eye relief ranging from 25 mm to over 100 mm, but telescopic sights intended for scout rifles or handguns need much longer eye relief to present an unvignetted image. Telescopic sights with relatively long eye relief are favourable to avoid recoil induced facial and eye injuries and use in instances where it is difficult to hold the eyepiece steady. Eye relief can be particularly important for eyeglass wearers. The eye of an eyeglass wearer is typically further from the <b>eye</b> <b>piece</b> which necessitates a longer eye relief in order to still see the entire field of view.|$|E
5000|$|Denys Fisher/Mego {{released}} {{a selection of}} 9" [...] figures in the mid-1970s, including the Fourth Doctor, Leela, K-9 (released in 1978 after the first six), the Giant Robot, a Cyberman, a Dalek, and a TARDIS. The Dalek and K-9 have friction drives to allow for movement. The TARDIS has a self-propelled spinning top. The Doctor could be inserted into the TARDIS and the [...] "light" [...] on top was spun. If the red button was hit while the top was spinning, the Doctor [...] "disappeared". If the green button was hit, the Doctor re-appeared. These toys are all extremely rare and difficult to find, especially in near mint or mint condition. The Tom Baker figure {{is the most common}} and can be found in an English or Italian box. A mint (or near mint) Baker figure with the box is worth between $150-500, depending on quality of the figure and the box. The Tom Baker figure with the Italian box is more common (and may sell for as little as $75-200). The other figures, excluding the TARDIS, are worth $500-1200 if they are in near mint quality and have their original box, even if the box is damaged. In May 2006, a Denys Fisher Dalek with box sold for over $1150 on eBay. The TARDIS is usually a bit cheaper at $200-350 (provided it has no damage or any repairs are not noticeable and the box is included). Of course, this is relative and eBay auctions can vary considerably. While a mint Leela may sell for $500-600, one without a box may only sell for $150-200. That said, some items are so rare that even a damaged item, or one with missing pieces, is worth a fair amount. For example, in May 2006, a Leela doll without her loin cloth (and correspondingly, without the attached pouches and knife) but with her original, but highly damaged box, sold for over $350. It really depends on competition, timing and if serious bidding is occurring. Nonetheless, considering these toys sold in the UK for under GBP £10 in the 1970s, their value has gone up nearly 10- to 100-fold and will most likely continue to rise due to the popularity of the new Doctor Who series. Some stress cracks due to time and cannot be avoided, but more serious cracks or discolouration will decrease the value considerably. The more damaged the item is, obviously, the less it is worth. These are very simple toys, as none require batteries, have any flashing lights or speak, but they have become quite collectible. The rarity of the boxes (or high quality boxes) has led to people selling box reproductions. These reproduced boxes can be an alternative as they are less expensive than finding a figure with the original box, although true collectors may not appreciate them. Be sure to ask if the box is original or a reproduction. Along those lines, some of these toys can be repaired. The TARDIS [...] "light" [...] and doors easily broke, but repairs by those with ingenuity or toy-repair skills can be done. Simply re-glueing the light or the doors rarely works for this toy, so more advanced repairs are needed. Flaking damage on the Cyberman suit can be repaired using a high quality silver paint for fabric. Dust on many figures can be removed by air-blown sprays or delicate washing. Leela's hair can be repaired by combing, conditioning and steam-cleaning. Delicate repainting can also be done on some figures. The key is to do just enough repairs, without ruining the essence of the original. Any repair work should be noted in ads (often a seller will simply sell the damaged item and leave repairs to the buyer). If unsure, ask the seller. The Denys Fisher K-9 or Dalek may be initially confused with the talking Palitoy K-9 or Dalek toys. The Palitoy talking toys were {{released a}}round the same time and are also quite collectable. Finding a good quality talking K-9 or Dalek, that speak at a [...] "normal" [...] speed and have their original boxes, can cost anywhere from $200-500. Even without the box, the toy could be worth $100-150 if in good speaking condition. If the toys do not speak, their value drops considerably (not more than $50-100 for a non-speaking Dalek). A working Palitoy K-9 is more rare and may be more costly. Both toys speak via a small vinyl record that is inside or near the battery compartment. The K-9 record is inside the battery compartment and the record can be flipped over, giving K-9 more phrases. The Dalek record is buried within the toy and cannot be removed. The Palitoy K-9 is considerably larger than the Denys Fisher line, so the two cannot be confused when visually compared. The Palitoy Dalek is considerably different from the Denys Fisher Dalek, although it is similar in size. The Palitoy Dalek came in red with black Dalek [...] "spots" [...] or [...] "bumps" [...] and in silver-grey with blue [...] "bumps". The silver/blue Dalek is a bit more rare. Both Palitoy Daleks had black extremities, with a red end on the eye and red suction cup. The Denys Fisher Dalek is also silver/blue, but has a red head and a blue <b>eye</b> <b>piece</b> (with silver gun and suction cup). Palitoy toys also tended to rust and crack.|$|E

30|$|Biomedical {{research}} has been performed by using advanced information techniques, and micro-high-quality stereo images {{have been used by}} researchers and/or doctors for various aims in biomedical research and surgery. To visualize the stereo images, many related devices have been developed. However, the devices are difficult to learn for junior doctors and demanding to supervise for experienced surgeons. In this paper, we describe the development of a high-definition (HD) three-dimensional (3 D) stereoscopic imaging display system for operating a microscope or experimenting on animals. The system consists of a stereoscopic camera part, image processing device for stereoscopic video recording, and stereoscopic display. In order to reduce eyestrain and viewer fatigue, we use a preexisting stereo microscope structure and polarized-light stereoscopic display method that does not reduce the quality of the stereo images. The developed system can overcome the discomfort of the <b>eye</b> <b>piece</b> and eyestrain caused by use {{over a long period of}} time.|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} rare case of {{bilateral}} spontaneous anterior partial in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation in a 75 -year-old man with pseudoexfoliation (PXF). He underwent uneventful phacoemulsification in both eyes with in-the-bag IOL implantation 9 years back. In the right <b>eye,</b> single <b>piece</b> poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) IOL (+ 19 D) {{and in the}} left <b>eye,</b> single <b>piece</b> acrylic foldable IOL (+ 19 D) were implanted. An attempt at pharmacological IOL repositioning was unsuccessful. The dislocated IOLs were explanted and exchanged with scleral suture fixated PMMA IOLs. Vision improved to 20 / 30 in both eyes following surgery, without any associated ocular morbidity. We believe that zonular weakness secondary to PXF, capsular contraction, and myopia together were the predisposing factors for partial anterior dislocation of IOLs and IOL exchange with scleral suture fixation of IOL is a safe and effective treatment option...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} several years {{considerable}} experimenting has been aimed at developing methods for improving potato yields.

Significant differences in yield were obtained between the various seed piece size treatments. The yield advantage was in favor of the larger size. The number of <b>eyes</b> per <b>piece</b> was less important except with the smallest size. In this case the seed pieces were incapable of adequately supplying plant growth from more than one eye.
