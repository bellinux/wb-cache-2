With Stevens returning as her rider, she tracked Uzziel until pulling away for a [...] length win. [...] "The game was pretty much over going into the first turn and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> glorified workout, which is something you hope for in a race like this," [...] Stevens said. [...] "She's the best filly I've ever sat on and I'm not sure she's not the best horse I've ever ridden." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> challenge I wanted to take on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} for his new television series Homeland, 24 executive producer Howard Gordon addressed {{the impact of the}} series, describing it as [...] "stunning - everyone from Rush Limbaugh to Bill Clinton would talk about it, and we knew they were among our fans. I guess when people used it as propaganda for their own ideas—you know, when Justice Scalia mentioned Jack Bauer—that would make me feel uncomfortable." [...] On the topic of torture and Islamophobia within the series, Gordon said, [...] "I think the one thing that we all felt very confident about—although we had a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate—was at what point are we loyal and beholden to good storytelling, and at what level do you hold yourself accountable for things like stoking Islamophobia or promoting torture as a policy? There were just certain things that we needed to portray {{in order to make it}} feel thrilling—and real, even. When discussing his regrets, he referred to an advertisement for the show for its fourth season (though mistakenly quoted it as an advertisement for the second season, saying [...] "I actually do have regrets about one particular moment, which had more to do with the promotion of the show. In season four, the story involved a Muslim American family, and the father and the mother—and the son—were party to a terror plot. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> purple conceit in a way. But it was maybe a year and a half after 9/11, and on the 405 freeway there's this giant electronic billboard, and I think the line was: [...] "They could be next door." [...] The writers and the producers were not party to that campaign, but we quickly put an end to it, and realized how dangerous and potentially incendiary this show could be. And I think our awareness of that changed the way we approached the series. So I guess you could call it a regret, but it was really an epiphany.|$|E

5000|$|According to Coyne, [...] "The song {{came to me}} very quickly, and I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> funny." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{he later}} told The New York Times [...] "I guess <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a storybook ending. When {{you think about}} where I was and where I <b>am</b> now, <b>it</b> seems pretty incredible." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} screenplay consisted {{mostly of}} dialog and featured {{only a few}} changes from Crumb's stories. The script and storyboards went largely unused {{in favor of more}} experimental storytelling techniques. Bakshi said, [...] "I don't like to jump ahead on my films. The way you feel about a film on Day One, you may not feel the same way forty weeks down the road. Characters grow, so I wanted to have the option to change things, and strengthen my characters... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stream of consciousness, and a learning process for myself." [...] Bakshi wrote the characters without feral animal behavior to lend the material greater realism.|$|E
2500|$|On January 4, 2011, Billboard {{revealed}} two guest {{appearances on}} Fiasco's album Lasers. The guests confirmed were Trey Songz and British rapper Sway. In {{the interview with}} Billboard, Fiasco expressed his thoughts on music piracy and fighting track leaks on various blogs. Speaking about the problems with his record label, Fiasco has stated: [...] "I think I set the precedent for record labels — showed everyone {{that you can have}} rappers that don't fit the format and still have a presence [...] You look at a person like me, or Kanye , and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shock to the system. I definitely think I was part of changing that, and an influence to a lot dudes that are coming out today." ...|$|E
2500|$|Debney called Iron Man 2 [...] "odd in {{that there}} were {{not a lot of}} places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a {{full-blown}} superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively." [...] For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with [...] "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen [...] "was less thematic. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> groove {{with a little bit of}} French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." [...] He continued, [...] "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where [...] "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." [...] Debney felt that this process led to the score being [...] "watered down and mashed up a little bit" [...] from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, Ivan Vanko, which he described as a personal [...] "joy". He said that Favreau [...] "gave me a great opportunity to get into [...] scene and learn 's circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film". For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to [...] "capture the dark Russian soul" [...] of the character.|$|E

5000|$|At first, Bill Koch didn't {{think much}} of his father's project. [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> folly," [...] he said later. [...] "I didn't think it would go anywhere." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bishop Cosgrove {{would serve}} the Davenport Diocese for 22 years. He {{was a friend}} of Archbishop John Ireland of St. Paul and was {{therefore}} aligned with the more progressive wing of the American hierarchy. While the diocese had no newspaper at the time, the periodical Iowa Orphan's Friend reported on Cosgrove's activities and published his pastoral letters. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> [...] "house organ" [...] for the bishop. While Cosgrove was less outspoken it quoted Archbishop Ireland liberally.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interesting}} thing about the guitar solo <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> recorded after we had already finished [...] "Heartbreaker" [...] - <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an afterthought.

500|$|Nixon did not sport the {{outrageous}} fashions of the 1970s, {{because she was}} concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose.

50|$|Beastmilk {{was founded}} in 2010 by Mat McNerney, Johan Snell, Valtteri Arino and Paile in Helsinki, Finland. The band name came about because McNerney and Snell read White Stains by Aleister Crowley, and {{wanted to have a}} {{dialogue}} {{about what it means to}} be a man and go through all these male emotions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conversation on what is your father’s milk, what is your mother’s milk and so on.
