5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the <b>hourly</b> <b>wage,</b> and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, and handling the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens. The {{statutory}} minimum wage {{does not apply to}} them; although the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum <b>hourly</b> <b>wage</b> of HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation has complained that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be willing to work for less than the MAW.|$|E

Thus, large metro stayers earn higher <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> but work fewer hours than large metro leavers. CollegeTown has a significantly negative coefficient for log <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> of − 0.020 but an insignificant effect on log annual hours. The interaction term has a significantly negative effect on <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> with a coefficient of − 0.270 but an insignificant effect on log annual hours.

Stayer again has a significantly positive effect on log <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and a significantly negative effect on log annual hours with coefficients of 0.018 and − 0.036, respectively. CollegeTown now has an insignificant effect on both log <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and log annual hours.

3000|$|... 4 {{report the}} results for these {{separate}} outcomes. According to the results, college town stayers both earn significantly lower <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and work significantly fewer annual hours with coefficients of − 0.209 and − 0.058, respectively. Notice that these two coefficients add up to the coefficient in the second column by definition. While both are significantly negative, the magnitude is much greater for log <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and suggests that lower <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> account for 78 percent of the lower annual wages of stayers. The results for advanced education are again somewhat interesting. Master’s degree holders have significantly higher <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> but significantly lower annual hours with coefficients of 0.084 and − 0.106. Professional degree holders earn similar <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> but work significantly fewer hours than persons with only a bachelor’s degree with a coefficient of − 0.176. For professional degrees the lower annual hours explains all of the lower annual wages in the second column. Given the age range considered, these results likely suggest that many master’s and professional degree holders were in school {{for part of the}} previous year and devoted less time to work because of school. Doctoral degree holders earned significantly higher <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> with a coefficient of 0.199, but the difference in hours worked is not statistically significant, probably {{due in part to the}} small number of doctorates in the sample. Age generally has a significantly positive effect on <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and annual hours, except there is no difference in <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> between 23 and 24 [*]year olds. Females earn lower <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and work fewer annual hours with coefficients of − 0.115 and − 0.092, respectively. Blacks earn similar <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> to Whites, but work significantly fewer hours with a coefficient of − 0.082. Asians earn higher <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> with a coefficient of 0.158 but do not work significantly different hours than Whites. Hispanics and Other Nonwhites earn similar wages to Whites but work significantly fewer hours with coefficients of − 0.064 and − 0.087, respectively. Married persons earn significantly higher <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and work significantly more hours with coefficients of 0.053 and 0.027. Those with children earn significantly lower <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and work significantly fewer hours with coefficients of − 0.031 and − 0.232.|$|R

This new pay plan effectively reduced weekly wages for sanitation workers from $101.40 for 6 days of work (which included time and a half for Saturday) to $73 for 5 days of work. This new plan amounted to a 15% reduction in pay per hour and a 28% reduction in pay per week.

30|$|Our paper {{contributes}} to the literature on earnings inequality by considering the role of hours worked and not only that of <b>hourly</b> <b>wages,</b> in order to address the question of whether, for a given distribution of wages, the dispersion of working time tends to dampen or magnify initial inequalities. To do so, we decompose our inequality index to quantify the contribution of inequality in <b>hourly</b> <b>wages</b> and the dispersion in hours worked to overall inequality in earnings. Hours dispersion affects overall inequality through two mechanisms, inequality in hours and the correlation between hours worked and <b>hourly</b> <b>wages.</b> As a result, if the latter term is negative (i.e., if poorly paid workers are those that work most), hours inequality may have a substantial equalizing impact.|$|R
