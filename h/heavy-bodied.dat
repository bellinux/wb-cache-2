5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are <b>heavy-bodied,</b> strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both in flight and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated {{on the sides of}} the head.|$|E
5|$|Variation of {{the wing}} beat may also occur, not just amongst {{different}} species, but even among individuals at different times. In general, the frequency is dependent upon the ratio between the power {{of the wing}} muscles and the resistance of the load. Large-winged, light-bodied butterflies may have a wing beat frequency of 4–20 per second whereas small-winged, <b>heavy-bodied</b> flies and bees beat their wings more than 100 times a second and mosquitoes can beat up to 988–1046 times a second. The same goes for flight; though it is generally difficult to estimate the speed of insects in flight, most insects can probably fly faster in nature than they do in controlled experiments.|$|E

25|$|The boa {{constrictor}} (Boa constrictor), {{also called the}} red-tailed boa or the common boa, is a species of large, <b>heavy-bodied</b> snake that is frequently kept and bred in captivity. The {{boa constrictor}} {{is a member of}} the family Boidae, found in tropical North, Central, and South America, as well as some islands in the Caribbean. A staple of private collections and public displays, its color pattern is highly variable yet distinctive. Ten subspecies are currently recognized, although some of these are controversial. This article focuses on the species Boa constrictor as a whole, and on the nominate subspecies B. c. constrictor.|$|E
500|$|The false {{catshark}} or sofa shark (Pseudotriakis microdon) is {{a species}} of ground shark in the family Pseudotriakidae, and the sole member of its genus. It has a worldwide distribution, and has most commonly been recorded close to the bottom over continental and insular slopes, at depths of [...] Reaching [...] in length, this <b>heavy-bodied</b> shark can be readily identified by its elongated, keel-like first dorsal fin. It has long, narrow eyes and a large mouth filled with numerous tiny teeth. It is usually dark brown in color, though a few are light gray.|$|E
500|$|A <b>heavy-bodied</b> shark with a [...] "typical" [...] {{streamlined}} shape, the Caribbean reef shark {{is difficult}} to distinguish from other large requiem shark species. It usually measures [...] long; the maximum recorded length is [...] and the maximum reported weight is [...] The coloration is dark gray or gray-brown above and white or white-yellow below, with an inconspicuous white band on the flanks. The fins are not prominently marked, and the undersides of the paired fins, the anal fin, and the lower lobe of the caudal fin are dusky.|$|E
500|$|Birds {{that are}} heavily [...] "wing-loaded"—that is, <b>heavy-bodied</b> birds with {{relatively}} short wings—have great difficulty flying {{with the loss}} of even a few flight feathers. [...] A protracted moult like the one described above would leave them vulnerable to predators for a sizeable portion of the year. [...] Instead, these birds lose all their flight feathers at once. [...] This leaves them completely flightless for a period of three to four weeks, but means their overall period of vulnerability is significantly shorter than it would otherwise be. [...] Eleven families of birds, including loons, grebes and most waterfowl, have this moult strategy.|$|E
500|$|The {{porcupine}} ray (Urogymnus asperrimus) is a {{rare species}} of stingray in the family Dasyatidae.

The largest stingray in the world, this <b>heavy-bodied</b> species grows upwards of [...] across and [...] in weight. Its plain-colored, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc is characterized by a lack of dermal denticles even in adults, and white pores beside the head on either side. Its tail is usually shorter than the disc and thick at the base. It is armed with large tubercles and a midline row of large thorns in front of the stinging spine which has the dorsal and ventral fin folds behind.|$|E

[...] Members of the family Archaeolemuridae, {{they were the most}} terrestrial of the lemurs, with short, robust forelimbs and relatively flat digits. [...] Although they {{spent a lot of time}} on the ground, they were only semi-terrestrial, spending time in trees to feed and sleep. They were <b>heavy-bodied</b> and ranged in size from approximately [...] They had relatively good day vision and large brains compared with other lemurs. [...] Their robust jaws and specialized teeth suggest a diet of hard objects, such as nuts and seeds, yet other evidence, including fecal pellets, suggests they may have had a more varied diet, including leaves, fruit, and animal matter (omnivory). [...] Dental wear analysis has shed some light on this dietary mystery, suggesting that monkey lemurs had a more eclectic diet, while using tough seeds as a fall-back food item. [...] Within the family, the genus Archaeolemur was the most widespread in distribution, resulting in hundreds of subfossil specimens, and may have been one of the last subfossil lemurs to die out.|$|E

[...] As juveniles they are faintly or boldly {{patterned}} with wide gray to moss green bands interspersed with wide gray to black anteriorly directed chevrons. These bands fade and are generally lost as the animals mature, turning a uniform grayish or brownish-black with varying amounts of turquoise on the dorsal spines, tail base, fore and hind legs. Occasionally this bluish coloration extends up onto {{the sides of the}} individual, particularly in males. Females tend to be relatively dull in color, exhibiting less brilliant blue if any.|$|E
2500|$|Members of this genus {{range in}} size from only [...] (C. intermedius, C. pricei), to over [...] (Eastern and Western diamondback rattlesnakes). In general, adult males are {{slightly}} larger than females. Compared to most snakes, they are <b>heavy-bodied,</b> although some African vipers are much thicker. Most forms are easily recognized by the characteristic rattle on the end of their tails, although a few island populations form exceptions to this rule: C. catalinensis has lost its rattle entirely, C. ruber lorenzoensis usually has no rattle, and both C. r. lucasensis and C. molossus estebanensis exhibit a tendency for rattle loss. The rattle may also be lacking in any species due to a congenital abnormality.|$|E
