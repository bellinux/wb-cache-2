5|$|City of Death was {{broadcast}} on BBC1 over four consecutive Saturdays beginning on 29 September 1979. At this time, <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> had blacked out rival broadcaster ITV {{and as a}} result, the serial scored very high ratings, averaging 14.5 million viewers over the four episodes; 16.1 million watched the fourth episode, the largest audience ever recorded for an episode of Doctor Who. The story was repeated on BBC1 across four consecutive evenings from Tuesday to Friday, 12 - 15 August, 1980, achieving viewing figures of 6.3, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.9 million viewers respectively.|$|E
5|$|Driving to the Emirates Stadium is {{strongly}} discouraged {{as there are}} strict matchday parking restrictions in operation around the stadium. An hour before kick-off to one hour after the final whistle there is a complete ban on vehicle movement {{on a number of}} the surrounding roads, except for Islington residents and businesses with a road closure access permit. The parking restrictions mean that the stadium is highly dependent on the Underground service, particularly when there is no overground service in operation. <b>Industrial</b> <b>action</b> forced Arsenal to reschedule the match for the following month.|$|E

30|$|The main {{motivation}} {{of this research}} is to prove how <b>industrial</b> <b>actions</b> can have a devastating influence on macroeconomic factors by implementing an empirical analysis. Although it is widely accepted that <b>industrial</b> <b>actions</b> are the principal reason behind high wage growth, {{there are only a few}} empirical studies on this, and there has not been an outstanding empirical work that took Turkey into account. There are several reasons why this has not been researched sufficiently. The first is about the transparency of statistics on <b>industrial</b> <b>actions.</b> The data of workdays lost to strikes are difficult to collect or access on a daily or monthly basis because wage bargaining usually happens once or twice a year, either with government or the employersâ€™ associations. Thus, collecting annual data to create a satisfactory model with enough time spans takes time. Second, the institutionalization of trade unions has remained behind economic development. For instance, in Turkey, although mechanization or industrial development began in the early 1950 s, trade unions were only legalized in the early 1960 s. In other words, after the technological change in the economy, Turkish peasants moved to industrial cities and became workers, something that had happened in the developed countries long before. After this economic phenomenon, trade unions were legalized by the government and could organize larger members. The difficulties pointed out above also made it hard to compare Turkey with a number of developing countries in terms of <b>industrial</b> <b>actions</b> because most countries have not made available enough data to facilitate a comparative analysis, or have lagged behind in the development process. 2 However, Turkey provides the chance to conduct such an analysis since it has regularly shared data on <b>industrial</b> <b>actions</b> since the early 1960 s. The country has consistently released detailed statistics about <b>industrial</b> <b>actions,</b> enabling a time-series analysis. In consequence, it is possible to discuss the wage policy of the country in this research. Hence, this study aims to contribute to the economic literature for understanding the power of trade unions and its influence on wage growth, and to serve as a resource for the creation of new empirical analyses for other countries.|$|R

5|$|The serial's {{production}} was beset by {{problems caused by}} <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> taken by electricians at the BBC during filming. It was eventually finished three months behind schedule, but the unavailability of several actors for new filming dates forced the production team to recast their parts at short notice. Enlightenment averaged of 6.8 million viewers per episode on its first transmission and received generally positive reviews from critics. The story was novelised by its writer, Barbara Clegg, {{as part of the}} ongoing Target Books range in 1984 and was released on video and DVD in 1993 and 2009 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The strike action {{began on}} a local level after postal workers at Royal Mail offices in London and Edinburgh accused their bosses of cutting jobs and services, which they claimed broke the 2007 Pay and Modernisation Agreement, the {{agreement}} that was struck to end the 2007 strikes, and accused Royal Mail of threatening modernisation of the service. After a series of localised walkouts over the summer months, and after failing to reach an agreement, the CWU opened a national ballot for <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> in September 2009.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the series, {{there have}} been three filming {{locations}} for Sun Hill police station. From the first series, the police station consisted of a set of buildings in Artichoke Hill, Wapping, East London. However, these buildings were next to the News International plant and during the winter of 1985â€“86 there was much <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> which resulted in some altercations between the strikers and what they thought were the real police but were actually actors working on The Bill. Working conditions got so dire, that the production team realised they needed to find another base to set Sun Hill police station.|$|E

Furthermore, the paper will examine the nature and extent of this difference, as well as the scholarly attention that it has received from labour historians. The paper will analyse the <b>industrial</b> <b>actions</b> and tactics of export meatworkers in Rockhampton and Townsville over a long period of time.

5|$|Industrial {{conscription}} and {{the drive}} to increase productivity led to an increasing degree of industrial unrest over time. Many workers were required to work long hours in poor conditions and {{were not able to}} change their employment due to the manpower laws. Poor work conditions were exacerbated by the Government's austerity measures reducing workers' standards of living. As a result, strikes and other forms of protest disrupted Australian production, especially from 1943 onwards. These protests attracted considerable criticism from other civilians and members of the military. In May 1943 the Government introduced policies which enabled workers who were undertaking unlawful <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> to be conscripted into the military, but this had little impact due to the shortage of skilled labour in the industries most prone to industrial disputes.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that the CWU had started a fighting fund to help support postal workers who were experiencing financial difficulties {{as a result of}} the strike. Postmen lose a day's pay for each day they strike, and although most workers had lost just two days pay so far, many in the London area who had taken part in previous <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> earlier in the year had lost as much as 18 days of wages. There was also speculation that the CWU lacked the funds for a lengthy dispute and donations to the union's fighting fund were pledged by other unions, including UNISON and Unite.|$|E
5|$|More {{large-scale}} refits occurred {{throughout the}} rest of the 1970s. Melbourne was back in dock from November 1972 until August 1973, with further work done to her catapult. The next major refit ran from April 1975 to June 1976, and was intended to increase the operational lifespan of the carrier to at least 1985. The refit was lengthened by <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> at the dockyard. Melbourne underwent another refit from late 1978 until August 1979. A refit scheduled to begin in late 1981 was postponed in September until a decision regarding the new carrier was made, then cancelled in January 1982, after the announcement that the RAN would be acquiring HMS Invincible.|$|E
30|$|High {{wage rate}} {{growth has been}} the basic cause of high {{inflation}} rate and unstable exchange rates. Therefore, to find the influences of <b>industrial</b> <b>actions,</b> inflation and real GDP growth on wage growth, the data for workdays lost to strikes and for other two variables were collected annually between 1963 and 2015.12 Inflation has been a main factor in creating wage growth. This means that when a country experiences low productivity growth in non-tradable goods and high wage growth, trade unions can demand greater wage growth in {{a year as a}} compensation for inflation. However, this can also serve to increase inflation because the productivity growth of non-tradable goods does not increase at the same pace. This problem is caused by <b>industrial</b> <b>actions</b> dictated by the power of trade unions. Real GDP could have been taken as general wage-setting factor, but this policy was not explicitly considered in Turkey.|$|R

Despite the importance of uninterrupted production, several factories were affected by <b>industrial</b> <b>action.</b> By {{the end of its}} production run in 1950, 168,176 Merlin engines had been built; over 112,000 in Britain and more than 55,000 under licence in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|There were driver {{changes for}} the race's first free {{practice}} session. Max Verstappen replaced Jean-Ã‰ric Vergne {{as part of his}} preparation for a full-time seat at Toro Rosso in 2015.

Caterham confirmed that Roberto Merhi would replace Marcus Ericsson, and Kamui Kobayashi would drive in the race. Formula Renault 3.5 Series driver Will Stevens was announced as participating in the first practice session in Max Chilton's car, but a problem with paperwork sent to the FIA Contract Recognition Board due to an <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> in Germany prevented him from driving.|$|E
5|$|An {{increase}} in the trade union movement was an inevitable corollary of this and {{during the war years}} there was a considerable {{increase in}} the membership of the various unions. Despite the considerable rises in the costs of many basic items, the government sought to maintain wages largely as they were. Although the average weekly wage during the war was increased by between 8â€“12 per cent, it was not enough to keep up with inflation and as a result there was considerable discontent amongst workers, to the extent that <b>industrial</b> <b>action</b> followed. Not all of these disputes were due to economic factors, and indeed in some part they were the result of violent opposition to the issue of conscription, which many trade unionists were opposed to. Nevertheless, the result was very disruptive and {{it has been estimated that}} between 1914 and 1918 there were 1,945 industrial disputes, resulting in 8,533,061 working days lost and Â£4,785,607 in lost wages.|$|E
