2500|$|In Denver, Masterson dealt faro for [...] "Big Ed" [...] Chase at the Arcade {{gambling}} house. In 1888, {{he managed}} and then purchased the Palace Variety Theater. There, Masterson probably first met an <b>Indian</b> <b>club</b> swinger and singer called Emma Moulton, born as Emma Matilda Walter near Philadelphia on July 10, 1857. The pair subsequently lived {{together and they}} were widely reported to have married in Denver on November 21, 1891, although no record of the marriage has come to light thus far. The only known source for that date was given by Bat Masterson's brother, Thomas Masterson, years after Bat died. Emma was not divorced from her first husband, Edwin Winford Moulton (1847–1922), [...] until November 9, 1893. When they were later enumerated in the 1910 U.S. Federal Census, Bat and Emma claimed {{that they had been}} married for 17 years, suggesting a marriage date of 1893. Masterson's biographer has raised the possibility that Bat and Emma were actually married on November 21, 1893, two weeks after Emma's divorce from Edwin Moulton. Bat and Emma were traveling through various eastern states at that time, and they were possibly married on November 21, 1893, in one of those eastern states.
