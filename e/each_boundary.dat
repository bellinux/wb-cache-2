We compared practitioner and student experiences for <b>each</b> platform <b>boundary</b> resource type, to identify any similarities and differences. Emerging concepts were used to construct main findings for <b>each</b> platform <b>boundary</b> resource type. An example of such an emerging concept was fragmentation of social boundary resources.
