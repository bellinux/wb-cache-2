5|$|In 1993, NSB test-ran an X2 {{train on}} the Randsfjord Line, and between 29 September and 21 December 1996, ran a unit in regular {{service on the}} Sørland Line. On 23 February 1995, NSB signed a {{contract}} to purchase 16 Class 71 trains for use on the Airport <b>Express</b> <b>Train</b> on the Gardermoen Line. The contract included two options, one for 16 trains for intercity traffic and one for 6 trains for regional traffic. The reason for using {{the same type of}} train as the Airport <b>Express</b> <b>Train,</b> was to reduce maintenance and operation costs through having a unified fleet. The options would only modify the trains slightly; they were primarily designed for the airport service and any optimization for intercity and tilting technology was secondary in the design process. The first option was taken out on 5 March 1997.|$|E

The Lysaker/Fornebu name was in use until 9 January 2000. By then the amount of traffic to Lysaker was so substantial, even without the airport, that NSB continues to stop its express trains at Lysaker.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees.

5|$|The idea of {{creating}} a Hogwarts Express-related attraction came from Mark Woodbury, the president of Universal Creative. After {{the opening of the}} Hogsmeade attraction at the Islands of Adventure theme park in 2010, Universal began considering how to keep attendance balanced between the adjacent parks. At first, the creative team considered putting Diagon Alley within Islands of Adventure. Eventually they decided that the London and Hogsmeade environments should not be visible between one another. As a result, Woodbury proposed building Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and then connecting the two Harry Potter-themed lands with the Hogwarts <b>Express</b> <b>train.</b>|$|E

During night, freight trains also use the line.|$|E

On 1 October 1996 {{it was decided that}} the construction company, NSB Gardermobanen, would also become the operator of the airport <b>express</b> <b>train.</b> However, due to limited profitability with the company, from 1 January 2001 the ownership of Gardermobanen was transferred to the Norwegian National Rail Administration, who also owns the rest of railway lines in Norway. The operating company changed its name to Flytoget AS.|$|E

Leeds Bradford Airport provides connections to most major European and North African airports as well as Pakistan and New York City.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{airport site}} to Gardermoen was proposed at Hurum, south-west of Oslo. Had Hurum been chosen, the Gardermoen Line {{would not have}} been necessary for the airport <b>express</b> <b>train,</b> but the planning documents recommended that construction still proceed to ease traffic congestion north of Oslo. The tunnel is used by all trains on the Gardermoen Line, including the Flytoget airport express, and the regional and express trains which continue via the Dovre Line. Local trains on the Hoved Line and Kongsvinger Line to the north also use the tunnel. Use of the Hoved Line is limited to freight trains and commuter trains which make stops along the route.|$|E
