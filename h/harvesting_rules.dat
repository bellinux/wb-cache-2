40|$|Demand {{and supply}} {{analysis}} in fisheries often indicates {{the presence of}} instabilities and multiple equilibria, both in open access conditions and in the socially optimal solution. The associated management problems are further intensified by uncertainty {{on the evolution of}} the resource stock or on demand conditions. In this paper the fishery management problem is handled using robust optimal control, where the objective is to choose a harvesting rule that will work, in the sense of preventing instabilities and overfishing, under a range of admissible specifications for the stock recruitment equation. The paper derives robust <b>harvesting</b> <b>rules,</b> leading to a unique equilibrium, which could be used to design policy instruments such as robust quota systems.

We provide the conceptual and institutional background for <b>harvest</b> control <b>rules,</b> {{a discussion of the}} structure of fisheries management, and brief introductions to <b>harvest</b> control <b>rules</b> in a selection of present day cases. The cases demonstrate that <b>harvest</b> control <b>rules</b> take different forms in different settings, yet cover only a subset of the full policy space. We conclude with views on <b>harvest</b> control <b>rules</b> in future fisheries management, both in terms of ideal and realistic developments.

40|$|We {{characterize}} the optimal harvest of a renewable resource in a generalized stochastic spatially explicit model. Despite {{the complexity of}} the model, we are able to obtain sharp analytical results. We find that the optimal <b>harvest</b> <b>rule</b> in general depends upon dispersal patterns of the resource across space, and only in special circumstances do we find a modified golden rule of growth that is independent of dispersal patterns. We also find that the optimal <b>harvest</b> <b>rule</b> may include closure of some areas to harvest, either on a temporary or permanent basis (biological reserves). Reserves alone cannot correct open access, but may, under sufficient spatial heterogeneity and connectivity, increase profits if appropriate harvest controls are in place outside of reserves. ...|$|R

The content, perceived application, social distribution (by age, gender and education) and intergenerational transmission of this knowledge were explored. A survey approach was used and it entailed personal interviews, key informant interviews and focus group discussions. A dependence on trees by the rural community was observed, as well as evidence of customary resource use practices. Harvesting practices and techniques, traditional rules, occurrence of sacred forests and tree planting constituted the indigenous management system that promoted the conservation of trees in the community. Protection of indigenous fruit trees and those with cultural significance, use of deadwood for firewood, and leaving a base stump when chopping a tree, represented some of the reported <b>harvesting</b> <b>rules,</b> practices and techniques respectively. A positive association was observed between age and knowledge of <b>harvesting</b> <b>rules,</b> whilst a negative correlation was identified between education and knowledge of harvesting techniques.

30|$|Both {{the ethnographic}} and archaeological records {{demonstrate}} that Northwest Coast peoples {{used a variety}} of techniques to enhance clam production. In addition to the ecological benefits of aerating the beach sediments while harvesting clams, people harvesting clams recognize the benefits of returning broken shells and gravels to the beach to keep the sediments productive (Nathan Cardinal and Nicole Smith, pers. comm. to M. Caldwell). Measurements of archaeological clam shells suggest that in some cases only clams of a certain size (age) were collected and that it is possible that clam beds were left fallow to allow populations to reach the harvestable size (Cannon and Burchell 2009). This proposition is supported by traditional knowledge which states that selective harvesting left behind small clams “to keep the populations productive” (Turner 2005). In the archaeological context, we cannot know whether this size selection was a personal decision to enhance clam production because it was the “right way to behave,” because of more formal harvesting and tenure rules, or simply because of a desire to eat large clams. Finally, quantification of clam size, age, and number in archaeological sites in Washington state suggests that management was occurring at the level of habitat manipulation, rather than through <b>harvesting</b> <b>rules</b> per se (Daniels 2009).|$|E

We have developed a software utility ‘eFlow tool’, which can construct flow time series via augmentation of a current-case of flow by reconstructing environmentally important components of the flow.

40|$|Community-based {{fisheries}} management (CBFM) is {{held up as}} one of the most promising approaches for securing sustainable small-scale fisheries. Yet, the complex features that shape CBFM outcomes remain inadequately understood. In part, this stems from the fact that few community-based projects meet the data requirements for formal impact evaluations. Given this context, diagnostic approaches are increasingly seen as a frontier for strengthening CBFM analysis and securing small-scale fisheries sustainability. This study explores the capacity of Elinor Ostrom 2 ̆ 7 s social-ecological systems (SES) framework to strengthen post-hoc diagnosis of CBFM. It draws on data from published and grey literature (including field notes, meeting minutes, and project reports) generated throughout an eight-year CBFM project in five Solomon Island villages. Results suggest that successful CBFM outcomes were facilitated by effective information sharing, <b>harvesting</b> <b>rules</b> that merge traditional and contemporary practices, strong leadership, and resource monitoring, while uneven power differentials undermined positive outcomes. The paper argues that the SES framework can add analytical rigour to post-hoc analysis when it used to: 1) engage with temporal dynamics that shape CBFM processes; 2) integrate insights from plural theories, and 3) explore interactions between multiple CBFM outcomes. Ultimately, the paper argues that diagnostic applications of the SES framework can contribute towards conducting more systematic analysis of diverse CBFM data, improving CBRM practices, and realizing more sustainable small-scale fisherie...|$|E
