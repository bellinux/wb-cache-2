5|$|During Bush's second term, a {{controversy}} arose over the Justice Department's midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. The White House {{maintained that the}} U.S. attorneys were fired for poor performance. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales later resigned over the issue, along with other {{senior members of the}} Justice Department. The House Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas for advisers <b>Harriet</b> <b>Miers</b> and Josh Bolten to testify regarding this matter, but Bush directed Miers and Bolten to not comply with those subpoenas, invoking his right of executive privilege. Bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice. The Justice Department determined that the President's order was legal.|$|E

[...] "You'll notice that we've had people subpoenaed even though they've resigned from the White House," [...] Leahy said, referring to <b>Harriet</b> E. <b>Miers,</b> the former White House counsel, and Karl Rove, who resigned in August 2007 as the president's top political aide.

5000|$|Concerns {{expressed}} by Senators Feinstein and Pryor concerning the Senate's preogative in confirming U.S. Attorney nominations in early January were followed up by hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 6, 2007 called by Senator Schumer (D, New York) with Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty as witness.McNulty underscored that the seven were fired for job performance issues, and not political considerations.McNulty later called Senator Schumer by telephone {{to apologize for}} that inaccurate characterization of the firings, however.At least six of the seven had recently received outstanding job performance ratings. McNulty testified that Bud Cummins, the U.S. Attorney for Arkansas, was removed to install {{a former aide to}} Karl Rove and Republican National Committee opposition research director, the 37-year-old Timothy Griffin.Cummins, apparently, [...] "was ousted after <b>Harriet</b> E. <b>Miers,</b> the former White House counsel, intervened on behalf of Griffin."In subsequent closed-door testimony on April 27, 2007 to the committee, McNulty said that days after the February hearing, he learned that White House officials had not revealed to him White House influence and discussions on creating the list.|$|R
5000|$|Early in {{the congressional}} {{investigations}} of the firings, Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty testified that Cummins was removed for no reason except to install {{a former aide to}} Karl Rove: 37-year-old Tim Griffin, a former opposition research director for the Republican National Committee.Cummins, apparently, [...] "was ousted after <b>Harriet</b> E. <b>Miers,</b> the former White House counsel, intervened on behalf of Griffin." [...] In fact, White House emails uncovered during investigations showed that Griffin laid the groundwork for the dismissal of Cummins, telling staff members in the White House that Cummins was widely seen by members of the Arkansas bar as [...] "lazy" [...] and [...] "ineffective." [...] Sara Taylor and Scott Jennings later testified that they believed Cummins to be a sub-par attorney based solely on statements made by his intra-party rival, Tim Griffin. Cummins told the Senate Judiciary Committee [...] "that Mike Elston, the deputy attorney general's top aide, threatened him with retaliation in a phone call February 2007 if he went public." [...] Emails show that Cummins passed on the warning to some of the other Attorneys who were fired.|$|R
5000|$|February 6, 2007 - Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty {{testified before}} the Senate Judiciary Committee. He underscored that the U.S. Attorneys were fired for job {{performance}} issues, and not political considerations. He stated: [...] "The indisputable fact is that United States attorneys serve {{at the pleasure of}} the president. They come and they go for lots of reasons." [...] In subsequent closed-door testimony to the committee (on April 27, 2007), McNulty said that days after the February hearing, he learned that White House officials had not revealed to him the extent of White House influence and discussions on creating the list. [...] McNulty, {{a few days after the}} February hearing, calls Senator Schumer by telephone to apologize for the inaccurate characterization of the firings. At least six of the seven had recently received outstanding job performance ratings. McNulty testified that Bud Cummins, the U.S. Attorney for Arkansas, was removed to install a former aide to Karl Rove and Republican National Committee opposition research director, the 37-year-old Timothy Griffin. Cummins, apparently, [...] "was ousted after <b>Harriet</b> E. <b>Miers,</b> the former White House counsel, intervened on behalf of Griffin." [...] McNulty's testimony that the attorneys were fired for [...] "performance related issues" [...] caused the attorneys to come forward in protest. There is some evidence that the administration was concerned about the attorneys going public with complaints prior to this time.|$|R
25|$|Bush {{failed to}} win {{conservative}} approval for <b>Harriet</b> <b>Miers</b> to the Supreme Court, replacing her with Samuel Alito, whom the Senate confirmed in January 2006.

25|$|With the {{exception}} of Walden College, Trudeau has frequently used real-life settings, based on real scenarios, but with fictional results. Due to deadlines, some real-world events have rendered some of Trudeau's comics unusable, such as a 1973 series featuring John Ehrlichman, a 1989 series set in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, China, a 1993 series involving Zoë Baird, and a 2005 series involving <b>Harriet</b> <b>Miers.</b> Trudeau has also displayed fluency in various forms of jargon, including those of real estate agents, flight attendants, computer scientists, journalists, presidential aides, and soldiers in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|During {{the evening}} of Sunday, October 2, John Fund, a {{columnist}} for the Wall Street Journal, announced on the radio show of blogger Matt Drudge that his sources had told him that the nominee would be moderate Hispanic Judge Consuelo M.

25|$|After {{the death}} of Chief Justice William Rehnquist on September 3, 2005, {{creating}} another vacancy, speculation resumed that President George W. Bush might nominate Gonzales to the Court. This again proved to be incorrect, as Bush decided to nominate Roberts to the Chief Justice position, and on October 3, 2005, nominated <b>Harriet</b> <b>Miers</b> as Associate Justice, to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. On October 27, 2005, Miers withdrew her nomination, again renewing speculation about a possible Gonzales nomination.

25|$|Not every Supreme Court nominee has {{received}} a floor vote in the Senate. A president may withdraw a nomination before an actual confirmation vote occurs, typically because {{it is clear that}} the Senate will reject the nominee; this occurred most recently with the nomination of <b>Harriet</b> <b>Miers</b> in 2006. The Senate may also fail to act on a nomination, which expires at the end of the session. For example, President Dwight Eisenhower's first nomination of John Marshall Harlan II in November, 1954 was not acted on by the Senate; Eisenhower re-nominated Harlan in January 1955, and Harlan was confirmed two months later. Most recently, as previously noted, the Senate failed to act on the March 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland; the nomination expired in January 2017, and the vacancy was later filled by President Trump's appointment of Neil Gorsuch.|$|E
500|$|Of the 113 justices, 109 (96.5%) {{have been}} men. [...] All Supreme Court justices were males until 1981, when Ronald Reagan {{fulfilled}} his 1980 campaign promise {{to place a}} woman on the Court, which he did with the appointment of Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor was later joined on the Court by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993. After O'Connor retired in 2006, Ginsburg would be joined by Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, who were successfully appointed to the Court in 2009 and 2010, respectively, by Barack Obama. The only other woman to be nominated to the Court was <b>Harriet</b> <b>Miers,</b> whose nomination to succeed O'Connor by George W. Bush was withdrawn under fire.|$|E
500|$|American {{television}} comedian Stephen Colbert {{coined the}} term truthiness in this meaning as {{the subject of a}} segment called [...] "The Wørd" [...] during the pilot episode of his political satire program The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005. By using this as part of his routine, Colbert satirized the misuse of appeal to emotion and [...] "gut feeling" [...] as a rhetorical device in contemporaneous socio-political discourse. He particularly applied it to U.S. President George W. Bush's nomination of <b>Harriet</b> <b>Miers</b> to the Supreme Court and the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Colbert later ascribed truthiness to other institutions and organizations, including Wikipedia. Colbert has sometimes used a Dog Latin version of the term, [...] "Veritasiness". For example, in Colbert's [...] "Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando" [...] the word [...] "Veritasiness" [...] can be seen on the banner above the eagle on the operation's seal.|$|E
