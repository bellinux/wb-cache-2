5|$|The {{effects of}} Hurricane Isabel in New Jersey in 2003 were overall moderate, limited to fallen trees, two deaths, and $50million in damage (2003USD, $59million 2008USD). Hurricane Isabel formed from a {{tropical}} wave on September 6 {{in the tropical}} Atlantic Ocean. It moved northwestward, and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) on September 11. After fluctuating in intensity for four days, Isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 105mph (165km/h) on September 18. It quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western Pennsylvania the next day. Several days before Isabel made landfall, there existed uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> hurricane would strike. At least one computer model predicted a landfall on New Jersey, {{and as a result}} services across the state thoroughly prepared for the hurricane.|$|E

However, the state refused, but later sold the land (as well as the former Route 18 alignment, which became a private access road for the university) to Geneva. After construction of the new right-of-way was complete and opened, Geneva shrunk part of the southern end to a one-lane road (in order {{to make room for}} the expansion of Reeves Field) and put a sidewalk <b>in</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> northern end used to make the first bend in the s-turn, permanently blocking access to the s-bend.

25|$|While {{consonant}} intervals (intervals of a {{third or}} sixth) and perfect intervals (intervals of a fourth, fifth, eighth) are greatly important, dissonant intervals can occur within music, which is why resolutions are vital. The most basic rule of resolution is to always resolve the leading tone upwards (the leading tones being the 7th scales degree of the key that the piece is in). When resolving the seventh scale degree to the tonic, it creates a sense of satisfaction and completion, relieving the tension that it created. Tritones also must be resolved correctly. These can occur in triads or seventh chords {{that are based on}} scale degree seven, and they must be resolved correctly. A tritone can either be an augmented fourth intervals or a diminished fifth based on the voicing that the composer uses. In common practice, an augmented fourth must resolve out, meaning the top voice resolves up and the bottom voice resolves down, creating a sixth Opposite of that a diminished fifth must resolve <b>in,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> top voice resolves down and the bottom voice resolves up, creating an interval {{of a third}}.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Mega Man Legends 2 is {{very similar}} to that of its predecessor and has a few changes. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt in his explorations through ruins and fights against Reaverbots. The ruins, however, are from various islands in contrast to the prequel in which most ruins belonged to Kattelox Island. The player is able to travel to other islands with Roll's ship, the Flutter, although he can only enter certain islands by completing different missions. Unlike Mega Man Legends in which the player could enter to different ruins by having the approval of Kattelox's mayor, here the player must pass different tests in order to win Digger licenses from a specific level. The license allows Mega Man to enter into ruins which are forbidden to lower-class Diggers. Additionally, when winning a license, the Reaverbots' health is higher, but once they are destroyed, they drop more refractors' shards which are used in shops to buy items. Mega Man's interactions with other characters can also affect the character's state depending whether he is good with other people or makes them angry. Mega Man is also able to grab objects or people which help the player to complete missions. Mega Man can also suffer from special damage when fighting Reaverbots or touching fields that damage him such as lava. If the player equips Mega Man specific body part, he will become invulnerable to such states. Another addition is the underwater dungeon, <b>in</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> objects' weight is reduced and Mega Man can jump higher. The energy of the special weapons, which are developed by Roll using unusable items, are now shown in two energy bars, one green and one blue. The blue bar indicates how much energy the weapon has, while the green bar shows how much energy is consumed when the weapon is used.|$|E

In an unfavourable review, {{the show was}} described by Elisabeth Mahoney of The Guardian as [...] "a chilly, alienating listening experience" [...] and a [...] "rare wrong move" [...] {{on the part of}} Radio2. Lisa Martland of The Stage agreed that [...] "it is by far the music that brings me back to the programme... and not her lightweight presenting style". However, the show regularly attracts 3million listeners, and interviews are also featured each week.

He chose to work on the project as he wanted make his next film in the United States, and signed on as its director in February 1979. Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [...] was really much more interested <b>in</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> pain was in going to the school, and so we had our little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E

500|$|The leading actor-manager Charles Hawtrey, {{whom the}} young Coward idolised and {{from whom he}} {{learned a great deal}} about the theatre, cast him in the children's play Where the Rainbow Ends. Coward played in the piece in 1911 and 1912 at the Garrick Theatre in London's West End. In 1912 Coward also {{appeared}} at the Savoy Theatre in An Autumn Idyll (as a dancer in the ballet) and at the London Coliseum in A Little Fowl Play, by Harold Owen, in which Hawtrey starred. Italia Conti engaged Coward to appear at the Liverpool Repertory Theatre in 1913, and in the same year he was cast as the Lost Boy Slightly in Peter Pan. He reappeared in Peter Pan the following year, and in 1915 he was again <b>in</b> <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> Rainbow Ends.

500|$|Before {{starting}} a book Wodehouse would write {{up to four}} hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that [...] "It's the plots that I find so hard to work out. It takes {{such a long time}} to work one out." [...] He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions. For a novel the note-writing process could take up to two years, and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously. After he had completed his notes, he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words, which ensured plot holes were avoided, and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop. When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that [...] "For a humorous novel you've got to have a scenario, and you've got to test it so that you know where the comedy comes <b>in,</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> situations come in... splitting it up into scenes (you can make a scene of almost anything) and have as little stuff in between as possible." [...] He preferred working between 4 and 7pmâ€”but never after dinnerâ€”and would work seven days a week. In his younger years, he would write around two to three thousand words a day, although he slowed as he aged, so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand. The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books: when younger he would produce a novel in about three months, while Bachelors Anonymous, published in 1973, took around six months.|$|E

Also in 1997 she filmed a situation comedy for the BBC, Bloomin' Marvellous, {{in which she}} played Liz, one half of an argumentative married couple trying for a baby. However, due to poor viewing figures and a damning critical response the sitcom was not renewed. Regarding the negative reception to the series, her co-star Clive Mantle saracastically remarked [...] "I've seen murderers and rapists get a better press than we did". Lancashire continued to star as Ruth Goddard <b>in</b> <b>Where</b> <b>the</b> Heart Is for its second and third series in 1998 and 1999.
