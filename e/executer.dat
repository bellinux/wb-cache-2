500|$|Helmichis (fl. 572) was a Lombard noble {{who killed}} his king, Alboin, in 572 and unsuccessfully {{attempted}} to usurp his throne. Alboin's queen, Rosamund, supported {{or at least}} did not oppose Helmichis' plan to remove the king, and after the assassination Helmichis married her. The assassination was assisted by Peredeo, the king's chamber-guard, who in some sources becomes the material <b>executer</b> of the murder. Helmichis is first mentioned by the contemporary chronicler Marius of Avenches, but the most detailed account of his endeavours derives from Paul the Deacon's [...] late 8th-century Historia Langobardorum.|$|E

60|$|As for myself, I {{must confess}} {{my eyes were}} open to my danger, though not the least to {{anything}} of application for remedy. I was all amazement and confusion, {{and this was the}} first time that I can say I began to feel the effects of that horror which I know since much more of, upon the just reflection on my former life. I thought myself doomed by Heaven to sink that moment into eternal destruction; and with this peculiar mark of terror, viz., that the vengeance was not executed in the ordinary way of human justice, but that God had taken me into His immediate disposing, and had resolved to be the <b>executer</b> of His own vengeance.|$|E

A splendid dream; and by force of the qualities born in her she is making it come true.|$|E

40|$|The dologx package {{contains}} multiple {{versions of}} dolog (q. v.), written in multiple versions of Stata, for <b>executing</b> certification scripts. Usually, a do-file {{should include a}} version statement {{at or near the}} top, so it will still <b>execute</b> in a similar way if the user runs it after the next Stata upgrade. Certification scripts are an exception to this rule, because the same certification script may be <b>executed</b> under multiple versions of Stata, to show that the package being certified still works in the same way under different Stata versions. Therefore, if a certification script is <b>executed</b> using dolog, then it will <b>execute</b> under the Stata version in which dolog is written. Therefore, a certification script should not be <b>executed</b> using the standard dolog, and the user should use the dologx package, using dolog 6 to <b>execute</b> the script under Stata 6, dolog 7 to <b>execute</b> the script under Stata 7, dolog 8 to <b>execute</b> the script under Stata 8, dolog 9 to <b>execute</b> the script under Stata 9, dolog 10 to <b>execute</b> the script under Stata 10, dolog 11 to <b>execute</b> the script under Stata 11, dolog 12 to <b>execute</b> the script under Stata 12, and dolog 13 to <b>execute</b> the script under Stata 13. ...|$|R
