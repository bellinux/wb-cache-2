5|$|Within {{his first}} three films, Hard Eight, Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Anderson {{explored}} themes of dysfunctional families, alienation and loneliness. Boogie Nights and Magnolia were noted for their large ensemble casts, which Anderson returned to in Inherent Vice. In Punch-Drunk Love, Anderson explored similar themes but expressed a different visual style, shedding the influences and references of his earlier films, being more surreal and having a <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> reality. It was also short, compared to his previous two films, at 90 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} {{of the first generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large {{olfactory}} bulbs and olfactory nerves {{relative to their}} brain size, the organs responsible for a <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the olfactory bulbs has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|E

25|$|This {{sets the}} stage, in ritual, mood, tenor and a <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> festivity, {{for the days}} that follow it, namely, of Shemini Atzeret, when seven hakafot are again {{performed}}. (Outside the Land of Israel, the hakafot are performed by some congregations on the night (i.e., the beginning) of Shemini Atzeret, and then by all on both the night and during the day of Simchat Torah).|$|E
25|$|After the Babylonian {{conquest and}} {{during the period of}} Achaemenid rule, notable drops in the {{population}} of Jerusalem, the Sphephelah and the Negev region occurred, while a continuity is maintained in the northern Judean and Benjamin areas. Along the coastal region the Phoenician presence expanded, while the Cisjordan underwent demographic change with the inflow of Moabite and Ammonite refugees, while the southern part of Judea underwent substantive change with the settlement of Edomites. The exilic returnees resettled, perhaps with a <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> their ethnic identity.|$|E
25|$|The {{main effect}} of {{suspension}} bondage {{is to create a}} <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> vulnerability and inescapability, as the subject is made to feel that by attempting to free themselves they may fall and hurt themselves, thus also creating a form of mental bondage in addition to the physical one that holds them. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of objectification, submissiveness and erotic helplessness for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as performance art at BDSM conventions and fetish-themed nightclubs.|$|E
50|$|Werewolf: Werewolves almost became {{extinct in}} the early 1900s. They are half human and half wolf. In no {{particular}} order. They are highly attuned to nature and possess <b>heightened</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> smell and sight.Werewolves have {{been around since the}} dawn of civilization. Contrary to popular belief, they have not always been at odds with vampires. They just had one huge disagreement, but they get along pretty well most of the time.|$|R
50|$|The Appalachian cottontail {{is adapted}} its role of prey, {{and because of}} this it {{typically}} has <b>heightened</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> smell, hearing, and sight. This allows for the rabbit to notice predators and react quickly to threats. Mothers have been observed performing a grunting sound in order to alert offspring to the presence <b>of</b> predators.

The New Avengers rescue Lopez and she ends up stabbing Elektra to death. However, upon her death it is revealed that [...] "Elektra" [...] is actually a Skrull in disguise; its death indicates that the Skrulls have become undetectable to even the <b>heightened</b> <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> New Avengers members Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Doctor Strange.

25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of {{narcolepsy}} to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime sleepiness. The other symptoms may begin {{alone or in}} combination months or years after {{the onset of the}} daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime sleepiness generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. A rare subset of narcoleptics also experience a <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> taste and smell known as the supertaster phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern {{societies}}, it was {{the elders}} who possessed the knowledge: they were definable in time and space. In modern societies we must rely on expert systems. These are not present in time and space, but we must trust them. Even if we trust them, we know that something could go wrong: there's always a risk we have to take. Also the technologies which we use, and which transform constraints into means, hold risks. Consequently, {{there is always a}} <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> uncertainty in contemporary societies. It is also in this regard that Giddens uses the image of a 'juggernaut': modernity is said to be like an unsteerable juggernaut travelling through space.|$|E
500|$|... : An elf-like race, the Elezen {{are said}} to be the {{original}} inhabitants of Eorzea, and thus were originally hostile with the other races. An intense rivalry exists between the Wildwood and Duskwight clans. Wildwood Elezen live in the forest and their keen sense of sight contributed to the development of archery as a tool of war. Duskwight Elezen are a reclusive clan who dwell in caves and caverns, giving them a <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hearing.|$|E

The sequels were originally scheduled for release in [...] and 2015.

To view and interact with the piece, a user first enters a room, called the [...] "Cave," [...] which is a virtual reality display area with four walls surrounding the participant. White memory texts appear on the background of black walls. Through bodily interaction, such as using one's hand, a user can move and bounce the text around the walls.

[...] "Listen Mode" [...] allows players to locate enemies through a <b>heightened</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> hearing and spatial awareness, {{indicated}} as outlines visible through walls and objects. In the dynamic cover system, players crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat. The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters. Players solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies of water, and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.|$|E

500|$|The {{iconography}} is {{not overly}} labored, and Memling avoids extraneous symbolism.
