40|$|Mobile {{networks}} have changed from circuit switched to IP-based mobile wireless packet switched networks. This paradigm shift led to new possibilities and challenges. The {{development of new}} capabilities based on IP-based networks is ongoing and raises new problems {{that have to be}} tackled, for example, the heterogeneity of current radio access networks and the wide range of data rates, coupled with user requirements and behaviour. A typical example of this shift is the nature of traffic, which is currently mostly data-based; further, forecasts based on market and usage trends indicate a data traffic increase of nearly 11 times between 2013 and 2018. The majority of this data traffic is predicted to be multimedia traffic, such as video streaming and live video streaming combined with voice traffic, all prone to delay, jitter, and packet loss and demanding high data rates and a high Quality of Service (QoS) to enable the provision of valuable service to the end-user. While the demands on the network are increasing, the <b>end-user</b> <b>devices</b> become more mobile and end-user demand for the capability of being always on, anytime and anywhere. The combination of <b>end-user</b> <b>devices</b> mobility, the required services, and the significant traffic loads generated by all the end-users leads to a pressing demand for adequate measures to enable the fulfilment of these requirements. The aim of this research is to propose an architecture which provides smart, <b>intelligent</b> and per <b>end-user</b> <b>device</b> individualised traffic steering for heterogeneous mobile networks to cope with the traffic volume and to fulfil the new requirements on QoS, mobility, and real-time capabilities. The proposed architecture provides traffic steering mechanisms based on individual context data per <b>end-user</b> <b>device</b> enabling the generation of individual commands and recommendations. In order to provide valuable services for the end-user, the commands and recommendations are distributed to the <b>end-user</b> <b>devices</b> in real-time. The proposed architecture does not require any proprietary protocols to facilitate its integration into the existing network infrastructure of a mobile network operator. The proposed architecture has been evaluated through a number of use cases. A proof-of-concept of the proposed architecture, including its core functionality, was implemented using the ns- 3 network simulator. The simulation results have shown that the proposed architecture achieves improvements for traffic steering including traffic offload and handover. Further use cases have demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} achieve benefits in multiple other areas, such as for example improving the energy efficiency, improving frequency interference management, and providing additional or more accurate data to 3 rd party to improve their services...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{evolution}} of the Next Generation Networks, especially the wireless broadband access technologies such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), have {{increased the number of}} “all-IP ” networks across the world. The enhanced capabilities of these access networks has spearheaded the cloud computing paradigm, where the end-users aim at having the services accessible anytime and anywhere. The services availability is also related with the <b>end-user</b> <b>device,</b> where one of the major constraints is the battery lifetime.

In this paper, an empirical methodology to measure network interfaces energy consumption is proposed. By employing this methodology, an experimental evaluation of energy consumption in three different cloud computing access scenarios (including WiMAX) were performed. The empirical results obtained show the impact of accurate network interface states management and application network level design in the energy consumption.

40|$|The {{advancing}} digitization of {{all areas}} of the economy and society is generating significantly increasing demand for processing power. More and more data centers of ever larger size are being built worldwide, and their electricity consumption is constantly on the rise. Forecasts project {{a significant increase in the}} global electricity consumption of data centers in the next five years. The presentation discusses the development of data centers' energy consumption and energy efficiency, using the example of Germany. A recent study by Borderstep and Fraunhofer IZM for the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy shows that the electricity consumption of data centers in Germany grew by 15 % to 12 billion kilowatt hours from 2010 to 2015. This was the case in spite of considerable efficiency gains in IT hardware and data center infrastructure. If the current trends in IT usage continue, German data centers' energy consumption will increase further and exceed 14 billion kWh in 2020. Reasons for this growth are in particular the increasing number of internet-enabled <b>end-user</b> <b>devices</b> and networked sensors. In addition, more and more processing is being shifted from <b>end-user</b> <b>devices</b> to data centers...|$|R
