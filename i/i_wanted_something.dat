500|$|Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman {{described}} {{the writing process}} as, [...] "When we were writing this album I {{was looking for something}} to beat; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> to beat, but nothing impresses me right now. Nothing sounded really aggressive or heavy enough to inspire me to beat it, so I just {{had to come up with}} my own shit." [...] The album was produced by Rick Rubin and was recorded at Oceanway Studios.|$|E
500|$|The {{costumes and}} looks {{for each of}} the {{different}} women were chosen by Spears and Kahn. The scenes in the sauna were suggested by Kahn, {{as a response to the}} attacks Spears received over the years about her weight. He stated, [...] "I knew that the whole world would be watching, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> in there that stated, 'This is Britney, this is why you should respect her'". The set was cleared for two hours, leaving her and Kahn alone shooting the sequence. Kahn also decided to end the video with an image of Spears smiling, because [...] "We just needed to tell everybody she's OK".|$|E

I tried it the other night just before I went to sleep, and it was fine. I became an example to others. But when I woke up--I went on in the old way. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>something</b> hard, don't you know; but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> it to be easy!" ...|$|R

500|$|The Dark Troopers in Dark Forces {{were created}} {{specifically}} for the game by Justin Chin and Paul Mica. Chin notes that they were designed as a more advanced enemy when compared to standard stormtroopers: [...] "Instead of just beefing up the stormtroopers, I designed {{them to be more}} efficient. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> more terrifying and more omnipotent." [...] Three designs for the Dark Troopers were produced for Dark Forces. Lucasfilm licensing department initially rejected two of the designs for looking too much out of character, so Chin produced new designs which were ultimately approved. The development team collaborated with staff at Skywalker Ranch for the sounds, music, and costumes used in the cutscenes.|$|E
500|$|Eveanescence cover artwork was {{introduced}} on the band's website on August 30, 2011. It is their first album cover {{which does not}} feature Lee. In an interview, she discussed the cover: [...] "Well, both of our other records are me on the cover, and I think it's cool to have that photo, you know, that people can look at and go, 'OK, that's who that is.' But I feel like, by now, they know who we are, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> really different. I didn't feel like {{we had to put}} a photo on the cover, I wanted it to be more mysterious and more about Evanescence itself, not just me." [...] The cover, black with vapor behind the band's name, is a play on the meaning of [...] "evanescence" [...] ("to dissipate like vapor").|$|E
500|$|A {{lot of my}} {{performances}} {{have had}} fire involved, so we thought 'Heat.' Also, red {{is one of my}} favorite colors, as is gold. So then we thought of making the bottle look like it's on fire. I love antique bottles — my mother had a collection of them when I was growing up. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> with an antique yet modern feeling. Even with my wardrobe, I always try to find things that have a little bit of something vintage, yet still timeless and classic. The bottle, I felt, was a great mixture of the two... Everything, from the bottle design to the name and the ideas for the commercials–that's me. When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E

500|$|After {{the tour}} was confirmed, Madonna and her troupe {{started working on}} it. Madonna {{wanted it to be}} [...] "loud and brazen, and a {{reflection}} of my street-style and DGAF attitude." [...] She wanted a concert where people can enjoy themselves as much as she would enjoy performing. Commenting on the development, Madonna said [...] "I normally hate performances where there is just a singer singing, and a lame-ass band playing in the background; or shows where there is a rocker screaming his lungs out and jumping on the crowd. That just plain sucks! That's why <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> different, something that would be memorable." [...] For the show, Madonna collaborated with her designer friend Maripol for the clothes and the fashion. Maripol operated a small fabric boutique called Maripolitan in Greenwich Village, where the designs and the clothes for the tour were decided by her and Madonna. Rehearsals for the show started in late February, with auditions and choosing the dancers going on in-between. Madonna specifically wanted male back-up dancers, citing that the [...] "provocating moves that I do on stage works better with men beside me." [...] To further promote the tour, Warner Bros. Entertainers Merchandise Management Corp. introduced [...] the Boy Toy collection, named after the belt buckle Madonna wore on the Like a Virgin album cover picture. It consisted of a rectangular buckle, with the words [...] "Boy" [...] and [...] "Toy" [...] emblazed on it in gold color. For choosing a music director for the tour, Madonna's manager Freddy DeMann contacted record producer Patrick Leonard, who had just returned from the Victory Tour by The Jackson 5. At first Leonard said no, feeling exhausted from the Victory Tour, but after he spoke to Madonna on the phone, he found her charming, and agreed to sign for the tour.|$|E
500|$|Inafune {{created the}} {{character}} Zero, whom he {{originally intended to}} be the game's main, playable protagonist. [...] "When the X series came out, I really wanted to redesign Mega Man," [...] Inafune explained. [...] "I wanted a totally different Mega Man. I’m a designer, a creator; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> new. I didn’t {{want to use the}} same old Mega Man." [...] Fearing a negative reaction from fans, Zero was ultimately reduced to a role secondary to Mega Man X. The development team additionally wanted the world of Mega Man X to be much more sophisticated than in the first Mega Man series. They wanted to accomplish this with Zero's [...] "hardcore" [...] personality and the game's antagonist Sigma. As stated by Inafune, the original series' villain Dr. Wily had [...] "a side to him you couldn't really hate". Sigma, however, was written as a once-good character suffering an [...] "unforeseen error" [...] that leads him to be completely evil. The game's story went through several changes during development. Two allies of Mega Man X, named RX and RY, appeared in previews for the game, but were later taken out. Mega Man X altered the franchise tradition of having themed boss characters with a [...] "Man" [...] moniker by replacing them with anthropomorphic animal-like androids. The art and pixelization for these eight bosses were divided among three illustrators: Inafune did Storm Eagle and Chill Penguin; Kaji did Spark Mandrill, Launch Octopus, and Sting Chameleon; and Kazunori Tazaki (credited as Ikki) did Flame Mammoth, Armored Armadillo, and Boomer Kuwanger. The team was careful in making the bosses distinct from one another in both stature and coloring. Tatsuya Yoshikawa (credited as Tatsunoko), a fourth artist who had recently been hired by Capcom, was given the task of assisting {{the rest of the team}} by designing, illustrating, and creating the sprites for the game's minor enemies. The musical score for Mega Man X was composed by Capcom's Alph Lyla group. Setsuo Yamamoto (credited as Setsuo) was initially the sole composer assigned to the game, and contributed the vast majority of the soundtrack, but four other composers, Yuki Iwai (credited as Sato), Toshihiko Horiyama (credited as Kirry), Yuko Takehara (credited as Yuko) and Makoto Tomozawa (credited as Tomozou), were brought in late in production to help finish the soundtrack. Iwai and Horiyama would later compose the soundtracks for Mega Man X2 and X4 respectively. The Japanese division of Sony Records published an arranged album featuring ten songs on March 9, 1994. Music using the SNES instrumentals was included as part of the Capcom Music Generation: Rockman X1 ~ X6 soundtrack released by Suleputer in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|On {{working with}} the pair, Almodóvar said: [...] "I battled a lot with the actresses' tears, against the {{physical}} need to cry. It is a very expressive battle. It wasn't out of reservedness, but because I didn't want tears, what I wanted was dejection – the thing that stays inside after {{years and years of}} pain. I adore melodrama, it's a noble genre, a truly great genre, but I was very clear that I didn't want anything epic, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> else. Simply put, this had to be a very dry, tearless film". In an interview with the BBC, Almodóvar said there were comic situations in rehearsals, but he wanted to set the humour aside: [...] "I wanted something more intense; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> cleaner to make sure the message got through". Almodóvar stated that he wanted to create something more austere and restrained than his previous films; he also reflected on the physical pain he had experienced in the past years which he believed to have inspired him to create a piece about solitude.|$|E

2500|$|Well, it wasn't {{really my}} idea ... I didn't like {{the thought of}} doing it like {{everyone}} else–maybe a mix through the back catalog and a few exclusive new tracks by some key artists... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> more special. Then a while ago I met Emika, she’s making music herself on Ninja Tune. We sat together one day last summer {{and she told me}} about her last visit to Berghain. It was a regular Sunday morning and she noticed how everything in the building was resonating and vibrating and swinging and humming–she realized that there were lot of sounds coming from the building itself. That led to the idea of doing field recordings within the building while it's not open to the public ... It took about two or three weeks ... It was a four gigabyte library.|$|E

2500|$|According to Dickinson, his revitalised enthusiasm, {{brought about}} by Harris's idea to make a concept album, carried forward into the cover artwork, saying that [...] "I was {{probably}} responsible in a large part for the cover, with Derek." [...] Dickinson states that the idea to set the painting in a polar landscape may have originated from when he showed Riggs a Gustave Doré piece, depicting traitors frozen in a lake of ice in the ninth circle of Dante's Inferno. In contradiction of this, Riggs states that the setting was because he [...] "might have just seen a documentary about the North Pole or something ... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> that was a departure from all the cityscapes and things. It was about prophecy and seeing the future, and so I just wanted something distant. And then they said, on the back, 'Could you stick all the other Eddies in the ice?' So I did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beatles guitarist George Harrison {{described}} {{the song in}} 1969 as [...] "one of those instant whistle-along tunes which some people hate, and other people really like. It's a fun song, but it's kind of a drag because Maxwell keeps on destroying everyone like his girlfriend then the school teacher, and then, finally, the judge." [...] Lennon described it as [...] "more of Paul's granny music". In 1994, McCartney said that the song merely epitomises the downfalls of life, being [...] "my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as I was beginning to find out {{at that time in}} my life. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't know why it was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer. It was needed for scanning. We still use that expression now when something unexpected happens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Every {{level in}} the game was {{designed}} primarily by a different level designer, which is why every level looks and feels so different from all the rest. To ensure Kurt and the enemies in the game moved as realistically as possible, their movements were created using motion capture, a relatively new technology in video game development at the time. Unlike previous motion capture games, however, the motion scripts for individual limbs were split up, allowing the developers to mix and match them and thus build {{a greater variety of}} animations. In terms of designing the character of Kurt, the most important aspect was ensuring a smooth transition from the third-person mode to the sniper mode. This was when the developers decided to make Kurt's sniper rifle the same gun as his machine gun; rather than having to stop and extract a new weapon when switching modes, Kurt simply attaches the gun to his helmet. This also made sense within the milieu of the game as it made Kurt's Coil Suit a completely self-contained one-gun offensive/defensive ensemble. In designing the suit, Bruty stated [...] "At the time most of the other action games out there were very clunky and hardcore-looking. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> with more flair and elegance. I remember looking at a lot of old Spanish armour for the decoration and flourish." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellen Burstyn {{was still}} in the midst of filming The Exorcist when Warner Bros. {{executives}} expressed interest in working with her on another project. Burstyn later recalled, [...] "It was early in the woman's movement, and we were all just waking up and having a look at the pattern of our lives and wanting it to be different… I wanted to make a different kind of film. A film from a woman's point of view, but a woman that I recognized, that I knew. And not just myself, but my friends, what we were all going through at the time. So my agent found Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore… When I read it I liked it a lot. I sent it to Warner Brothers and they agreed to do it. Then they asked who I wanted to direct it. I said that I didn't know, but I wanted somebody new and young and exciting. I called Francis Coppola and asked who was young and exciting and he said 'Go look at a movie called Mean Streets and see what you think.' It hadn't been released yet, so I booked a screening to look at it and I felt that it was exactly what…Alice needed, because [...] was a wonderful script and well written, but for my taste it was a little slick. You know – in a good way, in a kind of Doris Day–Rock Hudson kind of way. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> a bit more gritty." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Take Everything", {{another song}} {{recorded}} for the album, {{is one of}} several songs written by Love and produced by Jim Jonsin and was the first record that Rowland recorded with the duo. Jonsin praised his studio sessions with Rowland, describing the new sound as Donna Summer-esque. During an interview with 103.5 KTU FM, she accidentally revealed she had collaborated with Pitbull, {{but it was not until}} August 15, 2010 during an interview with 97.9 The Box FM, that it was revealed that he features on [...] "Take Everything". Another song written and produced by the duo is titled [...] "Motivation" [...] featuring Lil Wayne. It was released as the album's lead single in April 2011. Speaking of how the record came about, Rowland said [...] "'Motivation' came about when I was in the studio with [...] Jim Jonsin and Rico Love, and we kind of were just vibing. I told Rico <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> really sexy ... and he came up with 'Motivation' along with Jim. It turned into this amazing record... I played [...] and he got on it, and it was just as simple as that." [...] The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body, and are accompanied by a [...] "synth-saturated beat" [...] produced by Jonsin. In terms of instruments, [...] "Motivation" [...] uses sparse keyboard notes, programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus. Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland's seductive suggestions, using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex.|$|E
2500|$|Digital Spy asked Scherzinger to {{describe}} Killer Loves sound, {{during an interview}} she replied said [...] "the album is largely produced by RedOne, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>something</b> explosive that could be staged live in a full performance and I needed music to match the intensity. That's what he did. It's raw, dangerous and big. That's what I {{want to be on}} stage. It's a different energy to Lady Gaga. The music is more rock, funk and soul inspired." [...] Killer Love sees Scherzinger duet with two male vocalists. On the ballad, [...] "Power's Out", she duets with English recording artist Sting. Speaking of their collaboration, which took place with both singers in the same studio, Scherzinger said [...] " [...] energy is very commanding, in a subtle way. He is giving, generous and kind. I flew to Boston for his show with The Police. I met him and he was everything and more than I thought. I felt like we were doing yoga when we were singing. He was such an easy guy to work with... Singing on the same mic you are really close. He had fresh breath. No broccoli in the teeth." [...] David Renshaw from PopDash said the song borrowed elements and the sound from The Police, a band Sting was previously lead singer of, and in particular their 1983 hit single [...] "Every Breath You Take". The other duet is with Enrique Iglesias, on his 2010 single [...] "Heartbeat". The version featured on Killer Love is the [...] "Rude Well's Open Heart Remix". Ellwood noted that the remix [...] "added beats changing the tone of the song completely." ...|$|E
