25|$|<b>Dyskeratosis</b> congenita (DC) is {{a disease}} of the bone marrow that {{can be caused by}} some {{mutations}} in the telomerase subunits. In the DC cases, about 35% cases are X-linked-recessive on the DKC1 locus and 5% cases are autosomal dominant on the TERT and TERC loci.|$|E
25|$|Leukoedema lesions {{disappear}} {{when the}} mucosa is stretched, which helps to differentiate it from other white lesions in the mouth. The differential diagnosis is with leukoplakia, oral candidiasis, oral lichen planus, white sponge nevus, morsicatio buccarum, hereditary benign intraepithelial <b>dyskeratosis</b> and <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita. Tissue biopsy is not indicated, but when taken, the histologic appearance {{is one of}} increased epithelial thickness, broadening and eleongation of the rete ridges, parakeratosis and intracellular edema of the spinous layer. The cells of the spinous later are vacuolated, large and possess pyknotic nuclei. The superficial squamous cells have a clear, seemingly empty cytoplasm {{but it has not}} been shown that there is an increase in intracellular water, possibly making the term edema misleading. The histologic appearance is thought to be caused by water within the cells of the spinous layer causing the light to reflect back as whitish. The diagnosis is usually made based on the clinical appearance alone, but oral exfoliative cytology {{has been used as a}} diagnostic aid.|$|E
25|$|A {{child who}} was {{eventually}} diagnosed with cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts was first described in the literature in 1987. The disorder was suspected of being allelic with either the Revesz syndrome or leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts. However, Revesz syndrome, a severe variant of <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita, was later shown to result from heterozygous dominant mutations in the TINF2 gene, which encodes TRF1-interacting nuclear factor 2, {{a major component of}} the telomere protecting shelterin complex, and individuals with the leukoencephalopathy with calcifications and cysts phenotype have not had mutations in the CTC1 gene.|$|E

5000|$|Germline {{mutations}} in WRAP53β result in disorder known as <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita, characterized by bone marrow failure, premature ageing, predisposition for cancer and a triad of mucocutaneous features including oral leukoplakia, abnormal skin pigmentation and nail dystrophy. Mutations in WRAP53β are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, reside in highly conserved regions of its WD40 domain {{and result in}} a more severe form of this disease. These mutations reduce the nuclear level of WRAP53β, impair its trafficking of telomerase to telomeres, and subsequently lead to progressive shortening of telomeres in these patients [...] The chaperonin CCT/TRiC is crucial for proper folding of WRAP53β and this folding is impaired in <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita ...|$|E

5000|$|Ribosomopathy underpins most Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), the X-linked subtype of <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita (DKCX), [...] Treacher Collins {{syndrome}} (TCS), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) and 5q- myelodysplastic syndrome.(5q- MDS),(cite)(cite) North American Indian childhood cirrhosis (NAIC), isolated congenital asplenia (ICAS), and Bowen-Conradi syndrome (BWCNS), CHARGE {{syndrome and}} ANE syndrome (ANES).|$|E
50|$|Bone marrow {{failure is}} {{associated}} with three types of diseases, Fanconi anemia (FA), <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita, and aplastic anemia. Fanconi anemia is an inherited blood disorder due to abnormal breakages in DNA genes. It is linked to hyperpigmentation, which is the darkening of an area of skin or nails caused by increased melanin. According to Histopathology, “However, in about 30% of FA patients no physical abnormalities are found”. <b>Dyskeratosis</b> congenita often affects multiple parts of the body. Individuals with this disorder usually show changes in skin pigmentations, unusual fingernail growth, and mucosa leukoplakia; the inner part of the mouth is encased with white patches that may never resolve. Aplastic anemia happens when bone marrow doesn’t produce enough new blood cells throughout the body. Aplastic anemia is an acquired autoimmune disease, which occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue.|$|E
50|$|Hereditary benign intraepithelial <b>dyskeratosis</b> {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant disease of the conjunctiva and the oral mucosa caused by a duplication of chromosome 4q35. In the mouth it appears similar to white sponge nevus, with painless, diffuse, folded and spongy white plaques. In the eye it appears as gelatinous plaques on bulbar perilimbal conjunctiva.|$|E
5000|$|Revesz {{syndrome}} is a fatal disease that causes exudative retinopathy and bone marrow failure. [...] Other symptoms include severe aplastic anemia, intrauterine growth retardation, fine sparse hair, fine reticulate skin pigmentation, ataxia due to cerebellar hypoplasia, and cerebral calcifications. Its effects {{are similar to}} that of Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome. It is a variant of <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita.|$|E
50|$|Mycosis fungoides, {{a type of}} skin lymphoma, may be a {{cause of}} PVA. The {{condition}} may also be caused by, associated with or accompany {{any of the following}} conditions or disorders: other skin lymphomas, dermatomyositis, lupus erythematosus, Rothmund-Thompson syndrome, Kindler syndrome, <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita, and chronic radiodermatitis. Rare causes include arsenic ingestion, and the condition can also be idiopathic.|$|E
50|$|Telomere {{deficiency}} {{is often}} linked to aging, cancers {{and the conditions}} <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita (DKC) and Cri du chat. Meanwhile, over-expression of hTERT {{is often associated with}} cancers and tumor formation. The regulation of hTERT is extremely important to the maintenance of stem and cancer cells and can be used in multiple ways in the field of regenerative medicine.|$|E
5000|$|Grover's disease (GD) is a polymorphic, pruritic, papulovesicular {{dermatosis}} characterized histologically by acantholysis with {{or without}} <b>dyskeratosis.</b> [...] Once confirmed, most cases of Grover's disease last six to twelve months, {{which is why it}} was originally called [...] "transient". However it may last much longer. Nevertheless, it is {{not to be confused with}} relapsing linear acantholytic dermatosis.|$|E
50|$|Ayelet {{was born}} at NYU's Langone Medical Center two months prematurely {{weighing}} just 2 lbs 7 ounces. She spent six weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, feeding and growing, before being released. When she was a year old, Galena was diagnosed with <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita of the HH variant. She presented with IUGR, colitis, immune deficiency, cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly and very short telomeres.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{research}} has used induced {{pluripotent stem cells}} to study disease mechanisms in humans, and discovered that the reprogramming of somatic cells restores telomere elongation in <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita (DKC) cells despite the genetic lesions that affect telomerase. The reprogrammed DKC cells were able to overcome a critical limitation in TERC levels and restored function (telomere maintenance and self-renewal). Therapeutically, methods aimed at increasing TERC expression could prove beneficial in DKC.|$|E
5000|$|Ribosomopathies are {{congenital}} human disorders {{resulting from}} defects in ribosomal protein or rRNA genes, or other genes whose products are implicated in ribosome biogenesis. Examples include X-linked <b>Dyskeratosis</b> congenita (X-DC), Diamond-Blackfan anemia, Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) [...] and Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS). SBDS {{is caused by}} mutations in the SBDS protein that affects its ability to couple GTP hydrolysis by the GTPase EFL1 {{to the release of}} eIF6 from the 60S subunit.|$|E
50|$|Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson {{syndrome}} (HHS) is a {{very rare}} multisystem X-linked recessive disorder characterized by excessively short telomeres and is considered a severe form of <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita. Being an X-linked disorder, HHS primarily affects males. Patients with HHS typically present in early childhood with cerebellar hypoplasia, immunodeficiency, progressive bone marrow failure, and intrauterine growth retardation. The primary {{cause of death in}} HHS is bone marrow failure, but mortality from cancer and pulmonary fibrosis is also significant.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} the haploinsufficiency of {{telomerase}} reverse transcriptase which leads to anticipation in autosomal dominant <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita. It is a rare inherited disorder characterized by abnormal skin manifestations, which results in bone marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis and an increased predisposition to cancer. A null mutation in motif D of the reverse transcriptase domain of the telomerase protein, hTERT, leads to this phenotype. Thus telomerase dosage is important for maintaining tissue proliferation.|$|E
50|$|In contrary, inactivating {{mutations}} in both alleles of WRAP53β causes <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita, indicating that this protein acts as tumor suppressor, {{rather than an}} oncogene. Loss of nuclear WRAP53β is also correlated with shortened survival and resistance to radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer. With its complex roles {{in a number of}} cellular processes, WRAP53β may act as a tumor suppressor under certain conditions and as an oncogene in under others.|$|E
50|$|Desert {{tortoises}} {{have been}} severely impacted by disease. Both {{upper respiratory tract}} disease and cutaneous <b>dyskeratosis</b> have caused precipitous population declines and die-offs across {{the entire range of}} this charismatic species. Both of these diseases are extremely likely to be caused by people, and URTD is easily linked with people releasing captive tortoises into the wild. The combination of scientific research and public education are imperative to curb the spread of disease and aid the tortoise in recovery.|$|E
50|$|This gene is {{a member}} of the melanoma-associated antigen gene family. The members of this family encode {{proteins}} with 50 to 80% sequence identity to each other. The promoters and first exons of the MAGEA genes show considerable variability, suggesting that the existence of this gene family enables the same function to be expressed under different transcriptional controls. The MAGEA genes are clustered at chromosomal location Xq28. They have been implicated in some hereditary disorders, such as <b>dyskeratosis</b> congenita.|$|E
