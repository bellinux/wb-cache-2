40|$|Inspired {{from the}} ideas such as “algorithm portfolio”, “mixture of experts”, and “genetic algorithm”, this paper {{presents}} two novel negotiation strategies, which combine multiple negotiation experts {{to decide what to}} bid and what to accept during the negotiation. In the first approach namely incremental portfolio, a bid is constructed by asking each negotiation agent’s opinion in the portfolio and picking one of the suggestions stochastically considering the expertise levels of the agents. In the second approach namely crossover strategy, each expert agent makes a bid suggestion and a majority voting is used on each <b>issue</b> <b>value</b> to decide the bid content. The proposed approaches have been evaluated empirically and our experimental results showed that the crossover strategy outperformed the top five finalists of the ANAC 2016 Negotiation Competition in terms of the obtained average individual utility...|$|E
40|$|Superscalar {{microprocessors}} currently {{power the}} majority of computing machines. These processors are capable of executing multiple independent instructions in each clock cycle by exploiting the Instruction-Level Parallelism (ILP) available in programs. Theoretically, there is {{a considerable amount of}} ILP available in most programs. However, the actual amount of exploitable ILP within a fixed instruction window with preset hardware resources is typically quite limited. On the other hand, researchers have observed that the values produced by the execution of instructions exhibit considerable value locality, that is, the repetitive execution of a single instruction often produces repetitive values. Hence, while its performance is limited by the exploitable ILP, the processor is doing redundant work. A natural solution to this problem would be to remove as much redundant work as possible. Value prediction and value reuse are two of the promising approaches addressing this <b>issue.</b> <b>Value</b> pre [...] ...|$|E

Memory Renaming has been proposed to communicate stored values directly to aliased loads. In this paper we examine in detail the interaction and performance tradeoffs of these four load speculation techniques in the presence of two mispeculation recovery architectures [...] reexecution and squash. We examine the performance of combining these techniques to create a load speculation chooser which provides performance improvement over using any one technique in isolation. We also examine the accuracy of these load speculation techniques for predicting data cache misses...|$|E

In modern economies all the more urgent to study the <b>issue</b> <b>value</b> of intangible assets of the company's overall strategy - learning tool which acts as a strategic card company is based on balanced scorecard. The strategic map balanced scorecard is a model that demonstrates how the strategy integrates intangible assets and value creation processes. In this paper a strategy map is based on total solution strategy for the client, the construction of long-term client relations based on bilateral cooperation. Balanced Scorecard and strategy map are the tools of effective business process Management Company. Forming a strategy based on intangible assets is the key to long-term and successful development. That is why the strategy of research companies should describe how the organization based on intangible assets is going to create long term value for its shareholders. ? ?????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ? ????????? ??????? ???????????????? ??????????? ? ?????????????? ????? ???????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ????????????????? ???????? ? ???????? ???????? ???????????? ??????...|$|E

Failure of design professionals to consider how a maintenance contractor or facility manager will construct the design thus results in higher operating cost, wastage, defects during the maintenance and operation process. Moving towards team integration is considered a significant strategy for overcoming the <b>issue.</b> <b>Value</b> Management is a style of management dedicated to guiding people and promoting innovation with the aim to improve overall building performance through structured, team-oriented exercises which make explicit, and appraise subsequent decisions, by reference to the value requirements of the clients. Accordingly, this paper discusses the fragmentation issue in more detail including the definition, causes and effects to the maintenance and operation of building {{and at the same time}} will highlighted the potential of VM integrated team approach as a strategic management approach for overcoming that issue.

40|$|The paper reviews {{evidence}} from the USA and UK on seasoned equity offers (SEOs) and rights issues. There are two main avenues of research: first, the market reaction to announcements of SEOs, and the related questions of the price elasticity of demand for new shares and the timing of issues; second, the costs of issuing and choice of issuing method. The negative reaction to announcements is well documented and the evidence suggests it is more due to an issue being a signal of overvaluation than to inelastic demand. Other findings are less well understood. The shares of issuers underperform appreciably in the long term, and {{there is evidence that}} market receptiveness to new issues varies. Companies tend to choose the most expensive method of issue both in terms of direct costs and negative market reaction. US companies use underwritten non-rights, through underwriting increases the direct costs. A possible explanation is that certification of <b>issue</b> <b>value</b> by the sponsor is more credible with non-rights issues in the USA and underwritten rights in the UK than with the apparently cheaper alternatives. seasoned equity offers, rights issues, investment banking,...|$|E
