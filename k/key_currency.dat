5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Summoner is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control of a silent protagonist that can be named and whose personality is determined by dialogue choices made in the game. Navigation is split into two types: standard navigation through the game's three-dimensional (3D) dungeons in a first-person view, and navigation around the protagonist's home of Hirasaki City using a 3D overworld map. During dungeon navigation, the player's route is automatically mapped, and the map can be viewed in the menu screen. Non-playable characters (NPCs) are represented in first-person navigation with 2D sprites, and their speech is represented with head-and-shoulder portraits above dialogue boxes. Quests are available at a location called the House of Divination, which the player can choose to accept in exchange for rewards. Various stores are scattered throughout Hirasaki City for buying items, weapons and armor, and healing the player's party and reserves. A <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> in the game is Magnetite, which is used for summoning demons and as currency {{in some of the}} stores.|$|E

5000|$|In 1970, the US was at {{the center}} of {{international}} instability that was a consequence of its rapid monetary growth (James, 1996). The US, however, had learned the fate of its predecessor’s <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> (e.g. Sterling). Britain’s experience as monetary hegemon demonstrated to the US the problems faced by a reserve currency when foreign monetary authorities, individuals, and investors chose to convert their reserves. In terms of monetary power defined by reserves, the US share of reserves had fallen from 50 percent in 1950 to 11 percent in August 1971 (Odell, 1982, p. 218). Although, the US had become considerably weak in defending convertibility, its rule-making power was second to none. Rather than being constrained by the system it created, the US moved to the conclusion that it “was better to attack the system than to work within it” (James, 1996, p. 203). This decision was based on the recognition of the inseparability between foreign policy and monetary policy. The termination of the Bretton Woods system signified the subordination of monetary policy to foreign policy. The closing of the gold window was a fix that was assigned to “free…foreign policy from constraints imposed by weaknesses in the financial system” (Gowa, 1983,p. 69).|$|E

40|$|What are the {{macroeconomic}} {{consequences of}} the dominant role of the dollar in the international monetary system? Here, we present a calibrated two country model in which exports are invoiced in the <b>key</b> <b>currency,</b> and government bonds denominated in the <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> are held internationally to facilitate trade. Domestic government bonds and money are held in each country to facilitate domestic transactions. Our model generates deviations from uncovered interest parity that are as volatile as some empirical estimates, but much too small by others. Our model also speaks to some other empirical anomalies, such as the Backus - Smith puzzle. Shocks affecting asset supplies [...] such as bond financed tax cuts, and open market operations [...] have large effects in our model because they generate non-Ricardian changes in household wealth. Generally, shocks emanating from the <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> country do more to destabilize the world economy than equal sized shocks coming from the other country. Similarly, monetary and fiscal policy innovations in the <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> country are more potent {{than those in the}} other country. On the other hand, the <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> country is more vulnerable to financial market turbulence, such as a sell off of <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> bonds, which can lower consumption dramatically. ...|$|E

Our results show that real exchange rates co-move with commodity prices in the long run and respond to oil price somewhat less than to commodity prices.

Considering that the combinations between the flexible exchange rates and the free circulation of capital and information have made the financial system be strongly interconnected internationally, however, some national economies preserve financial circuits that are not indirectly integrated in the world system.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the degree of {{monetary}} flexibility a government enjoys does not only depend on the implemented monetary institutions such as exchange rate arrangements and central bank independence but also on the economic and financial relationships with <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> areas. I develop a formal theoretical framework explaining the degree of monetary independence in open economies under flexible exchange rate regimes by trading relations and financial integration. The model suggests that a) higher import shares from the <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> area increase the imported inflation when monetary authorities try to offset an exogenous shock by cutting back the interest rate while the base country does not encounter a similar shock, and b) the more cross border assets of a country are denominated in the base currency the higher the exchange rate effects of interest rate differences to the interest rate of the <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> area. The presented empirical evidence largely supports the theoretical predictions. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper adopts and {{develops}} the "fear of floating" theory {{to explain the}} decision to implement a de facto peg, the choice of anchor currency among multiple key currencies, {{and the role of}} central bank independence for these choices. We argue that since exchange rate depreciations are passed-through into higher prices of imported goods, avoiding the import of inflation provides an important motive to de facto peg the exchange rate in import-dependent countries. This study shows that the choice of anchor currency is determined by the degree of dependence of the potentially pegging country on imports from the <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> country and on imports from the <b>key</b> <b>currency</b> area, consisting of all countries which have already pegged to this <b>key</b> <b>currency.</b> The fear of floating approach also predicts that countries with more independent central banks are more likely to de facto peg their exchange rate since independent central banks are more averse to inflation than governments and can de facto peg a country's exchange rate independently of the government...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea of an}} {{international}} monetary System comprised {{of a number of}} countries (monetary zones) linked together by an exchange rate mechanism controlled by the I. M. F. - the system's center - is the basis of {{the vast majority of the}} analyses and reform schemes respecting the System. This idea does not correspond to international economic and monetary reality which is organized around one or several international <b>currencies</b> (or <b>key</b> <b>currencies)</b> with regard to which the Central Bank(s) exercise(s) the de facto role of the System's monetary authority. This fact raises two theoretical questions : How is a Central Bank led to exercise such a role ? How, in fact, does the System function ?It is significant that the textbooks rarely treat the first question other than from an historical perspective. It would nevertheless appear that the explanation for the development of Euromarkefs employs a number of analytical tools that allow for a theoretical framework for the evolution of the I. M. S. based on the idea of competition among financial institutions and banks. On the one hand, this theory anticipates the long-term integration process of markets characterized by the erosion of regional markets and the growth of a new dominant market and therefore by the coexistence of regional authorities and a central authority sharing monetary power. On the other, it advocates the mix of unification and macroeconomic management policies that these authorities must adhere to in order to optimize the process. In the second part of the text the operation of a monetary zone such as the dollar standard of the last thirty years is examined. The organization of that zone provides an example of the distribution of monetary power as between the Federal Reserve System and the central banks of other countries.
