5000|$|Employing this functionalist approach, Ossorio {{defined a}} [...] "person" [...] as [...] "...an {{individual}} whose history is paradigmatically {{a history of}} deliberate action". A person is an individual, in other words, that (paradigmatically) {{has the ability to}} behave in the full sense of that term—to engage in some behavior B, knowing {{that he or she is}} doing B rather than other behaviors that he or she distinguishes, and having chosen B as being the thing to do from among a set of distinguished behavioral alternatives. In the vernacular, such behavior is characterized as [...] "knowing what you're doing and doing it on purpose." [...] Such behaviors as making a carefully considered move in a board game, ordering from a restaurant menu, or phrasing a verbal reply so as not to offend another represent clear, everyday examples of deliberate actions.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the nature of theory as portrayed in the metatheory 2 of Stanley Fish. Fish is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most controversial literary critics, an ardent pragmatist and an uncompromising representative of antifoundationlist thinking.

My main contention is that the functions attributed by him to theory—i. e. substituting of the general for the local, making objective noncontingent truth claims, which serve as grounds for his detraction, actually constitute the very basis of antifoundationalist criticism, hence his dismissal of theory is actually the consequence of his theory of theory. egyetemiangol nyelv és irodalo...|$|R

The project serves old adults participants of <b>the</b> attended program <b>at</b> Old Age of Centro Universitário Feevale.

This causes the adjacent material to neck down, harden, and this continues until the entire piece is much longer and thinner. The typical elongation can be anywhere from 18 to 65%, depending on both the exact composition of the alloy and prior heat-treatments. Alloys with manganese contents ranging from 12 to 30% are able to resist the brittle effects of cold, sometimes to temperatures {{in the range of}} -196 F.|$|R
40|$|We study cosmological {{solutions}} {{in the context}} of 4 -dimensional low energy Heterotic M-theory with moving bulk branes. In particular we present non-trivial, analytic axion solutions generated by new symmetries of the full potential-free action which are similar to 'triple axion' solutions found in Pre-Big-Bang (PBB) cosmologies. We also consider the presence of a non-perturbative superpotential, for which we find cosmological solutions with and without a background perfect fluid. In the absence of a fluid the dilaton and the T-modulus go to <b>the</b> potential-free solutions <b>at</b> late time, while the moving brane tries to avoid colliding with the boundary and stabilize within the bulk. When the fluid is included, we find that the real parts of the fields track its behaviour and that the moving brane <b>gets</b> stabilized <b>at</b> <b>the</b> middle <b>point</b> between <b>the</b> boundaries. In this latter case we can make analytic approximations for the evolution of the fields whether or not axions are included and we consider the possibility of this set up being a realization of the quintessential scenario.

40|$|Abstract: Background: Intravenous {{thrombolysis}} with alteplase is {{the only}} approved treatment for acute ischemic stroke. But there are patients with a severe stroke who do not benefit much from intravenous thrombolysis compared with patients having a mild to moderate severe stroke. We {{want to see if}} there is a significant difference in gaining recovery between those who get mild stroke and those who get severe stroke. Methods: Analysis of a thrombolysis- register ”SITS-MOST” (safe Implementation of Trombolysis in Stroke- Monitoring Study) from the period between 2003 - 01 - 01 and 2009 - 02 - 17 at Akerhus Universitets sykehus, Norway. Patients were evaluated with Rankin scale before <b>getting</b> stroke. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of stroke, patients were evaluated with NIHSS, TOAST- and Oxford classification. After getting thrombolysis, NIHSS was measured after 2 hours, 24 hours and after 7 days. Their function was monitored again after 3 months using Rankin scale. Results: After giving thrombolysis the outcome after 24 hours was as follows: in the NIHSS = 10 group 43 % had been much better, 10 % had been worse, and nobody were died. Outcome after 3 months by using Rankin scale was as follow: In the NIHSS group = 10 group, 4 % had no symptoms, 32 % had mild dysfunction, 29 % moderate difficulties, and 7 % were died after 3 months. Conclusions: Our results confirm that a NIHS score over 10 after giving intravenous thrombolysis is associated with a poorer outcome compared with those with a NIH score below 10. The findings should encourage use of intraarterial thrombolytic therapy for suitable patients treated in stroke centres...|$|R

He {{began to turn}} increasingly to writing and directing. Sharp said his background as an actor was useful for his development as a director, in particular it developed his sense of timing:You’ve got to know, for example, a thing I was taught early in theatre - if there's a scene in a movie, in a play, that always gets good laughs, on a good night, when there's a good and laughing audience, you’ll get laughs in the build-up to it, in the five or ten minutes beforehand, because it's a good audience who's appreciative of what's going on. On a bad night, when the audience are not laughing, increase your pace, <b>get</b> them <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> And this teaches you a control of speed and how to control an audience[...] [...] [...] Working with good actors, you get a feeling of timing with them; although sometimes the timing between them can be good but their overall pace, which is quite different, can be wrong - its context in the film, because {{of the situation in}} the film, perhaps there should be that little more urgency, therefore pace, in the scene.He worked on the screenplay to Background (1953). A new government-backed film company, Group Three, had a brief to support new talent and Sharp sold them an original script called Child's Play (1954). Group Three liked it and bought a story of Sharp's, originally called The Norfolk Story. He turned this into a novel called Conflict of Wings (1954), the title under which it was filmed; Sharp collaborated on the screenplay with John Pudney.|$|R
40|$|Nano-particle {{agglomeration}} {{plays an}} important role in processes such as spray drying and particle flame synthesis. These processes have in common that nano-particles collide at low concentrations and <b>get</b> irreversibly linked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of contact due to plastic deformation. In this paper, we investigate several models of irreversible connections, which require only local interactions between the colliding nano-particles and thus allow for scalable simulations. The models investigated here connect the particles upon collision by non-bonded strongly attractive interactions, bonded interactions or by binding agents placed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> of contact. Models using spherically symmetric interactions form compact agglomerates and are therefore unsuitable to study agglomeration. In contrast, models that are either based on both central and angular potentials (type one) or on binding agents (type two) efficiently prevent restructuring of the agglomerates, and are therefore useful for modeling contacts formed by plastic deformation. Moreover, both types of models allow to control the rigidity and by that the degree of restructuring. The first type of model is computationally more efficient at low fractional dimensions of the aggregates, while the second gives easy access to local shear forces, which is important when breaking of agglomerates is to be considered. As example applications, we reproduce the well-known diffusion-limited agglomeration (DLA) and report results on soot aggregation. Comment: Updated due to missing reference...|$|R
25|$|During {{the late}} 1940s Pollock's radical {{approach}} to painting revolutionized {{the potential for}} all contemporary art that followed him. To some extent Pollock realized that the journey toward making {{a work of art}} was as important as the work of art itself. Like Pablo Picasso's innovative reinventions of painting and sculpture near {{the turn of the century}} via Cubism and constructed sculpture, Pollock redefined the way art <b>gets</b> made <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mid-century <b>point.</b> Pollock's move — away from easel painting and conventionality — was a liberating signal to his contemporaneous artists and to all that came after. Artists realized that Jackson Pollock's process — working on the floor, unstretched raw canvas, from all four sides, using artist materials, industrial materials, imagery, non-imagery, throwing linear skeins of paint, dripping, drawing, staining, brushing, essentially blasted artmaking beyond any prior boundary. Abstract expressionism in general expanded and developed the definitions and possibilities that artists had available for the creation of new works of art. In a sense the innovations of Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Mark Rothko, Philip Guston, Hans Hofmann, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt and others opened the floodgates to the diversity and scope of all the art that followed them.|$|R
