The statue cost $217,000 and is displayed outside Maryland's student union. In 2006, Maryland introduced 50 statues of their school mascot, Testudo the Terrapin, with various designs chosen by different sponsoring groups. Among them was Kertle, a statue by Washington, DC artist Elizabeth Baldwin, designed to look like <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog.</b>|$|E

5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, and look what {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog</b> and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and says in a deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka. Who wants to hear a funny-ass joke?”.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, while {{attending}} Northwestern High School, {{he began working}} for WTOP-TV (now WUSA-TV), creating puppets for a Saturday morning children's show called The Junior Morning Show. After graduating from high school, Henson enrolled at the University of Maryland, College Park, as a studio arts major, thinking he might become a commercial artist. A puppetry class offered in the applied arts department {{introduced him to the}} craft and textiles courses in the College of Home economics, and he graduated in 1960 with a BS in home economics. As a freshman, he had been asked to create Sam and Friends, a five-minute puppet show for WRC-TV. The characters on Sam and Friends were forerunners of Muppets, and the show included a prototype of Henson's most famous character: <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog.</b> Henson would remain at WRC for seven years, from 1954 to 1961.|$|E
5000|$|In season 4 of Robot Chicken, Gordon the Gecko {{appears as}} <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> {{businessman}} cousin. <b>The</b> {{majority of his}} lines are direct quotes from the movie, including his [...] "Greed is Good" [...] speech.|$|R
5000|$|... "Halfway Down the Stairs" [...] {{was used}} in the first season of The Muppet Show. The {{performance}} was staged {{in the middle of a}} flight of stairs, and became the most significant performance of <b>the</b> season for <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> nephew, Robin <b>the</b> <b>Frog.</b> <b>The</b> sequence was reshot for a few different countries' broadcast of the tenth episode, with guest Harvey Korman.|$|R
5000|$|On July 2, 1990, Big Bird {{appeared}} at Jim Henson's memorial service at St. Paul's Cathedral in London, singing <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> signature song, [...] "Bein' Green". Performer Spinney nearly broke down {{several times during}} the deeply touching performance, which was later described by Life as [...] "an epic and almost unbearably moving event".|$|R
5|$|Henson {{became famous}} in the 1960s {{when he joined the}} children's {{educational}} television program Sesame Street, and there helped develop characters for the series. He also appeared on the sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live. In 1976, after scrapping plans for a Broadway show, he produced The Muppet Show. He won fame for his creations, particularly <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog,</b> Rowlf the Dog, and Ernie, and was involved with Sesame Street for over 20 years. Rowlf the Dog was a cast member on the Jimmy Dean Show in the early '60s. He also had frequent roles in Muppets films such as The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, and The Muppets Take Manhattan, and created advanced puppets for projects like Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth. During the later years of his life, he also founded the Jim Henson Foundation and Jim Henson's Creature Shop. His involvement in two television programs—The Storyteller and The Jim Henson Hour—led to Emmy Award wins.|$|E
5|$|In other media, the {{television}} series Sledge Hammer! (1986–88) lampoons noir, along with {{such topics as}} capital punishment, gun fetishism, and Dirty Harry. Sesame Street (1969–curr.) occasionally casts <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog</b> as a private eye; the sketches refer {{to some of the}} typical motifs of noir films, in particular the voiceover. Garrison Keillor's radio program A Prairie Home Companion features the recurring character Guy Noir, a hardboiled detective whose adventures always wander into farce (Guy also appears in the Altman-directed film based on Keillor's show). Firesign Theatre's Nick Danger has trod the same not-so-mean streets, both on radio and in comedy albums. Cartoons such as Garfield's Babes and Bullets (1989) and comic strip characters such as Tracer Bullet of Calvin and Hobbes have parodied both film noir and the kindred hardboiled tradition—one of the sources from which film noir sprang and which it now overshadows.|$|E
5|$|The Jim Henson Company and the Jim Henson Foundation {{continued}} {{after his}} death, producing new series and specials. Jim Henson's Creature Shop, founded by Henson, also continues to build creatures {{for a large}} number of other films and series (e.g. the science-fiction production Farscape, the film adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and the movie MirrorMask) and {{is considered one of the}} most advanced and well respected creators of film creatures. As of 2017, his eldest son Brian and eldest daughter Lisa are the co-chairs and co-CEOs of the company; his daughter Cheryl is the president of the foundation. Steve Whitmire, a veteran member of the Muppet puppeteering crew, assumed the roles of <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog</b> and Ernie, the most famous characters formerly played by Jim Henson. Whitmire also assumed the roles of Link Hogthrob, starting with the video game Muppet RaceMania, as well as The Muppet Newsman, starting in 2008, with Muppet.com viral online videos. However in 2017 Whitmire was fired from the Muppets Studio and as a result, Matt Vogel has taken over the role of Kermit. Muppeteer veteran Bill Barretta has taken over for Henson's fairly deeper voiced roles, such as the Swedish Chef, Mahna Mahna, Rowlf the Dog, and Dr. Teeth. Guy Smiley, in recent years, has been taken over by Eric Jacobson, and the role of Waldorf, in 1992, was assumed by Muppet performer veteran Dave Goelz. As of 2017, Ernie is now performed by puppeteer Peter Linz.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, Henning {{appeared}} on The Muppet Show where he performed several acts. He demonstrated chink-a-chink for <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> nephew Robin, segmented a Muppet monster into four pieces (and put him together wrong), and performed {{what he called}} [...] "metamorphosis": a bit where he swapped places with an assistant who was locked inside a trunk.|$|R
5000|$|Cookie Monster, still unnamed, {{made his}} Sesame Street {{debut in the}} first episode, interfering with <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frogs</b> [...] "famous W lecture" [...] by eating a model [...] "W" [...] bit by bit. He turns it into an [...] "N," [...] a [...] "V," [...] and finally an [...] "I," [...] to Kermits frustration. He then tries to eat Kermit.|$|R
50|$|Kermit's Swamp Years is a 2002 direct-to-video film, {{directed}} by David Gumpel, featuring Jim Henson's Muppets, including a young Kermit {{and his best}} friends Goggles and Croaker, who travel outside {{their homes in the}} swamps of the Deep South to do something extraordinary with their lives. The film, which tells <b>the</b> story of <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> early life, is a prequel to The Muppet Movie (1979).|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog</b> and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
25|$|Mickey was the Grand Marshal of the Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day 2005. He was {{the first}} cartoon {{character}} to receive the honor and only the second fictional character after <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog</b> in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Segel and Adams {{appeared}} at CinemaCon in March 2011, {{to promote the}} project, showcasing several clips from the film. Clips from the film were also shown at Suffolk University in April 2011 during a Q with David Hoberman, Steve Whitmire and <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog.</b> Although {{there had been some}} speculation that the cast would appear at Comic-Con, no official announcement was made.|$|E
2500|$|The Sesame Street Dictionary is an {{illustrated}} children's dictionary featuring Muppet characters {{from the popular}} television show Sesame Street. First published in 1980, it contains short definitions and sample sentences for around 1300 words, each accompanied by an illustration featuring a character from Sesame Street. In 1986, the dictionary was also issued as an 8-volume set under the title Big Bird's Sesame Street Dictionary. <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> nephew Robin <b>the</b> <b>Frog</b> makes a cameo in this book on the page [...] "frogs", also Miss Piggy makes a cameo in {{the book on the}} page [...] "magazines" [...] on a book called [...] "Stars".|$|R

During the tour, Walter sneaks into <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> office and discovers Statler and Waldorf selling the Muppet Theater to oil magnate Tex Richman and his henchmen Bobo the Bear and Uncle Deadly. After Statler and Waldorf leave, Walter overhears Richman reveal {{his plan to}} destroy the theater and drill for oil underneath. Walter explains to Gary and Mary that if the Muppets can raise $10 million by the time their original contract expires, they can repurchase the theater.|$|R
40|$|In this Christmas special {{featuring}} the Muppets, Fozzie Bear surprises his mother on Christmas Eve by bringing the entire Muppet gang to her farm {{to celebrate the}} holidays. Doc and his dog, Sprocket, who had planned a quiet Christmas, end up joining the Muppets in many holiday activities and preparations. The Sesame Street regulars, including Big Bird, Bert, Ernie, and others, join the festivities, but to <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> dismay, <b>the</b> only one missing is Miss Piggy, who has been caught in a snowstorm.

25|$|NOAA uses two Lockheed WP-3D Orion {{turboprops}} to {{fly through}} hurricanes and a Gulfstream IV-SP which flies around the upper fringes of storms {{to get a}} read on steering currents. The NOAA also uses light aircraft for some of its research. In conjunction with Jim Henson Productions, NOAA's P-3s are nicknamed <b>Kermit</b> <b>The</b> <b>Frog</b> (N42RF) and Miss Piggy (N43RF). The G-IV (N49RF) is nicknamed Gonzo.|$|E
25|$|The Jim Henson Company {{retains the}} rights {{to a number of}} {{productions}} featuring the Disney-owned Muppet characters, including Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, The Christmas Toy, , Henson's Place, Billy Bunny's Animal Songs, the original Dog City special, and Donna's Day.

2500|$|Walt Disney Records {{announced}} the album at the 2009 D23 Expo as Muppets Revisited with a projected 2010 release date. [...] The original project's name paralleled {{the title of}} Nightmare Revisited, the tribute album that Disney had released for The Nightmare Before Christmas in 2008. The album was part of Disney's dualistic effort to revitalize the franchise which had drastically faded since the 1990s and to promote the subsequent release of the seventh Muppet film, three months later. The album's artwork features a [...] "typographic portrait" [...] of <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> face, which is reminiscent of cover art derived from the psychedelic rock albums of the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|He also {{performed}} many characters on The Muppet Show, including Sgt. Floyd Pepper (the bassist of the Electric Mayhem band), Pigs in Space star Dr. Julius Strangepork, the boomerang fish-throwing Lew Zealand, <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> nephew Robin <b>the</b> <b>Frog,</b> Gonzo's girlfriend Camilla the Chicken, the mad pyrotechnist Crazy Harry, and the Phantom of the Muppet Show, Uncle Deadly. He performed Statler {{in the pilot}} episode but was replaced by Richard Hunt when he could not perform full-time in the first season. He was a full-time performer {{for the rest of}} the show's run. Nelson was also selected to play Statler after Hunt's death, after the end of the show. Nelson's Muppets on The Muppet Show were all only supporting roles, but they did occasionally play a central role in an episode's plot.|$|R
500|$|On May 21, Henson's public {{memorial}} service {{was conducted in}} New York City at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine. Another was conducted on July 2 at St Paul's Cathedral in London. In accordance with Henson's letters, no one in attendance wore black, and The Dirty Dozen Brass Band finished the service by performing [...] "When the Saints Go Marching In". Harry Belafonte sang [...] "Turn the World Around," [...] a song he had debuted on The Muppet Show, as {{each member of the}} congregation waved, with a puppet performer's rod, an individual, brightly colored foam butterfly. Later, Big Bird, performed by Caroll Spinney, walked out onto the stage and sang <b>Kermit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Frog's</b> signature song, [...] "Bein' Green".|$|R
