25|$|Marriage is solemnized as {{a written}} <b>financial</b> <b>contract,</b> in the {{presence}} of two Muslim male witnesses, and it includes a brideprice (Mahr) payable from a Muslim man to a Muslim woman. The brideprice is considered by a sharia court as a form of debt. Written contracts are paramount in sharia courts in the matters of dispute that are debt-related, which includes marriage contracts. Written contracts in debt-related cases, when notarized by a judge, is deemed more reliable.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{same-sex}} or heterosexual, unmarried {{and also}} married couples {{living in the}} Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and France for example, {{have the right to}} choose their own legal status and respective rights and obligations easily, such as to have no community or to have community of property, as an active opt in system at time of first living together. This is in contrast to the Australian de facto and married regimes where all property is in the pool, unless a couple actively opt out with a binding <b>financial</b> <b>contract</b> drawn up by lawyers and they also have to be resident in Australia to do that.|$|E

The seller (or [...] "writer") is obligated to sell the commodity or financial instrument should the buyer so decide. The buyer pays a fee (called a premium) for this right.|$|E

These <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> allow {{not only for}} removing moral hazard and adverse selection as index insurances do, but also for adding more flexibility and, hence, better risk protection. The evaluation of these <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> uses FADN farm data of Belgium from 1990 to 2007. Area indexes based on yield and yield-in-value perform well in stabilising revenues from some farm activities, but badly from some others. The variation in the estimated actuarially fair premiums across agricultural area shows the importance of designing those <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> according to homogenous agricultural area...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere are {{conflicts}} between risk sharing and incentive provision in <b>financial</b> <b>contracting</b> under information asymmetry. Efficient risk allocation is appropriate risk sharing subject to incentive constraints. Credit risk transfer changes incentive structure of <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> and has dilution effect on incentive of risk seller. Contract design and reputation discipline may reduce moral hazard but cannot eliminate it. Furthermore, {{the complexity of}} structured products created through financial engineering along the risk transfer chain makes the markets very opaque, which magnifies the information problems to the extreme. The inherent fragility of CRT markets provides an important role for regulation to improve risk allocation...|$|R

Conversely, we find that the stronger power given by law to entrepreneurs to renegotiate the terms of <b>financial</b> <b>contracts</b> increased the the cost of debt financing...|$|R
