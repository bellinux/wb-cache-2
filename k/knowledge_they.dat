5|$|In {{addition}} to research into synthetic explosives like RDX and HMX, the ERL investigated {{the properties of}} detonations and shock waves. This was initiated as a pure research project, without obvious or immediate applications. Kistiakowsky visited England in 1941 and again in 1942, where he met with British experts, including William Penney and Geoffrey Taylor. When Kistiakowsky and Edgar Bright Wilson, Jr., surveyed the existing state of <b>knowledge,</b> <b>they</b> found several areas that warranted further investigation. Kistiakowsky began {{to look into the}} Chapman–Jouguet model, which describes the way the shock wave created by a detonation propagates.|$|E

Tyler notices the phone soon after, talks {{to her and}} goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla become sexually involved. He warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. More fight clubs form across the country and, under Tyler's leadership (and without the Narrator's <b>knowledge),</b> <b>they</b> become an anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization, Project Mayhem, {{with many of the}} former local Fight Club members moving into the dilapidated house and improving it.|$|E

5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of a}} medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat into sleep. They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of <b>knowledge</b> <b>they</b> must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that cat’s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E
5|$|The next spring, a revitalized army {{emerged from}} Valley Forge in good order, {{thanks in part}} to a {{full-scale}} training program supervised by General von Steuben. The British evacuated Philadelphia for New York in June, 1778. Washington summoned a council of war with Generals Lee, Greene, and Wayne and Lafayette, and he decided to make a partial attack on the retreating British at the Battle of Monmouth. The British were commanded by Sir Henry Clinton, Howe's successor. On June 28, Lee and Lafayette moved with 4,000 men. Without Washington's immediate <b>knowledge</b> <b>they</b> attempted to launch but bungled the first attack at the British rear guard. Clinton came about and offered stiff resistance, also with 4,000 men and waiting in anticipation, keeping the Americans in check. After sharp words of criticism, Washington relieved Lee and continued fighting to an effective draw in one of the war's largest battles. When nightfall came, the fighting came to a stop and the British continued their retreat and headed towards New York, where Washington soon moved his army just outside the city.|$|E

25|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{study examined the}} extent to which the statistical information learned during this type of artificial grammar learning feeds into knowledge that infants may already have about their native language. Infants preferred to listen to words over part-words, whereas there was no significant difference in the nonsense frame condition. This finding suggests that even pre-linguistic infants are able to integrate the statistical cues they learn in a laboratory into their previously-acquired knowledge of a language. In other words, once infants have acquired some linguistic <b>knowledge,</b> <b>they</b> incorporate newly acquired information into that previously-acquired learning.|$|E

Naturally, when you claim some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.|$|E
