5|$|Raised on 12 August 1914, at {{the start}} of the First World War, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment came from the Canterbury Region on the South Island of New Zealand. Commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel John Findlay, it was {{composed}} of a headquarters, a machine-gun section and three squadrons, formed from Territorial Force regiments. The New Zealand Territorial Force included a compulsory training system, and the four Military Districts were required to supply a mounted regiment for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force. To meet that obligation, the Territorial Force regiments each provided a squadron, which kept their own regimental badges and traditions. The regiment's squadrons came from the 1st Mounted Rifles (Canterbury Yeomanry Cavalry) (1st Squadron), the 8th (South Canterbury) Mounted Rifles (8th Squadron) and the 10th (Nelson) Mounted Rifles (10th Squadron). The establishment was fixed at twenty-six officers and 523 other ranks, who used 528 riding horses, seventy-four draught horses and six pack horses. Each squadron, of 158 men, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> headquarters and four troops. The Machine-Gun Section, with two Maxim Guns, had one officer, twenty-six other ranks, twenty riding horses and sixteen draught horses. Even though the regiment used horses, they were not cavalry but mounted infantry, and expected to ride to the battlefield, dismount and then fight as traditional infantry. Attached to, but not part of, the regiment were medical and veterinary officers, an artificer, three more other ranks and another eighteen horses. The regiment was assigned to the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, serving alongside two other regiments: the Auckland Mounted Rifles and the Wellington Mounted Rifles.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} of the First French Republic wished to drive Sardinia-Piedmont out of the First Coalition. To achieve this aim, the French Army of Italy first had to defeat Michelangelo Alessandro Colli-Marchi's 21,000-man Sardinian army (including 4,000 Austrians) and Johann Peter Beaulieu's 28,000-strong Austrian army. For this purpose, Bonaparte <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> force of 43,000, while 22,000 more troops guarded his vulnerable supply line along the Italian and French Riviera.|$|E

The match had started well enough for the hosts Northamptonshire, but a menacing spell from the Pakistani fast bowler reduced them from 150 for 2 to 173 for 8 - Matt Mason helping out with two wickets as well. Shoaib {{finished}} with six for 47, including twenty runs conceded due to no-balls - while Monty Panesar and Jason Brown rescued the hosts to 299 with a last-wicket stand of 62. Young wicket-keeper Steve Davies then made a career-best 95 in his sixth first-class game, which helped lift Worcestershire to 381, a lead of 82.|$|E
25|$|Packer {{was often}} the centre of controversy. One of the {{earliest}} incidents occurred on 7 June 1960, {{when his father was}} trying to take over the Anglican Press, a small publisher run by Francis James. According to author Richard Neville, Frank Packer was angered by James' refusal to sell the Anglican Press, so he sent Kerry and some burly friends to pressure him into selling. They forced their way in and reportedly began vandalising the premises, but James was able to barricade himself in his office and call his friend Rupert Murdoch, Packer's most powerful rival. Murdoch quickly dispatched his own team of 'heavies', who threw Kerry and friends out. Not surprisingly, the Murdoch press <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> day with the news that the son of Australia's biggest media tycoon had been caught brawling in the street.|$|E

In the 139th Brigade, the 1/5th and 1/7th Sherwood Foresters were to attack with the 1/6th Sherwood Foresters in support and the 1/8th Sherwood Foresters in reserve, with one battalion {{to hold the line}} between the attacking divisions; one battalion was to dig a communication trench parallel to the Foncquevillers–Gommecourt road, from the sugar mill after the attack (a start was made but German artillery fire made it impossible to continue). The 138th Brigade was in reserve less two battalions and each brigade <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>Field</b> Company RE and the divisional pioneer battalion, 1/1st Monmouthhire Regiment (Monmouth), was to dig communication trenches.|$|E

She {{averaged}} 5.1 points per game and 2.8 rebounds per game this season, but {{had to deal with}} a foot injury. In the 2006/2007 season she played in the forward position for the Rangers. She avoided training during the early part of so as not to aggravate a foot injury. Nonetheless, in the first seven games of the season, she averaged 21.8 points and 5.6 rebounds per game. In one game against Bulleen, she scored 28 points. In those seven games, she only shot under 20 points only two times. Her team lost only in the two games she did not play. That season, she was coached by Gary Fox. In the team's 66-61 preliminary loss to the Adelaide Lightning, O'Hea scored 28 points and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> goal percentage of 55%.

25|$|Cleveland {{beat the}} Yankees {{in its second}} shutout of the season. The Browns scored all of their {{points in the first}} half. The first score was a {{touchdown}} from Graham to Bill Boedeker. Dub Jones ran for two one-yard touchdowns, while Motley scored on a short rush in the second quarter. Groza also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>field</b> goal {{at the end of the}} first quarter as the Browns built a 31–0 lead that it sustained through the third and fourth quarters. The Yankees threatened to score on their first drive of the third quarter, reaching the Browns' one-yard line. New York, however, failed to score and turned the ball over on downs. The Yankees again reached the one-yard line later in the game, but were stopped by a Cleveland interception. Graham threw for 382 yards in the game. Speedie, meanwhile, set AAFC records with 11 receptions and 228 receiving yards. The yardage figure surpassed the mark set by Lavelli against the Dons and remains a Browns team record. The victory clinched first place for the Browns in the regular season AAFC standings and gave them home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The 49ers and Yankees were in a battle for the second and third playoff spots, while the fourth berth was still up for grabs. A crowd of 50,711 came to see the Browns and the Yankees play in Yankee Stadium, the largest home attendance total of the year for New York.|$|E
