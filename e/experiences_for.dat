5|$|Pollack {{believed}} {{that the success of}} the WSOP was not determined based upon the number of participants every year, but rather upon the players' <b>experiences.</b> <b>For</b> example, in 2007 the WSOP flattened its award structure. The cash awards were distributed more evenly so that people who went out earlier earned more money, while those who made it to the final table won less.|$|E

5|$|Both {{free and}} paid DLC was {{announced}} as being planned {{as early as}} April 2016, with paid DLC being described as a necessity due to production costs. Plans for DLC content were finalized by June of that year, with a small team working on it while the main game was completed. The main aim was to make players feel they had made a good purchase. Full production began after the main game was completed. The DLC development was handled by Haruyoshi Sawatari, who took over as producer when Tabata saw the game would not make its projected September 30 release date; Tabata continued to focus on polishing the main game, while Sawatari created the DLC {{with a group of}} core developers, although Tabata continued to oversee their production. While having story-based DLC focused on each character seemed to undermine the main appeal of the story, Sawatari noted that the breaks gave characters a chance to grow as individuals before returning to and strengthening the group. Square Enix stressed when the details were announced that the DLC was not content cut from the game itself, but original content to add new <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> players.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} {{deals with the}} newly emerging field of service design. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim {{is to improve the}} quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good <b>experiences</b> <b>for</b> the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.|$|E
