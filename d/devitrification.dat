It was probably between [...] and [...] in volume and extended past the reaches of the caldera, down the adjacent foothills. Beyond the caldera, the eruptive products are poor in phenocrysts (unlike those of the first eruption). They are instead rich in lithic material, which makes {{up as much as}} 10percent of the rock in parts (50percent {{at the base of the}} caldera). As the first of the ash was deposited, it accumulated in layers that formed quickly and resisted erosion, but only partially melded together. However, except for these basal layers and thin zones where the ash was devitrified (loses the properties of a glass and becomes brittle), the entire sheet is melded together. Inside Calabozos, the ash resisted welding and contains more phenocrysts. Instead, erosion ate away at it, in the form of acid leaching, and broke down much of its pumice content. Still, the rock layer here contains five to 30percent phenocrysts, and has high levels of <b>devitrification</b> and lithic content.|$|E

50|$|<b>Devitrification</b> is {{the process}} of {{crystallization}} in a formerly crystal-free (amorphous) glass. The term is derived from the Latin vitreus, meaning glassy and transparent.|$|E
50|$|Techniques for {{avoiding}} <b>devitrification</b> include cleaning the glass surfaces of dust or unwanted residue, and allowing rapid cooling once the piece reaches the desired temperature, until the temperature approaches the annealing temperature.

50|$|Graphic texture is {{commonly}} created by exsolution and <b>devitrification</b> and immiscibility processes in igneous rocks.It is called 'graphic' because the exsolved or devitrified minerals form lines and shapes which {{are reminiscent of}} writing.|$|E
5000|$|Causes of <b>devitrification,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "devit", can include holding a high temperature for too long, which causes the nucleation of crystals. The presence of foreign residue such as dust {{on the surface of the}} glass or inside the kiln prior to firing can provide nucleation points where crystals can propagate easily. The chemical compositions of some types of glass can make them more vulnerable to <b>devitrification</b> than others, for example a high lime content can be factor in inducing this condition. In general opaque glass can devit easily as crystals are present in the glass to give its opaque appearance and thus the higher the chance it might devit.|$|E

50|$|In some {{rocks the}} whole groundmass {{consists}} of spherulitic growths of fibrous quartz and feldspar; in their centres {{there is often}} a quartz or feldspar crystal; the outer boundaries of the spherulites are not usually circular but irregular, owing to the interlocking of adjacent spherulites at their margins.

50|$|Clinoptilolite is {{a natural}} zeolite {{comprising}} a microporous arrangement of silica and alumina tetrahedra. It has the complex formula: (Na,K,Ca)2-3Al3(Al,Si)2Si13O36·12H2O. It forms as white to reddish tabular monoclinic tectosilicate crystals with a Mohs hardness of 3.5 to 4 and a specific gravity of 2.1 to 2.2. It commonly occurs as a <b>devitrification</b> product of volcanic glass shards in tuff and as vesicle fillings in basalts, andesites and rhyolites. It was described in 1969 from an occurrence in Owl Canyon, San Bernardino County, California.|$|E
50|$|Once devit has occurred, {{there are}} {{techniques}} {{that can be}} attempted to fix it, {{with varying degrees of}} success. One technique is to cover the surface with a sheet of clear glass and refiring. Since <b>devitrification</b> can change the COE somewhat, and devitrified glass tends to be somewhat harder to melt again, there is the possibility of this technique resulting in a less stable piece, however it has also been used effectively with full-fused pieces with no apparent problems. Applying devit spray and refiring can also be effective. Alternatively, sandblasting, acid bath, or polishing with a pumice stone or rotary brush can be used to remove the unwanted surface.|$|E
5000|$|Glasses {{to be fused}} {{together}} must {{be selected}} for compatibility with each other, both chemically (more of a concern with soft glass than borosilicate) {{and in terms of}} coefficient of thermal expansion (COE) is also used for Coefficient of Thermal Expansion. Glasses with incompatible COE, mixed together, can create powerful stresses within a finished piece as it cools, cracking or violently shattering the piece. Chemically, some colors can react with each other when melted together. This may cause desirable effects in coloration, metallic sheen, or result in an aesthetically pleasing [...] "web effect". It also can cause undesirable effects such as unattractive discoloration, bubbling, or <b>devitrification.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{thin film}} method {{is limited to}} thin {{specimens}} (typically < 500 nm) because the electrons cannot cross thicker samples without multiple scattering events. Thicker specimens can be vitrified by plunge freezing (cryofixation) in ethane (up to tens of μm in thickness) or more commonly by high pressure freezing (up to hundreds of μm). They can then be cut in thin sections (40 to 200 nm thick) with a diamond knife in a cryoultramicrotome at temperatures lower than -135 °C (<b>devitrification</b> temperature). The sections are collected on an electron microscope grid and are imaged {{in the same manner}} as specimen vitrified in thin film. This technique is called cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) or cryo-electron microscopy of frozen-hydrated sections.|$|E
50|$|Some {{differences}} {{exist between the}} facies of the ignimbrite {{inside and outside of}} the caldera, as well as between the western and eastern outcrops. Such differences concern the degree of welding of the ignimbrite, the occurrence or absence of <b>devitrification</b> and the jointing patterns. In fact, a segment of the northern Atana ignimbrite was later considered to not be actually part of the Atana ignimbrite at all because of the different facies and petrology. This separate ignimbrite was christened to be an upper and a lower Tara ignimbrite, possibly erupted by the Cerro Guacha caldera. The Tara ignimbrite fills part of the La Pacana caldera. The total volume of the La Pacana ignimbrites proper is estimated to be about , on the basis of gravimetric information about the volume of the caldera and the infill ignimbrites.|$|E
50|$|The second {{eruption}} {{was more}} extensive and covered {{at a minimum}} 2265 km2. Starting from the caldera rim, it is clearly distinguishable in two units; the intracaldera Chorrillos and the extracaldera Tajamar units which were formerly considered to be separate events. The Chorrilos deposits are gray coloured and have pumice fragments of less than 5 cm diameter; they also contain breccia lenses. The Tajmar deposits overlie the Chorrillos deposits and have a red to pale pink colour. The ash flows from the eruption flowed out of the caldera, forming flow structures similar to large lava flows. The deposits underwent some <b>devitrification</b> due to vapour action. This ignimbrite has a maximum thickness of 450 m on Cerro Aguas Calientes in the caldera centre and thins to less than 100 m away from the volcano.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{contemporary}} fusing methods involve stacking, or layering thin {{sheets of}} glass, often using different colors to create patterns or simple images. The stack is then placed inside the kiln (which {{is almost always}} electric, but can be heated by gas or wood) and then heated {{through a series of}} ramps (rapid heating) and soaks (holding the temperature at a specific point) until the separate pieces begin to bond together. The longer the kiln is held at the maximum temperature, the more thoroughly the stack will fuse, eventually softening and rounding the edges of the original shape. Once the desired effect has been achieved at the maximum desired temperature, the kiln temperature will be brought down quickly through the temperature range of [...] to [...] to avoid <b>devitrification.</b> The glass is then allowed to cool slowly over a specified time, soaking at specified temperature ranges which are essential to the annealing process. This prevents uneven cooling and breakage and produces a strong finished product.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Devitrification,</b> {{the process}} of {{crystallization}} of a formerly crystal-free, amorphous glass state, can lead to damage during the warming of cells. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the glass transition temperature of a cryopreservation solution typically used in the vitrification, storage and warming of mammalian oocytes and embryos using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. A numerical model of the heat transfer process to analyze warming and <b>devitrification</b> thresholds for a common vitrification carrier (open pulled straw, OPS) was conducted. The implications on specimen handling and storage inside the dewar in contact with nitrogen vapor phase at different temperatures were determined. The time required for initiation of <b>devitrification</b> of a vitrified sample was determined by mathematical modeling and compared with measured temperatures in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen cryogenic dewars. Results indicated that the glass transition ranged from - 126 to - 121 ºC and <b>devitrification</b> was initiated at - 109 ºC. Interestingly, samples entered rubbery state at - 121 ºC and therefore could potentially initiate <b>devitrification</b> above this value, with the consequent damaging effects to cell survival. <b>Devitrification</b> times were calculated considering an initial temperature of material immersed in liquid nitrogen (- 196 ºC) and two temperatures of liquid nitrogen vapors within the dewar (- 50 and - 70 ºC) to which the sample could be exposed for a period of time, either during storage or upon its removal. The mathematical model indicated samples could reach glass transition temperatures and undergo <b>devitrification</b> in 30 seconds. Results of the present study indicate storage of vitrified oocytes and embryos in the liquid nitrogen vapor phase (as opposed to completely immersed in liquid nitrogen) poses the potential risk of <b>devitrification.</b> Due to the reduced time-handling period before samples reach critical rubbery and <b>devitrification</b> values, caution should be exercised when handling samples in vapor phas...|$|E
