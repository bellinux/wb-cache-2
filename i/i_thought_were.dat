Meyer, who stated he dislikes director's cuts, {{nevertheless}} found [...] "a couple of moments that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> not clear", and re-edited them as [...] "I suddenly saw {{how to make them}} clear." [...] Among the elements added for home video were a briefing with the Federation president where Admiral Cartwright and Colonel West unveil their plan for rescuing Kirk and McCoy, and a scene where Spock and Scott inspect the torpedoes. Some shots were reordered or replaced, with wide-angle shots replacing close angles and vice versa. The special features included a commentary track with Meyer and Flinn, featurettes detailing the special effects, production, and historical inspiration of the film, and a tribute to actor DeForest Kelley.|$|E

Co-producer Paul Rabwin said that the episode had some of the funniest {{material}} in The X-Files {{as well as some of}} the most horrific, such as the scene where a cockroach crawled into someone's arm. Gillian Anderson rated the episode one of her favorite episodes of the third season. On a more negative note, writer Darin Morgan ended up being unhappy with the final product, saying [...] "The other day, my girlfriend was saying, 'I never understood that episode,' and I guess I don't either. It was an episode that had a lot of what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> really good ideas and never quite got it to work. I was really disappointed with that episode. Some people love it."

Rosenwald Trophy Tournament in New York City (1956), a premier tournament limited to the 12 players considered the best in the country. Although Fischer's rating was not among the top 12 in the country, he received entry by special consideration. Playing against top opposition, the 13-year-old Fischer could only score 4½/11, tying for 8–9th place. Yet, he won the [...] for his immortal game against International Master Donald Byrne, in which Fischer sacrificed his queen to unleash an unstoppable attack. Hans Kmoch called it [...] "The Game of the Century", writing: [...] "The following game, a stunning masterpiece of [...] play performed by a boy of 13 against a formidable opponent, matches the finest on record in the history of chess prodigies". According to Frank Brady, The Game of the Century' has been talked about, analyzed, and admired for more than fifty years, and it will probably {{be a part of the}} canon of chess for many years to come."

500|$|For the 2009 {{version of}} Friday the 13th, effects artist Scott Stoddard took {{inspiration}} from Carl Fullerton's design in Friday the 13th Part 2 and Tom Savini's work in Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter. Stoddard {{wanted to make}} sure that Jason appeared human and not like a monster. Stoddard's vision of Jason includes hair loss, skin rashes, and the traditional deformities in his face, but he attempted to craft Jason's look in a way that would allow for a more human side to be seen. Stoddard took inspiration from the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. The make-up artist managed to acquire an original set piece, which he studied and later sculpted. Although he had a model of one of the original masks, Stoddard did not want to replicate it in its entirety. As Stoddard explains, [...] "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed, there were things <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit. Make it custom, but keep all the fundamental designs. Especially the markings on the forehead and cheeks. Age them down a bit, break them up." [...] In the end, Stoddard crafted six versions of the mask, each with varying degrees of wear.|$|E
500|$|For Jason's wardrobe, Mears {{was given}} a pair of combat boots and a [...] "high-priced t-shirt" [...] that allowed the special effects make-up to be seen through holes in the shirt. The jacket Jason wears in the film was created by {{combining}} a hunting jacket and a military jacket. Mears {{wanted to use the}} hunting jacket, but the creative team liked the way the military jacket billowed as he was making his [...] "kill movements." [...] The top of the hunting jacket was removed and placed {{over the top of the}} military jacket. Mears called it a [...] "giant Frankenstein jacket." [...] He describes Jason as leaner in this film because the character does not eat much. A leaner Jason was deemed more functional and allowed more emphasis to be placed on the hump on his back. Stoddard was inspired by the third and fourth films when designing Jason's hockey mask. Using an original mold, Stoddard made six new versions of the mask. He said, [...] "Because I didn't want to take something that already existed. There [...] were things <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> great, but there were things I wanted to change a bit.

500|$|Following Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons, Joe 90 was {{purposely}} {{conceived and}} developed to {{be a different}} kind of Supermarionation series, placing the narrative emphasis less on action, advanced technology and visual effects and more on characterisation and plotlines subscribing more to the spy thriller genre than science fiction. Co-creator Gerry Anderson explained, [...] "The show majored on its characters, which <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> all very good. The puppets had become so lifelike, I now strongly believed that they could carry the action without the usual massive assistance from futuristic hardware." [...] Explaining his inspiration for the series, Anderson remembered his pre-Supermarionation days when he served as an assistant editor for such films as The Wicked Lady, handling recording tape on a daily basis. While pondering on the blanking and re-use of such tape, Anderson made a connection to the human brain's electrical activities, explaining, [...] "I read somewhere that the human brain is controlled by electrical impulses and how thoughts are stored electronically. I started toying with the story potential of a process that would allow the recording of brain patterns and transferring them to another brain. I was really likening it to magnetic recording, where material could be stored or transferred to another tape." [...] When it came to naming the lead character and, from that, the name of the new series, Anderson recalled that on one of his earlier productions, Fireball XL5, the surname [...] "Ninety" [...] had been an early proposal for Colonel Steve Zodiac, and selected it for the new schoolboy protagonist.|$|E
500|$|On 30 March 2005 the BBC {{confirmed}} that Eccleston {{would not be}} staying in the role for a second series, claiming that he was scared of being typecast. On 4 April they admitted that this statement had been made without consulting the actor, and were forced to apologise. Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post in 2010, Eccleston denied that he left due to fear of being typecast. He stated that he [...] "didn't enjoy {{the environment and the}} culture that we, the cast and crew, had to work in" [...] and {{that he did not want}} to do any more based on the experience. He said, [...] "I wasn't comfortable. I thought 'If I stay in this job, I'm going to have to blind myself to certain things that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> wrong.' And I think it's more important to be your own man than be successful, so I left. But the most important thing is that I did it, not that I left. I really feel that, because it kind of broke the mould and it helped to reinvent it. I'm very proud of it." [...] According to the Sunday Mirror, an interview for BBC's Doctor Who website that was taken down after his departure revealed that Eccleston had planned to stay for two or three more years. In March 2013 a source for the BBC indicated that Eccleston had discussed plans for Doctor Whos 50th anniversary special, which aired in November 2013, with Davies' successor as executive producer, Steven Moffat. After consideration, he decided not to return to the series. Had he returned, his incarnation would have played the role that ultimately became the War Doctor, portrayed by John Hurt.|$|E

The Good Son, a 1990 album by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, was heavily informed by Cave's mental state at the time, which he has described as saudade. He told journalist Chris Bohn: [...] "When I explained to someone that what I wanted to write about was the memory of things that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> lost for me, I was told that the Portuguese word for this feeling was saudade.

[...] This inspired Manson to grab the hotel notepad and begin penning the song's lyrics. Manson explains in his autobiography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell that [...] "I had written other songs <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>were</b> good, but [...] "Cake and Sodomy" [...] {{was more than just a}} good song.

On 14 February Fitzwilliam replied that it was support national security that he made those appointments: the disaffection amongst Catholics was great and so a change in direction was needed to retain Ireland. His fears of Beresford's [...] "power and influence" [...] had been [...] "too well founded: I found them incompatible with mine...and after the receipt of this, you will be prepared to decide between Mr Beresford and me and that the matter is come to this issue is well known here".
