In 2006 the club moved to Ashburton Grove {{on the west}} side of Drayton Park in Highbury. The old stadium was converted into a luxury housing complex known as Highbury Square, with the two listed main stands being converted into apartments, ensuring their original exteriors remained almost entirely preserved. The unlisted North Bank and Clock End stands have been demolished to make way for entirely new apartment blocks. The pitch has been converted into a garden, with private gym and swimming pool located underneath it. Today, property in the area around the old Highbury stadium is highly sought after, and prices for apartments within the stadium start at £300k.|$|E
25|$|The 105-day war had a {{profound}} and <b>depressing</b> <b>effect</b> in Finland. Useful international support was minimal, arrived late, and the German blockade prevented most armament shipments. At {{the end of the}} war, the situation of the Finnish army on the Karelian Isthmus had been the subject of some debate. The orders were already given to prepare a retreat to the next line of defence in the Taipale sector. The estimates of how long the enemy could have been held in these kinds of retreat-and-stand operations varied from a few days to a couple of months, most averaging around a few weeks. During the Interim Peace, Karelian local governments, parishes and provincial organizations established Karjalan Liitto, an interest group, in order to defend the rights and interests of Karelian evacuees and to find a solution for returning Karelia.|$|E

500|$|In 1922 Keynes {{continued}} to advocate reduction of German reparations with A Revision of the Treaty. He attacked the post World War I deflation policies with A Tract on Monetary Reform in 1923 – a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation {{even at the}} cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of sterling to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works. During the 1920s Keynes's pro stimulus views had only limited effect on policy makers and mainstream academic opinion – according to Hyman Minsky one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was [...] "muddled". The Tract had also {{called for an end to}} the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the gold standard, as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor Winston Churchill to re-establish it, which had a <b>depressing</b> <b>effect</b> on British industry. Keynes responded by writing The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill and {{continued to}} argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.|$|E

2500|$|Lionfish {{are known}} for their venomous fin rays, an {{uncommon}} feature among marine fish in the East Coast coral reefs. The potency of their venom makes them excellent predators and hazardous to fishermen and divers. Pterois venom produced negative inotropic and chronotropic effects when tested in both frog and clam hearts and has a <b>depressing</b> <b>effect</b> on rabbit blood pressure. These results are thought to be due to nitric oxide release. In humans, Pterois venom can cause systemic effects such as extreme pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, breathing difficulties, convulsions, dizziness, redness on the affected area, headache, numbness, paresthesia (pins and needles), heartburn, diarrhea, and sweating. Rarely, such stings can cause temporary paralysis of the limbs, heart failure, and even death. Fatalities are common in very young children, the elderly, those with a weak immune system, or those who are allergic to their venom. Their venom is rarely fatal to healthy adults, but some species have enough venom to produce extreme discomfort for a period of several days. However, Pterois venom is a danger to allergic victims as they may experience anaphylaxis, a serious and often life-threatening condition that requires immediate emergency medical treatment. Severe allergic reactions to Pterois venom include chest pain, severe breathing difficulties, a drop in blood pressure, swelling of the tongue, sweating, runny nose, or slurred speech. Such reactions can be fatal if not treated. There is a possibility for a human to be stung without any venom being [...] injected. If venom is injected, the sting will hurt more than just briefly. Lionfish are not aggressive towards swimmers. Most accidents happen to fishermen who happen to catch them.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} developments in macroeconomic policy-making {{over the last two decades}} has been the growing recognition that inflation is usually bad for economic growth. There is still substantial disagreement among researchers, however, about how quantitatively important are the growth <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> of inflation and at what levels of inflation these effects begin to appear. Some economists have been concerned by rates of inflation of three or four percent while others have been unconcerned by rates of twenty or thirty percent. A recent paper by Sarel (1996) makes an important contribution to the research literature on the growth effects of inflation. Much of the literature has assumed that the effects of inflation on growth are linear. But threshold rates of inflation may have to be surpassed before the growth <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> of inflation become important. Sarel shows that failure to take such thresholds into account leads to a substantial downward bias in estimates of the growth costs of inflation.

40|$|The {{effects on}} unit {{discharges}} of various {{doses of the}} compounds chlordiazepoxide, meprobamate, sodium pentobarbital, and diazepam were studied in the unanesthetized, unrestrained rat. Recordings of action potentials were made simultaneously in hippocampus, pre-optic region, and the reticular formation of the midbrain. The doses of chlordiazepoxide were 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg; 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital; 80, 100 and 120 mg/kg of meprobamate, and finally 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg of diazepam. In the hippocampus, chlordiazepoxide depressed spontaneous activity at every dose used. The reduction ranged from 30 to 50 %, but in no case was there inhibition of all discharges. Diazepam also had substantial <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> on the activity in this region of the brain. In contrast, sodium pentobarbital had relatively minor effects in the lower dose range, but significant <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> at the higher doses. Meprobamate also had comparatively small effects in the hippocampus. In the pre-optic area, chlordiazepoxide and meprobamate depressed spontaneous activity at the higher dose range. There were small effects in the lower dose range. Sodium pentobarbital also had minor <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> at all doses. Diazepam caused less depression even at the higher doses than either chlordiazepoxide or meprobamate, and these effects were transient. In the midbrain reticular formation, meprobamate caused substantial depression of spontaneous activity even at the lower doses. Sodium pentobarbital similarly depressed activity, but the onset of effect was less delayed than with meprobamate. Chlordiazepoxide at low doses caused less depression of reticular midbrain neurons than of hippocampal or pre-optic region ones. At high doses, the effect {{was similar to that}} of meprobamate. The data suggest the possibility of a mode of action of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam which implicates the hippocampus, whereas in the case of sodium pentobarbital and meprobamate, the mode of action appears to implicate the midbrain reticular area.

40|$|Objective: Paired {{associative}} stimulation (PAS) {{has been}} used to study normal and abnormal cortical plasticity. However, a normative review of PAS effects has not been provided so far. To this end, the magnitude and time course of PAS protocols was systematically evaluated here. Methods: A literature search in PubMed using the search term paired associative stimulation was conducted. Main inclusion criteria were that experiments were conducted in primary motor cortex of healthy volunteers without motor training before intervention and motor evoked potentials as primary outcome measure. This search yielded in total 104 experiments, which were analyzed to examine the potentiating (PAS(LTP)) and <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> of PAS (PAS(LTD)) on cortical excitability levels in healthy volunteers. Results: PAS(LTP) induces reliable and stable potentiating effects (maximum +/- standard error 38. 5 +/- 3. 3 %) on cortical excitability levels up to 90 min. PAS(LTP) was most effective when applied at frequencies of 0. 05 and 0. 2 Hz. Analyses of the PAS(LTD) studies demonstrated reliable and stable depression of cortical excitability levels up to 120 min (maximum +/- standard error - 23. 0 +/- 1. 9 %) Conclusions: PAS significantly modulates cortical excitability. The potentiating effects of PAS(LTP) are stronger than the <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> for PAS(LTD). Significance: Present findings offer normative insights into the magnitude and time course of PAS(LTP) and PASLTD-induced changes in cortical excitability levels...|$|R

40|$|Excessive {{levels of}} {{unemployment}} exist in many South African communities (www. statssa. gov. za) alongside {{low levels of}} entrepreneurial behaviour (GEM Report, 2006). This is true even when South African figures are compared to figures from similar developing countries (GEM Report, 2006; Urban, 2006). This thesis looks for reasons why this situation exists and examines possible solutions by considering the motivation to create new ventures alongside contemporary theories of work motivation. It considers those theories {{in light of the}} known <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> that unemployment has on an individual (Darity et al, 1996; Feather, 1992; McKee-Ryan et al, 2005; Rodriguez, 1997; Shamir, 1986; Vansteenkiste et al, 2004; Vansteenkiste et al, 2005) in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of why entrepreneurship is not flourishing in South Africa’s unemployed communities. The motivation to form a new venture is vital to new venture formation (Herron&Sapienza, 1992; Douglas et al, 1994; Wennekers and Thurik, 1999; Wiklund et al, 2003; Segal et al, 2005) but is under-considered in many programmes aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship. Where the psychologically <b>depressing</b> <b>effects</b> of unemployment have reduced an individual’s intrinsic motivation to form a new venture, a structured environment should be created to facilitate the early stages of new venture formation. Individuals should be extrinsically motivated to achieve goals until the benefits of accumulated achievements have countered those depressive effects and traditional venture formation theories once again become valid.
