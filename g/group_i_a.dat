An Invitro {{study was conducted to}} investigate the elemental release and their cytotoxic effects from commercially available Ni–Cr dental casting alloys, commonly used for fabricating fixed partial dentures. Three Ni–Cr alloys [Wiron 99 (A), Ceramet (B), and Hi Nickel CB (C) ] were tested. Alloy specimens (disks 3  ×  5  mm) were casted and grouped as follows: <b>Group</b> <b>I</b> (<b>A</b> 1 /B 1 /C 1) : 100 % pure alloy; Group II (A 2 /B 2 /C 2) : 50 % new with 50 % recast; and Group III (A 3 /B 3 /C 3) : 100 % recast. Disks of each alloy type from each group were transferred to Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium and left for 3  days at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2. Ni, Cr, Co, Cu and Mo elemental release from metal alloys into culture medium was investigated using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Cytotoxicity was tested using mouse fibroblast cells and MTT Assay. Controls consisted of 6 wells containing cells with no alloy specimens. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance followed by t-test. The total amount of elements released in parts per billion for various casting groups were <b>Group</b> <b>I,</b> <b>A</b> 1 - 6. 572, B 1 - 6. 732, C 1 - 8. 407; Group II, A 2 - 22. 046, B 2 - 26. 450, C 2 - 29. 189; Group III, A 3 - 84. 554, B 3 - 88. 359, C 3 - 92. 264. More amounts of elements were released in Hi Nickel CB than Ceramet and Wiron 99 in all the three test groups. Percentage of viable cells from MTT analysis were <b>Group</b> <b>I,</b> <b>A</b> 1 - 62. 342, B 1 - 61. 322 C 1 - 60. 593, Group II, A 2 - 58. 699, B 2 - 56. 494, C 2 - 52. 688, Group III, A 3 - 53. 101, B 3 - 52. 195, C 3 - 47. 586. The viable cells present in the culture media were more in Wiron 99 than Ceramet and Hi Nickel CB. Elemental release increased with amount of recast alloy. Amongst the three alloys tested Hi Nickel CB had significantly higher elements released compared to Ceramet and Wiron 99 in 100 % pure alloys, 50 % recast and 100 % recast alloys. Wiron 99 showed least element release in 100 % pure alloy, 50 % recast and 100 % recast specimens. 100 % pure alloys of all three alloys are less cytotoxic, but their cytotoxicity is more on 50 % and 100 % re-casted alloys.

30|$|Previous {{studies are}} {{consistent}} with the model which has been proposed by Mott and used in our research. This model explains the hopping conduction of the whiskers at low temperatures. The obtained influence of Ni impurities on the whisker resistance at the region of hopping conductance could be understood taking into account polarization effect of Ni on charge carriers. It is obvious that the effect depends on spin orientation of charge carriers, which is specific at the region of hopping conductance in the sample with B concentration in the vicinity to MIT (<b>group</b> <b>I).</b> <b>A</b> temperature growth leads to an increase of the number of valence charge carriers accompanying spin depolarization as well as to a decrease of Ni impurities influence on the whisker resistance (Fig.  2 b). As for the absence of any influence of Ni impurities on the whisker resistance (Fig.  2 a), there are no charge carriers with polarized spins in the samples with lower B concentration (group II) in low temperature range. So, Ni impurities are likely influenced on the charge carriers, twice occupied on B impurities, which are present at low temperature range in the sample with concentration in the vicinity to MIT.|$|E

This article evaluates an antiarrhythmic action during sympathetic stimulation in the intact anesthetized dog with and without ischemia. Methods and Results: The ventricular fibrillation threshold (VFT) was examined before and after epinephrine (E) in normals (<b>group</b> <b>I).</b> <b>A</b> VFT reduction during E was normalized after 1 week of ASA (P <. 01). Regional myocardial ischemia for I hour resulted in similar hypoperfusion in controls of group II and after ASA.

To assess the antiarrhythmic role of the anion in group III, Na salicylate was given.
