25|$|By 600, the {{establishment}} of the first Anglo-Saxon 'emporia' was in prospect. There seem to have been over thirty of such units, many of which were certainly controlled by kings, in the parts of Britain which the Anglo-Saxons controlled. Bede's use of the term imperium has been seen as significant in defining the status and powers of the bretwaldas, in fact it is a word Bede used regularly as an alternative to regnum; scholars believe this <b>just</b> <b>meant</b> the collection of tribute. Oswiu's extension of overlordship over the Picts and Scots is expressed in terms of making them tributary. Military overlordship could bring great short-term success and wealth, but the system had its disadvantages. Many of the overlords enjoyed their powers for a relatively short period. Foundations had to be carefully laid to turn a tribute-paying under-kingdom into a permanent acquisition, such as Bernician absorption of Deira. The smaller kingdoms did not disappear without trace once they were incorporated into larger polities; on the contrary their territorial integrity was preserved when they became ealdormanries or, depending on size, parts of ealdormanries within their new kingdoms. An obvious example of this tendency for later boundaries to preserve earlier arrangements is Sussex; the county boundary is essentially {{the same as that of}} the West Saxon shire and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Witan, also called Witenagemot, was the council of kings; its essential duty was to advise the king on all matters on which he chose to ask its opinion. It attested his grants of land to churches or laymen, consented to his issue of new laws or new statements of ancient custom, and helped him deal with rebels and persons suspected of disaffection.|$|E
500|$|... "Alive" [...] is not [...] "the type of music" [...] that Lopez {{is used to}} making. According to Lopez, {{she knew}} that there was {{something}} [...] "inside of me that I have to offer to this [...] And then, you know, things happen. Things have a weird way of happening naturally and organically when they're supposed to. And I feel that this song was <b>just</b> <b>meant</b> to be, for this movie. Basically, I wrote the song for me to go through all these kinds of things as an actress with this character. You draw from all different experiences in your life. From way back to the present, to whatever, to make it really true and honest". [...] "Alive" [...] means [...] "the world" [...] to Lopez because of its positive message {{and the fact that it}} was something that she created with Judd.|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{railroad}} track {{that existed in the}} Confederacy was of simple rail-way design <b>just</b> <b>meant</b> to carry the large bales of cotton to local river ports in the harvest season. [...] These often did not connect to other rail-lines making internal shipments of goods difficult at best. While the Union had a large navy, the new Confederate Navy had only a few captured warships or newly built vessels. [...] These did surprisingly well but ultimately were sunk or abandoned as the Union Navy controlled more rivers and ports. [...] Rebel 'raiders' loosed on the Northern ships on the Atlantic did tremendous damage and sent Yankee ships into safe harbors as insurance rates soared. [...] The Union blockade of the South, however, made imports via blockade runners difficult and expensive. [...] Somewhat awkwardly, these runners didn't bring significant amounts of the war materials so greatly needed but rather the European luxuries sought as a relief from the privations of the war-time's stark conditions.|$|E

500|$|The hawthorn-scented bath lotion, or boyaryshnik, {{that caused}} the mass {{methanol}} poisoning was purchased as a drink because of its low price amid poor economic conditions—such liquids were {{not subject to the}} alcohol excise tax, which had been increased as part of an anti-alcohol effort in 2009, or other restrictions placed in recent years to help curb alcohol consumption in the country. Although the bottles are typically half the size of traditional vodka, their alcohol content is such that they can be diluted into a strength similar to vodka. Moreover, they were often available from vending machines at any time of the night, while government-regulated liquor could only be sold within legally defined hours. The machines were often deliberately placed near poorer areas of Russian cities, where the product would be appealing to those seeking a cheaper alternative to regular alcohol. [...] "Everybody knew that it was not bath oil," [...] one individual told The New York Times after the poisoning. [...] "That label was <b>just</b> <b>meant</b> to fend off the inspectors." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{black-and-white}} {{stripes on}} the prisoner's uniform {{in the first}} design reminded Fuse of the Forty-seven Ronin, who wore black and white; this led him to incorporate traditional Japanese clothing into the design. He called this the key to solving the problem, but still had further issues with the design: if he made the outfit too Japanese, Blackquill would not look like an Ace Attorney prosecutor, and {{he thought it would}} be strange if he gave him a katana like an actual ronin, since Blackquill is a convict, and even average citizens are not legally allowed to carry swords. He realized that he could use a combination of Japanese black-and-white clothes and prosecutorial Western clothes found in the Meiji era, when Japan was Westernized. As they needed the character to look [...] "sharp and stylish in Western clothing", the only direct indication of him being a convict in the end was his shackles. His messy ponytail was also used to convey a feeling of [...] "long incarceration", as well as evoke the image of a ronin. Blackquill's hawk, Taka, was initially <b>just</b> <b>meant</b> as a part of the Japanese elements of the design, being reminiscent of Japanese falconers. Taka's role was eventually extended to bringing documents and evidence to Blackquill, highlighting how Blackquill's movements are hindered by his shackles. Fuse described the final design as looking like a [...] "Meiji Restoration-era fighter".|$|E
2500|$|Until 1935 {{there were}} just a dozen states that had old age {{insurance}} laws but these programs were woefully underfunded and therefore almost worthless.

2500|$|... "Welcome" [...] {{is a song}} by American hip hop act Fort Minor, {{the side}} project of rock band Linkin Park's co-lead vocalist Mike Shinoda.

2500|$|Itagaki classifies his {{projects}} into core projects (for business and technical excellence purposes), and those purely for self-fulfillment.

The Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball games are <b>just</b> <b>meant</b> for simple fun, and to fulfill a 'love' for the female characters, letting the player nurture and watch the girls partaking in simple joys. Even though he admits to there being sexual content in the game, Itagaki refuses to create scenarios which he feels are vulgar for his 'daughters', a term he uses to call the female characters. Code Chronos falls into the same category of development, developed as Itagaki's hobby for style.|$|E

2500|$|André Green objected that [...] "when {{you read}} Freud, {{it is obvious}} that this {{proposition}} doesn't work for a minute. Freud very clearly opposes the unconscious (which he says is constituted by thing-presentations and nothing else) to the pre-conscious. What is related to language can only belong to the pre-conscious". Freud certainly contrasted [...] "the presentation of the word and the presentation of the thing... the unconscious presentation is the presentation of the thing alone" [...] in his metapsychology. However Dylan Evans, in his Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis, [...] "... takes issue with those who, like André Green, question the linguistic aspect of the unconscious, emphasizing Lacan's distinction between das Ding and die Sache in Freud's account of thing-presentation". [...] Green's criticism of Lacan also included accusations of intellectual dishonesty, he said, [...] " [...] cheated everybody… the return to Freud was an excuse, it <b>just</b> <b>meant</b> going to Lacan." ...|$|E
