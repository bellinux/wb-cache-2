The meat dress was displayed at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in 2012, and entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in September 2015.|$|E
500|$|Similar to Disney's Aladdin (1992) and Pocahontas (1995) before it, Mulan {{begins with}} an opening song that {{establishes}} the film's location, setting and cultural characteristics, in this case [...] "Honor to Us All". The song attempts to deconstruct the idea that women are only good for looking attractive and getting married. According to Diversity in Disney Films: Critical Essays on Race, Ethnicity, Gender, Sexuality and Disability (2013) author Johnson Cheu, {{the power of the}} Matchmaker's decision [...] "emphasizes the necessity of heterosexual approbation in order to secure a place in society." [...] The musical number highlights Mulan's greatest dilemma; her own individuality constantly contradicts against society's expectations of young women. Consequence of Sounds Dominick Suzanne-Mayer cited [...] "Honor to Us All" [...] as an example of Mulan spending {{a significant portion of the}} film at the mercy of other characters, framing [...] "her preparation rituals for courtship as a gauntlet of demands from... her entire village" [...] while [...] "instructing her about how important it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to be complacent and attentive." ...|$|E

[...] As with Poniewozik, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club complimented 30 Rock as they [...] "pulled it off with aplomb" [...] in regards to Liz's actions in this episode. He said that Liz and Drew [...] "are so damned delightful that it's hard not to root for them even if Liz's antics increasingly border on deranged and criminal." [...] Rabin said that the Rohypnol incident was funny [...] "but also sweet {{and more than a little}} romantic." [...] Sassone enjoyed Liz and Drew's scenes, writing that when Fey and Hamm work together they are quite good. Gold said that Liz's unsuccessful attempts of seduction were [...] "hilarious effects". Canning wrote that Liz's [...] "scam" [...] started weakly but that her storyline [...] "grew at a great pace." ...|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Isn't This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain)", while Rogers is out riding, a {{thunderstorm}} breaks {{and she takes}} shelter in a bandstand. Astaire follows her and a conversation about clouds and rainfall soon gives way to Astaire's rendering of this, one of Berlin's most prized creations. Astaire sings to Rogers' back, but the audience can see that Rogers' attitude towards him softens during the song, {{and the purpose of}} the ensuing dance <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to communicate this change to her partner. The dance is one of flirtation and, according to Mueller, deploys two choreographic devices common to the classical minuet: sequential imitation (one dancer performs a step and the other responds) and touching. Initially, the imitation is mocking in character, then becomes more of a casual exchange, and ends in a spirit of true cooperation. Until the last thirty seconds of this two and a half minute dance the pair appear to pull back from touching, then with a crook of her elbow Rogers invites Astaire in. The routine, at once comic and romantic, incorporates hopping steps, tap spins with barrages, loping and dragging steps among its many innovative devices. The spirit of equality which pervades the dance is reflected in the masculinity of Rogers' clothes and in the friendly handshake they exchange at the end.|$|E
500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with a smile to give her a little time.|$|E
500|$|On 27 November 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Shakira was conducting auditions to choose a different opening act for each of the tour's appearances in different cities. The acts willing to audition were required to upload videos of their performances to Shakira's official website. Fans were allowed to vote for their favourite acts and the ones with the most would proceed to the finals; Shakira and her team would then pick the winner out of them. Sean Wolfington, Shakira's digital-business partner, talked about the decision and told the New York Post that [...] "The artists will open for Shakira live in big cities and virtually through a video performance in smaller markets. There are a lot of talented artists, and Shakira wants to help them by giving them part of her stage". The visuals and conceptual video scenes for the tour were managed and designed by entertainment branding agency Loyalkaspar, who had previously designed tour visuals for artists like U2 and Jay-Z. Elliott Chaffer, the creative director of the agency, talked about the project, saying that [...] "Shakira was a much bigger undertaking then anything we've attempted previously. They were looking for original content that had to work over two LED screens and on a huge projector mapping surreal models of an ever-changing animated face, all in just three weeks. This <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> global world tour, so modifications to the setlist and track durations continued through nine rounds of revisions". The visuals were projected onto the large screen set behind the stage. The stage was shaped {{in the form of the}} letter [...] "T" [...] to enable a maximum number of viewers to see Shakira.|$|E

After an ordeal, Finn saves Marceline from the amulet. Marceline admits that all she wants <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> father to understand her. When Finn wishes for an alternate reality [...] in which the Lich never existed during {{the events of the}} fifth season premiere [...] "Finn the Human", a universe is created in which the Mushroom War was prevented by Simon Petrikov and Marceline never became a vampire. She appears in the episode as an extremely frail and aged half-demon, who was killed when a [...] "mutagenic bomb" [...] that was frozen in ice by Simon Petrikov detonates. Jake manages to undo this reality with his wish and sets everything back to the way it was. In [...] "Sky Witch", Marceline enlists the help of Princess Bubblegum, and the two are able to track down Maja, the titular Sky Witch. It is revealed that Ash sold Hambo to Maja. Only when Bubblegum trades her beloved rock shirt—which was given to her by Marceline—is Hambo able to be reunited with Marceline. After the events of [...] "Sky Witch", Bubblegum and Marceline are on much friendlier ground, and their friendship is completely reaffirmed in the episodes [...] "Varmints" [...] and [...] "Broke His Crown", from the seventh and eighth season respectively. In [...] "Betty", Marceline sacrifices Hambo so that Ice King—who lost his powers and became Simon Petrikov again—can open a portal into time so that Simon can reconcile with his estranged fiancee Betty. Although the two are reunited in [...] "Betty", due to the rush of events, Marceline and Simon are unable to fully catch up before Simon reverts back to the Ice King. With that being said, in the eighth season episode [...] "Broke His Crown", the two manage to more fully reunite, and as such, manage to affirm how much they care for one another.|$|E
500|$|Kristen Bell was lauded for her {{performance}} as Anna in the film. Michelle Im, {{writing for the}} Eye of the Tiger referred to the character as [...] "bubbly and spirited", and commented, [...] "Not only was [...] able to nail those vibratos and belting notes in her songs, it was actually her singing them." [...] The Coast News review of the film wrote that Bell [...] "earns top marks" [...] for instilling a spirited sensibility in the clumsy but well-meaning Anna. Cinenerd, a film critic for Blogcritics, commended the actress' singing ability, stating that she and Menzel [...] "sing their hearts out, with two showstoppers in Let it Go and For the First Time in Forever". Colin Covert of Colorado Springs' The Gazette considered Bell's performance as a [...] "flawless delivery". Matt Goldberg extolled the relationship between Anna and her elder sister Elsa, writing, [...] "There's so much to love about Frozen, but {{at the top of}} the list is the emphasis on [...] and Elsa's relationship. Anna still has an infatuation with the charming Hans and romantic chemistry with the flustered Kristoff, but her greatest love <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> sister. [...] is mostly scared and guilt-ridden. She's an incredibly sympathetic character, and it's a fresh spin on depicting estrangement between siblings. Anna has so much life and enthusiasm, and we want to see her share it with Elsa." [...] Magdalena Lachowicz of The Heights referred to this sisterly bond as [...] "what truly makes the film and the moral that comes with it", commenting, [...] "the plot is set up to lead the viewer into thinking that it needs to be true love's kiss—something which Anna then goes to seek. This journey sends her on a difficult adventure in which she learns about both sacrifice and love." [...] Debbie Lynn Elias of Culver City Observer commented, [...] "Female driven with confidence and positivity, Elsa and Anna are like two sides of a coin, both strong, albeit one through power and confidence and the other through clumsy sticktuitiveness and love," [...] while Stephen Holden from The New York Times appreciated that instead of a romantic attachment, it was a sisterly love and devotion that drove the story, which departed greatly from traditional Disney formula. Noah Lee described Anna and Elsa's relationship as [...] "genuine", saying, [...] "watching those themes of family and love versus isolation and fear touched my heart in more ways than one." ...|$|E
