40|$|April 2009 Using {{a sample}} of 231 {{entrepreneurial}} firm <b>successions</b> <b>in</b> Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan, we find that firms' unsigned discretionary accruals decrease while timely loss recognition increases subsequent to successions, suggesting a shift in accounting toward a less insider-based system. We argue that the change in accounting properties {{is due to the}} loss of specialized assets <b>in</b> the <b>succession</b> process, such as the entrepreneur's reputation and political/social networks, inducing the firm to adapt to market-based rather than relationship-based contracting. Moreover, we find that the extent of the shift in accounting is larger <b>in</b> founder <b>successions</b> than <b>in</b> subsequent (non-founder) <b>successions,</b> as the dissipation of specialized assets is greatest <b>in</b> founder <b>successions...</b>|$|R
