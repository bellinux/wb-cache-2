40|$|There {{are still}} many {{unresolved}} issues concerning the efficiency of electrochemical realkalisation and electrochemical chloride removal as <b>electrochemical</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> methods for corroding reinforced concrete structures. The present paper seeks to answer {{a number of questions}} which, though seemingly elementary, continue to arouse controversy in scientific, technical and economic communities, despite the vast amount of work that has been devoted to research on corrosion in concrete embedded steel, such as whether corrosion can be stopped once it has started, whether corroded reinforced concrete structures can be repassivated, and whether it is sufficient to remove the sources of corrosion in order to stop rusting. A discussion is conducted on the relationship between the prerusting grade of rebars and the possibility of their repassivation; on whether <b>electrochemical</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> methods treatments are efficient, and if so, when and on whether a simple potential measurement can determine the passive or active state of a rebar. For this purpose an analysis is made, using electrochemical, gravimetric and metallographic techniques, of the response of clean and previously corroded steel electrodes in a Ca(OH) 2 saturated solution with and without a sodium nitrite corrosion inhibitor and in cement mortar. The effectiveness of electrochemical realkalisation and electrochemical chloride removal for repassivating prerusted steel in concrete is found to depend heavily on the prerusting grade.
