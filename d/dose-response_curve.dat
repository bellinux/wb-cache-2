5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a <b>dose-response</b> <b>curve</b> measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

This ability to measure current through exactly the same piece of membrane in different solutions is the distinct advantage of the outside-out patch relative to the cell-attached method. On the other hand, it is more difficult to accomplish. The longer formation process involves more steps that could fail and results in a lower frequency of usable patches.|$|E

40|$|At present, {{regulatory}} {{assessment of}} systemic toxicity is almost solely carried out using animal models. The European Commission's REACH legislation stimulates {{the use of}} animal-free approaches to obtain information on the toxicity of chemicals. In vitro toxicity tests provide in vitro concentration-response curves for specific target cells, whereas in vivo <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> are regularly used for human risk assessment. The present study shows an approach to predict in vivo <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> for developmental toxicity by combining in vitro toxicity data and in silico kinetic modeling. A physiologically based kinetic (PBK) model was developed, describing the kinetics of four glycol ethers and their embryotoxic alkoxyacetic acid metabolites in rat and man. In vitro toxicity data of these metabolites derived in the embryonic stem cell test were used as input in the PBK model to extrapolate in vitro concentration-response curves to predicted in vivo <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> for developmental toxicity of the parent glycol ethers in rat and man. The predicted <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> for rat {{were found to be}} in concordance with the embryotoxic dose levels measured in reported in vivo rat studies. Therefore, predicted <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> for rat could be used to set a point of departure for deriving safe exposure limits in human risk assessment. Combining the in vitro toxicity data with a human PBK model allows the prediction of <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> for human developmental toxicity. This approach could therefore provide a means to reduce the need for animal testing in human risk assessment practices. Â© The Author 2010. All rights reserved...|$|R

We examined whether immediate TLR induced changes in CD 11 b and L-selectin (CD 62 L) expression are able to discriminate the presence and severity of atherosclerotic disease by exploring single dose whole blood TLR stimulation and detailed <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves.</b> Blood samples were obtained from 125 coronary artery disease (CAD) patients and 28 controls. CD 11 b and L-selectin expression on CD 14 + monocytes was measured after whole blood stimulation with multiple concentrations of the TLR 4 ligand LPS (0. 01 - 10 ng/ml) and the TLR 2 ligand P 3 C (0. 5 - 500 ng/ml). Subsequently, <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> were created and the following parameters were calculated: hillslope, EC 50, area under the curve (AUC) and delta. These parameters provide information about the maximum response following activation, {{as well as the}} minimum trigger required to induce activation and the intensity of the response. CAD patients showed a significantly higher L-selectin, but not CD 11 b response to TLR ligation than controls after single dose stimulations as well as significant differences in the hillslope and EC 50 of the <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves.</b> Within the CAD patient group, <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> of L-selectin showed significant differences in the presence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary occlusion and degree of stenosis, whereas CD 11 b expression had the strongest discriminating power after single dose stimulation.

40|$|In {{chemical}} safety assessment, information on adverse effects after repeated dose and chronic exposure to {{low levels of}} hazardous compounds is essential for estimating human risks. At present, this information is almost solely obtained by performing animal experiments. Therefore, suitable methods to reduce, refine or replace (3 Rs) repeated dose animal testing are urgently needed. At present, in vitro toxicity assays are able to screen compounds for toxicity, but since these tests result in in vitro concentration-response curves, whereas for the safety assessment of chemicals for human in vivo <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> are needed, {{it is important that}} in vitro concentration-response curves can be translated to in vivo <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves.</b> The goal of the present project is to extrapolate in vitro concentration-response curves to in vivo <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> with the help of physiologically based kinetic (PBK) models that describe the in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) processes. This is achieved by using the concentration-response curves, acquired in an appropriate in vitro toxicity test, as internal concentrations in the model, in order to calculate the in vivo dose levels that are needed to reach the internal (toxic) concentrations, by using the PBK-model. The predicted <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> thus obtained can be used to determine safe exposure levels in {{chemical safety}} assessment. The endpoint {{used in the present study}} is developmental toxicity. The in vitro toxicity assay used is the differentiation assay of the embryonic stem cell test (EST). With the use of a rat PBK model, predicted <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> for in vivo developmental toxicity for the rat are acquired, which are compared with experimental literature data on the in vivo developmental toxicity of these compounds in the rat. To obtain the <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> for in vivo developmental toxicity in human, PBK-models describing the in vivo kinetics in human are used.

The results of the research reveal the feasibility of translating in vitro concentration-response curves to in vivo <b>dose-response</b> <b>curves</b> using PBK modeling.
