In addition, one can easily check that the <b>integrand</b> is strictly positive for at least one point in the range of integration, say at 1/2. Since the <b>integrand</b> is continuous at that point and non-negative elsewhere, {{the integral}} from 0 to 1 must be strictly positive.|$|E
40|$|In this letter, we {{extend the}} tree-level Kawai [...] Lewellen [...] Tye (KLT) and Bern [...] Carrasco [...] Johansson (BCJ) {{amplitude}} relations to loop <b>integrands</b> of gauge theory and gravity. By rearranging the propagators of gauge and gravity loop <b>integrands,</b> we propose the first manifestly gauge- and diffeomorphism invariant formulation of their double-copy relations. The one-loop KLT formula expresses gravity <b>integrands</b> {{in terms of}} more basic gauge invariant building blocks for gauge-theory amplitudes, dubbed partial <b>integrands.</b> The latter obey a one-loop analogue of the BCJ relations, and both KLT and BCJ relations are universal to bosons and fermions {{in any number of}} spacetime dimensions and independent on the amount of supersymmetry.

40|$|Abstract. Local Lipschitz {{continuity}} of minimizers of certain integrals of the Calculus of Variations is obtained when the <b>integrands</b> are convex {{with respect to}} the gradient variable, but are not necessarily uniformly convex. In turn, these regularity results entail existence of minimizers of variational problems with non-homogeneous <b>integrands</b> nonconvex {{with respect to the}} gradient variable. The x-dependence, explicitly appearing in the <b>integrands,</b> adds signicant technical diculties in the proof. Mathematics Subject Classication. 49 J 45, 49 K 20, 35 F 30, 35 R 70.

Our approach yields <b>integrands</b> that are independent of the choice of CSW reference spinor even before integration. Furthermore, we present a recursive derivation of the recently proposed massive CSW-style vertex expansion for massive tree amplitudes and loop <b>integrands</b> on the Coulomb-branch of N = 4 SYM. The derivation requires a careful study of boundary terms in all-line shift recursion relations, and provides a rigorous (albeit indirect) proof of the recently proposed construction of massive amplitudes from soft-limits of massless on-shell amplitudes.
