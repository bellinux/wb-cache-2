The models determined maximum concentrations of heavy <b>key</b> <b>in</b> the distillate and light <b>key</b> <b>in</b> the bottom for limited feed stock and market condition.

The limiting constraints were sales specification concentration of light <b>key</b> <b>in</b> the distillate [ ], heavy <b>key</b> <b>in</b> the bottom [ ] and an operating loading constraint of flooding above the feed tray. For unlimited feed stock and market condition, the optimization models determined the optimum separation [ and ] and feed flow rate that would give maximum profit with minimum purity sales specification constraints of light <b>key</b> <b>in</b> the distillate and heavy <b>key</b> <b>in</b> the bottom as stated above. The feed loading was limited by the reboiler capacity.

5|$|In 2017, the European Commission began {{investigating}} Valve {{and five}} other publishers—Bandai Namco Entertainment, Capcom, Focus Home Interactive, Koch Media and ZeniMax Media—for anti-competitive practices, specifically the use of geo-blocking through the Steam storefront and Steam product keys to prevent access to software to citizens of certain countries. Such practices would be against the Digital Single Market initiative set by the European Union. The French gaming trade group, Syndicat National du Jeu Vidéo, noted that geo-blocking was a necessary feature to hinder inappropriate product key reselling, where a group buys a number of <b>keys</b> <b>in</b> regions where the cost is low, and then resells them into regions of much higher value to profit on the difference, outside of European oversight and tax laws.|$|E
