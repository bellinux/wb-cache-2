5|$|If cancer growth blocks a short {{section of}} bronchus, {{brachytherapy}} (localized radiotherapy) {{may be given}} directly inside the airway to open the passage.

Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. <b>External</b> <b>beam</b> radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E

The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust, causing problems with radiation protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Radiation therapy can be {{delivered}} by <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiotherapy, brachytherapy (internal radiotherapy), or by intra-operative radiotherapy (IORT). In the case of <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiotherapy, X-rays are delivered from outside the body by a machine called a Linear Accelerator or Linac. In contrast, brachytherapy involves the precise placement of radiation source(s) directly at the treatment site. IORT includes a one-time dose of radiation administered with breast surgery.

25|$|<b>External</b> <b>beam</b> {{radiation}} therapy uses a linear accelerator to produce high-energy x-rays that are directed in a beam towards the prostate. A technique called Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) {{may be used}} to adjust the radiation beam to conform with the shape of the tumor, allowing higher doses to be given to the prostate and seminal vesicles with less damage to the bladder and rectum. <b>External</b> <b>beam</b> {{radiation therapy}} is generally given over several weeks, with daily visits to a radiation therapy center. New types of radiation therapy such as IMRT have fewer side effects than traditional treatment. Eleven centers in the United States are now using proton therapy for prostate cancer, which uses protons rather than X-rays to kill the cancer cells. Researchers are also studying types of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Cherenkov {{light has}} been used to image {{substances}} in the body. These discoveries have led to intense interest around the idea of using this light signal to quantify and/or detect radiation in the body, either from internal sources such as injected radiopharmaceuticals or from <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiotherapy in oncology. Radioisotopes such as the Beta emitters 18-F and 13-N or positron emitters 32-P or 90-Y have measurable Cherenkov emission and isotopes 18-F and 131-I have been imaged in humans for diagnostic value demonstration. <b>External</b> <b>beam</b> radiation therapy has been shown to induce a substantial amount of Cherenkov light in the tissue being treated, due to the photon beam energy levels used in the 6 MV to 18 MV ranges. The secondary electrons induced by these high energy x-rays result in the Cherenkov light emission, where the detected signal can be imaged at the entry and exit surfaces of the tissue.|$|E

50|$|The fascia (<b>external)</b> <b>beams</b> of {{the main}} span {{exhibited}} longitudinal cracks in about 1957. The other girders exhibited no cracks. Through the years, {{the cracks in the}} fascia beams were repaired and monitored. However, in 1989, the Pennsylvania Depart of Transportation made the decision to replace the bridge superstructure. Because of the historical significance of the structure, the decision was controversial. However, the replacement structure (the new Walnut Lane Memorial Bridge) comprises prestressed concrete girders and is similar in appearance to the original. The new bridge was completed in 1990.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{international}} {{codes of}} practice based on absorbed dose to water standards have been published for the clinical reference dosimetry of <b>external</b> <b>beams</b> 1. It has become widely accepted that dosimetry of radiotherapeutic beams {{should be based on}} these standards. These {{codes of practice}} are a major improvement over earlier ones that used air kerma calibration factors as they are based on a calibration directly in a phantom in terms of the quantity of interest. The previous codes begin with calibration in air in terms of air kerma, then use theoretical and generic conversion factors to obtain dose to water that do not take account of chamber-to-chamber variation. Other good reasons for implementing the new codes are that they are conceptually simpler, include improved physical data and improve the consistency for various ionisation chamber types as well as between different beam types. TRS- 3982, 3 is a new Code of Practice (CoP) for reference dosimetry of <b>external</b> radiotherapy <b>beams</b> based on absorbed dose to water calibrations and was published by the IAEA in a joint effort with the WHO, PAHO and ESTRO. It is the first CoP of its kind comprehensively covering all <b>external</b> radiotherapy <b>beams</b> except neutrons.

25|$|For {{low-risk}} disease, {{radiation therapy}} (<b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiotherapy or brachytherapy), topical chemotherapy (imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil) and cryotherapy (freezing the cancer off) can provide adequate {{control of the}} disease; all of them, however, may have lower overall cure rates than certain type of surgery. Other modalities of treatment such as photodynamic therapy, topical chemotherapy, electrodesiccation and curettage {{can be found in}} the discussions of basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the three}} main {{divisions}} of radiation therapy are <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiation therapy (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate {{to the position of}} the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses sealed radioactive sources placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of radioactive sources. The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{prostate}} cancer may involve active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy including brachytherapy (prostate brachytherapy) and <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), cryosurgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or some combination. Which option is best depends {{on the stage of}} the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level. Other important factors are the man's age, his general health, and his feelings about potential treatments and their possible side effects. Because all treatments can have significant side effects, such as erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, treatment discussions often focus on balancing the goals of therapy with the risks of lifestyle alterations.|$|E

Giuliani chose a combination prostate cancer treatment consisting of four months of neoadjuvant Lupron hormonal therapy, then low dose-rate prostate brachytherapy with permanent implantation of ninety TheraSeed radioactive palladium-103 seeds in his prostate in September 2000, followed two months later by five weeks of fifteen-minute, five-days-a-week <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiotherapy at Mount Sinai Medical Center, with five months of adjuvant Lupron hormonal therapy.|$|E
25|$|In brachytherapy, {{radiation}} {{sources are}} precisely placed {{directly at the}} site of the cancerous tumour. This means that the irradiation only affects a very localized area – exposure to radiation of healthy tissues further away from the sources is reduced. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiation therapy – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localized radiation, whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues. A course of brachytherapy can often be completed in less time than other radiation therapy techniques. This can help reduce the chance of surviving cancer cells dividing and growing in the intervals between each radiation therapy dose.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cancer}} has spread beyond the prostate, {{treatment}} options significantly change, so most doctors that treat prostate cancer {{use a variety}} of nomograms to predict the probability of spread. Treatment by watchful waiting/active surveillance, HIFU, <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> radiation therapy, brachytherapy, cryosurgery, and surgery are, in general, offered to men whose cancer remains within the prostate. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are often reserved for disease that has spread beyond the prostate. However, there are exceptions: Radiation therapy may be used for some advanced tumors, and hormonal therapy is used for some early stage tumors. Cryotherapy (the process of freezing the tumor), hormonal therapy, and chemotherapy may also be offered if initial treatment fails and the cancer progresses.|$|E
