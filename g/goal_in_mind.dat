I think maybe we were a little too jaded and a little too dark, and I {{think that the}} lack of hope and faith that we put on this record made us a little less sparkly and light to people. But I think that it's all part of our evolution. We all went a bit too far.|$|E

Hancock did not feel the composition was a sellout however, describing that structurally, it was one of his strongest pieces due to its almost mathematical balance.|$|E

These underground shelters are {{the direct result of}} the Eden Project, a massive international undertaking in which hundreds of Arks, containing cryogenic pods, were sealed under the surface of the Earth in order to preserve enough of the human population to rebuild civilization after the asteroid collision. The Eden Project was far less successful than hoped, as Raine's Ark in particular was heavily damaged, with all of its other residents dead and equipment destroyed, and he wakes up alone with no specific <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b>|$|E

25|$|Shakuni also advises Duryodhana to seek Krishna's help. Duryodhana {{rushes to}} Dwarka {{only to find}} Krishna sleeping; he waits {{at the head of}} Krishna's bed when suddenly, Arjuna arrives with the same <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> Arjuna waits at the foot of Krishna's bed. When Krishna wakes up, both Duryodhana and Arjuna appeal for his alliance. Krishna offers a choice of himself, {{completely}} unarmed, or the entire Vrishini army. Duryodhana proclaims that because he arrived first, he should get first-pick. However, Krishna says that because he saw Arjuna first, and because Arjuna is younger, that Arjuna gets the first choice. Duryodhana becomes worried, but is overjoyed when Arjuna elects to reject Krishna's army in favor of Krishna alone. Joyously, Duryodhana returns to Hastinapur with the Vrishini army in-hand, only to be rebuked by Shakuni, who comments that Krishna is worth many armies by him.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, {{the bishops}} of Râmnic, {{witnessing}} two decades of Austrian domination {{and a number of}} Austro-Turkish confrontations in Oltenia, visibly acquired a national identity and a feeling of cultural, linguistic and religious cohesion with other Romanians. This helps explain why in their town more than in the national capital Bucharest, where Ottoman pressures and the financial interests of Phanariote Princes and dignitaries restricted such sentiments, printing activity in Romanian was done with the intention of aiding the popular masses, and why in spite of the difficulties involved, they strove to preserve traditional cultural and spiritual ties to areas inhabited by Romanians. With this <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> they took care to print the most needed religious texts in the best translations, to present and comment on them in careful prefaces, to promote notions of spiritual, religious, cultural and political unity and to enrich a literary Romanian language with a basis in liturgical use. Each of the ten bishops involved (as well as Galaction, after 1800) had his own particular merits shaped by the context within which he operated. While the writing of Anthim, defrocked and assassinated, were forbidden, those of Damaschin took on his literary and liturgical prestige. Chesarie, although only bishop for a short while, had original ideas on Romanian history, accounting for Iorga's appreciation.|$|E

Levels were designed with this <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> with just enough plot to give context to the player's actions. Liberties were thus taken with the plot, and critics noted there was little footage which could spoil the film for those who had not seen it. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin said [...] "if you didn't know anything about the story of The Return of the King, then the story of the game may be hard to follow, though you'll still get the gist of it."

500|$|Evolution in colloquial {{contexts}} {{can refer}} to any sort of progressive development or gradual improvement, and a process that results in greater quality or complexity. When misapplied to biological evolution this common meaning leads to frequent misunderstandings. For example, the idea of devolution ("backwards" [...] evolution) {{is a result of}} erroneously assuming that evolution is directional or has a specific <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> (cf. orthogenesis). In reality, the evolution of an organism has no [...] "objective" [...] and is only showing increasing ability of successive generations to survive and reproduce in its environment; and increased suitability is only defined in relation to this environment. Biologists do not consider any one species, such as humans, to be more highly evolved or advanced than another. Certain sources have been criticized for indicating otherwise due to a tendency to evaluate nonhuman organisms according to anthropocentric standards rather than more objective ones.|$|E
500|$|The {{project that}} became Not My Life was {{initiated}} by {{the executive director of}} the UNODC, Antonio Maria Costa, who wanted to commission a film that would [...] "bring the issue of modern slavery to the attention of public opinion, globally—especially the well-meaning, law-abiding and God-fearing people who do not believe something so horrible is happening in their own neighborhood." [...] With this <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind,</b> Costa approached Worldwide Documentaries, an East Bloomfield, New York-based organization that had produced two films with which he was familiar: The Cry of Reason, which documents internal resistance to South African apartheid by way of Beyers Naudé's story; and A Closer Walk, which is about the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Costa e-mailed Bilheimer, Director of Worldwide Documentaries, asking him to create the film he envisioned. Costa said that he choose Bilheimer because the director had developed a [...] "solid reputation [...] addressing difficult topics... combining artistic talent, a philosophical view about development and a humanitarian sentiment about what to do about the issues." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{decision}} to continue playing Test level rugby Campese writes that, [...] "In the end, my decision to play on was taken with one overriding <b>goal</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind.</b> I wanted to end my Test career on a high note.

[...] He further adds that, [...] "the prospect of playing 100 Tests had enormous appeal too… But, to be perfectly honest, the initial aim was just {{to get back in}} the starting side." [...] Campese was selected for the Australian team for the first eight Tests of their 1996 season, before being dropped following his 100th Test against Italy.

One of the prerequisites for performing on Chic-a-Go-Go stipulated that the trio would have to lip-sync their contribution to the program. This became a point of contention with drummer Heather Melowic, who refused to perform on the show. Despite Melowic's refusal {{to appear on the}} program, {{the other members of the}} band opted not to cancel their performance. In Melowics' stead the band hired a young girl dressed as a cavewoman to intermittently beat a snare drum with a plastic dinosaur bone in lieu of Melowic's percussive accompaniment.
