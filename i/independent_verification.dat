Theoretically, this should not happen, because nuclear fusion requires a huge activation energy to get it started. The effect was first reported by chemists Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons in 1989, but attempts to reproduce it over the ensuing months were mostly unsuccessful. Cold fusion research was discredited, and articles on the subject became difficult to publish. But according to the book, a scattering of scientists around the world continue to report positive results, with multiple, <b>independent</b> <b>verifications,</b> making the evidence difficult to deny.|$|R

Instead, supernatural explanations should be left {{a matter of personal}} belief outside the scope of science.

To alleviate any confusion on how to pronounce the names of other Japanese people, official Japanese documents require Japanese to write their names in both kana and kanji.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of plate {{vibration}} under complex and irregular internal support conditions. Such a problem has its widely spread industrial applications {{and has not been}} addressed in the literature yet, partially due to the numerical difficulties. A novel computational method, discrete singular convolution (DSC), is introduced for solving this problem. The DSC algorithm exhibits controllable accuracy for approximations and shows excellent flexibility in handling complex geometries, boundary conditions and internal support conditions. Convergence and comparison studies are carried out to check the validity and accuracy of the DSC method. Case studies are considered to the combination of a few different boundary conditions and irregular internal supports. The latter are generated by using an image processing algorithm. Completely <b>independent</b> <b>verifications</b> are conducted by using the established pb- 2 Ritz method, which is available for two relatively simpler support patterns. The morphology of the first few eigenmodes is found to be localized to largest support-free spatial regions. 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
