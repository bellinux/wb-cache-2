5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push Notification Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and authenticate unique identifiers (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and responds with the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request. If the authentication succeeds, the <b>data</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E

50|$|Digital {{broadcasting}} is {{very different}} from analog. The NTSC and PAL standards describe both transmission of the signal and how the electrical signal is converted into an image. In digital, there is a separation between the subject of how <b>data</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>transmitted</b> from tower <b>to</b> TV, and the subject of what content that data might contain.
