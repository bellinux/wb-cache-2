No razor was to touch the nazirite's head until the completion of the nazirite term. And the nazirite was not to go near a dead person, even a father, mother, brother, or sister. If a person died suddenly near a nazirite, the nazirite was to shave his or her head on the seventh day. On the eighth day, the nazirite was to bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest, who was to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. That same day, the nazirite was to reconsecrate his or her head, rededicate the nazirite term, and bring a lamb in its first year as a penalty offering. On the day that a nazirite completed his or her term, the nazirite was to be brought to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and present a male lamb in its first year for a burnt offering, a <b>ewe</b> <b>lamb</b> in its first year for a sin offering, a ram for an offering of well-being, a basket of unleavened cakes, unleavened wafers spread with oil, and meal offerings.

Both <b>ewes</b> and <b>ewe</b> <b>lambs</b> (20 per treatment group) were given either normal saline or 4 ?g GnRH or 200 IU hCG on Day 12 post-mating. Pre- and post-treatment plasma hormone concentrations were determined in seven pregnant animals per treatment group in samples collected 1 h before and 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48 and 72 h after treatment. Overall mean progesterone concentrations were higher (P < 0. 001) in ewes as compared with <b>ewe</b> <b>lambs</b> in saline-treated controls. GnRH or hCG treatment increased (P < 0. 001) mean plasma progesterone concentrations in both age groups, however, post-treatment concentrations were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher in ewes than in <b>ewe</b> <b>lambs.</b> Oestradiol concentrations were similar in the two control groups. In ewes, but not in <b>ewe</b> <b>lambs,</b> both GnRH and hCG treatments significantly (P < 0. 05) increased the mean oestradiol concentrations above pre-treatment levels. Moreover, post-treatment oestradiol concentrations in GnRH- and hCG-treated animals were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than those in the saline-treated controls. LH release in response to GnRH treatment was greater (P < 0. 05) in ewes than in <b>ewe</b> <b>lambs,</b> whereas FSH release in ewes was less (P < 0. 05) than that of <b>ewe</b> <b>lambs.</b> The effects of GnRH or hCG on conceptus growth and placentation was determined at slaughter on Day 25. In ewes, GnRH treatment increased (P < 0. 05) luteal weight, amniotic sac width and length, and crown-rump length compared with controls, but had no effect on these parameters in <b>ewe</b> <b>lambs.</b> In <b>ewes,</b> hCG treatment also enhanced (P < 0. 05) luteal weight, amniotic sac width and length, crown-rump length, embryo weight and number of placentomes as compared with controls.
