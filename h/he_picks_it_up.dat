5|$|In {{the world}} of Pokémon, boys and girls {{at the age of}} ten can get their {{official}} license to become Pokémon trainers, and Ash Ketchum of Pallet Town is about to receive his very first Pokémon from Professor Oak. On the morning of the day that he is supposed to get his first Pokémon, it is revealed that Ash has accidentally broken his alarm clock and oversleeps. When he wakes up, he runs in his pajamas to Professor Oak's laboratory where Ash runs into his rival and the Professor's grandson, Gary Oak. Gary proceeds to taunt Ash for arriving to the ceremony late and brags about having already received his first Pokémon. When Ash enters Professor Oak's lab to receive his Pokémon, he is told that all three starter Pokémon have already been taken. Ash pleads for any Pokémon and Oak replies that he still has one left. Ash does not care and receives the Pokémon, which {{turns out to be the}} electric-type Pokémon Pikachu. Ash thinks that it is cute, but it gives him an electric shock when <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to hug it. Oak gives Ash a Pokédex and six Poké Balls before he heads out on his journey to become the greatest Pokémon trainer of all time.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were {{inspired}} by Norman Mailer's 1980 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Executioner's Song, written about serial killer Gary Gilmore, and by Truman Capote's 1966 novel In Cold Blood; [...] "Executioner's Song" [...] was the track's working title. [...] Lead singer Bono had read both novels and {{wanted to try to}} write [...] "a story in the mind of a killer". Further reading of Flannery O'Connor and Raymond Carver caused him to try to understand [...] "the ordinary stock first and then the outsiders, the driftwood – those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream." [...] Bono described the lyrics as [...] "just a short story really, except I left out a few of the verses because I liked it as a sketch. It's just about a guy who gets an idea into his head. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> off a preacher on the radio or something and goes out...". He noted that, although 30 songs were in contention for inclusion on the album, he [...] "wanted a song with that sense of violence in it, especially before 'Mothers of the Disappeared'." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the music}} video, Bieber is {{attracted}} {{to a girl}} (Grace Marie Wilson) he sees every day washing clothes at the local laundromat. In the opening scenes, Bieber is wearing a green hooded sweatshirt, similar to the gray one he wore in the [...] "One Time" [...] video, along with a cranberry shirt. One day while he is waiting for his clothes and is tuning his guitar, she drops a scarf, and <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> In the laundromat scene Bieber is wearing a mixed purple, blue & orange plaid collared shirt, with a dark purple tee. The girl comes {{back the next day}} however he is not there. He then posts a sign beside the washer that he found her missing scarf. He leads the girl on a scavenger hunt for the scarf, posting signs with pictures of him on them around the town to encourage her to go on a date with him. He takes pictures of him in situations such as buying chocolate for her and the puppies scene, and others, with notes doting quips of what he would do for her. During the date and ending scenes Bieber has on a white striped collared shirt, with a dark cyan tee. She finally finds him {{at the end of the}} video, and they have their date.|$|E
60|$|Just then he hit {{something}} with his foot, and <b>it</b> rolled. <b>He</b> <b>picked</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> {{and then put}} it down again. It was a nut, a plump hickory nut.

6000|$|... [A flower {{has fallen}} from her breast, whether by chance or meaning, he knows not. <b>He</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and kisses it; stands twirling it, {{undecided}} for a second, then lets it fall again upon the floor.] ...|$|E

6000|$|It will be said immediately, {{and must}} as {{promptly}} be admitted, {{that we could}} find a biographical significance {{in any of these}} theories if we looked for it. But it is, indeed, the sin and snare of biographers that they tend to see significance in everything; characteristic carelessness if their hero drops his pipe, and characteristic carefulness if <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> again. It is true, assuredly, that all the three races above named could be connected with Browning's personality. If we believed, for instance, that he really came of a race of mediæval barons, we should say at once that from them he got his pre-eminent spirit of battle: we should be right, for every line in his stubborn soul and his erect body did really express the fighter; he was always contending, whether it was with a German theory about the Gnostics, or with a stranger who elbowed his wife in a crowd. Again, if we had decided that he was a Jew, we should point out how absorbed he was in the terrible simplicity of monotheism: we should be right, for he was so absorbed. Or again, in the case even of the negro fancy; it would not be difficult for us to suggest a love of colour, a certain mental gaudiness, a pleasure ...|$|E
60|$|If the bashful young gentleman, {{in turning}} a street corner, chance to stumble {{suddenly}} upon {{two or three}} young ladies of his acquaintance, nothing can exceed his confusion and agitation. His first impulse {{is to make a}} great variety of bows, and dart past them, which he does until, observing that they wish to stop, but are uncertain whether to do so or not, he makes several feints of returning, which causes them to do the same; and at length, after a great quantity of unnecessary dodging and falling up against the other passengers, he returns and shakes hands most affectionately with all of them, in doing which he knocks out of their grasp sundry little parcels, which he hastily picks up, and returns very muddy and disordered. The chances are that the bashful young gentleman then observes it is very fine weather, and being reminded that it has only just left off raining for the first time these three days, he blushes very much, and smiles as if he had said a very good thing. The young lady who was most anxious to speak, here inquires, with an air of great commiseration, how his dear sister Harriet is to-day; to which the young gentleman, without the slightest consideration, replies with many thanks, that she is remarkably well. 'Well, Mr. Hopkins!' cries the young lady, 'why, we heard she was bled yesterday evening, and have been perfectly miserable about her.' 'Oh, ah,' says the young gentleman, 'so she was. Oh, she's very ill, very ill indeed.' The young gentleman then shakes his head, and looks very desponding (he has been smiling perpetually up to this time), and after a short pause, gives his glove a great wrench at the wrist, and says, with a strong emphasis on the adjective, 'GOOD morning, GOOD morning.' And making a great number of bows in acknowledgment of several little messages to his sister, walks backward a few paces, and comes with great violence against a lamp-post, knocking his hat off in the contact, which in his mental confusion and bodily pain he is going to walk away without, until a great roar from a carter attracts his attention, when <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> and tries to smile cheerfully to the young ladies, who are looking back, and who, he has the satisfaction of seeing, are all laughing heartily.|$|E
6000|$|Mentioning Mr. Baffle {{gives an}} {{instance}} of there being good in persons where good is not expected, for it cannot be denied that Mr. Buffle's manners when engaged in his business were not agreeable. To collect is one thing, and to look about as if suspicious of the goods being gradually removing {{in the dead of}} the night by a back door is another, over taxing you have no control but suspecting is voluntary. Allowances too must ever be made for a gentleman of the Major's warmth not relishing being spoke to with a pen in the mouth, and while I do not know that it is more irritable to my own feelings to have a low-crowned hat with a broad brim kept on in doors than any other hat still I can appreciate the Major's, besides which without bearing malice or vengeance the Major is a man that scores up arrears as his habit always was with Joshua Lirriper. So at last my dear the Major lay in wait for Mr. Buffle, and it worrited me a good deal. Mr. Buffle gives his rap of two sharp knocks one day and the Major bounces to the door. [...] "Collector has called for two quarters' Assessed Taxes" [...] says Mr. Buffle. [...] "They are ready for him" [...] says the Major and brings him in here. But on the way Mr. Buffle looks about him in his usual suspicious manner and the Major fires and asks him [...] "Do you see a Ghost sir?" [...] "No sir" [...] says Mr. Buffle. [...] "Because I have before noticed you" [...] says the Major [...] "apparently looking for a spectre very hard beneath the roof of my respected friend. When you find that supernatural agent, be so good as point him out sir." [...] Mr. Buffle stares at the Major and then nods at me. [...] "Mrs. Lirriper sir" [...] says the Major going off into a perfect steam and introducing me with his hand. [...] "Pleasure of knowing her" [...] says Mr. Buffle. [...] "A--hum!--Jemmy Jackman sir!" [...] says the Major introducing himself. [...] "Honour of knowing you by sight" [...] says Mr. Buffle. [...] "Jemmy Jackman sir" [...] says the Major wagging his head sideways in a sort of obstinate fury [...] "presents to you his esteemed friend that lady Mrs. Emma Lirriper of Eighty-one Norfolk Street Strand London in the County of Middlesex in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Upon which occasion sir," [...] says the Major, [...] "Jemmy Jackman takes your hat off." [...] Mr. Buffle looks at his hat where the Major drops it on the floor, and <b>he</b> <b>picks</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and puts it on again. [...] "Sir" [...] says the Major very red and looking him full in the face [...] "there are two quarters of the Gallantry Taxes due and the Collector has called." [...] Upon which if you can believe my words my dear the Major drops Mr. Buffle's hat off again. [...] "This--" [...] Mr. Buffle begins very angry with his pen in his mouth, when the Major steaming more and more says [...] "Take your bit out sir! Or by the whole infernal system of Taxation of this country and every individual figure in the National Debt, I'll get upon your back and ride you like a horse!" [...] which it's my belief he would have done and even actually jerking his neat little legs ready for a spring as it was. [...] "This," [...] says Mr. Buffle without his pen [...] "is an assault and I'll have the law of you." [...] "Sir" [...] replies the Major [...] "if you are a man of honour, your Collector of whatever may be due on the Honourable Assessment by applying to Major Jackman at the Parlours Mrs. Lirriper's Lodgings, may obtain what he wants in full at any moment." ...|$|E
