50|$|The Model 14's design {{incorporated}} several innovative concepts. Among {{them was}} a spiral magazine tube to prevent bullet tips from contacting the primer of the cartridge in front of them. This magazine moved with the fore-end when pumping the action. Loading was through {{an opening in the}} magazine itself located between the fore-end and the receiver. The bolt unlocked via a button pressed through the ejection port though firing the gun automatically unlocked the bolt. The Model 14 was a takedown rifle that featured a single <b>knurled</b> <b>screw</b> {{on the left side of}} the receiver that was withdrawn allowing the trigger group and buttstock to be removed from the bottom of the gun.|$|E
30|$|The {{saw blade}} has a {{thickness}} of 280  μm and a feed of 310  μm {{was selected to}} obtain the final section thickness of 30  μm. The <b>knurled</b> <b>screw</b> {{was used for the}} setting of the section thickness. The prepared section was finally removed from the saw blade. The specimens were prepared for histology by the method as described by Donath and Breuner [49].|$|E
40|$|A CHUCK is a {{means of}} {{connecting}} a catheter to a syringe to facilitate repeated injections (Hender-son, 1950). Great care must be taken that the catheter and internal mechanism of the chuck do not become contaminated—particularly when the spinal and extradural spaces are involved—and this chuck has been designed with this object in mind. The sterile catheter is threaded through the nozzle (with <b>knurled</b> <b>screw)</b> A, and the rubber sleeve B. Rotation of the nozzle now compresses the rubber sleeve, thus attaching the chuck firmly to the catheter as shown in the illustration. The free end of the chuck has a female Luer taper C to receive the nozzle of the syringe. When the injection is completed, the syringe is detached and the proximal end of the chuck is protected against sepsis by screwing on the sealing cap D. As an additional precaution, cap D is then com-pletely enclosed by an outer cap E, which also screws on to the chuck. When a further injection has to be given, th...|$|E
50|$|<b>Knurl</b> point <b>screws</b> are {{generally}} used to secure one object within another. The serrated ridge on the <b>knurl</b> cup set <b>screw</b> helps reduce loosening due to vibration. The knurled point combines digging {{action of the}} cup point with counter-clockwise locking knurls that have a ratchet-locking action which helps resist loosening, even under the most severe vibrations.|$|R
5000|$|Until its dend, Isopress {{produced}} {{a wide range}} of thermoplastic and thermoset components. In particular, components for railway technology (switch controllers, [...] "chimney" [...] lightning arrestors for the SBB-CFF-FFS Re 460 (for the company Société Anonyme of the Atelier de Sécheron), loudspeaker covers for S-Bahn wagons) as well as lift buttons, filters for medical technology, electrical components for the Schurter Holding (e.g. EMF switches) and <b>knurled</b> <b>screws</b> etc. The Isopress trained its own apprentices as plastic technologists, it also enabled plastic technologists apprentices of Lego Produktion AG Switzerland to study the second subject of thermosetting processing and to complete the occupational test in this field at the Isopress AG. In 2001, Isopress entered into a collaboration with Lanker AG in Oberriet. In 2015, Isopress AG was dissolved and integrated into Lanker AG.|$|R
5000|$|Military Reisings {{are usually}} parkerized. They often have an {{adjustable}} front sight with an Allen screw and a rear sight with a retaining screw. They routinely have 14 fins on the barrel, a two piece magazine release, outward flanges on the safety/selector switch, sling swivels, stock ties (crossbolts through the forearm), and a <b>knurled</b> take-down <b>screw.</b> Finally, the military model commonly has a three-hole trigger guard, proofmarks like [...] "PH" [...] or [...] "Pm2" [...] above the chamber, and serial numbers ranging from 20,000 to 120,000.|$|R
40|$|The minimum {{resistance}} of expiratory Heidbrink-type valves has been assessed by determining the pressure decrease across the valves at a flow rate of 30 litre min" 1. The average resistance of 70 valves currently in clinical use was 318 Pa at that flow rate and about 44 % had resistances {{greater than the}} limit of 294 Pa previously suggested. The resistances obtained in new valves were either similar or fractionally greater. Valves being introduced as parts of scavenging systems appeared, on the whole, to have lower resistances. One-way valves of the Heidbrink pattern are used frequently in semi-closed anaesthetic circuits, in circle systems and in the "manual " circuits attached to ventilators. Proportional adjustment of the spring resistance allows the elimination of gas to be con-trolled by the anaesthetist; low settings are recom-mended for spontaneous breathing and higher set-tings are needed for intermittent positive pressure ventilation. Whilst the detailed construction varies with each manufacturer, the design consists essentially of a circular disc resting on the valve seating against which it is held by a closely coiled helical spring. A pin fixed to the disc runs in a guide. The <b>knurled</b> <b>screw</b> allows the pressure applied by the spring to be varied (fig. 1). The work of breathing in anaesthetic circuits has been reduced considerably {{by the use of}} large-bore tubing, by decreasing the number of bends and by using valves of low resistance (Cooper, 1961). The main source of resistance lies with the expiratory valve. Mushin and Mapleson (1954) described the properties of such valves and showed marked differ-ences between six of the Heidbrink type. Sykes (1959) and Mehta and his colleagues (1977) found also variations in the resistances of valves in clinical use. We report here a study of a number of expiratory valves in clinical use, of some newly delivered from the manufacturers and of some new types. Part of this work has been presented at the Royal Society o...|$|E
