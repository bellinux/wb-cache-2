40|$|Fleshy <b>fruit</b> is {{consumed}} by many wildlife species {{and is a}} critical component of forest ecosystems. Because <b>fruit</b> production may change quickly during forest succession, frequent monitoring of <b>fruit</b> biomass may be needed to better understand shifts in wildlife habitat quality. Yet, designing a <b>fruit</b> sampling protocol that is executable on a frequent basis may be difficult, and knowledge of accuracy within monitoring protocols is lacking. We evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of 3 methods to estimate understory <b>fruit</b> biomass (<b>Fruit</b> Count, Stem Density, and Plant Coverage). The <b>Fruit</b> Count method requires visual counts of <b>fruit</b> to estimate <b>fruit</b> biomass. The Stem Density method uses counts of all stems of <b>fruit</b> producing species to estimate <b>fruit</b> biomass. The Plant Coverage method uses land coverage of <b>fruit</b> producing species to estimate <b>fruit</b> biomass. Using linear regression models under a censored-normal distribution, we determined the <b>Fruit</b> Count and Stem Density methods could accurately estimate <b>fruit</b> biomass; however, when comparing AIC values between models, the <b>Fruit</b> Count method was the superior method for estimating <b>fruit</b> biomass. After determining that <b>Fruit</b> Count was the superior method to accurately estimate <b>fruit</b> biomass, we conducted additional analyses to determine the sampling intensity (i. e., percentage of area) necessary to accurately estimate <b>fruit</b> biomass. The <b>Fruit</b> Count method accurately estimated <b>fruit</b> biomass at a 0. 8 % sampling intensity. In some cases, sampling 0. 8 % of an area may not be feasible. In these cases, we suggest sampling understory <b>fruit</b> production with the <b>Fruit</b> Count method at the greatest feasible sampling intensity, which could be valuable to assess annual fluctuations in <b>fruit</b> production...|$|R

40|$|Control of {{individual}} tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) <b>fruit</b> weight during a crop cycle is of commercial benefit to improve marketable yield. To assess the main causes of variability in tomato <b>fruit</b> size, plant spacing and <b>fruit</b> thinning effects on <b>fruit</b> yield and individual <b>fruit</b> weight down the truss was examined. Three fresh market tomato cultivars, Alboran (Standard), Ophir (Beefsteak) and Cherita (Cherry) were grown, in New Zealand during {{winter and spring}} months of 2001, in a greenhouse with NFT at three plant densities (2. 76, 3. 67 and 4. 59 plant per m 2). Each tomato cultivar was <b>fruit</b> thinned to three different levels (3, 4 and 5 <b>fruit</b> per truss for Alboran; 1, 2 and 3 <b>fruit</b> per truss for Ophir; 4, 8 and 12 <b>fruit</b> per truss for Cherita). Total <b>fruit</b> weight and <b>fruit</b> number were taken at each harvest for all treatments. At the low density (2. 76 plants per m 2) individual <b>fruit</b> weights within each truss were taken for all <b>fruit</b> thinning treatments. A total soluble solid measurement was also taken during an August harvest. Alboran showed a significantly higher final <b>fruit</b> yield per surface area than Ophir and Cherita cultivars, indicating why Alboran is a standard cultivar. No difference in <b>fruit</b> yield or <b>fruit</b> number surface area was observed with both Alboran and Ophir cultivars as plant density increased. This {{was the result of}} flower and / or <b>fruit</b> abortion at the higher densities, due to low solar radiation levels observed under winter and spring conditions in this study. Cherita, although not significant, showed a trend of increasing <b>fruit</b> yield per surface area as plant density increased. The low solar radiation levels did not have as larger effect on flower and / or <b>fruit</b> abortion in Cherita. It had a lower <b>fruit</b> (sink) load and was able to support more <b>fruit</b> development with the low levels of photosynthetic assimilate produced under the low solar radiation levels. Larger mean <b>fruit</b> weights, in all three cultivars, were observed with more <b>fruit</b> thinning due to increased photosynthetic assimilate being available to the remaining <b>fruit.</b> No difference in <b>fruit</b> yield per surface area was observed with both Alboran or Ophir cultivars as more <b>fruit</b> were left on the truss, which was due to the smaller mean <b>fruit</b> weight and a greater proportion of flower and / or <b>fruit</b> abortion caused by the high <b>fruit</b> load with low solar radiation levels. However thinning Cherita to 4 <b>fruit</b> per truss did produce significantly lower yields per surface area compared with 8 and 12 <b>fruit</b> per truss. Individual <b>fruit</b> weight down the truss, of all three cultivars, reduced in size by a constant factor or slope. A slope of - 13 g / <b>fruit</b> position was observed for Alboran, which was flatter than that of Ophir (- 17 g / <b>fruit</b> position) and steeper than that of Cherita (- 0. 15 to - 0. 60 g / <b>fruit</b> position). The number of <b>fruit</b> on the truss did not affect the slope of Alboran and Ophir cultivars, while thinning Cherita to 4 <b>fruit</b> per truss produced a significantly steeper slope (- 0. 60 g / <b>fruit</b> position) than 8 and 12 <b>fruit</b> per truss (0. 25 g / <b>fruit</b> position). More <b>fruit</b> present on a truss produced smaller proximal (first) <b>fruit,</b> thus reducing the size of the remaining <b>fruit</b> on the truss proportionately. Individual trusses within Cherita were also shown to have a constant slope of <b>fruit</b> size down the truss. These results suggest that plant density and <b>fruit</b> thinning can be used to produce more <b>fruit</b> within the desired marketable <b>fruit</b> size range all year round. However a greater understanding of plant density and <b>fruit</b> thinning interactions during different growing seasons must first be achieved...|$|R

40|$|Regulated deficit {{irrigation}} (RDI) {{was applied}} on field-grown pear-jujube trees in 2005 and 2006 {{and its effects}} on crop water-consumption, yield and <b>fruit</b> quality were investigated. Treatments included severe, moderate and low water deficit treatments at bud burst to leafing, flowering to <b>fruit</b> set, <b>fruit</b> growth and <b>fruit</b> maturation stages. Different deficit irrigation levels at different growth stages had significant effects on the <b>fruit</b> yield and quality. Moderate and severe water deficits at bud burst to leafing and <b>fruit</b> maturation stages increased <b>fruit</b> yield by 13. 2 - 31. 9 % and 9. 7 - 17. 5 %, respectively. <b>Fruit</b> yield under low water deficit at <b>fruit</b> growth and <b>fruit</b> maturation stages was similar to that of full irrigation (FI) treatment. All water deficit treatments reduced water consumption by 5 - 18 % and saved irrigation water by 13 - 25 % when compared to the FI treatment. During the bud burst to leafing stage, moderate and severe water deficits did not have effect on the <b>fruit</b> quality, but significantly saved irrigation water and increased <b>fruit</b> yield. Low water deficit during the <b>fruit</b> growth stage and low, moderate and severe water deficits during the <b>fruit</b> maturation stage had no significant effect on the <b>fruit</b> weight and <b>fruit</b> volume but reduced <b>fruit</b> water content slightly, which led to much reduced rotten <b>fruit</b> percentage during the post-harvest storage period. Such water deficit treatments also shortened the <b>fruit</b> maturation period by 10 - 15 d and raised the market price of the <b>fruit.</b> <b>Fruit</b> quality shown as <b>fruit</b> firmness, soluble solid content, sugar/acid ratio and vitamin C (VC) content were all enhanced as a result of deficit irrigation.
