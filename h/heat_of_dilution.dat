The differential <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution</b> is viewed on a micro scale, which {{is associated with the}} process in which a small amount of concentrated solution is added to the mass dilute solution. The molar differential <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution</b> is thus defined as the enthalpy change caused by adding a mole of a concentrated solution at a constant temperature and pressure. Because of the small amount of addition, the concentration of dilute solution remains unchanged. Mathematically, the molar differential <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution</b> is denoted as: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{integral}} <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution,</b> however, {{is viewed}} on a macro scale. With {{respect to the}} integral heat, we consider {{a process in which}} a certain amount of solution diluted from an initial concentration to a final concentration. The enthalpy change in this process, normalized by the mole number of solute, is evaluated as the molar integral <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution.</b> Mathematically, the molar integral <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution</b> is denoted as: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution,</b> or {{enthalpy}} of dilution, {{refers to}} the enthalpy change associated with the dilution process of a component in a solution at a constant pressure. If the initial state of the component is a pure liquid (presuming the solution is liquid), the dilution process is equal to its dissolution process and the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution</b> {{is the same as}} the heat of solution. Generally, the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution</b> is normalized by the mole number of the solution and its dimension is energy per unit mass, commonly expressed in the unit of kJ/mol (or J/mol).|$|E

50|$|However, if the solute and solvent {{cannot be}} treated identically when {{considered}} {{in terms of}} molecular attraction, which makes the solution non-ideal, the net change of enthalpy is nonzero.

50|$|An {{excellent}} {{application is}} the sequential determination of calcium and magnesium. Although calcium reacts exothermically with EDTA (heat of chelation ~-23.4 kJ/mol), magnesium reacts endothermically with a heat of chelation of ~+20.1 kJ/mol. This {{is illustrated in}} the titration plot of EDTA with calcium and magnesium in sea water (Figure 18). Following the solution temperature curve, the breakpoint for the calcium content (red-tagged endpoint) {{is followed by a}} region of modest temperature rise due to competition between the heats of dilution of the titrant with the solution, and the endothermic reaction of Mg2+ and EDTA. The breakpoint for the consumption of Mg2+ (blue-tagged endpoint) by EDTA is revealed by upswing in temperature caused purely by the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>dilution.</b>|$|E

The concentration gradient was obtained by inserting a flask containing solvent in the detergent pump path followed by a flask containing the detergent solution at a concentration about ten times its critical micelle concentration (cmc). When the dilution in the calorimeter chamber is done with water and the resulting solution is above the cmc of the given detergent, the heat detected arises from the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> demicellization and the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> micellar <b>dilution.</b> On the other hand, when the dilution is done with a solution just above the cmc, the heat detected would only correspond to the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> micellar <b>dilution.</b> The standard enthalpies of micellization (ΔHm°) obtained in this manner are discussed in terms of hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions. The ΔHm° values and the standard free energies of micellization obtained from the cmcs were used to calculate the standard entropies of micellization (ΔSm°). A linear trend between ΔSm° and ΔHm° was obtained which was interpreted in terms of dehydration of ions when they are transfered from the water to the micellar phase. It is concluded that the binding of small ions to micelles would be promoted mainly by entropic factors.
