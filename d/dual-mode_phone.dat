2500|$|The WRT54G-TM (TM {{stands for}} T-Mobile) is {{also called the}} T-Mobile [...] "Hotspot@Home" [...] service. [...] It allows calls to be made via T-Mobile's GSM network or via Wi-Fi Unlicensed Mobile Access (UMA), using the same {{telephone}} and phone number (a special <b>dual-mode</b> <b>phone</b> designed for the service is required e.g. Blackberry Pearl 8120). Additionally, once a call is in progress, one may transition from Wi-Fi to GSM (and vice versa) seamlessly, as Wi-Fi signal comes and goes, such as when entering or exiting a home or business. A special router is not needed to use the service, but the T-Mobile branded routers are supposed to enhance the telephone's battery life. This is the only known tweak to the TM version of the firmware. The hardware appears {{similar to that of}} the WRT54GL, except it has 32MB RAM and 8MB flash memory.|$|E

50|$|A <b>dual-mode</b> <b>phone</b> is a {{telephone}} which uses {{more than one}} technique for sending and receiving voice and data. This could be for wireless mobile phones or for wired phones.|$|E
50|$|Most {{dual mode}} {{handsets}} require two identifying cards (one SIM and one RUIM), though some recent <b>dual-mode</b> <b>phones</b> (for example, the iPhone 4S) only require one SIM and one ESN. Not all dual SIM handsets are dual mode (for example dual SIM GSM phones).|$|R
50|$|VoIP {{devices have}} simple, {{intuitive}} user interfaces, so users can often make simple system configuration changes. <b>Dual-mode</b> <b>phones</b> enable users {{to continue their}} conversations as they move between an outside cellular service and an internal Wi-Fi network, {{so that it is}} no longer necessary to carry both a desktop phone and a cell phone. Maintenance becomes simpler as there are fewer devices to oversee.|$|R
50|$|The Sony Ericsson K810i Cyber-shot is a <b>dual-mode</b> UMTS <b>phone</b> with a 3.2 Megapixel {{camera with}} {{autofocus}} and 16x digital zoom. It has {{the full range}} of mobile entertainment and business features including video telephony, Memory Stick Micro removable storage (up to 8 GB available), picture blogging, full HTML browser, RSS feed support, and music and video players.|$|R
50|$|Some vendors {{use this}} term {{to mean that}} all {{features}} are available through a uniform user interface in both cellular and Wi-Fi networks. This means that the user should {{not be able to}} perceive which network is carrying their session on a <b>dual-mode</b> <b>phone.</b>|$|E
50|$|Three main {{categories}} of wireless extensions to PBXs exist: those that work over Wi-Fi (VoWLAN, or VoWi-Fi), those that use public mobile networks like 3G, {{and those that}} use other radio technologies like DECT. Client software can make a dual-mode smartphone act as a Wi-Fi extension to the PBX. This gives the handset a split personality: a regular cell phone and a VoIP PBX extension, each having its own phone number. These two personalities can be well integrated, fully separate or something in between. Session redirection as described above moves the call between devices; with a <b>dual-mode</b> <b>phone,</b> session redirection can occur between the two networks, keeping the call on the same handset.|$|E

50|$|The REX Operating System (Real-Time Executive Operating System) is an RTOS {{developed}} by Qualcomm for the ARM-based mobile <b>phone</b> <b>Dual-Mode</b> Subscriber Station (DMSS) or Advanced Mode Subscriber Software (AMSS) development. As of 2007 most Korean cell phones run on REX.|$|R
50|$|UMA is the {{commercial}} {{name for the}} global 3GPP Generic Access Network (GAN) standard for fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). UMA enables secure, scalable access to mobile voice, data and IMS services over broadband IP access networks. By deploying UMA, mobile operators can deliver a number of compelling FMC services. The most well-known applications of UMA include <b>dual-mode</b> Wi-Fi/cellular <b>phones.</b> Leading operators {{around the world have}} embraced UMA as the foundation for their FMC strategies, including France Telecom/Orange, T-Mobile (USA), Rogers Wireless, TeliaSonera and Cincinnati Bell.|$|R
50|$|GAN/UMA is not {{the first}} system to allow the use of {{unlicensed}} spectrum to connect handsets to a GSM network. The GIP/IWP standard for DECT provides similar functionality, but requires a more direct connection to the GSM network from the base station. While <b>dual-mode</b> DECT/GSM <b>phones</b> have appeared, these have generally been functionally cordless phones with a GSM handset built-in (or vice versa, depending on your point of view), rather than phones implementing DECT/GIP, {{due to the lack of}} suitable infrastructure to hook DECT base-stations supporting GIP to GSM networks on an ad-hoc basis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{discussion}} of a communication system will not be complete without the explanation of a system example. A dual-mode cellular phone as specified by the IS-54 standard is explained. A <b>dual-mode</b> <b>phone</b> is capable of operating in an analog-only cell or a dual-mode cell. Both the transmitter and the receiver support both analog FM and digital time division multiple access (TDMA) schemes. Digital transmission is preferred, so when a cellular system has digital capability, the mobile unit is assigned a digital channel first. If no digital channels are available, the cellular system will assign an analog channel. The transmitter converts the audio signal to a radio frequency (RF), and the receiver converts an RF signal to an audio signal. The antenna focuses and converts RF energy for reception and transmission into free space. The control panel serves as an input/output mechanism for the end user; it supports a keypad, a display, a microphone, and a speaker. The coordinator synchronizes the transmission and receives functions of the mobile unit.A dual-mode cellular phone consists of the following: ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} mobile {{distributed}} computing platform, WIPdroid, for distributed services computing in mobile environment with real-time communication capabilities. It {{is based on}} WIP, Web Services Session Initiation Protocol, for real-time service-oriented communication over IP. It integrates the emerging mobile endpoint platform, Android, from Google’s initiative of Open Handset Alliance (OHA). The WIP component of WIPdroid supports web services based communication over IP. But most importantly, it transforms WIPdroid into a mobile SOA web services endpoint. Applications developed on WIPdroid can be exposed and enabled by two-way web services. This makes WIPdroid well suited for distributed computing and SOA based applications, such as communication enabled business process (CEBP) and software-as-a-service (SaaS). It also leads to {{a new type of}} <b>dual-mode</b> <b>phone,</b> with one communication mode from the binding with the physical mobile environment, e. g. GSM, CDMA, 3 G, etc., and one fully web services enabled, service-oriented communication over IP mode from WIP. A prototype WIPdroid mobile computing platform is developed and tested. In order to support advance web services capabilities on mobile endpoints,, we developed an endpoint-edition of two-way web services application proxy (2 SAP) which has a small memory footprint (2 ~ 3 MB) and can be hosted on a mobile endpoint/handset, e. g. smart phone and PDA. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — An Embedded novel combo planar inverted-F antenna {{with high}} {{isolation}} for <b>dual-mode</b> mobile <b>phone</b> application is proposed. Two PIFAs are designed in this antenna. One is for GSM 900 /DCS 1800 /PCS 1900 triple-band {{and the other}} is for WLAN applications. Both of PIFAs are mounted on the same ground plane. For the purpose to enhance isolation of two PIFAS, we add a high-pass filter by using a pi-type lump matching circuit. By the way, the speaker effect is also considered in this antenna design. The obtained bandwidth of the proposed tri-band antenna can cover the EGSM （ 880 ~ 960 MHz ）, DCS （ 1710 ~ 1880 MHz ） and PCS (1850 ~ 1990 MHz) bands. The Isolation between two antennas could be better than – 20 dB...|$|R
5000|$|Lexus Link, {{launched}} October, 2000, is a subscription-based {{safety and}} security service from Lexus. It has been offered as a factory-installed option, available on certain Lexus models (LX, GX, LS, and GS), offering call-center-based telematics services to owners with equipped vehicles in the United States and Canada. The second-generation Lexus Link system utilizes a dedicated cellular <b>phone</b> (<b>dual-mode</b> CDMA/analog), Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) technology and 24-hour live-operator support. In 2009, an expanded system with added functionality, [...] Lexus Enform with Safety Connect, succeeded Lexus Link.|$|R
5000|$|ACeS {{has been}} {{assigned}} the virtual country code +88220, an international networks code rather than a GMSS code as the system does not operate globally. The company currently supplies only one handset type, the Ericsson R190, which derived many components from GH688 model. R190 is a <b>dual-mode</b> Satellite/GSM <b>phone</b> which automatically switches to satellite mode when terrestrial GSM network is not available. It accepts standard GSM SIM cards, and since ACeS has international roaming agreements with many GSM networks worldwide, the phone {{can be used in}} virtually any country. The handset supports most standard services such as call forward and call waiting but does not support short message service (SMS) in satellite mode. The demise of Ericsson mobile phone business in 2001 has left ACeS with no other handset available to offer to its customers [...] As Ericsson left the mobile phone business, production of the R190 was then continued by ACeS and rebranded to be the ACeS R190. Additionally ACeS has developed a land phone version, the ACeS FR-190, that allowed many villages and rural areas throughout Asia access to basic telephony services.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In densely {{populated}} cities, Wi-Fi networks—private or otherwise—are ubiquitous. We {{focus on the}} provision of citywide broadband communication capability to mobile users through private Wi-Fi networks that are in range but belong to others. We form a club that relies on indirect reciprocity: Members participate in the club and provide free Wi-Fi access to other members in order to enjoy the same benefit when they are away from their own Wi-Fi network. Our club scheme does not require registration with an authority and does not rely on centrally issued club identities: Members create their own identities (public-private key pairs) and receive signed digital receipts when they provide Wi-Fi service to other members. These receipts form a distributed receipt graph, parts of which are used as input to an indirect reciprocity algorithm that classifies club members according to their contribution. We show that our algorithm can sustain cooperation within the club and is robust to attacks by free-riders. We implement and evaluate our proposed club algorithms on commodity Wi-Fi routers and <b>dual-mode</b> cellular/Wi-Fi <b>phones.</b> Because we anticipate that Wi-Fi telephony will be a popular club application, we present and evaluate a secure and decentralized architecture for citywide voice (and multimedia) communications that is compatible with our club both from an architectural {{as well as an}} incentives perspective...|$|R
