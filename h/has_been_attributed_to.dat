5|$|Minnesotans {{participate}} in {{high levels of}} physical activity, {{and many of these}} activities are outdoors. The strong interest of Minnesotans in environmentalism <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the popularity of these pursuits.|$|E
5|$|Out of all dog breeds {{it is the}} Labrador Retriever that is {{most likely}} to obese. This obesity <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> a {{specific}} gene mutation. See the Obesity sub section below.|$|E
5|$|No {{version of}} the game has been {{released}} outside Japan. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> Nintendo's policy of censoring religious references in games, which rendered the early Megami Tensei titles unsuitable for localization due to their central religious elements. A fan translation of Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei was released on August 28, 2014.|$|E
50|$|Maya {{graffiti}} {{are usually}} difficult <b>to</b> date. Many <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the Late Classic (c.

Some graffiti <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> squatters in the Postclassic period (c. 950-1539).|$|R

5|$|The {{first case}} {{description}} of pituitary apoplexy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the American neurologist Pearce Bailey in 1898. This was followed in 1905 by a further {{report from the}} German physician Bleibtreu. Surgery for pituitary apoplexy was described in 1925. Before the introduction of steroid replacement, the mortality from pituitary apoplexy approximated 50%.|$|E
5|$|Ants have colonised {{almost every}} landmass on Earth. The only places lacking {{indigenous}} ants are Antarctica {{and a few}} remote or inhospitable islands. Ants thrive in most ecosystems and may form 15–25% of the terrestrial animal biomass. Their success in so many environments <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> their social organisation {{and their ability to}} modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves. Their long co-evolution with other species has led to mimetic, commensal, parasitic, and mutualistic relationships.|$|E

5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{a modern}} version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure, but its invention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> one Paddy Brennan, a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal, who, being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Clan badge: There {{have been}} two clan badges (or plant badges) {{attributed}} to Clan MacAulay: cranberry and scots pine. Both clans MacAulay and MacFarlane have been attributed with a badge of cranberry. Clan MacFarlane, also a west-Dumbartonshire clan, claims a descent from Alwyn II, Earl of Lennox. The badge of scots pine <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> all seven clans of Siol Alpin: Clan Grant, Clan Gregor, Clan MacAulay, Clan Macfie, Clan Mackinnon, Clan Macnab, and Clan MacQuarrie.|$|E
5|$|Dummer {{purchased}} the South Stoneham estate, comprising approximately , for {{the sum of}} £3,400. The house was constructed in 1708 as Dummer's family home, and its design <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> Nicholas Hawksmoor. The actual construction {{was carried out by}} Dummer's uncle, Thomas Dummer of London. Edmond Dummer was from nearby North Stoneham and had been baptised in St. Nicolas' Church there. The grounds of the house comprised 110 acres, with 5 acres of water.|$|E

5|$|Glass Joe is a 38-year-old French {{flyweight}} boxer who {{hails from}} Paris. He stands at 177.8 centimeters (5'10) and weighs in at 49.9 kilograms (110 lbs.). His win record is one win to 99 losses. He is the weakest opponent {{and the first}} players encounter in any of his roles. His mediocrity <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> poor blocking and reaction time. He possesses several negative stereotypes of French people.|$|E
5|$|McNeile {{interspersed}} his Drummond {{work with}} other novels and story collections that included two characters who appeared as protagonists in their own works, Jim Maitland and Ronald Standish. He {{was one of the}} most successful British popular authors of the inter-war period before his death in 1937 from throat cancer, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> damage sustained from a gas attack in the war.|$|E
5|$|Sideways {{curvature}} of his spine was evident as the skeleton was excavated. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> adolescent-onset scoliosis. Although {{it was probably}} visible in making his right shoulder higher than the left and reducing his apparent height, it did not preclude an active lifestyle, {{and would not have}} caused a hunchback. The bones are those of a male with an age range estimation of 30–34, consistent with Richard, who was 32 when he died.|$|E

5|$|Such {{extensive}} and enthusiastic {{collaboration with the}} Einsatzgruppen <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> several factors. Since the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Kresy Wschodnie and other borderlands had experienced a political culture of violence. The period of Soviet rule had been profoundly traumatic for residents of the Baltic states and areas that {{had been part of}} Poland until 1939; the population was brutalised and terrorised by the imposed Soviet rule, and the existing familiar structures of society were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. National Security Council {{described}} Mattei as an irritation and {{an obstacle}} in a classified report from 1958. The French could not {{forgive him for}} {{doing business with the}} pro-independence movement in Algeria. Responsibility for his death <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the CIA, to the French extreme-nationalist group, the OAS, and to the Sicilian Mafia.|$|E
5|$|The actual term polar {{coordinates}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> Gregorio Fontana {{and was used}} by 18th-century Italian writers. The term appeared in English in George Peacock's 1816 translation of Lacroix's Differential and Integral Calculus.

5|$|The {{following}} is a table outlining the population change of the town since 1801, which demonstrates a trend of slow population growth in the 19th century and more rapid growth in the 20th century. In particular over the past 40 years, in which the population of Northallerton has more than doubled. The fall in population between 1851 and 1871 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the collapse in coaching as the railways became popular.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the chemical causing bluing upon tissue injury was reported in 1973. The molecule, gyrocyanin, is a highly oxidized bis-phenol-substituted cyclopentenone that develops a blue color when it is oxidized. In contrast, the bluing of other boletes <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the oxidation of variegatic or xerocomic acid. Gyrocyanin is biosynthesized from intermediates supplied by the shikimate pathway, a metabolic route used by fungi for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids.|$|E
5|$|The {{most recent}} disk {{responsible}} for these phase changes was formed in 1972. What's intriguing, however, is that Pleione's long-term polarimetric observations show the intrinsic polarization angle has changed, providing direct evidence for a spatial motion of the disk axis. Because Pleione has a stellar companion with a relatively close orbit, the shift in the polarization angle <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>attributed</b> <b>to</b> the companion causing a precession (wobble) of the disk, with a precession period of roughly 81 years.|$|E
