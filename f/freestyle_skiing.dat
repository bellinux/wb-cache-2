5|$|Kanthaugen {{has hosted}} FIS <b>Freestyle</b> <b>Skiing</b> World Cup events twice, on 26 to 28 March 1993 and on 3 to 5 March 1995. It also hosted the Norwegian <b>Freestyle</b> <b>Skiing</b> Championships in 1993 and 1996. Lillehammer is {{scheduled}} to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, with Kanthaugen to host <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> and half-pipe snowboarding. The venue is designated a Norway's national <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> venue and is the main training ground for the national team. The area around the venue is a popular recreational area for Lillehammer. Since 1995, Lillehammer Olympiapark has rented out toboggans {{for use in the}} hill, including use of the ski lift.|$|E
5|$|<b>Freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> {{is one of}} the six skiing {{disciplines}} contested at the Winter Olympic Games, and one of the youngest. In 1924, {{the first}} Winter Olympics featured Nordic skiing disciplines (cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and Nordic combined), while alpine skiing was first contested in 1936. Only at the 1992 Winter Olympics, in Albertville, France, were <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> events first held as official medal events. Before that, <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> was contested at the 1988 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport, consisting of events {{for both men and women}} in three variants: moguls, aerials and ski ballet. In Albertville, moguls was the first-ever official <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> medal event; aerials and ski ballet were also held but still as demonstration events. The growing popularity of aerials convinced the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to add this freestyle discipline to the 1994 Winter Olympics official program. Moguls and aerials have thus been contested at every Winter Games since. Ski cross inclusion in the Winter Olympics program was approved at an IOC Executive Board meeting in November 2006, and the first events were held at the 2010 Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2010 Winter Olympics, the United States is {{the most}} {{successful}} nation {{in the history of}} Olympic <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing,</b> having collected a total of 14 medals: five gold, five silver, and four bronze. They are followed by Canada with nine medals (four gold, three silver, two bronze). Together with France and Norway, the United States are also the only nation to have won a medal at every Winter Olympics featuring <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> as an official Olympic sport discipline. Overall, 72 medals (24 of each color) have been awarded to 58 skiers representing 17 National Olympic Committees (NOC).|$|E

5|$|LeMond's {{introduction}} to cycling came in 1975 thanks to <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> pioneer Wayne Wong, who recommended the bike {{as an ideal}} off-season training aid. LeMond started competing in 1976, and after dominating the Intermediate category (13–15) and winning the first 11 races he entered, he received permission to ride against older, more seasoned competitors in the Junior (16–19) category.|$|E
5|$|Many program {{changes were}} made in Calgary to grow {{the appeal of the}} Winter Games for sponsors: the {{extension}} to 16 days from 12 added an extra weekend of coverage, while the additional programming time was filled by television friendly demonstration events popular in Canada. The exposure curling, <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> and short-track speed skating gained in Calgary influenced the growth in their popularity and led to all three becoming full medal sports by 1998.|$|E

5|$|Tore Løkke was {{selected}} as the main contractor. Construction cost 20.3 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which NOK3.3 million was paid for by the municipality and NOK17 million was paid for by LOOC. The venue was completed in the fall of 1992 and was the first <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> arena in the world to feature a common spectator area for all three event hills. The temporary structures used during the Olympics were completed in December 1993. A jibbing park was installed in 2008.|$|E

5|$|In 1988 the Canadian city of Calgary {{hosted the}} first Winter Olympics to span 16days. New events were added in ski-jumping and speed skating; while future Olympic sports curling, short track speed skating and <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing</b> made their {{appearance}} as demonstration sports. For {{the first time}} the speed skating events were held indoors, on the Olympic Oval. Dutch skater Yvonne van Gennip won three gold medals and set two world records, beating skaters from the favoured East German team in every race. Her medal total was equalled by Finnish ski jumper Matti Nykänen, who won all three events in his sport. Alberto Tomba, an Italian skier, made his Olympic debut by winning both the giant slalom and slalom. East German Christa Rothenburger won the women's 1,000metre speed skating event. Seven months later she would earn a silver in track cycling at the Summer Games in Seoul, to become the only athlete to win medals in both a Summer and Winter Olympics in the same year.|$|E
5|$|The Winter Games {{have evolved}} since their inception. Sports and {{disciplines}} {{have been added}} and some of them, such as Alpine skiing, luge, short track speed skating, <b>freestyle</b> <b>skiing,</b> skeleton, and snowboarding, have earned a permanent spot on the Olympic programme. Some others, including curling and bobsleigh, have been discontinued and later reintroduced; others have been permanently discontinued, such as military patrol, though the modern Winter Olympic sport of biathlon is descended from it. Still others, such as speed skiing, bandy and skijoring, were demonstration sports but never incorporated as Olympic sports. The rise of television as a global medium for communication enhanced {{the profile of the}} Games. It generated income via the sale of broadcast rights and advertising, which has become lucrative for the IOC. This allowed outside interests, such as television companies and corporate sponsors, to exert influence. The IOC has had to address several criticisms, internal scandals, the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Winter Olympians, as well as a political boycott of the Winter Olympics. Nations have used the Winter Games to proclaim the superiority of their political systems.|$|E
