5000|$|Of his {{preparations}} for Jimmy Dean, Altman added, [...] "I didn't {{do what they}} told me I had to do, I hired the people I wanted." [...] The production was his first to involve Pierre Mignot, a Canadian cinematographer; they would both collaborate on five more films. Filming took place on just one set: a [...] "redressed" [...] version of its Broadway counterpart. Altman used Super 16 equipment during the nineteen-day shoot; this was later converted to 35 mm stock for the <b>first</b> <b>answer</b> <b>print.</b> For the film's flashbacks, he built a double set with two-way mirrors that were controlled by computerized lighting techniques—which became problematic for both him and the film's critics.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} not have the {{newspaper}} look as if most of the articles were written by the same author, Tucholsky wrote under three pseudonyms since 1913: Ignaz Wrobel, Theobald Tiger und Peter Panter. He kept these pseudonyms during his writing career. Under the influence of Tucholsky, {{the character of the}} newspaper should be changed soon. Already in March 1913, the <b>first</b> <b>answers</b> were <b>printed.</b> The idea behind this category was to react on letters to the newspaper that were authored by real or fictitious readers of the newspaper. More important, however, was Jacobsohn's decision to open his newspaper to topics from politics and economics. On September 25, the economics lawyer Martin Friedlander wrote about monopolies in the tobacco industry of the United States of America under the pseudonym Vindex. Jacobsohn commented on this article in a fictitious [...] "answer" [...] in which he emphasized {{that it was important to}} look at other topics despite focusing only on theater for the previous nine years. He wrote that the isolated consideration of one topic offers incentives and advantages but also dangers.|$|R
50|$|The {{interpositive}} is {{made after}} the <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> has been approved. All lights and opticals from the <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> are repeated when striking the interpositive, {{and once the}} IP exists, the original negative can be vaulted.|$|R

50|$|The {{distinction}} between camera stocks and print stocks involves {{a difference in}} the recording process. When the work print or edit master has been approved, the Original Camera Negative (OCN) is assembled by a negative cutter using the edited work print or EDL (edit decision list) as a guide. A series of <b>Answer</b> <b>Prints</b> are then made from the OCN. During the <b>Answer</b> <b>Print</b> stage, corrections in the film's density and color are corrected (timed) to the filmmakers' tastes. Interpositive (IP) prints are struck from the OCN, checked to make sure they look the same as the custom timed <b>Answer</b> <b>Print,</b> and then each IP is used to make one or more Dupe Negative (DN) copies. The release prints are then generated from the DN(s). Recently, with the development of digital intermediate (DI), it has become possible to completely edit, composite visual effects, and color grade the image digitally at full resolution and bit-depth. In this workflow, the <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is generated digitally and then written out to the IP stage using a laser film printer.|$|R
50|$|After a film is shot, the {{original}} negatives—taken {{directly from the}} camera equipment—are edited into correct sequence and printed onto fresh stock as a cohesive film, creating an interpositive print used for color timing. From the interpositive, <b>answer</b> <b>prints,</b> which include the color-corrected imagery and a properly synced sound track, are made. Once approved by the studio, the final <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is made into an internegative used for striking copies that will be delivered to theaters for viewing.|$|R
50|$|When {{the last}} <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is {{approved}} and finalized, {{it is used}} to make an internegative from which the release prints are struck.|$|R
50|$|<b>Answer</b> <b>print</b> {{refers to}} {{the first version of}} a given motion picture that is printed to film after color {{correction}} on an interpositive. It is also the first version of the movie printed to film with the sound properly synced to the picture.|$|R

5000|$|An <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is made {{either from}} the cut camera {{negative}} or an interpositive, depending on the production workflow, in order to verify that the grading ("timing" [...] in US English) conforms to specifications, so that final adjustments can be made before the main batch of release prints is made.|$|R
5000|$|Out was a {{short film}} {{produced}} by the United Nations Film Board and directed by Lionel Rogosin on the refugee situation in Austria {{as a result of}} Hungarian Revolution of 1956. The film was conceived 28 November 1956, filming began on 3 December 1956, and the <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> was screened 4 January 1957.|$|R
50|$|<b>Answer</b> <b>prints</b> {{are created}} during the {{post-production}} process after editing, dubbing {{and other related}} audio work and special effects sequences have been finished or completed to a degree satisfactory for pre-release viewing. They are used by the filmmaker and studio {{to ensure that the}} work going into the film during the post-production process is cohesive with the final goals for the project. In effect, it is a post-edit editing where the filmmaker can observe and direct the course of the film's final look and feel as it pertains to color correction, sound and special effects elements and overall pacing/editing. Pre-release screenings for test audiences are often run from late <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> copies of the film, as more often than not the filmmaker is using the screening as a way to help direct the final choices he/she will make regarding the finished project.|$|R
50|$|Cartel spent {{another year}} in {{post-production}} until the project arrived in 1982 as a 8460-foot <b>answer</b> <b>print.</b> Contracted with one distributor, Cartel later discovered Runaway Nightmare online {{as a home}} video, marketed by a completely different distributor (with unauthorized nude inserts spliced into several scenes) where it was released {{as one of the}} very first straight-to-video VHS.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} a {{restored}} film is the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. The color portions of Oz were shot in the three-strip Technicolor process, which in the 1930s yielded three separate black and white negatives created from red, green, and blue light filters which were used to print the cyan, magenta, and yellow portions of the final <b>printed</b> color film <b>answer</b> <b>print.</b> These three negatives were scanned individually into a computer system, where the digital images were tinted and combined using proprietary software.|$|R

When developed, the paper would remain white {{if it had not been}} exposed to light (i.e., by a player opening their briefcase). If any player opened their briefcase, the paper would turn black when developed. In that event, no money is added.|$|R

50|$|The edited {{original}} negative is then copied {{to create}} a safety positive {{which can be used}} as a backup {{to create a}} usable negative. At this point, an <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> will be created from the OCN, and upon its approval, interpositives (IPs) and internegatives (INs) are created, from which the release prints are made. Generally speaking, the OCN is considered too important and delicate to be used for any processes more than necessary, as each pass through a lab process carries the risk of further degrading the quality of the negative by scratching the emulsion. Once an <b>answer</b> <b>print</b> is approved, the IPs and INs are regarded as the earliest generation of the finished and graded film, and are almost always used for transfers to video or new film restorations. The OCN is usually regarded as a last resort in the event that all of the intermediate elements have been compromised or lost. Ironically, the more popular a film is, the higher the likelihood that the original negative is in a worse shape, due to the need to return to the OCN to strike new IPs to replace the exhausted ones, and thus create more INs and release prints. Before 1969, 35mm prints were struck directly from the original negative, often running into hundreds of copies, and causing further wear on the original.|$|R

50|$|When {{the film}} {{workprint}} {{had been cut}} to a satisfactory state, it was then used to make an edit decision list (EDL). The negative cutter referred to this list while processing the negative, splitting the shots into rolls, which were then contact printed to produce the final film <b>print</b> or <b>answer</b> <b>print.</b> Today, production companies {{have the option of}} bypassing negative cutting altogether. With the advent of digital intermediate ("DI"), the physical negative does not necessarily need to be physically cut and hot spliced together; rather the negative is optically scanned into computer(s) and a cut list is conformed by a DI editor.|$|R
