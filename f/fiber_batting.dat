The chamber was modified to record the weight loss of the samples, which in turn, indicated {{the effectiveness of the}} insulation material. The following materials were tested: (a) aluminoborosilicate cloth (NEXTEL); (b) fiber glass cloth; (c) carbonized polyaacrylonitrile and rayon cloth; (d) aromatic nylon felt; (e) SiC (NICALON) CLOTH; and (f) phenolic novolac (KYNOL) cloth. Samples of these were put in front of <b>fiber</b> glass <b>batting</b> containing 18 % phenolic resin (Owens Corning PF- 204). They were exposed to a radiant heat of 5 w cm- 2 which resulted in an almost complete resin mass loss within four minutes. Results of this study are shown in various figures, where the mass loss from the <b>fiber</b> glass <b>batting</b> is plotted vs. time. In these figures, solid curves show the percent mass loss of the exposed fiber glass and dashed curves indicate the loss in another fiber glass sample of the same initial mass protected by the material under test...|$|R

2500|$|Within the dermal and {{epidermal}} {{layer of}} bat wing skin, the connective tissue and muscle fibers provide the structural support. The connective tissue <b>fibers</b> within <b>bat</b> wing skin consists of collagen and elastin fiber bundles {{arranged in a}} [...] "regular mesh like scaffolding", which the nerves, skeletal muscle fibers and blood vessels embed themselves into. Of the muscles that insert themselves into the mesh scaffolding, larger muscles anchor the skin to the bone and control the membrane tension and camber of the bat wing during flight, whereas smaller muscles, which originate from within the mesh scaffolding, attach to collagen fibers within the fiber network and modulate bone loading and allow for precise control of wing shape and tension.|$|R
50|$|The {{world of}} {{clothing}} is always changing, as new cultural influences meet technological innovations. Researchers in scientific labs have been developing prototypes for fabrics {{that can serve}} functional purposes well beyond their traditional roles, for example, clothes that can automatically adjust their temperature, repel bullets, project images, and generate electricity. Some practical advances already available to consumers are bullet-resistant garments made with kevlar and stain-resistant fabrics that are coated with chemical mixtures that reduce the absorption of liquids. New blends of Spandex cotton blends allow for form fitting and stretching of closer fitting mass produced patterns. New mesh materials allow for better breathe-ability in shoes. New insulation <b>fibers</b> and <b>batting</b> make lighter rainments that keep you warm when wet and recent advances in coatings for fabrics or down also repel water.|$|R
5000|$|Gliding, Flying and Parachuting {{are some}} of the some methods of aerial {{locomotion}} used by animals. Vertebrates have altered the structure of the skin to accommodate the stresses and strains of flight. Typically mammalian skin consists of collagen fibers arranged in a felt-work pattern, with no preferential fiber orientation. However, the structures of skin in bats, birds, and gliding lizards are very different from those of typical mammalian skin. The structural arrangement of the <b>fibers</b> within <b>bat</b> wing skin enables the bat to act like a spring during the down-stroke of flapping. The scales of gliding lizards are arranged in a regular rib like pattern to enable to lizard to act as an airfoil. Avain skin must be structurally arranged such that [...] "the coat of feathers" [...] remains smooth and intact during flight.|$|R
50|$|The usual {{clothing}} for Arctic or mountain regions is a parka and heavy insulated mittens with long gauntlets {{to protect the}} wrist, gaiters to keep snow and moisture {{out of the top}} of the boots, and wool-felt or down-insulated booties. In high wind-chills, these garments may be supplemented by a mask, usually of oiled wool. In Arctic areas, the typical modern insulation is very fine hydrophobic polyester <b>fiber</b> <b>batting</b> sewn in laps between a nylon shell. The sewing must not compress or quilt the insulation, because the heat leaks out through the thin spots. Most designers now include a moisture barrier on the inner side to prevent condensation from a body's moisture from condensing and freezing in the insulation. Sometimes the moisture barrier has several layers of aluminized plastic film to reflect infrared back to the body. If plastic film is near the skin, usually some lightweight absorbent cloth is between the skin and the film, for comfort.|$|E
30|$|The comfort {{layer is}} divided into three subcategories: the quilt, the {{insulating}} layer, and the cushioning layer. The quilt is the top layer of the mattress. It provides a soft surface texture and a level of firmness that can be varied by changing the material and the details of construction. The quilt consists of the ticking plus low-density foam or <b>fiber</b> <b>batting</b> that is stitched to its underside. These two layers are sewn to a tape edge that attaches to the border quilting {{around the perimeter of the}} mattress. The insulating layer is the first layer next to the innerspring unit. It forms a barrier between the softer foam layers to reduce the likelihood of them “pocketing” into the spring unit and causing a lumpy uncomfortable sleeping surface. The insulating layer can be a <b>fiber</b> <b>batting</b> or layers of non-woven fabrics. The cushioning layer provides an extra layer of comfort, and may include flat or convoluted PUF, shredded pads of compressed polyester, or fiber battings. The insulator and cushioning layers can be stacked in varying sequences between the quilt and the innerspring support. With the introduction of 16 CFR 1633 in 2007, most mattress manufacturers changed to single-sided mattresses because of the expense of complying with flammability regulations for both sides of the bedding (Taylor [2999]).|$|E
30|$|Polyester fiber battings, {{commonly}} used in upholstered seats, provide a significant barrier effect when tested with smoldering cigarette ignition ([Gandhi & Spivak 1994]). However, it fails to protect the underlying cushioning material when an open flaming ignition source is used ([Damant GH. et al. 1994]). The polyester fiber melts away from the smoldering cigarette and extinguishes, whereas the polymer melt burns {{in the presence of}} flaming ignition. Once ignited, the molten polymer burns vigorously, resulting in substantial weight loss and increased temperature of the system. Thus, the polyester <b>fiber</b> <b>batting</b> acts as an additional fuel and the whole system fails. Recent studies on the flammability of cushions with polyester fiber wraps (low loft batting) in our laboratories have shown that the presence of polyester wrap increases the PHRR when compared to analog systems without polyester fiber wrap ([Davis et al. 2009]). This study suggests that, regardless of the type of FR-PUF and/or cover fabric, polyester fiber promotes the composite system to burn vigorously.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight white, solid-color or printed plain weave, satin weave, or flannel cotton or cotton/polyester blends are {{the most}} common types of sheeting, {{although}} linen and silk may also be used, including in combination. Goose or duck down and other feathers are frequently used as a warm and lightweight filling in duvets, comforters and quilts. But such fill can protrude in part even from tightly-woven fabric, and be an irritant for many people, particularly those with allergies. Natural and synthetic down alternatives are marketed. Cotton, wool or polyester batting is commonly used as fill in quilts and down alternative comforters. These are less expensive and more easily laundered than natural down or feathers. Synthetic fibers are best in the form of thermofused (where <b>fibers</b> cross) <b>batting.</b> Thick-woven or knitted wool, cotton, acrylic or other microfiber synthetics, or blends of these, are typically used for blankets.|$|R
40|$|A {{program is}} {{described}} that {{was conducted to}} develop an internal insulation system for potential application to the liquid hydrogen tanks of a reusable booster, where the tanks would be subjected to repeated high temperatures. The design of the internal insulation {{is based on a}} unique gas layer concept, in which capillary or surface tension effects are used to maintain a stable gas layer, within a cellular core structure, between the tank wall and the contained liquid hydrogen. Specific objectives were to select materials for insulation systems that would be compatible with wall temperatures of 350 F and 650 F during reentry into the earth's atmosphere, and to fabricate and test insulation systems under conditions simulating the operating environment. A materials test program was conducted to evaluate the properties of candidate materials at elevated temperatures and at the temperature of liquid hydrogen, and to determine the compatibility of the materials with a hydrogen atmosphere at the appropriate elevated temperature. The materials that were finally selected included Kapton polyimide films, silicone adhesives, <b>fiber</b> glass <b>batting,</b> {{and in the case of}} the 350 F system, Teflon film...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies of}} mixed {{background}} mice {{have demonstrated that}} targeted deletion of Vgf produces a lean, hypermetabolic mouse that is resistant to diet-, lesion-, and genetically-induced obesity. To investigate potential mechanism(s) and site(s) of action of VGF, a neuronal and endocrine secreted protein and neuropeptide precursor, we further analyzed the metabolic phenotypes of two independent VGF knockout lines on C 57 Bl 6 backgrounds. Results Unlike hyperactive VGF knockout mice on a mixed C 57 Bl 6 - 129 /SvJ background, homozygous mutant mice on a C 57 Bl 6 background were hypermetabolic with similar locomotor activity levels to Vgf+/Vgf+ mice, during day and night cycles, indicating that mechanism(s) other than hyperactivity were responsible for their increased energy expenditure. In Vgf-/Vgf- knockout mice, morphological analysis of brown and white adipose tissues (BAT and WAT) indicated decreased fat storage in both tissues, and decreased adipocyte perimeter and area in WAT. Changes in gene expression measured by real-time RT-PCR were consistent with increased fatty acid oxidation and uptake in BAT, and increased lipolysis, decreased lipogenesis, and brown adipocyte differentiation in WAT, suggesting that increased sympathetic nervous system activity in Vgf-/Vgf- mice {{may be associated with}} or responsible for alterations in energy expenditure and fat storage. In addition, uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) and UCP 2 protein levels, mitochondrial number, and mitochondrial cristae density were upregulated in Vgf-/Vgf- BAT. Using immunohistochemical and histochemical techniques, we detected VGF in nerve <b>fibers</b> innervating <b>BAT</b> and Vgf promoter-driven reporter expression in cervical and thoracic spinal ganglia that project to and innervate the chest wall and tissues including BAT. Moreover, VGF peptide levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay in BAT, and were found to be down-regulated by a high fat diet. Lastly, despite being hypermetabolic, VGF knockout mice were cold intolerant. Conclusion We propose that VGF and/or VGF-derived peptides modulate sympathetic outflow pathways to regulate fat storage and energy expenditure. </p...|$|R
30|$|A {{mattress}} set essentially {{consists of}} three main components: a frame, foundation and mattress. Mattresses are classified by the support system, which can be an innerspring, solid PUF, cotton batting, air or water. A typical innerspring mattress, which accounts for nearly 80 % of the U.S. market, is covered by a comfort layer on one side for single-sided mattresses or on both sides for double-sided mattresses. The comfort layer {{is divided into three}} sub categories: cushioning layer, insulator and quilt. The quilt is the top layer of the mattress and is constructed of the ticking (the outer cover fabric of a mattress) and a low density PUF or <b>fiber</b> <b>batting</b> laminated or stitched to the underside of the ticking. The insulator and the cushioning layers may be stacked in varying sequences between the quilt and the innerspring support. The insulating layer is often a light-weight, low density nonwoven batting (or layers of nonwoven fabrics), whereas the cushioning layer may include flat or convoluted PUF, shredded pads of compressed polyester, or fiber battings.|$|E
40|$|A {{catalyst}} cartridge, {{for use in}} {{a carbon}} dioxide reducing apparatus in a life support system for space vehicles, is described. The catalyst cartridge includes an inner perforated metal wall, an outer perforated wall space outwardly from the inner wall, a base plate closing one end of the cartridge, and a cover plate closing {{the other end of the}} cartridge. The cover plate has a central aperture through which a supply line with a heater feeds a gaseous reaction mixture comprising hydrogen and carbon dioxide at a temperature from about 1000 to about 1400 F. The outer surfaces of the internal wall and the inner surfaces of the outer wall are lined with a ceramic <b>fiber</b> <b>batting</b> material of sufficient thickness to prevent carbon formed in the reaction from passing through it. The portion of the surfaces of the base and cover plates defined within the inner and outer walls are also lined with ceramic batting. The heated reaction mixture passes outwardly through the inner perforated wall and ceramic batting and over the catalyst. The solid carbon product formes is retained within the enclosure containing the catalyst. The solid carbon product formed is retained within the enclosure containing the catalyst.

30|$|The fire {{threat of}} a {{mattress}} {{is determined by the}} propensity of component materials to ignite, the intensity with which they burn and the rate at which flames spread. The cover fabric, which is often termed as ticking in the mattress industry, is a mattress component that can char, melt or ignite when in contact with an ignition source, for example, a smoldering cigarette or a small match flame. If the ticking forms a smoldering char, a considerable amount of heat may accumulate {{over a period of time}} and subsequently spread into the filling material. The ticking may also melt away from the ignition source, thereby exposing the underlying cushioning foam or filling. Smoldering may result in one of two possible outcomes as the heat penetrates into the filling: oxygen depletion may reduce the intensity of the ignition source and thereby extinguish the fire, or the filling material can ignite and fire begins to spread over the mattress assembly. Once the fire becomes an open flame, the bedclothes may catch fire and act as a high intensity secondary ignition source, leading to ignition of the underlying materials. The melting and dripping of the significant quantities of mattress components, such as polyester <b>fiber</b> <b>batting</b> and polyurethane foams may cause ‘pool’ fires thereby increasing the threat of fire spread to other items in the room (Fleischmann [2006]). In addition to the direct threat of ignition, the hot gases and smoke from the burning bed assembly will accumulate under the ceiling. The temperature of this hot layer is very high, and its radiant heat can eventually ignite all flammable items in the room, leading to room flashover. Flashover typically occurs when the heat release from a burning bedding assembly reaches 1700 [*]kW (Babrauskas et al. [2003]). A fire of this size in a confined space results in rapid generation of carbon monoxide, which poses another serious threat to occupants elsewhere in the building. Mattresses related fire fatalities are often associated with fires with substantial growth or spread, such as a flashover (Ohlemiller & Gann [2002]). Thus, a bedding fire that begins with a smoldering cigarette or the open flame of a match has the potential to translate into a large fire with serious consequences (Ohlemiller & Gann [2002]).|$|E
5000|$|Bats rely on skin {{on their}} wings to {{generate}} lift and thrust used in flight. Therefore, {{the structure of}} the bat wing skin is different from the skin of the bat body. Bat wing skin consists of two thin layers of epidermis with a thin layer of dermis/hypodermis located between the epidermal layers whereas the skin of the bat body consists of a single layer of epidermis with a thicker layer of dermis internal to the epidermis. Within the dermal and epidermal layer of bat wing skin, the connective tissue and muscle fibers provide the structural support. The connective tissue <b>fibers</b> within <b>bat</b> wing skin consists of collagen and elastin fiber bundles arranged in a [...] "regular mesh like scaffolding", which the nerves, skeletal muscle fibers and blood vessels embed themselves into. Of the muscles that insert themselves into the mesh scaffolding, larger muscles anchor the skin to the bone and control the membrane tension and camber of the bat wing during flight, whereas smaller muscles, which originate from within the mesh scaffolding, attach to collagen fibers within the fiber network and modulate bone loading and allow for precise control of wing shape and tension. As seen in snakes, local structural differences within the arrangement of the fibers change the mechanical properties of local area, but there are general characteristics that describe the mechanical behavior of bat wing skin. Within the mesh scaffolding of bat wing skin, collagen fibers cross bones perpendicular to the long axes of the bones, therefore mechanical properties of bat wing skin oriented perpendicular to the long axes of the bones exhibit a lower stiffness than the skin that is oriented parallel to the long axes of the bodies. Stiffer skin is necessary for bat wing skin oriented in the direction parallel to the long axes of the bones to prevent too much deformation of bat wing skin during flight(with respect to the bone), resulting in the shearing of the bat wing skin off of the bone. Flexible skin is necessary for the direction perpendicular to the long axes of the bones for facilitating the shape changes needed for movement and control during flight. [...] This anisotropy of bat wing skin is also useful as method of storing and releasing elastic energy, particularly during the downstroke. During the downstroke, the bat extends its wing and the wing skin experiences an aerodynamic force. The wing skin expands and counteracts the aerodynamic force. After the wing is fully extended, the orientation of the wing is nearly vertical and the aerodynamic forces on the wing are reduced. As the aerodynamic force is reduced, the wing recoils, drawing the digits of the wings together in preparation for the upstroke.|$|R
