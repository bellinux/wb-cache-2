On January 9, 2012, however, Forcier withdrew from the San Jose State football program.

After attending Ottawa's NHL training camp, <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to join the Binghamton Senators to begin his professional career. On October 14, 2011, Caporusso was reassigned to the Elmira Jackals of the ECHL.

5|$|Diaby {{is often}} {{described}} as being injury-prone. Since returning from his fractured ankle injury in late 2006, the midfielder has endured persistent niggling injuries that have resulted in Diaby failing to play a full season for his current club. During his second season at Auxerre, a season in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to get some significant playing time, Diaby failed to gain the confidence of manager Jacques Santini primarily due to repetitive injuries he endured during the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season. After returning to the team, Diaby struggled to return to form, which ultimately resulted in his sale to Arsenal. His highest output for appearances with Arsenal came in the 2009–10 season when he played in 40 matches. Arsenal played a total of 55 competitive matches in the season.|$|E
5|$|Edward and Karl find {{a fork in}} {{the road}} and travel down {{separate}} paths. Edward follows a path through a swamp and discovers the secret town of Spectre, the cheery locals claiming <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected.</b> There, he befriends Ashton poet Norther Winslow and the mayor’s daughter Jenny. However, Edward leaves Spectre, unwilling to settle down but promises Jenny he will return. In the present day, Joséphine speaks to the bed-ridden Edward and asks him to tell her the story of how he met his wife Sandra, with Will listening outside the door. Returning to his reminisces, Edward reunites with Karl and they visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward {{falls in love with a}} beautiful woman. Karl and Edward get jobs in the circus where the ringmaster Amos Calloway reveals to Edward one detail about the woman at the end of every month.|$|E
5|$|He {{held the}} vicarage of Lochrutton in Kirkcudbrightshire in 1388, when a papal letter {{indicated}} that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to resign Lochrutton after obtaining the benefice of Maybole {{in the gift}} of the Prioress of the nunnery of North Berwick. He still held Lochrutton on 18 April 1390, when the letter was repeated. Thomas remained provost of Maybole until at least 1401, and perhaps until his consecration as Bishop of Galloway in 1415. No-one else is known to have held the position of provost there until 1439, although this proves nothing as the evidence for such things in the south-west of Scotland in this period is always scarce.|$|E

5|$|He started 2008–09 as an ever-present in {{the team}} before pulling a calf muscle during an FA Trophy second round match away to Oxford United on 13 January 2009, which ruled him out for three weeks. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to make his return ahead of {{schedule}} away to Eastbourne Borough on 24 January 2009, but was not named {{in the team}}. His return came as a 90th-minute substitute in a 0–0 away draw with Ebbsfleet United on 8 March 2009. During the period of his injury, York signed defender Shaun Pejic, whose form alongside Danny Parslow in central defence resulted in McGurk being unable to reaffirm {{his place in the}} team. He started in the 2009 FA Trophy Final at Wembley Stadium on 9 May 2009, which York lost 2–0 to Stevenage Borough. He finished the season with 45 appearances.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> by some {{to mount}} a {{challenge}} for promotion to the Premiership in 2005–06, which was the club's first season in the new Ricoh Arena. The team started out poorly, but improved {{in the second half}} of the season to rise up the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in Dennis Wise. However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{to begin}} the 1975 season, Ellis {{continued}} to perform well {{at the beginning of}} the season. In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, who responded by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E

5|$|In a {{makeshift}} hospital at Plateros, Scout Alfonso and Ranger Fisher were quickly put into surgery. The shrapnel {{was removed from}} Alfonso's abdomen, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to recover if returned to American lines. Fisher's shrapnel was also removed, but with limited supplies and widespread damage to both his stomach and intestines, it was decided more extensive surgery {{would need to be}} completed in an American hospital. Mucci ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could airlift him to American lines. Some Scouts and freed prisoners stayed behind to construct the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn {{thought he looked}} more like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected,</b> when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
5|$|June {{was signed}} by the Houston Texans on April 4, 2009 to a one-year {{contract}} worth $1.5million. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>expected</b> to compete with Xavier Adibi and Zac Diles for the weakside linebacker position. However, on August 20, June broke his forearm during morning practice, had surgery to insert a plate that afternoon and was expected to miss 68 weeks. June had previously missed some training camp time due to a knee injury. On August 28, June was placed on season-ending injured reserve due to his injured forearm. He was released with an injury settlement on September 3, making him a free agent.|$|E
