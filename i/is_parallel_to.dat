5|$|In the west, NY175 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US20 {{in the town}} of Skaneateles. The highway heads towards the northeast as Lee Mulroy Road, passing by farmlands and fields as well as several residences. As NY175 heads to the northeast into the town of Marcellus, it intersects with three county roads. This section of the route <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> two other unsigned county roads, located to the northwest and to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The {{western edge}} of St. Louis Park is marked by the {{interchange}} with US169. The area immediately adjacent to MN7 in this suburb is filled with commercial properties {{on either side of}} access roads. East of Louisiana Avenue, the highway <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> a line of the Twin Cities and Western Railroad. There is another interchange for Wooddale Avenue before MN7 meets, and terminates at, the interchange for MN100 near the Peavey–Haglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator, the country's first concrete grain elevator. The expressway continues east for approximately another mile (1.6km) as CR25.|$|E
5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> the Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether the Sun is above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when the Sun is located on the equatorial plane.|$|E

5|$|In Syracuse, NY5 <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> I-690 {{for much}} of its routing but never {{encounters}} the highway, thus making the north–south streets that intersect NY5 entry points to and from I-690. In downtown Syracuse, West Genesee Street becomes James Street. At {{the southern tip of}} the interchange between I-690 and I-81, NY5 transfers onto Erie Boulevard and intersects State Street (US11), but passes under I-81 without access. From the downtown area to DeWitt, NY5 is divided. At the Syracuse–DeWitt boundary, NY5 intersects NY635 and eastward, it curves to a southeast course. Near Shoppingtown Mall, NY5 turns east onto Genesee Street to begin an overlap with NY92. Less than a mile east of the mall, NY5 and NY92 intersect I-481 at a cloverleaf interchange.|$|E
5|$|Inferences about {{behavior}} {{can also be}} drawn from examination of the inner ear. The semicircular canals within the inner ear aid in balance, and the lateral semicircular canal is usually {{parallel to the ground}} when the animal holds its head in an alert posture. When the skull of Majungasaurus is rotated so that its lateral canal <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> the ground, the entire skull is nearly horizontal. This contrasts with many other theropods, where the head was more strongly downturned when in the alert position. The lateral canal is also significantly longer in Majungasaurus than in its more basal relative Ceratosaurus, indicating a greater sensitivity to side-to-side motions of the head.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E

5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick the ball up into the air. The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> the ground. As the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms {{should be used for}} balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E
5|$|Groesbeck Highway runs {{northeast}} from Hoover Street crossing out of Wayne County into Macomb County at 8 Mile Road. The trunkline here <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> {{railroad tracks}} through Warren. M-97 crosses Interstate 696 (I-696) at an interchange {{located on the}} Warren–Roseville line. This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile Road System. M-97 crosses through {{the southeast corner of}} Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township. There is a major intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, which is a limited access county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile Road System. Between this intersection and Harrington Street, Groesbeck Highway curves around to the north, crossing the Clinton River and the railroad then entering Mt. Clemens. M-97 continues to curve around the west side of downtown Mt. Clemens before re-entering Clinton Township. Groesbeck Highway and M-97 ends at M-59/Hall Road, another limited access county primary road in Macomb County located in place of 20 Mile Road. The northern terminus is on the Clinton Township–Macomb Township line northwest of Selfridge Field, an Air National Guard facility on Lake St. Clair. The road continues north as a county road known as North Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E
5000|$|More {{recently}} the implication has been phrased differently {{in terms of}} the binary relation expressed by parallel lines: In affine geometry the relation is taken to be an equivalence relation, which means that a line <b>is</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> itself. Andy Liu wrote, [...] "Let P be a point not on line 2. Suppose both line 1 and line 3 pass through P and <b>are</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> line 2. By transitivity, they <b>are</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> each other, and hence cannot have exactly P in common. It follows that they are the same line, which is Playfair's axiom." ...|$|R

For example, in a top view of a pyramid, which is an orthographic projection, the base edges (which <b>are</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> the projection plane) have true length, whereas the remaining edges in this view are not true lengths. The same is true with an orthographic side view of a pyramid. If any face of a pyramid <b>was</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> the projection plane (for a particular view), all edges would demonstrate true length.|$|R

25|$|Figure 19a {{shows the}} network of boron icosahedra in the boron {{framework}} of ScB19+xSiy. In this network, 4 icosahedra form a supertetrahedron (figure 18b); its one edge <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> the a-axis, and the icosahedra on this edge make up a chain along the a-axis. The opposite edge of the supertetrahedron <b>is</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> the b-axis and the icosahedra on this edge form a chain along the b-axis. As shown in figure 19, there are wide tunnels surrounded by the icosahedron arrangement along the a- and b-axes. The tunnels are filled by the B22 units which strongly bond to the surrounding icosahedra; the connection of the B22 units is helical and it runs along the c-axis {{as shown in figure}} 19b. Scandium atoms occupy the voids in the boron network as shown in figure 19c, and the Si atoms bridge the B22 units.|$|E
