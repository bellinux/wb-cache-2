The experiment included 42 breeding cows of the Czech Fleckvieh cattle breed and their calves. The breeding cows {{were divided into two}} age groups, each of 21 heads. The first group included heifers and the second group consisted of cows on the 2 nd and higher lactation. Each age group had 7 control animals (Heifers/Cows – control), 7 animals receiving 50 g of yeast culture on the <b>feed</b> <b>carrier</b> per head and day (Heifers/Cows – 50 g), and 7 animals receiving 150 g of yeast culture on the <b>feed</b> <b>carrier</b> per head and day (Heifers/Cows – 150 g). Blood of the animals was sampled three times during the experiment – two times in the cows and one time in their calves. The first blood sample was taken from the breeding cows before the start of feeding the yeast culture ca. 23 days before the expected parturition (Cow − 23). The second blood sample was taken from the breeding cows within 24 hours after birth (Cow + 2) and the third blood sample was taken from the calves on the 3 rd– 4 th day after birth (Calf + 4). Parameters ascertained in the processed serum were: immunoglobulines G (IgG), crude protein (CP), gamma glutamyl-transferase (GGT), urea, glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase (GPT) and glutamate-oxaloacetate-transaminase (GOT). Results of our experiment, which lasted from 16. 3 to 28. 6 (105 days) showed IgG in the serum of cows on the 2 nd and higher lactation in the control group (3. 8 ± 1. 48 mg/ml) was statistically significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in the blood sample Cow + 2 than in the serum of cows in the 2 nd and higher lactation fed with the lower concentration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at the same sampling (15. 9 ± 11. 41 mg/ml). This correlates also {{with the fact that the}} content of IgG antibodies in the serum of calves after the cows on the 2 nd and higher lactation in the control group (3. 9 ± 2. 06 mg/ml) was statistically significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than that of calves after the cows on the 2 nd and higher lactation with the lower concentration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14. 6 ± 8. 67 [*]mg/[*]ml).

40|$|The {{transfer}} of cadmium(II) from acidic chloride solutions through a smart liquid membrane technology {{was investigated in}} a microporous polypropylene hollow fiber membrane contactor. The organic solution of tri-isooactylammonium chloride (TiOAC) in Exxsol D 100 was used as carrier. The acidic chloride feed solution containing the metal was passed through the tube side, and the pseudo-emulsion of the organic solution and NHOH was passed through the shell side in counter-current mode, using a unique contactor in the process. In the pseudo-emulsion based hollow fiber membrane with strip dispersion (PEHFMSD) technology, the aqueous strip solutions of ammonium hydroxide are dispersed in the organic solutions in a tank with a mixing arrangement to provide a strip dispersion. This strip dispersion circulates from the tank to the membrane module to provide constant supply of the organic solution to the membrane pores. Different hydrodynamic and chemical variables, such as variation in feed acidity, metal concentration in the <b>feed,</b> <b>carrier</b> concentration in the organic phase, variation in feed, strip and organic phase volume ratios and variation in the feed and pseudo-emulsion flows, were investigated.

From that point the importance of Kanga Force's operations around Salamaua and Wau declined, with the direct threat posed by the landings dictating that the limited forces and supplies available to the Australians be concentrated on Port Moresby. Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell took over command of New Guinea Force from Morris on 12 August {{at the height of the}} fighting. The 2/6th Independent Company had arrived in Port Moresby on 7 August and it had been planned to send them forward to Wau to reinforce Kanga Force. However, with the Japanese threat against Port Moresby growing increasingly serious they were held in reserve there instead, while Kanga Force would be required to continue to hold on with the limited resources available to them. Meanwhile, as food was not getting through to Kanga Force, the soldiers of the NGVR became increasingly dependent on local supplies. Japanese air raids against their supply dumps, intimidation of the local inhabitants, large scale desertions of native carriers, and the inherent difficulty of getting supplies forward to <b>feed</b> those <b>carriers</b> that remained combined to threaten to stop their operations altogether.|$|R
40|$|A aspersão térmica envolve processos de recobrimentos que podem utilizar materiais cerâmicos, poliméricos, metálicos ou misturas destes. O {{material}} a ser depositado é fundido total ou parcialmente. As partículas aquecidas são aceleradas e projetadas em direção a uma superfície devidamente preparada, onde se formam camadas com estrutura lamelar. Os efeitos das variáveis do processo de aspersão, pressão dos gases de combustão, taxa de alimentação e gás de arraste no transporte do material, sobre a resistência ao desgaste e atrito de filmes PET foram investigados. Os recobrimentos de PET foram caracterizados através do desgaste micro-abrasivo, utilizando o ensaio de caloteste, e da medida dos coeficientes de atrito, com o ensaio de pino-sobre-disco. Os valores do coeficiente de desgaste abrasivo e do coeficiente de atrito dos recobrimentos são comparados com os valores da garrafa PET utilizada como referência. Os coeficientes de desgaste encontrados foram similares aos valores de garrafas PET da ordem de 10 - 5. As análises estatísticas dos resultados deste trabalho indicam que os efeitos das interações das três variáveis, pressão dos gases de combustão, taxa de alimentação e gás de arraste foram significativos para o coeficiente de desgaste e não significativos para o coeficiente de atrito. The thermal spray technique involves coating processes that can use ceramic, polymers, metallic materials or {{a blend of}} these. The material to be deposited is melted totally or partially, where the heated particles are accelerated and projected toward a prepared surface forming layers with a lamellar structure. The effect of the spray process parameters such as, combustion pressure, <b>feed</b> rate and <b>carrier</b> gas, on the wear resistance and friction of PET films was evaluated. The PET coatings were characterized by measuring the wear coefficient through the calowear type testing and the friction coefficients using pin-on-disk testing. The values of the abrasive wear coefficient and the friction coefficient of the coatings were compared {{to the values of}} the bottle PET reference sample. The wear coefficient values were similar to the values for the PET bottles, in the range of 10 - 5. The statistical analyses of the results indicate that the interaction effects of the three variables, gas pressure, <b>feeding</b> rate and <b>carrier</b> gas were significant for the wear coefficient but not for the friction coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Zinc- and cadmium-doped gallium {{phosphide}} crystals have been grown by an open tube halogen transport process at 805 ~ 176 The zinc-doping varied from 10 I 7 to 10 TM cm- 3 while cadmium could be incorporated at levels ranging from 10 TM to 10 TM cm- 3. We observed a linear dependence of zinc and cadmium concentration on the partial {{pressure of the}} dopant in the growth ambient. This l inear dependence is evidence for a nonequil ibrium, kinetically controlled process. The structural and electrical properties are compared with the properties of crystals grown by the wet hydrogen process. A study of the gall ium consumption {{as a function of}} experimental variables yielded a Ga to PCI 3 ratio of 2. 5 _ 0. 2, independent of PC 13 <b>feed</b> rate and <b>carrier</b> gas flow. A ratio of 2. 64 is predicted from thermodynamic data provided the species GaC 12 (g) can be neglected in the initial reaction between HC 1 and Ga. At the present ime the open tube vapor transport technique used to produce large single crystals o...|$|R
