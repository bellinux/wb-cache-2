25|$|On 12 December 2009, {{locomotive}} 144 {{brought an}} ex-Mark 3 <b>Generator</b> <b>van</b> (7608) from Dublin to York Road Depot, Belfast. Then again on 22 December 2009, locomotive 8209 brought another ex-Mark 3 <b>Generator</b> <b>van</b> (7613) from Dublin to York Road. NIR received {{a total of}} four ex-Mark 3 Generator vans. They have been painted in Enterprise colours and wired with push/pull to run with the Enterprise sets to replace the HEP supplied by the locomotive. These Generator vans entered service in September 2012.|$|E
25|$|The RPSI {{bought the}} {{withdrawn}} Gatwick Express Mk2 coaches and <b>generator</b> <b>van</b> from NIR, which are currently (2017) in store at Dundalk and Whitehead. They {{will be used}} to augment and to replace some of the RPSI's current Mk2 fleet that work out of Whitehead.|$|E
25|$|On 12 and 22 December 2009, NIR {{received}} the first two, 7608 and 7613, of four Mark 3 <b>Generator</b> <b>vans</b> from IÉ for repainting in Enterprise livery. The other two <b>Generator</b> <b>vans</b> arrived in early 2010. They replaced the HEP power system {{when they were}} introduced to revenue service in September 2012, then numbered 5560 89-89604 (9602), 89605 (9604), 89608 (9606) and 89613 (9608).|$|R
5000|$|Four <b>generator</b> <b>vans,</b> {{numbered}} [...] "KaNi 24 10, 12, 13, and 14", {{were used}} with the Twilight Express trainsets.|$|R
50|$|It {{constitutes}} of five AC2-tier, nine AC3-tier, {{one first}} class AC, one Pantry Car and two guard cum <b>generator</b> <b>vans.</b> The total composition is 17 coaches.|$|R
25|$|Until September 2012, {{electrical}} power for train HVAC, battery charging and cooking was supplied from the locomotive's Head End Power system as the sets {{did not include}} a <b>Generator</b> <b>Van.</b> In order to avoid further damage to the locomotives, four Mark 3 Generator Vans entered service on the date above mentioned.|$|E
25|$|All ten {{coaches have}} since been {{withdrawn}} from service and sold into preservation. The <b>Generator</b> <b>Van</b> and eight passenger vehicles have been acquired by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland to enhance its Mark 2 fleet, with plans {{for at least one}} to be converted into a dining vehicle. The DBSO has been purchased by the Downpatrick & County Down Railway to act as a barrier vehicle {{in the event of a}} failure of the DCDR's Class 450 DEMU.|$|E
25|$|Their {{electrical}} system {{differed from the}} BR and NIR versions. The <b>generator</b> <b>van</b> contained two engine/generator sets, each supplying 220/380 V 50Hz AC to two separate electrical buses in the train. The air conditioning loads were divided in half, each half fed from a separate bus. In the case of failure of one generator set, the other set automatically supplies both buses. Air conditioning output power would then be halved, but all other loads including cooking, lighting and battery charging {{would continue to be}} supplied. This later remained the model for the electrical power supply on all subsequent IE coaches.|$|E
50|$|In December 2014 Botswana Railways {{announced}} that they would purchase three <b>generator</b> <b>vans,</b> five first class sleepers, 18 economy class coaches, five business class coaches, three buffet cars and a luggage van.|$|R
50|$|This system {{supplied}} AC {{power to}} the train for heating, battery charging, etc. and was intended to replace the Mark 2 & Mark 3 <b>Generator</b> <b>Vans</b> used at the time. In the event HEP was only used on the Enterprise cross-border De Dietrich service. HEP is no longer used due to noise while the train is in station, and reliability issues running the prime mover at high speed constantly. Four Mark 3 <b>generator</b> <b>vans</b> remain in use on the Enterprise service. The later CAF-built Mark 4 sets include their own generators in the Driving Van Trailer (DVT).|$|R
25|$|Craven Carriage Numbers 1505, 1506, 1508, 1514, 1522, 1523, 1529, 1532, 1539,and 1541 {{have been}} {{preserved}} in regular {{use by the}} Railway Preservation Society of Ireland (RPSI), along with two BR mk1 <b>generator</b> <b>vans,</b> Nos.3173 and 3185.|$|R
25|$|Twenty-four {{coaches were}} built for {{push-pull}} operation on the suburban rail service including 5 built to Control Cars (6101–05, 6301–19). Originally {{used in conjunction}} with the 121 Class locomotives they were last used with 201 Class locomotives. There were a number of differences between the Irish push-pull Mark 3's and the standard Mark 3's. An underfloor generator, mounted in the Control Car, provided electrical power to the coaches; unlike on the standard Mark 3's, which used a special <b>generator</b> <b>van.</b> This single generator was not as powerful as the two used in the Mark 3 generator vans and was the main reason the sets were limited to 6 cars. Irish Mark 3 push-pull based rolling stock did not have air conditioning and had opening windows instead. There was also a 70mph speed restriction imposed on the train {{due to the fact that}} three of the Control Cars were fitted with LHB bogies from an 8100 Class DART. and were air-braked.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "Dutch" [...] type <b>generator</b> <b>van,</b> no.3158 {{that would}} have {{operated}} with the Cravens stock, has also been preserved by the RPSI, and now runs with their Whitehead based mk2 set as No.462.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{electrical}} system also {{differed from the}} BR and NIR versions. The <b>Generator</b> <b>Van</b> contained two engine / generator sets, each supplying 220 / 380 Volts 50Hz AC to two separate [...] "busses" [...] in the train. The air conditioning loads were divided in half, each half fed from each [...] "bus". In the case of failure of one generator set, the other set automatically supplies both [...] "busses". Air conditioning output power would then be halved, but all other loads including Cooking, Lighting and Battery Charging continue to be supplied. This has remained {{the model for the}} electrical power supply on all subsequent IE coaches.|$|E
50|$|A further {{problem was}} due to the {{locomotive}} and rolling stock arrangements. Unlike most other locomotive-hauled rolling stock in Ireland, <b>generator</b> <b>vans</b> were not part of the train - even the DVTs did not supply power. Thus the General Motors-built locomotives had to supply head-end power for lighting and heating throughout the train. Although many types of locomotive are well designed for this purpose, these particular locomotives had struggled under the extra strain. The wear on the locos and time out of service were unusually high. On at least two occasions locomotives had burst into flames while shuttling along the route. To avoid further damage, four Mark 3 <b>Generator</b> <b>Vans</b> entered service in September 2012.|$|R
50|$|Five were {{converted}} to <b>generator</b> <b>vans</b> as for the aborted Nightstar service. One was purchased by UK Rail Leasing {{for use as a}} carriage heater at its Leicester depot in 2016. English Welsh & Scottish investigated converting Mark 3s for use on high speed freight trains.|$|R

2500|$|NIR {{purchased}} eight British Rail Class 488 electric {{multiple unit}} coaches in 2001 that been converted from Mark 2F coaches for the Gatwick Express service from London Victoria to Gatwick Airport. They were renumbered 8941-8948, The worked with NIR <b>Generator</b> <b>Van</b> 8911. They were withdrawn on 19 January 2005, having {{been replaced by}} new C3K units. They were reintroduced in September 2006 to provide extra capacity on the Portadown to Belfast (Central) service, making one trip every morning, hauled by a Class 111 locomotive but last ran on 18 June 2009 and have now been withdrawn. [...] These are now owned by the RPSI, and currently in storage for future use.|$|E

25|$|The first 44 Open Standards (7101–44) {{and five}} Buffets (7401–05) and seven <b>Generator</b> <b>Vans</b> (7601–07) were built at Derby Litchurch Lane Works. The {{remainder}} (7145–72, 7406–13, 7608–15) was built under licence in Inchicore between 1984 and 1989. The coaches ran on 5ft 3 in gauge versions of British Rail's BT22 Air Suspension bogie, and were air-braked.|$|R
25|$|The order {{consisted}} of six First Class coaches (5101–5106), nine Composites (5151–5159), 36 Standard Class (5201–5236), eleven Restaurant/Buffet Standard Class (5401–5411) and eleven <b>Generator</b> <b>Vans</b> (5601–5611). Internal fit-out {{was done in}} Inchicore, and was {{quite different from the}} original BR design, using bench seating rather than individual seats and with extensive use of wood veneer panelling.|$|R

On this set, train heating was supplied from the locomotive Head End Power System, but {{this led to}} reliability issues on the 201 Class locomotives, so Mark 3 <b>Generator</b> <b>vans</b> have replaced one of the De Dietrich standard class coaches in the formation since September 2012.|$|R
50|$|The Dublin to Belfast 'Enterprise' {{service is}} {{operated}} jointly by IÉ & NIR with rolling stock from De Dietrich, commissioned in 1997. These sets comprise a dining car, two first class carriages and driving van trailer (DVT) for push-pull operation. Four Mark 3 <b>Generator</b> <b>vans</b> {{were introduced in}} September 2012. Until then, 201 Class locomotives were required to supply head-end power (HEP) for heating and lighting.|$|R
50|$|The Enterprise route (Dublin to Belfast) is well regarded. However {{it is only}} {{double track}} and serves both local and {{intermediate}} Commuter as well as InterCity traffic. Hence any delay has knock on effects. Also there is limited platform availability at Connolly Station in Dublin. There was also a persistent problem with engine overloading, as Enterprise locomotives also supplied coach power. However, since September 2012, additional power is provided by separate Mark 3 <b>generator</b> <b>vans.</b>|$|R

50|$|In addition, Irish Rail {{introduced}} four former Mark 3 <b>generator</b> <b>vans</b> in September 2012 {{to operate}} this route {{in a bid}} to improve reliability of the service and reduce maintenance costs. Previously the service operated with head end power and this caused regular locomotive failures, increased wear and tear and also contributed to locomotive 230 been removed from service after an engine fire while operating a passenger service with HEP in operation.|$|R

50|$|Diesel {{multiple}} unit builds in the 1980s utilised the 52xxx, 55xxx, 57xxx and 58xxx series for carriages, {{all of which}} were motored. The 55xxx and 58xxx contained a mix of driving and non-driving motors, but the 52xxx and 57xxx cars were all driving motors. Some series have been used for conversions of carriages, e.g. 63xx has been used for a variety of miscellaneous carriages, including <b>generator</b> <b>vans</b> and observation saloons. Privately owned carriages were allocated numbers in the 99xxx series, with bullion and exhibition vans.|$|R
