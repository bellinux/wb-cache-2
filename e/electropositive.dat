5|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and <b>electropositive</b> metal. With a standard reduction potential of −1.90V for the Th4+/Th couple, it is somewhat more <b>electropositive</b> than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit pyrophoricity, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium turnings ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may eventually occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated {{with varying degrees of}} the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish in air, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.|$|E
5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium is less <b>electropositive</b> than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method is less expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).|$|E
5|$|Some tables, {{including}} the one published by IUPAC refer to all lanthanides and actinides as being in group 3: 30 lanthanide and actinide elements together with scandium and yttrium. Lanthanides, as <b>electropositive</b> trivalent metals, all have a closely related chemistry, and all show many similarities to scandium and yttrium, but they also show additional properties characteristic of their partially filled f-orbitals which are not common to scandium and yttrium.|$|E
5|$|Tetravalent thorium {{compounds}} {{are usually}} colourless or yellow, {{like those of}} silver or lead, as the Th4+ ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an <b>electropositive</b> metal forming a single diamagnetic ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the main group elements of the s-block. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Thorium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium metal is silvery and tarnishes black {{when it is}} exposed to air, forming the dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a high melting point. Thorium is an <b>electropositive</b> actinide whose chemistry {{is dominated by the}} +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.|$|E
5|$|When refined, uranium is {{a silvery}} white, weakly {{radioactive}} metal. It has a Mohs hardness of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and approximately {{equal to that}} of titanium, rhodium, manganese and niobium. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, strongly <b>electropositive</b> and a poor electrical conductor. Uranium metal has a very high density of 19.1g/cm3, denser than lead (11.3g/cm3), but slightly less dense than tungsten and gold (19.3g/cm3).|$|E
5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very <b>electropositive</b> metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E
5|$|Niobium is {{slightly}} less <b>electropositive</b> and more compact {{than its predecessor}} in the periodic table, zirconium, whereas it is virtually identical in size to the heavier tantalum atoms, {{as a result of}} the lanthanide contraction. As a result, niobium's chemical properties are very similar to those for tantalum, which appears directly below niobium in the periodic table. Although its corrosion resistance is not as outstanding as that of tantalum, the lower price and greater availability make niobium attractive for less demanding applications, such as vat linings in chemical plants.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is {{the first}} element in group 13 where the {{reduction}} of the +3 oxidation state to the +1 oxidation state is spontaneous under standard conditions. Since bond energies decrease down the group, by thallium, the energy released in forming two additional bonds and attaining the +3 state is not always enough to outweigh the energy needed to involve the 6s-electrons. Accordingly, thallium(I) oxide and hydroxide are more basic and thallium(III) oxide and hydroxide are more acidic, showing that thallium conforms to the general rule of elements being more <b>electropositive</b> in their lower oxidation states.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing <b>electropositive</b> cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound {{is the result of}} a reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, the result is an acidic salt. If it {{is the result of a}} reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it is the result of a reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E
5|$|The {{side-chain}} of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the substrate. The lone pair {{of electrons}} {{present on the}} oxygen or sulphur attacks the <b>electropositive</b> carbonyl carbon. The 20 naturally occurring biological amino acids do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult catalytic reactions. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the hydroxyl (OH) of serine and the thiol/thiolate ion (SH/S−) of cysteine. Alternatively, threonine proteases use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine, however due to steric hindrance of the side chain's extra methyl group such proteases use their N-terminal amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.|$|E
5|$|Zinc and cadmium are <b>electropositive</b> while {{mercury is}} not. As a result, zinc and cadmium metal are good {{reducing}} agents. The elements of group 12 have an oxidation state of +2 {{in which the}} ions have the rather stable d10 electronic configuration, with a full sub-shell. However, mercury can easily be reduced to the +1 oxidation state; usually, as in the ion , two mercury(I) ions come {{together to form a}} metal-metal bond and a diamagnetic species. Cadmium can also form species such as 4− in which the metal's oxidation state is +1. Just as with mercury, the formation of a metal-metal bond results in a diamagnetic compound in which there are no unpaired electrons; thus, making the species very reactive. Zinc(I) is known only in the gas phase, in such compounds as linear Zn2Cl2, analogous to calomel.|$|E
5|$|Perey {{named the}} new isotope actinium-K (it is now {{referred}} to as francium-223) and in 1946, she proposed the name catium (Cm) for her newly discovered element, as she believed {{it to be the}} most <b>electropositive</b> cation of the elements. Irène Joliot-Curie, one of Perey's supervisors, opposed the name due to its connotation of cat rather than cation; furthermore, the symbol coincided with that which had since been assigned to curium. Perey then suggested francium, after France. This name was officially adopted by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in 1949, becoming the second element after gallium to be named after France. It was assigned the symbol Fa, but this abbreviation was revised to the current Fr shortly thereafter. Francium was the last element discovered in nature, rather than synthesized, following hafnium and rhenium. Further research into francium's structure was carried out by, among others, Sylvain Lieberman and his team at CERN in the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation. In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most <b>electropositive</b> alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.|$|E
5|$|The trends {{going down}} from {{scandium}} and yttrium to lanthanum {{tend to be}} more similar to those going down groups 1 and 2 in the periodic table, while those going down from scandium and yttrium to lutetium {{tend to be more}} similar to those in the early transition metals. Since Sc3+, Y3+, and La3+ still have a low enough charge for their compounds to be predominantly ionic, unlike Ti4+, Zr4+, and Hf4+, {{it has been argued that}} lanthanum and the rest of group 3 should be considered at best atypical transition metals, as their chemistry is focused on the predominantly ionic +3 state and they have a low ability to form coordination compounds or organometallic compounds. Indeed, lanthanum is a strongly <b>electropositive</b> metal, comparable to calcium in electropositivity. The rare earth metals in general are more similar in reactivity to the alkaline earth metals that immediately precede them than to the transition metals proper which follow them.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these <b>electropositive</b> metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E
5|$|Being the {{smallest}} alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds, which are bonded covalently. Organolithium compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, {{and tend to}} form oligomers with the structure (RLi)x where R is the organic group. As the <b>electropositive</b> nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a carbanion, organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. For use as bases, butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ((CH3Li)x), which exists in tetrameric (x = 4, tetrahedral) and hexameric (x = 6, octahedral) forms. Organolithium compounds, especially n-butyllithium, are useful reagents in organic synthesis, {{as might be expected}} given lithium's diagonal relationship with magnesium, which {{plays an important role in}} the Grignard reaction. For example, alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls. The reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl, for example, proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde (using H+ as the electrophile) or ketone (using an alkyl halide) product.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most <b>electropositive</b> {{elements}} on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), forming salts known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable alkali metal halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the alkali metal halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of ununennium {{is predicted to}} be {{similar to that of the}} alkali metals, but it would probably behave more like potassium or rubidium than caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects, would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. the {{chemistry of}} ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkali metal, in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. Many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in francium, which shows some 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in francium superoxide (FrO2). Thus, instead of ununennium being the most <b>electropositive</b> element, as a simple extrapolation would seem to indicate, caesium instead retains this position, with ununennium's electronegativity most likely being close to sodium's (0.93 on the Pauling scale). The standard reduction potential of the Uue+/Uue couple is predicted to be −2.9V.|$|E
25|$|The {{phosphate}} ester is more reactive in organisms than the phosphorothiolate ester, as the phosphorus atoms {{become much more}} <b>electropositive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Elements {{which are}} more <b>electropositive</b> than {{hydrogen}} such as lithium, sodium, calcium, potassium and caesium displace hydrogen from water, forming hydroxides and releasing hydrogen.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to electrowinning, the wanted metal can be isolated by using a molten alloy of an <b>electropositive</b> metal and a less reactive metal.|$|E
25|$|Titanium dioxide is {{incompatible}} with strong reducing agents and strong acids. Violent or incandescent reactions occur with molten metals that are very <b>electropositive,</b> e.g. aluminium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, zinc and lithium.|$|E
25|$|Haloalkanes are {{reactive}} towards nucleophiles. They are polar molecules: {{the carbon}} {{to which the}} halogen is attached is slightly <b>electropositive</b> where the halogen is slightly electronegative. This results in an electron deficient (electrophilic) carbon which, inevitably, attracts nucleophiles.|$|E
25|$|Liquid ammonia will {{dissolve}} the alkali metals and other <b>electropositive</b> metals such as magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, europium and ytterbium. At low concentrations (<0.06nbsp&mol/l), deep blue solutions are formed: these contain metal cations and solvated electrons, free electrons that {{are surrounded by}} a cage of ammonia molecules.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, {{they are}} characterised—to varying degrees—by {{covalent}} bonding tendencies, acid-base amphoterism {{and the formation}} of anionic species such as aluminates, stannates, and bismuthates (in the case of aluminium, tin, and bismuth, respectively). They can also form Zintl phases (half-metallic compounds formed between highly <b>electropositive</b> metals and moderately electronegative metals or metalloids).|$|E
25|$|The chalcogens—the {{elements}} in group 16 of the periodic table—particularly sulfur (S), selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te)—react with more <b>electropositive</b> elements, such as silver, to form chalcogenides. These are extremely versatile compounds, {{in that they}} can be crystalline or amorphous, metallic or semiconducting, and conductors of ions or electrons. Glass containing chalcogenides {{can be used to make}} fibers for far infrared transmission.|$|E
25|$|Carboxylic acids are {{organic acids}} that contain an acidic {{hydroxyl}} group and a carbonyl (C=O bond). Carboxylic acids {{can be reduced}} to the corresponding alcohol; the replacement of an electronegative oxygen atom with two <b>electropositive</b> hydrogens yields a product which is essentially non-acidic. The reduction of acetic acid to ethanol using LiAlH4 (lithium aluminium hydride or LAH) and ether is an example of such a reaction.|$|E
25|$|Mainly, {{this is an}} {{attribute}} of metals, meaning that, in general, the greater the metallic character of an element the greater the electropositivity. Therefore, the alkali metals are most <b>electropositive</b> of all. This is {{because they have a}} single electron in their outer shell and, as this is relatively far from the nucleus of the atom, it is easily lost; in other words, these metals have low ionization energies.|$|E
25|$|One {{of these}} {{advantages}} {{is that the}} compound is available as an air-stable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic. Unlike other oxidizing agents, PCC can accomplish single oxidations with only about 1.5 equivalents (scheme 1). The alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the <b>electropositive</b> chromium (VI) metal displacing chlorine. The chloride anion then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium (IV). The slightly acidic character of PCC makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and alkenes (Scheme 2).|$|E
25|$|When in {{the form}} of {{coordination}} complexes, lanthanides exist overwhelmingly in their +3 oxidation state, although particularly stable 4f configurations can also give +4 (Ce, Tb) or +2 (Eu, Yb) ions. All of these forms are strongly <b>electropositive</b> and thus lanthanide ions are hard Lewis acids. The oxidation states are also very stable and with the exception of SmI2 and cerium(IV) salts lanthanides are not used for redox chemistry. 4f electrons have a high probability of being found close to the nucleus and are thus strongly affected as the nuclear charge increases across the series; this results in a corresponding decrease in ionic radii referred to as the lanthanide contraction.|$|E
25|$|Thorium is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} and <b>electropositive</b> metal. At standard temperature and pressure, it is slowly attacked by water, but does not readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, similarly to uranium and plutonium. At high temperatures, it is easily attacked by oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, the halogens, and sulfur. It can also form binary compounds with carbon and phosphorus. When thorium dissolves in hydrochloric acid, a black insoluble residue, probably ThO(OH,Cl)H, is left behind, similarly to protactinium and uranium.|$|E
25|$|Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) {{sources are}} used {{primarily}} for cation {{analysis of a}} wide array of sample types. In this source, a plasma that is electrically neutral overall, but that has had a substantial fraction of its atoms ionized by high temperature, is used to atomize introduced sample molecules and to further strip the outer electrons from those atoms. The plasma is usually generated from argon gas, since the first ionization energy of argon atoms is higher than the first of any other elements except He, O, F and Ne, but lower than the second ionization energy of all except the most <b>electropositive</b> metals. The heating is achieved by a radio-frequency current passed through a coil surrounding the plasma.|$|E
25|$|A {{compound}} {{is a pure}} {{chemical substance}} composed {{of more than one}} element. The properties of a compound bear little similarity to those of its elements. The standard nomenclature of compounds is set by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Organic compounds are named according to the organic nomenclature system. The names for Inorganic compounds are created according to the inorganic nomenclature system. When a compound has more than one component, then they are divided into two classes, the <b>electropositive</b> and the electronegative components. In addition the Chemical Abstracts Service has devised a method to index chemical substances. In this scheme each chemical substance is identifiable by a number known as its CAS registry number.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} metals in their solid state {{helps to explain}} the unusually high {{electrical}} conductivity of copper. In a copper atom, the outermost 4s energy zone, or conduction band, is only half filled, so many electrons are able to carry electric current. When an electric field is applied to a copper wire, the conduction of electrons accelerates towards the <b>electropositive</b> end, thereby creating a current. These electrons encounter resistance to their passage by colliding with impurity atoms, vacancies, lattice ions, and imperfections. The average distance travelled between collisions, defined as the “mean free path,” is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the metal. What is unique about copper is its long mean free path (approximately 100 atomic spacings at room temperature). This mean free path increases rapidly as copper is chilled.|$|E
