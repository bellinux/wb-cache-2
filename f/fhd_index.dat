40|$|Mutations in the low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) receptor gene {{are responsible for}} familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). At present, more than 600 mutations in this gene are known to underlie FH. However, the array of mutations varies considerably in different populations. Therefore, the delineation of essentially all LDL-receptor gene mutations in a population {{is a prerequisite for}} the implementation of nation-wide genetic testing for FH. In the Netherlands, mutation analysis by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing in 1641 clinically diagnosed FH patients resulted in the characterization of 159 different LDL-receptor gene defects.

We found a significant and independent effect of the following polymorphisms on: (i) plasma LDL-C (Apo E, MTP and Apo B); (ii) plasma HDL-C (HL, FABP- 2 and LPL S 447 X); (iii) plasma triglycerides (Apo E and Apo A-V).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) affects 1 in 500 {{people in}} the UK {{population}} and is associated with premature morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease. In 2008, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended genetic testing of potential <b>FH</b> <b>index</b> cases and cascade testing of their relatives. Commissioners {{have been slow to}} respond although there is strong evidence of cost and clinical effectiveness. Our study quantifies the recent reduced cost of providing a FH service using generic atorvastatin and compares NICE costing estimates with three suggested alternative models of care (a specialist-led service, a dual model service where general practitioners (GPs) can access specialist advice, and a GP-led service). METHODS: Revision of existing 3 ?year costing template provided by NICE for FH services, and prediction of costs for running a programme over 10 ?years. Costs were modelled for the first population-based FH service in England which covers Southampton, Hampshire, Isle of Wight and Portsmouth (SHIP). Population 1. 95 million. RESULTS: With expiry of the Lipitor (Pfizer atorvastatin) patent the cost of providing a 10 -year FH service in SHIP reduces by 42. 5 % (£ 4. 88 million on patent vs £ 2. 80 million off patent). Further cost reductions are possible {{as a result of the}} reduced cost of DNA testing, more management in general practice, and lower referral rates to specialists. For instance a dual-care model with GP management of patients supported by specialist advice when required, costs £ 1. 89 million. CONCLUSIONS: The three alternative models of care are now < 50 % of the cost of the original estimates undertaken by NICE...|$|R

Although age and gender are believed to modify the pituitary set point or response to free thyroid hormone concentration, the precise age- and gender-dependent responses to thyroid hormone have yet to be reported. Methods We analyzed the results of 3564 thyroid function tests obtained from patients who received medication at both out- and inpatient clinics of Shinshu University Hospital. Subjects were from among those with thyroid function test results in the normal or mildly abnormal range. Based on a log-linear relationship between the concentrations of FHs and TSH, we established the putative resistance index to assess the relation between serum FH and TSH levels.

40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic disease characterised by strikingly elevated plasma cholesterol concentration, {{which can lead to}} premature coronary death if left untreated. In this study DNA diagnosis of FH, which allows detection before onset of clinical symptoms, was evaluated against biochemical parameters routinely used to identify subjects with FH. Design. A population-based strategy was used to identify low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene defects in South Africans with clinical signs of FH, followed by a family-based DNA screening approach for presymptomatic diagnosis of FH. Results. DNA screening of 790 at-risk relatives for the FH-related mutations identified in 379 index cases, allowed accurate disease diagnosis in an additional 338 relatives and exclusion of the relevant mutation in 452 individuals. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis, based on total cholesterol values measured in family members of <b>FH</b> heterozygous <b>index</b> cases with one of the three founder-related mutations, D 154 N, D 206 E and V 408 M, were 89. 3 % and 81. 9 %, respectively. Conclusion. The predominance of 10 LDLR gene mutations in the local populations justifies population-directed DNA diagnosis of FH in South Africa on a routine basis, particularly since expression of the defective gene measured in biochemical tests does not allow accurate diagnosis of FH in all cases. DNA testing provides a definitive tool for family tracing aimed at pre-clinical diagnosis and preventive treatment of FH. Publisher’s versio...|$|R

40|$|Background: On-therapy impedance-pH {{monitoring}} in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) -refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) yielded conflicting results. We {{aimed to}} assess the diagnostic value of postreflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave (PSPW) index and mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) in PPI-refractory heartburn. Methods: On-therapy impedance-pH tracings from 189 consecutive patients with PPI-refractory heartburn were blindly reviewed. Patients were subdivided into refractory reflux esophagitis (RRE), healed reflux esophagitis (HRE), non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), and functional heartburn (FH) according to endoscopic and conventional impedance-pH findings. The diagnostic accuracy of PSPW index and MNBI in separating NERD from FH was assessed with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis. Objectively documented persistent reflux remission at 3 -year follow-up in 53 patients who underwent laparoscopic fundoplication served to evaluate PSPW index and MNBI as independent predictors of PPI-refractory GERD confirmed by positive surgical outcome. Key Results: Median PSPW index and MNBI values were significantly lower in 39 RRE (16 %; 1145  Ω) than in 41 HRE (25 %; 1741  Ω) and in 68 NERD (29 %; 2374  Ω) patients, and in all three GERD subgroups compared to 41 FH cases (67 %; 3488  Ω) (P<. 008). At ROC analysis, comparing NERD to FH the area under the curve was 0. 886 with PSPW index and 0. 677 with MNBI (P=. 005). PSPW index was an independent predictor of PPI-refractory GERD (odds ratio 0. 6983, P=. 012).

In {{comparison}} with paragangliomas {{located in the}} abdomen and the chest, which are generally catecholamine secreting (sPGLs) and sympathetic in origin, HNPGLs are, in fact, parasympathetic in origin and are generally nonsecreting. Overall, 79 consecutive patients with HNPGL were examined for mutations in SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF 2, VHL, MAX, and TMEM 127 genes by PCR/sequencing. According to a detailed family history (FH) and clinical, laboratory (including metanephrines), and instrumental examinations, patients were divided into three groups: a) patients with a positive <b>FH</b> for HNPGL (<b>index</b> cases only), b) patients with a negative FH and multiple HNPGLs (synchronous or metachronous) or HNPGL associated with an sPGL, and c) patients with negative FH and single HNPGL. The ten patients in group a) proved to be SDHD mutation carriers. The 16 patients in group b) proved to be SDHD mutation carriers. Among the 53 patients in group c), ten presented with germ-line mutations (three SDHB, three SDHD, two VHL, and two SDHAF 2). An sPGL was found at diagnosis or followed up in five patients (6. 3 %), all were SDHD mutation carriers. No SDHC, SDHA, MAX, and TMEM 127 mutations were found. In SDHD mutation carriers, none of the patients affected by HNPGL associated with sPGL presented missense mutations. In conclusion, a positive FH or the presence of multiple HNPGLs is a strong predictor for germ-line mutations, which are also present in 18. 8 % of patients carefully classified as sporadic. The most frequently mutated gene so far is SDHD but others, including SDHB, SDHAF 2, and VHL, may also be affected...|$|R
40|$|Familial {{hypercholesterolemia}} (FH) 5 is classically a {{monogenic disorder}} that delays the hepatic catabolism of LDL particles, {{resulting in a}} marked increase in the plasma concentration of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and accelerated coronary artery disease (CAD) (1). Heterozy-gous FH may be as prevalent as 1 in 200 in the popula-tion (2), and treatment with statins mitigates the risk of CAD (1, 2). The genetic causes of FH and related autosomal-dominant hypercholesterolemias include mu-tations in LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor), 6 of which 1200 have hitherto been described, and less commonly mutations in APOB (apolipoprotein B) and PCSK 9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) (1, 2). In certain countries (1), but not the US (3), DNA testing is recommended to confirm a diagnosis of <b>FH</b> in an <b>index</b> patient and to cascade-screen families to identify new cases of FH. This is supported by health economic evaluations and {{by the fact that}} the clinical expression of the disorder can be diminished, particularly in the young, leading to false reassurance and undertreatment of at-risk family members (1, 2). However, in up to 30 % of phenotypically frank FH, a pathogenic mutation can-not be detected (1, 2). These individuals may well carry single mutations in known or unknown FH genes that can-not be detected by conventional methods, but it is more likely that a significant proportionhavepolygenichypercho-lesterolemia (PHC). That is, they have inherited a greater-than-average number of common, cholesterol-raising ge-netic variants that, collectively, have a large effect on the plasma concentration of LDL-C (4). But how can PHC be diagnosed, and is it important to distinguish it from FH? In this issue of Clinical Chem-istry, Futema et al. describe a simplified LDL-C gene score to assist in the diagnosis of PHC (5). They studied 7 replication cohorts of FH subjects from 6 countries (Greek and Dutch children and adults from the Nether...|$|R
