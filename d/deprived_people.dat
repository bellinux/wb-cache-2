In the United Kingdom context, this is demonstrated by Ahmed v. H.M. Treasury (No. 1) (2010). The Treasury had exercised powers to freeze the appellants' financial assets and economic resources {{on the ground that}} it reasonably suspected the appellants were or might be persons who had committed, attempted to commit, participated in or facilitated the commission of terrorism, pursuant to the Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 and the Al-Qaida and Taliban (United Nations Measures) Order 2006 made under the United Nations Act 1946. The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom held that since the Al-Qaida Order made no provision for basic procedural fairness, it effectively <b>deprived</b> <b>people</b> designated under the order the fundamental right of access to a judicial remedy and hence was ultra vires the power conferred by the United Nations Act 1946 for the making of the Order.|$|E

"Vulnerability" [...] in {{this case}} stands for the {{underlying}} susceptibility of economically <b>deprived</b> <b>people</b> to fall into poverty {{as a result of}} exogenous random shocks. Vulnerable households are generally found to have low expenditure levels. Households are considered vulnerable if {{they do not have the}} means to smooth out their expenses in response to changes in income. In general, vulnerability is likely to be high in households clustered around the poverty line. Since coping strategies for vulnerable households depend primarily on their sources of income, exogenous shocks can increase reliance on non-agricultural wages. Such diversification has not occurred in many parts of Pakistan, leading to an increased dependence on credit.|$|E
