25|$|A related species, Panopea zelandica, {{is found}} in New Zealand and has been {{harvested}} commercially since 1989.

Whether these microsporidium-like parasitic species were introduced by commercial farming is being studied by Sea Grant. Research to date does indicate their presence.|$|E

2500|$|Drug {{resistance}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>growing</b> <b>concern</b> {{for many}} horse owners. Resistance {{has been noted}} with ivermectin to ascarids, and with fenbendazole, oxibendazole, and pyrantel to small strongyles. [...] Development of new drugs takes many years, leading to the concern that worms could out-evolve the drugs currently available to treat them. As a result, most veterinarians now recommend deworming for small strongyles based on fecal egg counts to minimize the development of resistant parasite populations. Fecal egg count reduction tests can also be performed to identify which dewormers are effective on a particular farm.|$|E
