40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the genetic and epigenetic landscape of <b>hypodiploid</b> (&lt; 45 chromosomes) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphism array, whole exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and methylation array {{analyses were performed}} on eleven <b>hypodiploid</b> ALL cases. Results: In line with previous studies, mutations in IKZF 3 and FLT 3 were detected in near-haploid (25 - 30 chromosomes) cases. Low hypodiploidy (31 - 39 chromosomes) was associated with somatic TP 53 mutations. Notably, mutations of this gene were also found in 3 / 3 high <b>hypodiploid</b> (40 - 44 chromosomes) cases, suggesting that the mutational patterns are similar in low <b>hypodiploid</b> and high <b>hypodiploid</b> ALL. The high <b>hypodiploid</b> ALLs frequently displayed substantial cell-to-cell variability in chromosomal content, indicative of chromosomal instability; a rare phenomenon in ALL. Gene expression analysis showed that genes on heterodisomic chromosomes were more highly expressed in <b>hypodiploid</b> cases. Cases clustered according to <b>hypodiploid</b> subtype in the unsupervised methylation analyses, {{but there was no}} association between chromosomal copy number and methylation levels. A comparison between samples obtained at diagnosis and relapse showed that the relapse did not arise from the major diagnostic clone in 3 / 4 cases. Conclusion: Taken together, our data support the conclusion that near-haploid and low <b>hypodiploid</b> ALL are different with regard to mutational profiles and also suggest that ALL cases with high hypodiploidy may harbor chromosomal instability.

40|$|In vitro {{techniques}} offer {{opportunity to}} broaden genetic variability by overcoming reproductive barriers between crop species. As an initial step for {{the exploitation of}} such techniques, we have established regeneration protocols for cultivated and wild sorghum species. The latter are important sources of insect resistance. The present study deals with immature inflorescence culture and cytogenetic stability of a wild Parasorghum species viz., Sorghum australiense (2 n= 20). Regeneration was observed at high frequency (= 80 %) on MS medium supplemented with kinetin (1. 0 mg/l) and benzyladenine (BAP; 1. 0 mg/l). Meiotic analysis of regenerants revealed somaclonal variation among regenerants from 12 -month-old cultures. Chromosomal variations like aneuploids, <b>hypodiploids,</b> quadrivalent associations and tetraploids {{were found in the}} regenerated plants. RAPD analysis with PCR revealed polymorphism in these cytological variants. The protocol developed here might be used as a basis for achieving high frequency of regeneration and generating cytogenetic variants. Some of the variants might be useful in conventional breeding programs and for gene transfer studies from wild to cultivated species by somatic hybridization...|$|R
40|$|Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV 2) is the causative {{agent of}} postweaning {{multisystemic}} wasting syndrome in pigs. In this study, transcription and translation {{of a novel}} viral gene (termed ORF 3 here) was detected during productive infection of PCV 2 in PK 15 cells. The results of infection with ORF 3 -deficient PCV 2 by site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the protein is not essential for viral replication. To investigate the underlying mechanism of cell death caused by replication of PCV 2, apoptosis characterized by chromosomal condensation and fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies, and significant increase in <b>hypodiploids</b> were detected in infected cells. We further demonstrated that PCV 2 -induced apoptosis required the activation of caspase- 8 but not caspase- 9. The activation of caspase- 8 results in the activation of caspase- 3 as shown {{by an increase in}} the cleavage of the caspase substrate in the infected cells. To determine whether ORF 3 protein could trigger apoptosis, ORF 3 as well as ORF 1 and ORF 2 genes were transiently expressed in PK 15 and Cos- 7 cells for apoptotic activity assay. Transfection of cells with the ORF 3 alone induced apoptosis using a pathway similar to that described in the context of viral infection. This is further confirmed by a significant decrease in apoptotic activity of infected cells {{in the absence of the}} ORF 3 expression, suggesting that the protein plays a major role in the induction of virus-induced apoptosis. Altogether, these results indicate that ORF 3 is a novel PCV 2 protein that is not essential for viral replication in cultured cells but is involved in PCV 2 -induced apoptosis by activating caspase- 8 and caspase- 3 pathways...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of somatic genetic aberrations {{in breast cancer}} has remained poorly understood. The most common chromosomal abnormality is hyperdiploidy, which is thought to arise via a transient <b>hypodiploid</b> state. However, hypodiploidy persists in 1 to 2 % of breast tumors, which are characterized by a poor prognosis. We studied the genetic aberrations in 15 flow cytometrically <b>hypodiploid</b> breast cancers by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). Surprisingly, numerous copy number gains were detected in addition to the copy number losses. The number of gains per tumor was 4. 3 +/- 3. 2 and that of losses was 4. 5 +/- 3. 3 (mean +/- SD), which is similar to that previously observed in hyperdiploid breast cancers. Gains at chromosomes or chromosomal regions at 11 q 13, 1 q, 19, and 16 p and losses of 2 q, 4, 6 q, 9 p, 13, and 18 were most commonly observed. Compared with unselected breast carcinomas, <b>hypodiploid</b> tumors showed certain differences. Loss of chromosome 4 (53 %) and gain of 11 q 13 (60 %) were significantly more common in <b>hypodiploid</b> tumors. The gain at 11 q 13 was found by FISH to harbor amplification of the Cyclin D 1 oncogene, which is therefore three to four times more common in <b>hypodiploid</b> than in unselected breast cancers (15 to 20 %). Structural chromosomal aberrations (such as Cyclin D 1 amplification) were present both in diploid and <b>hypodiploid</b> tumor cell populations, as assessed by FISH and CGH after flow cytometric sorting. Together these results indicate that <b>hypodiploid</b> tumors form a distinct genetic entity of invasive breast cancer, although they probably share a common genetic evolution pathway where structural chromosomal aberrations precede gross DNA ploidy changes...|$|E
40|$|Cytogenetic and DNA flow cytometric {{analyses}} of leukemic cells from 2, 184 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified 27 cases (1. 2 %) {{that had a}} <b>hypodiploid</b> line with fewer than 45 chromo-somes per cell.

40|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) affects {{individuals}} at all ages, with peak incidences in children 50 years.

40|$|Conventional karyotypes {{performed}} {{before any}} treatment in 208 patients with multiple myeloma were {{reviewed by the}} Groupe Français de Cytogénétique Hématologique. A total of 138 patients displayed complex chromosomal abnormalities (CCAs). According to the chromosome number pattern, a first group of 75 patients had a hyperdiploid karyotype. A second group of 63 patients {{referred to as the}} <b>hypodiploid</b> group had either pseudodiploid, <b>hypodiploid,</b> or near-tetraploid karyotypes. Of 159 treated patients available for survival analysis, 116 had an abnormal karyotype. The comparison of overall survival (OS) between hyperdiploid and <b>hypodiploid</b> patients showed a highly significant difference (median OS 33. 8 vs 12. 6 months, respectively, P <. 001). The presence of 14 q 32 rearrangements (36 of 116 patients) worsened the prognosis (median OS 17. 6 vs 29. 9 months, P <. 02). The presence of chromosome 13 q abnormalities (13 qA, 63 patients) did not modify OS in CCA patients (median OS 20. 6 vs 27. 8 months, P <. 59). However, taking into account the whole series including normal karyotypes, 13 qA (63 of 159 patients) {{had a significant impact on}} OS (median 20. 6 vs 37. 1 months, P <. 04). In the same way, the presence of a <b>hypodiploid</b> karyotype (52 of 159 patients) had a strong prognostic value (OS 12. 8 vs 44. 5 months, P <. 000 01). A multivariate analysis including stage, beta 2 -microglobulin, bone marrow plasmocytosis, treatment type, 13 qA, and hyperdiploidy and hypodiploidy showed that a <b>hypodiploid</b> karyotype was the first independent factor for OS (P <. 001), followed by treatment approach.

Indirect immunoperoxidase reactivity of Ki- 67 on frozen tumour tissue sections was evaluated both visually, using a classical semiquantitative scale, and by means of a computer-assisted image processor. Cell DNA content analysis was done using static computer-assisted cytometry on tumour cytological prints stained by the pararosaline Feulgen-Schiff technique. The ploidy was characterised for each tumour by DNA index (DI), percentage of <b>hypodiploid</b> cells and type of DNA content histogram (near diploid, hyperdiploid, <b>hypodiploid</b> and multiploid). Ki- 67 immunostaining was negative in 64 tumours (48 %) and positive in 69 (52 %). DNA histogram classification disclosed 57 (42 %) near diploid tumours. Among the 80 (58 %) aneuploid tumours, 16 were <b>hypodiploid,</b> 44 hyperdiploid and 20 multiploid. The prevalence of both a positive Ki- 67 immunostaining and an aneuploid DNA histogram differed according to histology as SCLC demonstrated a higher frequency of both features when compared with NSCLC and carcinoid tumours. On the other hand, Ki- 67 immunostaining and ploidy did not significantly differ according to degree of differentiation, nodal status and Mountain's stage grouping. The percentage of cells in the <b>hypodiploid</b> modal DNA was significantly higher for tumours which demonstrated a high Ki- 67 immunostaining, suggesting a link between growth fraction and DNA content abnormalities. In univariate analysis, survival did not differ significantly according to either the Ki- 67 immunohistochemical reactivity or the DNA index. Patients with a <b>hypodiploid</b> tumour had a shorter survival than patients with other DNA histogram patterns but, owing to the low frequency of hypodiploidy, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In Cox's proportional hazard model, an SCLC histology, an advanced tumour status, a positive nodal status and a <b>hypodiploid</b> tumour (hazard ratio: 2. 070; 95 % confidence interval 1. 041 - 4. 116) were significant determinants of survival.

The DNA fragmentation had a left‐skewed frequency distribution and an overall median value of 1. 64 %, whilst the median %S‐phase fraction was 8 %. The median %DNA fragmentation and %S‐phase fraction were 1. 96 % and 16 % in hyperdiploid tumours (n= 29; DNA index > 1. 1) {{higher than in}} <b>hypodiploid</b> tumors (n= 10; DNA index 0. 96), 0. 38 % and 7. 5 %. DNA diploid tumours (n= 71) had median %DNA fragmentation and %S‐phase values of 1. 68 % and 6 %, consistently lower than the median values of DNA hyperdiploid tumours. The ER content of <b>hypodiploid</b> tumours was about one half (median: 5. 9 fmol/mg) the median values in hyperdiploid (10. 6 fmol/mg) and diploid tumours (14. 6 fmol/mg).

The near-haploid and low <b>hypodiploid</b> groups were characterized by their chromosomal gains and a doubled hyperdiploid population. Structural abnormalities were more frequent in the low <b>hypodiploid</b> group.

To determine apoptotic cells, concentration of cytochrome c in the cytosol fraction, caspase- 9 and - 3 activities, and the percentage of the cells with <b>hypodiploid</b> DNA were measured quantitatively by flow cytometric assay or ELISA. The expression of Bcl- 2 -related proteins was examined by Western blot analysis. Amiodarone induced cytochrome c release into the cytosol fraction, activation of caspase- 9 and caspase- 3, and the occurrence of <b>hypodiploid</b> cells beginning at 10 μg/ml in the HepG 2 cells. However, 2. 5 μg/ml of amiodarone, a clinically attainable serum level, did not significantly. The expression of Bcl-xL but neither Bcl- 2 nor Bax was decreased in the amiodarone-treated cells. Thus, amiodarone-induced cell death related with cytochrome c release and caspases in the HepG 2 cells, suggesting that the drug causes hepatic toxicity in part through the induction of apoptosis. It is our conclusion that the amiodarone-induced apoptosis of HepG 2 cells proceeds via the mitochondrial pathway, and is mediated by the downregulation of Bcl-xL...|$|E
40|$|Genomic {{exclusion}} (GE) is {{an abnormal}} form of conjugation which {{has previously been}} described in detail for three <b>hypodiploid</b> strains of Tetrahymena thermophila. These strains cannot form gametic nuclei and by failing to participate in normal reciprocal fertilization their genes are excluded from exconjugants. To determine whether GE is a general property of infertile strains, we surveyed genetically and cytogenetically 19 additional strains of T. thermophila to determine why they failed to contribute genes to sexual progeny. Crosses to genetically marked tester strains showed that seventeen of these strains undergo GE. In each case GE appears {{to be due to}} the failure of the defective partner to form functional gametic nuclei. The normal conjugant, however, contributes to its defective partner a haploid nucleus identical to its own, and following diploidization of the unfertilized nuclei, the conjugants separate retaining the old macronuclei. Cytofluorimetric measurement of micronuclear DNA content in 18 strains suggests that aneuploidy is the proximate cause of GE; eleven strains were <b>hypodiploid,</b> five were diploid and three were hyperdiploid. Many irregular cytogenetic events were observed in conjugants presumably not undergoing GE, including, in some instances, abnormal meiosis in the normal partner. Since genomic exclusion was found in both wildtype and mutant clones, the results suggest that it should be possible by appropriate crosses to identify genomic exclusion strains of any genotype...|$|E
40|$|In this {{retrospective}} study of lymphomas, DNA content and proliferative index of 37 histopathologically confirmed cases of lymphoma consisting of 29 male and 8 female were measured using a flowcytometer. This {{was carried out}} using paraffin embedded tissues of cases diagnosed in the Department of Pathology, Hospital Kuala Lumpur, {{over a period of}} 1990 to 1995. Among them, 24 were diagnosed to be non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) while 13 were diagnosed as Hodgkin’s disease (HD). Lymph nodes showing reactive changes and tonsils removed for chronic inflammation were used as control. Of all the cases studied for NHL (B cell = 70. 8 %, T cell = 8. 3 % and unclassified cases = 20. 9 %), 12. 5 % were near diploid (DNA index, DI = 1. 0 - 1. 10), 66. 7 % were hyperdiploid (DI = 1. 10 - 1. 85) and 20. 8 % were <b>hypodiploid</b> (DI < 1. 0). Majority of the hyperdiploid cases were B cell type of NHL. In HD (mixed cellularity = 1, nodular sclerosing = 5, lymphocyte predominant = 1 and unclassified = 6) 30. 8 % were near diploid, 46. 1 % were hyperdiploid and 23. 1 % were <b>hypodiploid.</b> The significant finding of this study was {{that the majority of the}} NHL and HD showed a high proliferative index...|$|E

The present report demonstrates that in vitro, CAEV infection {{is associated with}} apoptosis, characterized by morphological changes such as condensation of chromatin {{and the appearance of}} apoptotic bodies. The presence of DNA fragments was documented by the appearance of a DNA ‘ladder ’ in agarose gel electrophoresis, as well as by in situ end-labelling of DNA ends. In addition, flow cytometric analyses revealed the presence of a <b>hypodiploid</b> peak that gradually appeared as virus infection progressed.

40|$|Abstract In this study, {{quantitative}} DNA estimation (DNA ploidy), AgNORs and koilocytotic {{changes were}} assessed in oral leukoplakia for risk categorization. Materials and methods: 50 cases of oral leukoplakias along with adequate controls {{were selected for}} the study. Quantitative DNA analysis was done by FACS scan. AgNORs were studied by silver staining method, koilocytotic changes and histopathology were studied in HE stained tissue sections. Results: Out of 50 cases, 45 cases (90 %) were linked to traditional addiction of various forms and 5 cases (10 %) were non-addicts. Histologically, there were 52 % non dysplastic and 48 % dysplastic cases. Out of these 50 cases, there were diploid, tetrapoid and aneuploid population including <b>hypodiploid</b> DNA content. The DNA index (DI), among these cases, were ranged from 0. 22 (<b>hypodiploid)</b> to 2. 12 (tetrapoid) (co-efficient of variation ranged from 0. 39 to 18. 43). The mean AgNOR count for smokers were 3. 5 ± 2. 058 whereas the mean AgNOR count for the betel quid group was 2. 85 ± 1. 47 and for khaini- gutka group was 3. 67 ± 2. 21. Less than 50 % cases showed positivity for koilocytotic changes (20 out of 50 cases). Conclusion: The quantitative DNA (ploidy) study along with AgNORs can be considered dually as a prospective prognostic marker for cancer risk prediction in cases of oral leukoplakia. But koilocytotic changes for the HPV association as a marker for risk prediction in cases of ora...|$|E
40|$|AbstractChildren with <b>hypodiploid</b> acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have {{inferior}} outcomes despite intensive risk-adapted chemotherapy regimens. We describe 78 {{children with}} <b>hypodiploid</b> ALL who underwent {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation between 1990 and 2010. Thirty-nine (50 %) patients had ≤ 43 chromosomes, 12 (15 %) had 44 chromosomes, and 27 (35 %) had 45 chromosomes. Forty-three (55 %) patients underwent transplantation in first remission (CR 1) and 35 (45 %) underwent transplantation in ≥ second remission (CR 2). Twenty-nine patients (37 %) received a graft from a related donor and 49 (63 %) from an unrelated donor. All patients received a myeloablative conditioning regimen. The 5 -year probabilities of leukemia-free survival, overall survival, relapse, and treatment-related mortality for the entire cohort were 51 %, 56 %, 27 %, and 22 %, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed that mortality risks were higher for patients who underwent transplantation in CR 2 (hazard ratio, 2. 16; P =. 05), with number of chromosomes ≤ 43 (hazard ratio, 2. 15; P =. 05), {{and for those who}} underwent transplantation {{in the first decade of}} the study period (hazard ratio, 2. 60; P =. 01). Similarly, treatment failure risks were higher with number of chromosomes ≤ 43 (hazard ratio, 2. 28; P =. 04) and the earlier transplantation period (hazard ratio, 2. 51; P =. 01). Although survival is better with advances in donor selection and supportive care, disease-related risk factors significantly influence transplantation outcomes...|$|E
