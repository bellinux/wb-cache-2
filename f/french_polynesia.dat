5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone Wasa–Arthur was {{the first}} major {{tropical}} cyclone to affect <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia</b> and Tahiti since the 1982–83 season. The system was first noted on December 3, 1991 as a shallow tropical depression that was embedded within the monsoon trough, {{to the north of the}} Cook Island: Rarotonga. Over the next couple of days the system gradually developed further, before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Wasa during December 5. The system gradually strengthened further and acquired hurricane-force winds on December 6, as it performed a small clockwise loop. After completing the loop, Wasa moved southwards before it peaked in intensity during December 8, with sustained wind speeds of 165km/h (105mph). Over the next few days the system started to weaken as it passed through the French Polynesian Society Islands, and became the first major tropical cyclone to affect <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia</b> since 1983.|$|E
5|$|During November 2002, New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research {{predicted}} {{that there would}} be an eastwards shift in activity during the season, with more tropical cyclones than normal expected to the east of the date line, due to well established weak to moderate El Niño conditions. As a result, the island nations of Wallis and Futuna, Niue, Samoa, Tokelau, and the Southern Cook Islands were predicted to experience a higher than average number of tropical cyclones. The Solomon Islands, Fiji, Tuvalu, Tonga, <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia,</b> New Zealand and the Northern Cook Islands were predicted to experience an average number of tropical cyclones, while Southern Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and New Caledonia were predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones. In January 2003, NIWA issued an updated outlook, listing the Northern Cook Islands and <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia</b> as areas predicted to experience an above average number of tropical cyclones. In contrast, Vanuatu was predicted to experience below average cyclone activity. The Solomon Islands and Tonga were now predicted to experience a reduced number of tropical cyclones, with all other countries expected to face the same risk as the November outlook.|$|E

5|$|Grey reef {{sharks are}} prey for larger sharks, {{such as the}} silvertip shark. At Rangiroa Atoll in <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia,</b> great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that attach to the sharks' skin, and juvenile stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that attach to the gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).|$|E
5|$|King Teuruarii IV {{was born}} Prince Epatiana in around 1879 {{on the island}} of Rurutu, in present-day <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia,</b> to King Teuruarii III and his second wife Taarouru a Mootua. His family was {{originally}} from a chiefly line in Huahine rather than Rurutu, and it was only through the adoption of his father by King Teuruarii I that his family was eligible to rule. The island of Rurutu was settled later than many of the surrounding islands and was historically ruled as an unoccupied territory by the earliest kings of the archipelago. Including these early kings, the royal line of Epatiana stretched back more than forty generations and included many of the founding chiefs of the Austral Islands kingdoms, as well as early kings of Rurutu after the settlement of the island. Little is recorded of the prince's childhood, although it is known that Epatiana and his parents were visited by the French writer and later governor of <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia,</b> Édouard Petit, in the early 1880s, when the young prince Epatiana was still nursing from his mother.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone brought major {{damage to}} some islands in <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia.</b> Around 95% of the {{infrastructure}} in Maupiti was destroyed, including 77 homes, an airport, and a town hall. About 30% {{of the infrastructure}} in Bora-Bora was destroyed, as well as 309 homes and many yachts. Many roads were also damaged.

5|$|Encarsia formosa {{is a small}} predatory {{chalcid wasp}} which is a {{parasitoid}} of whitefly, a sap-feeding insect which can cause wilting and black sooty moulds in glasshouse vegetable and ornamental crops. It is most effective when dealing with low level infestations, giving protection {{over a long period}} of time. The wasp lays its eggs in young whitefly 'scales', turning them black as the parasite larvae pupate. Gonatocerus ashmeadi (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) has been introduced to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter Homalodisca vitripennis (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) in <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia</b> and has successfully controlled ~95% of the pest density.|$|E
5|$|Osea was {{the second}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia</b> during the season; Cyclone Martin had impacted the islands a few weeks earlier. In {{the aftermath of the}} storm, disaster aid was delivered to the victims of Osea. President Gaston Flosse, accompanied by technicians, arrived in Maupiti to help repair the island's electrical and hydraulic systems. A Latter-Day Saint meeting house was used as an emergency shelter, though the house itself sustained minor damage from the storm. The name Osea was later retired from the South Pacific list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

5|$|Vanilla tahitensis (Tahitian vanilla), {{which is}} a cross-strain of Vanilla planifola (Mexican vanilla and Bourbon vanilla) and Vanilla odorata (Inflated Vanilla), is {{produced}} in <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia,</b> especially in Tahiti, and also Hawaii. Its pods have fewer seeds than Vanilla planifolia, {{which is not a}} direct competitor. Mexican vanilla is used almost exclusively as the base of vanilla extract, due to higher vanillin levels. Tahitian vanilla is used primarily in perfume because of its coumarin-like scent. Other Tahitian vanilla products include vanilla green tea, vanilla oil, vanilla powder, vanilla rum, and vinegar-based vanilla.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla, {{originally}} a crop endemic to South America, {{was introduced in}} <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia</b> in 1848 by Admiral Ferdinand-Alphonse Hamelin, a French commander in the Pacific. The admiral delivered several dozen specimens of the plant to the Tahitian Governor's garden in Papeete. A new variety of vanilla was subsequently developed {{in the area and}} came to be popularly known as Tahitian vanilla. This has special characteristics compared to the varieties such as Vanilla planifolia grown {{in other parts of the}} world, particularly in respect to taste and scent. It has resulted in greater demand for the Tahitian variety.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Osea was {{extremely}} destructive {{to some of}} the islands in <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia.</b> Over 700homes were destroyed or severely damaged on Maupiti, Bora-Bora, and Raiatea. Several roofs were blown off of buildings across the archipelago. On Maupiti, an island with a population of 1,100, about 95% of the infrastructure was destroyed. The town hall, twoschools, and an airfield were destroyed. The town hall was originally being used as an emergency shelter, but was later evacuated due to strong winds and was later destroyed.

5|$|Teuruarii's reign was {{disrupted}} by ongoing French expansionism in the Pacific. Teuruarii entreated the British to place Rurutu under a British protectorate, which the islanders deemed more favorable {{due to their}} predominant adherence to Protestantantism. These efforts failed and Rurutu was proclaimed a protectorate of the French Third Republic on 27 March 1889. Teuruarii was allowed to continue ruling as king until the annexation of the island to the territory of French Oceania in 1900, today part of the overseas country of <b>French</b> <b>Polynesia.</b> Living out {{the remainder of his}} life as a village chief, Teuruarii left many descendants who would have a strong influence in the islands to the modern day.|$|E

They were {{closely related to the}} Hawaiian Poi Dog and the New Zealand kurī; the latter is believed to be a descendant of the breed. Similar breeds of Polynesian dogs were brought alongside pigs and chickens when the people settled the islands of Polynesia. The Marquesan Dog became extinct in the neighboring Marquesas Islands before 1595. Even though dogs were virtually absent from Western Polynesia, they were recognized when European explorers later brought them as items of trade, indicating a universal cultural recognition of the dog in the many islands.|$|E
