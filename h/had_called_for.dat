5|$|At around 1:30am {{the tide}} had risen {{enough to allow}} the LFEE's {{floating}} fire engine to arrive on the scene. Braidwood <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the engine five hours previously, but the low tide had hampered its progress from its downriver mooring at Rotherhithe. Once it arrived it was effective in bringing under control the fire that had taken hold in the Speaker's House.|$|E
5|$|O'Brien {{was also}} {{equipped}} with four twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> two anti-aircraft guns for the O'Brien-class ships, {{as well as}} provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines. From sources, it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for O'Brien {{or any of the}} other ships of the class.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, 239 {{political}} parties {{at both the}} state and national level had pledged some form of direct election, and 33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries. Twenty-seven states <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.|$|E

He <b>has</b> also <b>called</b> <b>for</b> welfare and government support for older Singaporeans and their caregivers to be more accessible. Chen and his fellow WP colleagues <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> acknowledging the contributions of matured Singaporean workers.|$|R
50|$|She {{opposes the}} Iran nuclear deal and <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> strict new {{sanctions}} on Iran. Ayotte has also backed new sanctions on North Korea {{in the wake}} of purported nuclear tests and <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a tougher stance with Russia.|$|R
5|$|Despite Nerva's {{measures}} to remain {{popular with the}} Senate and the Roman people, support for Domitian remained strong in the army, which <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> his deification immediately after the assassination. In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard, Nerva had dismissed their prefect Titus Petronius Secundus—one of the chief conspirators against Domitian—and replaced him with a former commander, Casperius Aelianus.|$|E
5|$|In the Politburo Podgorny {{could count}} on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Podgorny was {{constantly}} in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo. When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the expansion of Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|Initially, this protest did not {{attract a}} great deal of attention, and even the IRA {{regarded}} it as a side-issue compared to their armed campaign. It began to attract attention when Tomás Ó Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison and condemned the conditions there. In 1979, former MP Bernadette McAliskey stood in the election for the European Parliament on a platform of support for the protesting prisoners, and won 5.9% of the vote across Northern Ireland, even though Sinn Féin <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a boycott of the election.|$|E
50|$|The Stop Coal {{campaign}} <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> {{a moratorium}} {{on the construction of}} any new coal plants and for the phase out of all existing plants, citing concern for global warming. Others <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a carbon tax and a requirement of carbon sequestration for all coal power plants.|$|R

5|$|Muhammad Jamal Al-Durrah (born 1988) was {{in fifth}} grade, but his school was closed on 30 September 2000; the Palestinian Authority <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> {{a general strike}} and day of {{mourning}} following violence in Jerusalem the day before. His mother {{said he had been}} watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so they went to the auction together.|$|E
5|$|On 31 May, {{just after}} the King of Bahrain <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> {{dialogue}} without preconditions to begin in early July the military National Safety Court issued an order for Rajab's arrest {{along with those of}} prominent Al Wefaq parliamentarians. Rajab was accused of spreading false news and statements about the situation in Bahrain and promoting hatred and disrespect of a specific religious sect, in addition to humiliating the king of Bahrain. All the detainees were released the same day.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} two-tier {{stand to}} the north and east were {{presented}} next. The plans <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> 24,500 sitting places in the new and south stands, and 5,500 standing places in the west stand. However, in 1989, the plans were modified, as the FIFA made new rules, requiring that only seating places could be used for international qualification matches from 1992. It was thereby decided that Ullevaal would become an all-seater.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{proposal}} <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> 22units, {{to replace}} {{all of the}} Kolsås and Holmenkoll Line stock. However, the Sognsvann and Røa Line was upgraded to metro standard between 1992 and 1995, and could start using T1000 stock with only third-rail support. At the time, the eastern network used third-rail, while the western network used overhead wire. The upgrade used non-utilised stock, so the order for T2000 was reduced to 12units.|$|E
5|$|After their marriage, Prince Andrew {{continued}} {{his career in}} the military and Princess Andrew became involved in charity work. In 1908, she visited Russia for the wedding of Grand Duchess Marie of Russia and Prince William of Sweden. While there, she talked with her aunt, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, who was formulating plans for the foundation of a religious order of nurses. Princess Andrew attended the laying of the foundation stone for her aunt's new church. Later in the year, the Grand Duchess began giving away all her possessions in preparation for a more spiritual life. On their return to Greece, Prince and Princess Andrew found the political situation worsening, as the Athens government had refused to support the Cretan parliament, which <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> the union of Crete (still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire) with the Greek mainland. A group of dissatisfied officers formed a Greek nationalist Military League that eventually led to Prince Andrew's resignation from the army and the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|At 9:00am on March 10, North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} of the 368th Artillery Regiment dragged 12 pieces of artillery which included 85mm, 105mm and 122mm guns onto the top of Nui Vu and Han Thon, and aimed their guns directly on Hill-211 and the administrative centre of Tien Phuoc, to support the 31st Regiment attacking those areas. At 1:30pm, following two failed counter-attacks, South Vietnamese units in Phuoc Lam deserted from the battlefield. In the mean time, however, South Vietnamese troops in Tien Phuoc could bare held their ground with support from two A-37 bombers, after South Vietnamese commanders on the ground <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> reinforcement from Chu Lai. By 4:00pm, Tien Phuoc was captured by the VPA 2nd Division.|$|E

5|$|Despite its post-revolutionary mythology, {{the march}} {{was not a}} {{spontaneous}} event. Numerous calls for a mass demonstration at Versailles had already been made; the Marquis of Saint-Huruge, one of the popular orators of the Palais-Royal, <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> just such a march in August to evict the obstructionist deputies who, he claimed, were protecting the king's veto power. Although his efforts were foiled, revolutionaries continued {{to hold onto the}} idea of a march on Versailles to compel the king to accept the Assembly's laws. Speakers at the Palais-Royal mentioned it regularly throughout the next month, creating enduring suspicions of the proprietor, Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orléans. The idea of a march on Versailles was widespread, and was even discussed {{in the pages of the}} Mercure de France (5 September 1789). A menacing unrest was in the air, and many nobles and foreigners fled the oppressive atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Initial plans <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> {{the bridge}} to be {{completed}} by October 1972. On 28 December 1968, the company asked the road administration if construction could be quickened. They estimated that the bridge could be completed by December 1971 for a price increase of NOK750,000. This gave the company NOK2 million more in profits, as it could more quickly start collecting toll revenue. The company chose to accept this extra cost. The start of construction was delayed, first by the parliamentary decision coming right before the holidays, followed immediately by a national strike by engineers. The contract for the foundation and concrete work was won by Selmer, who started work in March 1969. The steel-work contracts were issued to Høsveis, Bofa and Alfred Andersen; despite them not having the lowest bid, the road administration chose to use the largest companies.|$|E
5|$|Kesselring and Rommel had a {{disagreement}} over the latter's conduct in the Battle of Bir Hakeim. Rommel's initial infantry assaults {{had failed to}} capture this vital position, the southern pivot of the British Gazala Line, which was held by the 1st Free French brigade, commanded by General Marie Pierre Koenig. Rommel <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> air support but had failed to break the position, which Kesselring attributed to faulty coordination between the ground and air attacks. Bir Hakeim was evacuated on 10 June 1942. Kesselring was more impressed {{with the results of}} Rommel's successful assault on Tobruk on 21 June, for which Kesselring brought in additional aircraft from Greece and Crete. For his part in the campaign, Kesselring was awarded the Knight's Cross with oak leaves and swords.|$|E

5|$|On {{the right}} flank, {{north of the}} road, the North Koreans overran the {{battalion}} observation post and B Company's outpost line. This high ground changed hands three times during the day. While the infantry fight was in progress, and shortly after the first tank penetration, five more T-34s came around the road bend toward the US 71st Tank Battalion. Check <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> an air strike when the first tanks appeared. Three F-80 Shooting Stars arrived and immediately dived on the approaching group of tanks, destroying three of them with 5-inch rockets. Altogether, bazooka, artillery, and air strikes knocked out six North Korean tanks during the morning, either within or {{on the edge of}} the 1st Battalion position. In its first engagement with American troops, the NK 2nd Division lost all but two of the eight tanks that had been attached to it a few days earlier at Chongju.|$|E
5|$|Part of Guderian's {{original}} plan <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> a feint south towards {{and behind the}} Maginot Line, to mask the intention to thrust to the channel. General Franz Halder had dropped this from Fall Gelb, but Guderian resurrected it and ordered the 10th Panzer Division and Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment to attack across the Stonne plateau. In this innocuous town, a vicious two-day battle took place in which the Germans {{came face to face}} with the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, for the only time. One of these tanks, commanded by Pierre Billotte, proved invulnerable to German anti-tank fire and took 140 hits, and knocked out 13 German tanks (two PzKpfw IV and eleven PzKpfw III) and a number of anti-tank guns. It transpired that the French had concentrated their own armour there to mount another attack on the Sedan bridgeheads. The battle of Stonne took place between 15 and 17 May, and the town changed hands 17 times. Ultimately the failure of the French to hold it meant the final failure to eliminate the Sedan bridgeheads.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{is deeply}} troubled by Pfaster's crimes, and has unsettling dreams and {{hallucinations}} about the case. In Washington, {{she has a}} counseling session with a social worker, during which she shares her anxiety about the investigation. After the session, Scully learns that someone from Minnesota <b>had</b> <b>called</b> <b>for</b> her. When she contacts Mulder, she learns that neither he nor Bocks made the call. Tracing a fingerprint to Pfaster from his arrest, Bocks and Mulder raid his apartment, finding one of the prostitute's fingers in his refrigerator. Meanwhile, after Scully arrives in Minneapolis, Pfaster forces her car off the road. He kidnaps Scully and takes her to his late mother's abandoned house. He ties and gags Scully, and keeps her in a dark closet.|$|E
