30|$|Application of dead fungal biomass {{obtained}} from R. arrhizus to remove textile dyes from {{industrial waste water}} is attractive due to its cheap and constant supply from industrial fermentation processes, high removal rates, easy storage and regenerative potential [11]. Some researchers have demonstrated the high <b>dye</b> <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> of R. arrhizus which exceeds that of some commercial ion exchange resins or activated carbon [19, 20, 21]. Hence, the main objective {{of the present study}} was to apply RSM and ANN approach for techno-economical optimization of the removal of Reactive Orange 13 (RO 13) dye, a mono-azo reactive dye from an aqueous solution using the dead biomass of R. arrhizus NCIM 997 as a low-cost biosorbent. In this study, the optimum value of the parameters and interactions between factors that influence the removal of RO 13 dye were determined. RO 13 was chosen in this study due to its extensive use in Indian textile industry for dyeing and printing cotton, viscose, silk, wool and nylon fabric.|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the automatic determination of serum globulin con-centration, which is {{estimated by the}} turbidity produced by precipitation in a sodium sulphate-sodium sulphite solution. UTOMATIC ESTIMATION of serum globulins in human serum is normally measured as {{the difference between the}} total protein and the albumin as estimated by the <b>dye</b> <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> of the albumin, usually using 2 -(4 ’hydroxyazobenzene) (HABA). However, {{it has been shown that}} a variety of drugs will upset dye uptake by the albumin (1). In addi-tion, the absorbance of the native serum is so high, and the wavelength of maximum absorption of the bound HABA dye so close to that of serum, that it is necessary to run blanks on all samples estimated. Glenn (2) showed that serum globulins could be estimated auto-matically by the precipitation of the globulins of the serum proteins by a 27. 4 % (w/v) sodium sulphate solution and that the resultant turbidity bore a direct relationship to the globulin present in the serum. This method was modified by Jones (3) so that it was suitable for use with a 15 mm flowcefl. In our experience, however, we have found that the sodium sulphate solution must be kept warm in order to prevent crystallization during the estimations, and further, that the globulin precipitate tends to form in large unequal particles and hence causes an irregular response by the recorder. In addition, the base line tends to rise continually throughout a series of estimations due to precipita-tion of the globulins on the walls of the flowcell. In the method to be described, using an AutoAnalyzer system, globu-lins are flocculated by a sodium sulphate-sodium suiphite mixture which remains in solution at lower temperatures, and initially result...|$|E
40|$|The {{reported}} work {{on changes}} in lysine content in milk and dried milk is examined. The cause of these losses, the Maillard reaction, and the methods of lysine determination are discussed. All methods have recognised faults. Little information is available to the food processor regarding the kinetics of these losses, and the methods of their determination are not simple enough for routine quality control application. Although the lysine content of milk products determined after acid hydrolysis {{is known to be}} higher than nutritional studies indicate the causes of this are being established. Therefore acid hydrolysis in conjunction with a GLC method of amino acid analysis was adopted after some modification. (It was found that dialysis of the milk prior to hydrolysis resulted in cleaner chromatograms and that as the recovery of several amino acids, such a proline, leucine, and isoleucine, was not affected by heat treatment then these were used as internal 'internal standard'.) No simple rate expression could be found to fit the kinetics of the loss of acid released lysine. A first order model requiring the losses to be increased by a factor of 3. 43 was devised and this could be used to satisfactorily predict values for acid available lysine in the heat treated milk. The possibility of the 3. 43 factor being due to the regeneration of lysine by acid from Maillard intermediates, although requiring assumptions, was found to be not unreasonable. The energy of activation of the reaction leading to a loss in acid released lysine at 31. 5 Kcal/mole is similar to literature values while the model value of 37. 2 Kcal/mole is rather higher. The literature findings of little or no loss of lysine during pasteruization, evaporation, and sterilization of milk are supported. The technique of protein determination by dye binding was examined and applied to following changes in lysine in heat treated milk. The inconsistencies in reported work on dye binding is of little consequence as relative changes only are required. Changes in dye binding using amido black did not follow simple order kinetics, even when allowance was made for the constant binding by arginine and histidine. A first order model requiring the changes to be increased by a factor of 3. 68 was developed. About 46 % of this factor can be explained by assuming constant binding by arginine and histidine, the remainder of the factor possibly being due to Maillard intermediates binding dye, and/or a change in binding stoichiometry occurring. From the model it is possible to predict the observed changes in dye binding. Literature findings were supported. The energy of activation for the dye binding changes is 28. 6 Kcal/mole, and for the model, 30. 8 Kcal/mole. Ancillary investigations showed that the concurrent colour changes due to heat treatment have an energy of activation of about 30 Kcal/mole, {{and that there is a}} relationship between colour and <b>dye</b> <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> in heat treated milk. The relationship between the Pro-Milk and a typical absorbance spectrophotometer was determined, and an expression found which would enable a spectrophotometer to be used for protein determination...|$|E

Protein determinations on the milk, cheese and whey were made by an acid orange 12 <b>dye</b> <b>binding</b> test, and by Kjeldahl analysis. Similarly fat recovery was determined by using the Babcock fat test on milk, the modified Babcock test on cheese, and the Mojonnier test on whey.

Under optimized conditions, the total <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> of HSA for bilirubin was determined as 16. 3 ± 1. 4 mg/l 00 mL human serum (n= 3) and residual <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> for bilirubin 9. 8 mg/l 00 mL (n= 3) in normal infants. To assess risk of hyperbilirubinemia, free bilirubin and residual <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> by HSA provide a better indicator than total bilirubin, as neonates with impaired bilirubin <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> could be detected. In addition, residual <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> provides an advanced indicator to predict the onset of hyperbilirubinemia before the appearance of free bilirubin.

30|$|The other, {{and perhaps}} most {{important}} finding in this study, was that GR <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> was decreased in neutrophils of patients treated with steroids.

Impaired GR function has been described previously, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in sepsis [19], lung tissue in experimental acute lung injury [20], and by our group in neutrophils in experimental endotoxic shock [8]. One possible interpretation would be that the GC-treated patients were in a deeper state of shock than the non-treated patients, causing decreased GR <b>binding</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, this explanation is unlikely as the patients from both groups were similar in most shock-related parameters and also because the difference between GC-treated and non-treated patients still remained at T 3, when the shock was resolved. With the recent observation of substantial reduction in cortisol metabolism during critical illness [6], {{it is more likely that}} an excessively high concentration of endogenous cortisol and administered hydrocortisone caused decreased GR <b>binding</b> <b>capacity.</b> As the effects of signaling from the activated GR-GC complex during severe inflammation includes decreased capillary permeability, dampened cytokine release, and modulated leucocyte recruitment [21, 22], impaired GR <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> may have negative short-term consequences. Considering decreased <b>binding</b> <b>capacity</b> as well as the expanding number of neutrophils in sepsis, the inability of neutrophils to respond to endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids may have severe ramifications for the host. In the presence of infection, while T lymphocytes display an increased GR expression, neutrophils may become resistant to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis through decreased GR <b>binding</b> <b>capacity.</b> This is likely protecting the host from immunosuppression, which would exacerbate the present infection.|$|R

Results of protein <b>dye</b> <b>binding</b> method were in agreement with those of protein assay and ζ-potential measurements. Confocal laser scanning and fluorescence microscopy confirmed the presence of protein layer on the surface of alginate microgel particles at pH 3 and 4. Micrographs from transmission electron microscopy revealed a protein coating with a thickness of ∼ 206 - 240  nm on the gel particle surfaces...|$|R
