50|$|An eternal flame is a <b>flame,</b> <b>lamp</b> or torch {{that burns}} {{continuously}} for an indefinite period. Most eternal flames are ignited and tended intentionally, {{but some are}} natural phenomena caused by natural gas leaks, peat fires and coal seam fires, {{all of which can}} be initially ignited by lightning, piezoelectricity or human activity, some of which have burned for thousands of years.|$|E
40|$|From Introduction: "However, {{before the}} <b>flame</b> <b>lamp</b> becomes obsolete, {{it is fitting}} that the Bureau of Mines compile a {{permanent}} record of a device which has served the mining industry {{for more than three}} generations, and not only made possible the development of entire districts that otherwise could have not been worked but undoubtedly saved the lives of thousands of underground workers. ...|$|E
50|$|A {{safety lamp}} is any of {{several types of}} lamp that {{provides}} illumination in coal mines and is designed to operate in air that may contain coal dust or gases {{both of which are}} potentially flammable or explosive. Until the development of effective electric lamps in the early 1900s miners used <b>flame</b> <b>lamps</b> to provide illumination. Open <b>flame</b> <b>lamps</b> could ignite flammable gases which collected in mines, causing explosions and so safety lamps were developed to enclose the flame and prevent it from igniting the surrounding atmosphere. <b>Flame</b> safety <b>lamps</b> have been replaced in mining with sealed explosion-proof electric lights.|$|R

5000|$|He {{investigated}} {{the principle of}} action of many different gases. He investigated numerous mine disasters, especially the toxic gases which killed most miners after firedamp and coal dust explosions. The toxic mixtures of gases found in mines included afterdamp, blackdamp and whitedamp. His description of the way a <b>flame</b> safety <b>lamp</b> {{can be used to}} detect firedamp by the increase in height of the flame, and chokedamp by the dying of the flame, is a classic exposition in his textbook, Respiration. Although electronic gas detectors are now used widely in all coal mines, <b>flame</b> <b>lamps</b> are still used extensively for their ease and simplicity of operation. Electronic gas detectors rely on a catalytic chip which can be poisoned by atmospheric impurities.|$|R
5000|$|MSA {{is based}} in the Pittsburgh suburb of Cranberry. [...] With help from Thomas Edison the company was formed in 1914 to develop a {{battery-powered}} cap lamp for miners to help prevent methane-related explosions caused by open <b>flame</b> <b>lamps.</b> Since {{the turn of the}} 21st Century, MSA has seen record sales. Only {{a small portion of the}} company's current products involve mining related products. The company’s competitors include Industrial Scientific Corporation, RAE Systems and Dräger.|$|R
5000|$|Firedamp {{detection}} was {{by means}} of a <b>flame</b> safety <b>lamp.</b> <b>Flame</b> safety <b>lamps</b> need to be monitored to be effective, and in consequence the regulations [...] require certain men to have lamps with them. The men are not permitted to also have electric lamps with them, to ensure that they are aware of changes in the flame. However written permission from the mine manager may be obtained to allow electric lamps, and this was routinely given. Since the lamps were not needed for illumination, they become just an additional burden to carry and were sometimes left behind. When the explosion occurred both safety lamps had been left behind at the intake and so were not at the face. Roberts is unsure whether the lamps would have detected the firedamp in time.|$|R
50|$|The pellistor was {{developed}} in the early 1960s for use in mining operations as the successor of the <b>flame</b> safety <b>lamp</b> and the canary.It was invented by English scientist Alan Baker.|$|R
5000|$|A {{kerosene}} lantern, {{also known}} as a [...] "barn lantern" [...] or [...] "hurricane lantern," [...] is a flat-wick lamp made for portable and outdoor use. They are made of soldered or crimped-together sheet metal stampings, with tin-plated sheet steel being the most common material, followed by brass and copper. There are three types: Dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast. Both hot blast and cold blast designs are called tubular lanterns and are safer than dead <b>flame</b> <b>lamps</b> as tipping over a tubular lantern cuts off the oxygen flow to the burner and will extinguish the flame within seconds.|$|R
50|$|He {{undertook}} numerous {{experiments to}} determine {{the size of the}} <b>flame</b> in <b>lamps</b> that determined the percentage of fire damp in the atmosphere, but details that were ridiculed at the time have since been found to be extremely accurate.|$|R
50|$|Although its {{use as a}} {{light source}} was {{superseded}} by electric lighting, the <b>flame</b> safety <b>lamp</b> has continued {{to be used in}} mines to detect methane and blackdamp, although many modern mines now also use sophisticated electronic gas detectors for this purpose.|$|R

6000|$|According to Buddhism, the {{relation}} of one life to the next is merely that borne by the <b>flame</b> of one <b>lamp</b> to the <b>flame</b> of another <b>lamp</b> which is set alight by it. To the [...] "Arahat" [...] or adept [...] "no outward form, no compound thing, no creature, no creator, no existence of any kind, must appear to be other than a temporary collocation of its component parts, fated inevitably to be dissolved."--(Rhys Davids, Hibbert Lectures, p. 211.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Watts Museum’s {{collection}} {{numbers in}} the thousands, relating {{to a variety of}} eras of the coal and petroleum industries. Most notable {{is one of the largest}} collections in the United States of <b>flame</b> safety <b>lamps</b> of over 100 different makes and styles. The museum also holds books, archival documents, and historical photographs.|$|R
50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the original}} Argand arrangement was that the oil reservoir needed to be above {{the level of the}} burner because the heavy, sticky vegetable oil would not rise far up the wick. This made the lamps top heavy and cast a shadow in one direction away from the <b>lamp's</b> <b>flame.</b> The Carcel <b>lamp</b> of 1800, which used a clockwork pump to allow the reservoir to sit beneath the burner, and Franchot's spring-driven moderator lamp of 1836 avoided these problems.|$|R
50|$|On Friday December 6, 1907 {{there were}} officially 367 {{men in the}} two mines, {{although}} the actual number was much higher as officially registered workers often took their children and other relatives into the mine to help. At 10:28 AM an explosion occurred that killed {{most of the men}} inside the mine instantly. The blast caused considerable damage to both the mine and the surface. The ventilation systems, necessary to keep fresh air supplied to the mine, were destroyed along with many railcars and other equipment. Inside the mine the timbers supporting the roof were blown down which caused further issues as the roof collapsed. An official cause of the explosion was not determined, but investigators at the time believed that an electrical spark or one of the miners' open <b>flame</b> <b>lamps</b> ignited coal dust or methane gas.|$|R

50|$|There {{were three}} major {{advances}} in the 1880s: František Křižík invented in 1880 a mechanism to allow the automatic adjustment of the electrodes. The arcs were enclosed in a small tube to slow the carbon consumption (increasing the life span to around 100 hours). <b>Flame</b> arc <b>lamps</b> were introduced where the carbon rods had metal salts (usually magnesium, strontium, barium, or calcium fluorides) added to increase light output and produce different colours.|$|R
50|$|A modern-day {{equivalent}} of the Davy lamp is the Protector Garforth GR6S <b>flame</b> safety <b>lamp</b> which is used for firedamp testing in all UK coal mines. A modified version of this lamp {{has been used in}} the Olympic Flame torch relays. It was used in the relays for the Sydney, Athens, Turin, Beijing, Vancouver and Singapore Youth Olympic Games. It was also used for the Special Olympics Shanghai, Pan American and Central African games and for the London 2012 Summer Olympics relay.|$|R
40|$|An {{estimated}} 1. 2 {{billion people}} around the world don't have access to electricity, while many more suffer from supply that is of poor quality. Domestic energy poverty is most severe in the rural areas of South Asia, South East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Basic energy needs, such as cooking and lighting, are covered using traditional biomass and fossil fuels. These are consumed inefficiently in fire stoves and <b>flame</b> <b>lamps.</b> This situation hampers economic growth and social development and implies severe stress on resources and the environment. Photovoltaics could {{play a major role in}} overcoming domestic energy poverty, especially as most of the affected regions are within the Earth's Sunbelt. This paper provides such a solution in the form of a solar home system with lithium-ion battery in combination with an energy efficient multicooker and LED lamps to cover the needs for cooking and lighting for one family. A solar home system layout is provided and assessed in terms of its cost and benefits in contrast with the existing practices for cooking and lighting in developing regions. Thereby, evolutionary aspects are taken into account to capture the incremental cost advantage of the solar home system technology over time, and with that support the idea of projecting large-scale implementation in developing regions...|$|R

50|$|Mining {{disasters}} {{such as the}} 1954 {{accident at}} Collinsville usually led to improvements in mine safety. The Mount Mulligan accident (1921), resulting {{in the deaths of}} 75 men and boys, led to the introduction of the Coal Mining Act (1925) which included at least seven new safety provisions. Similarly, the Collinsville accident led to the addition of new safety provisions in the Act. These required Mine Deputies to undertake statutory examinations and to carry <b>flame</b> safety <b>lamps</b> and gas detectors during inspections. Subsequent disasters have led to additional legislative changes.|$|R
60|$|Esquimaux Lamp.--The cooking of the Esquimaux {{is wholly}} {{effected}} by stone lamps, with wicks made of moss, {{which are so}} carefully arranged that the flame gives little or no smoke. Their lamps vary in size from one {{foot and a half}} long to six inches. Each of the bits of moss gives a small but very bright <b>flame.</b> The <b>lamp</b> is all in all to the Esquimaux; it dries their clothes, and melts the snow for their drinking-water; its construction is very ingenious; without it they could not have inhabited the arctic regions.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a strong}} enough current of air enough air {{could be forced}} in through the tubes (later holes and gallery) to sustain the <b>flame</b> and the <b>lamp</b> could get red-hot. [...] The lamp becomes unsafe in a current of from 8 to 12 feet per second, about twice that of the Davy.|$|R
60|$|Rollo did so, Nathan {{standing}} all {{the time}} by his side. They observed that the <b>flame</b> of the <b>lamp</b> was driven into the room every time the door was shut; proving that, every time {{a little of the}} air was driven out by the door, a little puff rushed in at the key-hole.|$|R
60|$|Jukes' face {{appeared}} in a crack of the door: only his face, very red, with staring eyes. The <b>flame</b> of the <b>lamp</b> leaped, {{a piece of paper}} flew up, a rush of air enveloped Captain MacWhirr. Beginning to draw on the boot, he directed an expectant gaze at Jukes' swollen, excited features.|$|R
50|$|After the {{widespread}} {{introduction of the}} safety lamp, explosions continued because the early lamps were fragile and easily damaged. For example, the iron gauze on a Davy lamp only needed to lose one wire to become unsafe. The light was also very poor (compared to a naked flame) and there were continuous attempts to improve the basic design. The height of the cone of burning methane in a <b>flame</b> safety <b>lamp</b> {{can be used to}} estimate the concentration of the gas in the local atmosphere. It was not until the 1890s that safe and reliable electric lamps became available in collieries.|$|R
