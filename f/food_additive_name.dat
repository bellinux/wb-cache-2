40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{the model of}} heuristic judgment of Kahneman & Frederick (2002) and two experiments based upon it. According to the model people answer a question with an answer to an easier question when making a heuristic judgment. This process is called the attribute substitution because a target attribute of a question is substituted by an associated and easier accessible heuristic attribute. The first experiment investigated whether two heuristic attributes can be used simultaneously during making of a judgment. A part of participants gave 1 or 4 reasons {{for one of the}} statements in Linda problem (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983). Numbers of reasons were selected so as to produce a feeling of fluency of disfluency. Although the conjunction fallacy occurred, the writing of the reasons didn't have any influence on the assessment of the probability of the related statement. The second experiment investigated whether the priming of the relation between processing fluency and risk can influence the effect of pronounceability of a <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> <b>name</b> on the assessment of its harmfulness. In accord with previous study (Song & Schwarz, 2009) it was shown that food additives with less pronounceable names were considered as more harmful. The priming didn't have any effect.

40|$|Abstract. Food {{safety is}} an {{important}} issue related to the government regulatory authorities, food industry and food consumers. And the increasing use of <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> has become a matter of public and administrative concern, so an extensive safety evaluation on <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> must be carried out {{and the use of the}} <b>additives</b> in <b>food</b> should be controlled by law. In the United States, the Congress has entrusted the FDA with the responsibility to ensure that new additives to be used in foods and the foods the consumers purchase are safe. This paper discusses the supervision and management system of <b>food</b> <b>additives</b> in the United States. The conclusion is that FDA has developed a scientifically rigorous, sound and dependable system to assure the safety of food, thus a new <b>food</b> <b>additive</b> must be approved by FDA before it can be used in food.

The paths from the exogenous latent variable “knowledge of food processing” to the two endogenous latent variables were both significant and negative, indicating that consumers with correct knowledge of food processing had a negative attitude toward “preference for antioxidant additive-free wine” and “excessive concern for food safety.” Bearth et al.
