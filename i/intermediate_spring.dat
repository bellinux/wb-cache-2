5000|$|The Farquhar-Hill was {{originally}} patented in the UK in 1908 {{and in the}} USA in 1909. The key feature was an intermediate 'action' spring stored recoil energy. Upon discharge, the barrel recoiled while still locked with the bolt, compressing the <b>intermediate</b> <b>spring</b> on recoil. Upon return of the barrel to the forward position, the energy stored in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>spring</b> cycled the bolt back and forth, extracting and ejecting the spent case and feeding a fresh round into the now stationary barrel. The main goal was to achieve smooth and reliable cycling, but the design was very complicated and thus badly suited for a military firearm. By 1911, Farquhar and Hill revised their rifle, changing its source of energy from barrel recoil to more convenient gas operated action. This new weapon also utilized <b>intermediate</b> <b>spring</b> {{as a source of}} energy for cycling of the bolt, but the barrel was now stationary, simplifying design and making it potentially more accurate and reliable. During following years this design was further refined and tested by British Army on several occasions. This rifle was initially chambered for the new “.303 rimless” round, designed by necking up the 7.65x53mm Belgian Mauser case and loading it with British-issue Mk.VII bullet of [...]303 caliber. Later on this experimental loading was discarded in favor of the standard issue [...]303 British ammunition. After several trials, including troop trials at the Front, in 1918 the Farquhar-Hill rifle was found to be suitable for military use, and an official request was issued for procurement of as much as 100,000 of Farquhar-Hill rifles for British forces fighting on the Continent against Germany. Official nomenclature assigned to the military Farquhar-Hill rifle in August 1918 was “Rifle[...]303 inch, Pattern 1918”. However, hostilities of the Great War ended before production facilities were allocated for this rifle, and in the view of an upcoming peace the requirement for manufacture of Farquhar-Hill rifles was dropped in 1919.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the {{stability}} {{investigation of the}} linear responses of axially travelling beams supported by an intermediate linear spring is performed numerically by means of searching linear complex eigenvalues. The boundary conditions and the dynamic equation of motion are obtained {{by means of the}} Extended Principle of Hamilton for the two-span Euler-Bernoulli beam. Assuming the harmonic solution of the governing differential equations of motion, the dispersion relation is derived. To have a nontrivial solution in conjunction with the dispersion relation, the frequency equation is obtained by letting the determinant of the matrix representing the coefficients of the equations of the boundary conditions be equal to zero. The aim of this contribution is to compute the complex values of the natural frequencies from the nonlinear frequency equation by means of numerical methods for the beam supported by an <b>intermediate</b> <b>spring.</b> The real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalues versus the constant axial transport speed curves are depicted in order to show the linear instability.

40|$|The high {{sensitivity}} and sharp frequency selectivity of acoustical signal transduction in the cochlea suggest that an active process pumps {{energy into the}} basilar membrane's oscillations. This function is generally attributed to outer hair cells, but its exact mechanism remains uncertain. Several classical models of amplification represent the load upon the basilar membrane as a single mass. Such models encounter a fundamental difficulty, however: the phase difference between basilar-membrane movement and the force generated by outer hair cells inhibits, rather than amplifies, the modeled basilar-membrane oscillations. For this reason, modelers must introduce artificially either negative impedance or an appropriate phase shift, neither of which is justified by physical analysis of the system. We consider here a physical model based upon the recent demonstration that the basilar membrane and reticular lamina can move independently, albeit with elastic coupling through outer hair cells. The mechanical model comprises two resonant masses, representing the basilar membrane and the reticular lamina, coupled through an <b>intermediate</b> <b>spring,</b> the outer hair cells. The spring's set point changes in response to displacement of the reticular lamina, which causes deflection of the hair bundles, variation of outer hair cell length and, hence, force production. Depending upon {{the frequency of the}} acoustical input, the basilar membrane and reticular lamina can oscillate either in phase or in counterphase. In the latter instance, the force produced by hair cells leads basilar-membrane oscillation, energy is pumped into basilar-membrane movement, and an external input can be strongly amplified. The model is also capable of producing spontaneous oscillation. In agreement with experimental observations, the model describes mechanical relaxation of the basilar membrane after electrical stimulation causes outer hair cells to change their length...|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{detection}} of multiple open cracks in a slender Euler-Bernoulli beams is presented based on frequency measurements. The method {{is based on the}} approach given by Hu and Liang [J. Franklin Inst. 330 (5) (1993) 841], transverse vibration modelling through transfer matrix method and representation of a crack by rotational spring. The beam is virtually divided into a number of segments, which can be decided by the analyst, and each of them is considered to be associated with a damage parameter. The procedure gives a linear relationship explicitly between the changes in natural frequencies of the beam and the damage parameters. These parameters are determined from the knowledge of changes in the natural frequencies. After obtaining them, each is treated in turn to exactly pinpoint the crack location in the segment and determine its size. The forward, or natural frequency determination, problems are examined in the passing. The method is approximate, but it can handle segmented beams, any boundary conditions, <b>intermediate</b> <b>spring</b> or rigid supports, etc. It eliminates the need for any symbolic computation which is envisaged by Hu and Liang [J. Franklin Inst. 330 (5) (1993) 841] to obtain mode shapes of the corresponding uncracked. beams. The proposed method gives a clear insight into the whole analysis. Case studies (numerical) are presented to demonstrate the method effectiveness for two simultaneous cracks of size 10 % and more of section depth. The differences between the actual and predicted crack locations and sizes are less than 10 % and 15 % respectively. The numbers of segments into which the beam is virtually divided limits the maximum number of cracks that can be handled. The difference in the forward problem is less than 5 %. (C) 2002. ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the impacts}} of climate on migratory species is {{complicated}} by the fact that these species travel through several climates that may be changing in diverse ways throughout their complete migratory cycle. Most studies are not designed to tease out the direct and indirect effects of climate at various stages along the migration route. We assess {{the impacts of}} spring and summer climate conditions on breeding monarch butterflies, a species that completes its annual migration cycle over several generations. No single, broad-scale climate metric can explain summer breeding phenology or the substantial year-to-year fluctuations observed in population abundances. As such, we built a Poisson regression model to help explain annual arrival times and abundances in the Midwestern United States. We incorporated the climate conditions experienced both during a spring migration/breeding phase in Texas as well as during subsequent arrival and breeding during the main recruitment period in Ohio. Using data from a state-wide butterfly monitoring network in Ohio, our results suggest that climate acts in conflicting ways during the spring and summer seasons. High spring precipitation in Texas is associated with the largest annual population growth in Ohio and the earliest arrival to the summer breeding ground, as are <b>intermediate</b> <b>spring</b> temperatures in Texas. On the other hand, the timing of monarch arrivals to the summer breeding grounds is not affected by climate conditions within Ohio. Once in Ohio for summer breeding, precipitation has minimal impacts on overall abundances, whereas warmer summer temperatures are generally associated with the highest expected abundances, yet this effect is mitigated by the average seasonal temperature of each location in that the warmest sites receive no benefit of above average summer temperatures. Our results highlight the complex relationship between climate and performance for a migrating species and suggest that attempts to understand how monarchs will be affected by future climate conditions will be challenging...|$|E

50|$|An {{excellent}} climber, its preferred {{habitat is}} the rocky region along the snow line above alpine forests, where it occupies steep, rough terrain at elevations of 1800 to 3300 m. Alpine ibex are typically absent from woodland areas although adult males in densely populated areas may stay in larch and mixed larch-spruce woodland {{if there is}} no snow. Males spend the winter in coniferous forests. For most of the year, males and females occupy different habitat. Females rely on steep terrain more so than males. Males use lowland meadows during the spring, which is when snow melts and green grass appears. They then climb to alpine meadows during the summer. When winter arrives, both sexes move to steep rocky slopes that amass little snow. They prefer slopes of 30-45° and use small caves and overhangs for shelter. Home ranges are highly variable, depending on the availability of resources, and vary in size throughout the year. Figures of anything from 180 to 2800 ha have been recorded. Home ranges tend to be largest during summer and autumn, smallest in winter and <b>intermediate</b> in <b>spring.</b> Female home ranges are usually smaller than those of males.

40|$|A central {{hypothesis}} of ecological immunology is that immune defences are traded off against competing physiological and behavioural processes. During energetically demanding periods, birds are predicted {{to switch from}} expensive inflammatory responses to less costly immune responses. Acute phase responses (APRs) are a particularly costly form of immune defence, and, hence, seasonal modulations in APRs are expected. Yet, hypotheses about APR modulation remain untested in freeliving organisms throughout a complete annual cycle. We studied seasonal modulations in the APRs and in the energy budgets of skylarks Alauda arvensis, a partial migrant bird from temperate zones that experiences substantial ecological changes during its annual cycle. We characterized throughout the annual cycle changes in their energy budgets by measuring basal metabolic rate (BMR) and body mass. We quantified APRs by measuring {{the effects of a}} lipopolysaccharide injection on metabolic rate, body mass, body temperature, and concentrations of glucose and ketone. Body mass and BMR were lowest during breeding, highest during winter and <b>intermediate</b> during <b>spring</b> migration, moult and autumn migration. Despite this variation in energy budgets, the magnitude of the APR, as measured by all variables, was similar in all annual cycle stages.

We suggest that the ability to mount an APR may be so essential to survival i...|$|R
