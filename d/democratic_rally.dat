In the first elections held in French Sudan in 1957, the African <b>Democratic</b> <b>Rally</b> (Rassemblement Démocratique Africain, commonly known as the RDA) won the elections in French Sudan, as well as winning majorities in neighboring Ivory Coast, French Guinea, and the Upper Volta. Following the French constitutional referendum of 1958, of which received an overwhelming majority in support, the République Soudanaise declared itself a republic with internal autonomy on 24 November 1958. The Sudanese Republic, as the area was now called, was the second colony after Madagascar to join the French Community, which provided it internal autonomy while linking its currency, foreign policy and defense with France.|$|E

The party's main objective was to obtain autonomy for its member states and oppose the Senegalese leader Léopold Sédar Senghor's idea of federalism. Playing on his past as a former exile, and through the network of Bwiti followers, M'ba managed to rally support from the Fang and Myènè peoples. His goal was to win indigenous administrative and judicial posts.|$|E

25|$|Coutoucou Hubert Maga (August 1916 – May 8, 2000) was a {{politician}} from Dahomey (now known as Benin). He arose {{on a political}} scene where one's power was dictated by what region in Dahomey one lived in. Born a peasant in 1916, Maga served as a schoolmaster from 1936 to 1945, during which time he gradually gained considerable influence among the uneducated. He was elected to Dahomey's territorial assembly in 1947 and founded the Northern Ethnical Group, later renamed the Dahomey <b>Democratic</b> <b>Rally</b> (Rassemblement Démocratique du Dahomé). In 1951, Maga {{was elected to the}} French National Assembly, where he served in various positions, including premier from 1959 to 1960. When Dahomey gained its independence from France on August 1, 1960, Maga was appointed to the presidency, and was officially elected to that post on December11.|$|E
25|$|Maga's rise {{to power}} {{occurred}} {{during a period of}} intense regionalism, spurred by the historical resentment shared by members of the former kingdoms of Abomey, Porto Novo, and disorganised tribes from the north. Its result was the creation of three de facto tribal zones: the north, southeast, and southwest, which were led by Maga, Sourou Migan Apithy, and Justin Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, respectively. Maga's Ethnic Group of the North (later the Dahomeyan Democratic Movement), which merged into the Dahomeyan <b>Democratic</b> <b>Rally</b> in 1957, received little support outside his northern headquarters. Even then, most of his backing came from the Bariba, while Apithy was mostly backed by the Yoruba and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin, the Fon and Gouns. Regionalistic attitudes would only intensify {{during the rest of the}} political careers of the three men, collectively known as Dahomey's triumvirate.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} {{changed with}} a large number of slaves resiting their status starting in 1946. In that year, the French Fourth Republic was founded and {{a key part of the}} new constitution was direct elections for positions in the colonies. Along with these efforts, a political party came to prominence in the French Sudan, called the Sudanese Union – African <b>Democratic</b> <b>Rally</b> (US-RDA), which had a strong political base in the south of the colony. As a result of both its socialist ideology and to gain a political base in the north, the US-RDA encouraged slaves to resist their masters and become free. As a result, large numbers of slaves in the country began claiming ownership over their herds and land or simply moving to other areas where employment opportunities were available (mainly to the cities of Gao or Timbuktu or to other colonies like the Gold Coast).|$|E
50|$|After the {{successful}} French July Revolution of 1830, the Liberals were buoyant {{in most of}} Europe, {{as well as in}} Württemberg. The struggle for freedom in Poland against Russia in 1830/1831 reinforced this trend. In December 1831, the Liberals won the elections to the second chamber of the Württemberg Landtag. At the Hambach Festival on May 27, 1832, in which Hambach Castle in the Rhineland-Palatinate was a backdrop for liberal and <b>democratic</b> <b>rallies,</b> the call for banned political gatherings was answered. William moved to convene the parliament elected in 1831 for over a year until 15 January 1833. After the dissolution of parliament on 22 March, elections were held in April, and Friedrich Romans' liberals again emerged victorious.|$|R
