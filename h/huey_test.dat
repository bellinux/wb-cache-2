40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experiments {{carried out on}} industrial melts. There has been tested the REM influence on carbon properties (0. 20 %C) as well as austenitic cast steel Cr-Ni 18 / 8 +Ti type. It was found that REM cause an essential improvement of cast steels impact strength and in case of austenitic cast steel – also the corrosion resistance improvement in boiling 65 %HNO 3 (<b>Huey</b> <b>test)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of Cr - Ni 18 / 9 austenitic cast steel modifications by mischmetal. The study was conducted on industrial melts. Cast steel was melted in an electric induction furnace with a capacity of 2000 kg and a basic lining crucible.. The mischmetal was introduced into the ladle during tapping of the cast steel from the furnace. The effectiveness of modification was examined with the carbon content of 0. 1 % and the presence of δ ferrite in the structure of cast steel stabilized with titanium. The changes in the structure of cast steel and their effect on mechanical properties and intergranular corrosion were studied. It was found that rare earth metals decrease the sulfur content in cast steel and above all, they cause a distinct change in morphology of the δ ferrite and non-metallic inclusions. These changes have improved mechanical properties. R 02, Rm, and A 5 and toughness increased significantly. There was a great increase of the resistance to intergranular corrosion in the <b>Huey</b> <b>test.</b> The study confirmed the high efficiency of cast steel modification by mischmetal in industrial environments. The final effect of modification depends on the form and manner of placing mischmetal into the liquid metal and the melting technology, ie the degree of deoxidation and desulfurization of the metal in the furnace...|$|E
40|$|Stainless steel (SS) 304 L {{is widely}} used as a {{construction}} material in industries requiring corrosion resistance in nitric acid environments. Representative samples from 20 heats of SS 304 L products were subjected to a testing procedure consisting of testing as per the rapid screening test (Practice A) and the <b>Huey</b> <b>test</b> (Practice C) of ASTM A 262, Practices for Detecting Susceptibility to Intergranular Attack in Austenitic Stainless Steels. The presensitization heat treatment of 677 degrees C for 1 h and the modified heat treatment of 677 degrees C for 20 min were used for characterizing the microstructures in Practice A, whereas only the former presensitization heat treatment was used for Practice C. The percent duality after the two heat treatments has been correlated with the corrosion rate obtained in Practice C. A chemical composition based parameter, Cr effective = [% Cr - 0. 18 (%Ni) - 100 (%C) ], was calculated for all the heats and correlated with the percent duality after the two heat treatments {{as well as the}} corrosion rate in Practice C. It is observed that the SS 304 L heats with Cr effective > 14. 0 and < 50 % grain boundary coverage after the modified heat treatment (Practice A) show low corrosion rates in Practice C. This eliminates the need for carrying out the lengthy Practice C of ASTM. Examples of heats of SS 304 L are given to show that the modified presensitization heat treatment has better efficiency in screening materials and also exhibited better correlation with the results obtained in the Practice C. Guide rules for selection of SS 304 L heats for nitric acid service are also suggested...|$|E
