Computational {{modeling}} of haemodynamics in cardiovascular {{system can be}} a useful means for predictive medicine, which may be implemented in a form of Computation-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) and/or Computation-Aided Surgery (CAS).

Recent studies in patients with critical illnesses, sepsis, acute respiratory failure and heart failure suggest that use of the PAC does not improve patient outcomes.

40|$|International audienceObjectives Despite {{the wide}} {{use of the}} 6 min walk {{distance}} (6 MWD), no study has ever assessed its validity as a surrogate marker <b>for</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> and predictor of outcome in isolated pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc-PAH). We designed this work to address this issue. Methods Treatment-naive patients with SSc-PAH were prospectively included from two sources: the French PAH Network (a prospective epidemiological cohort) (n= 83) and randomised clinical trials submitted for drug approval (Food and Drug Administration) (n= 332). Correlations between absolute values of the 6 MWD and haemodynamics at baseline, {{as well as between}} variations of 6 MWD and haemodynamics during follow-up, were studied in both populations. Results In the French cohort, baseline cardiac output (CO) (R- 2 = 0. 19, p= 0. 001) and New York Heart Association class (R- 2 = 0. 10, p< 0. 001) were significantly and independently correlated with baseline 6 MWD in multivariate analysis. A significant, independent, but weaker, correlation with CO was also found in the Food and Drug Administration sample (R- 2 = 0. 04, p< 0. 001). During follow-up, there was no association between the changes in 6 MWD and haemodynamic parameters in patients under PAH-specific treatments. Conclusions In SSc-PAH, CO independently correlates with 6 MWD at baseline, but accounts for a small amount of the variance of 6 MWD in both study samples. This suggests that other non-haemodynamic factors could {{have an impact on the}} walk distance. Moreover, variations of 6 MWD do not reflect changes in haemodynamics among treated patients. Our results suggest that 6 MWD is not an accurate surrogate marker for haemodynamic severity, nor an appropriate outcome measure to assess changes in haemodynamics during follow-up in treated SSc-PAH...|$|E
40|$|Background: Previous {{in vitro}} and animal {{studies showed that}} {{biocompatibility}} reactions during continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) differ in dependence of the administered colloidal infusion. In a porcine model the infusion of 6 % HES 130 kDa/ 0. 4 (HES 130) was associated with superior haemodynamics compared to 4 % gelatine (GEL). Since many patients in need of renal replacement therapies suffer from acidosis, we investigated if this haemodynamic behaviour also occurs under acidaemia. Additionally, we investigated if {{the combination of a}} THAM-buffer-infusion and CVVH enables a sufficient correction of acidaemia that is independent of ventilatory modifications. Based on the first results of the applied experimental model for acidaemia, we developed a further porcine model for investigations on hypoxia. Methods: In anesthetized pigs a stable mixed acidaemia was induced by low tidal volume ventilation and infusion of lactic and hydrochloric acid. Simultaneously, HES 130 and GEL were infused. To accelerate biocompatibility reactions, the CVVH was operated in the recirculation-mode. For acidaemia-therapy THAM was infused either pre- or postdilutional and CVVH was operated in the standard-therapy-mode. Hypoxia was induced by reduction of respiratory rate (target: PaO 2 < 70 mmHg; SvO 2 < 65 %). Results: Acidaemia led to significant deterioration of haemodynamics especially in combination with CVVH. As already found for normal acid base homeostasis, more favourable results <b>for</b> <b>haemodynamics</b> were seen in the HES 130 -CVVH group compared to the GEL-CVVH group. Based on predilutional THAM-infusion during CVVH the acidaemia could be corrected within one hour without appearance of high-dose THAM-related adverse side effects. For the new porcine model with hypoxaemic acidaemia we established a period of 3 hrs for the exposition suitable to tolerate further challenges such as the CVVH-operation. Conclusion: Acidaemia and CVVH independently led to significant deterioration of haemodynamics. Under acidaemic conditions HES 130 also seems to support the circulatory system when biocompatibility reactions on a CVVH are challenging the organism in addition to acidaemia. Predilutional application of THAM in combination with CVVH seems to be a promising possibility for a fast correction of acidaemia and should be investigated in further studies concerning clinical utilization. It was possible to develop a porcine model of hypoxaemia which allows research on extracorporeal treatments such as CVVH...|$|E
40|$|Context: Spinal {{anaesthesia}} (SA) is {{the preferred}} anaesthesia for Caesarean section. Hypotension and bradycardia {{are the most common}} side effects caused by sympathetic blockade with a parasympathetic overdrive, aortocaval compression, and the Bezold Jarisch reflex (BJR) which is mediated by serotonin (5 HT 3) receptors. Ondansetron is a 5 HT 3 antagonist commonly used as an anti-emetic. The present study evaluated the effects of two different doses of ondansetron on the haemodynamic changes associated with SA for Caesarean section and the advantage of higher dose over the other. Aims: To study the effect of ondansetron in two different doses on the haemodynamic changes associated with spinal blocks. To compare the need of vasopressors if required and the incidence of nausea and vomiting with the two different doses of ondansetron in comparison with placebo in these patients. Settings and Design: Prospective, comparative, randomized, double-blinded placebo controlled study. Materials and Methods: After hospital ethics clearance 180 parturients undergoing Caesarean section were randomly divided into 3 groups before administration of SA. Group C received 10 ml of normal saline. Group F received 4 mg ondansetron with 8 ml normal saline. Group E received 8 mg ondansetron with 6 ml normal saline. All the patients were monitored <b>for</b> <b>haemodynamics,</b> vasopressor requirement and side effects and the results were compared. Three groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparison post hoc test; the results were considered significant when P < 0. 05. Adverse events were analysed with Chi-square test and was significant at P < 0. 01. Results: The change in the heart rate (HR) was not significant statistically. The fall of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) was statistically significant at all time intervals intraoperatively after administration of SA (P value < 0. 001) when compared to pre-operative values. The fall of SBP when compared between groups was significant after administration of SA, 111. 92 ± 17. 36 mmHg for Group C, group F was 122. 16 ± 18. 68 mm Hg and group E was 119. 29 ± 16. 88 mmHg (P value = 0. 04). The incidence of hypotension in patients was lesser in the group that received ondansetron, Group C (6, 14), Group F (3, 4) and Group E (1, 6) after administration of SA and at 5 minutes after administration of SA (P value = 0. 03) but comparable between the ondansetron groups. Conclusions: Intravenous ondansetron reduced the incidence of hypotension, nausea and vomiting after administration of SA but there was no added advantage of 8 mg ondansetron over 4 mg...|$|E

Whole blood seeded with a clinically used ultrasound contrast agent was pumped with a steady flow through live carotid arterial tissue from a rat, which was kept alive in a physiological salt solution. Pharmacological agents were then used to produce vascular relaxation. Velocity measurements were acquired with a spatial resolution of 14  µm × 14  µm and at a rate of 5000 acquisitions per second. Subtle velocity changes that occur are readily measurable, demonstrating the ability of X-ray velocimetry to sensitively and accurately measure haemodynamics ex vivo.

40|$|Simultaneous EEG-fMRI {{recordings}} {{have seen}} growing application {{in the evaluation}} of epilepsy, namely in the characterization of brain networks related to epileptic activity. In EEG-correlated fMRI studies, epileptic events are usually described as boxcar signals based on the timing information retrieved from the EEG, and subsequently convolved with a heamodynamic response function to model the associated BOLD changes. Although more flexible approaches may allow a higher degree of complexity <b>for</b> the <b>haemodynamics,</b> the issue of how to model these dynamics based on the EEG remains an open question. In this work, a new methodology for the integration of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data in epilepsy is proposed, which incorporates a transfer function from the EEG to the BOLD signal. Independent component analysis (ICA) of the EEG is performed, and a number of metrics expressing different models of the EEG-BOLD transfer function are extracted from the resulting time courses. These metrics are then used to predict the fMRI data and to identify brain areas associated with the EEG epileptic activity. The methodology was tested on both ictal and interictal EEG-fMRI recordings from one patient with a hypothalamic hamartoma. When compared to the conventional analysis approach, plausible, consistent and more significant activations were obtained. Importantly, frequency-weighted EEG metrics yielded superior results than those weighted solely on the EEG power, which comes in agreement with previous literature. Reproducibility, specificity and sensitivity should be addressed in an extended group of patients in order to further validate the proposed methodology and generalize the presented proof of concept...|$|R
40|$|Weight excess and/or {{central body}} fat {{distribution}} {{are associated with}} increased long-term renal risk, not only in subjects with renal disease or renal transplant recipients, {{but also in the}} general population. As the prevalence of weight excess is rising worldwide, this may become a main renal risk factor on a population basis, even more so because the risk extends to the overweight range. Understanding the mechanisms of this detrimental effect of weight excess on the kidneys is needed in order to design preventive treatment strategies. The increased risk associated with weight excess is partly attributed to associated comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and diabetes; however, current evidence supports a direct pathogenetic role <b>for</b> renal <b>haemodynamics</b> as well. Weight excess is associated with an altered renal haemodynamic profile, i. e. an increased glomerular filtration rate relative to effective renal plasma flow, resulting in an increased filtration fraction (FF). This renal haemodynamic profile is considered to reflect glomerular hyperfiltration and glomerular hypertension, resulting from a dysbalance between afferent and efferent arterial vasomotor balance. This unfavorable renal haemodynamic profile was found to be associated with renal outcome in experimental models and in human renal transplant recipients, and is associated with a blunted sodium excretion, and reversible by weight loss, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade or by dietary sodium restriction. More recent evidence showed that a central body fat distribution is also associated with an increased FF, even independent of overall weight excess. In this review, we provide an overview on current literature on the impact of weight excess and central body fat distribution on the renal haemodynamic profile in humans, and its possible role in progressive renal damage. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} the 'unique {{myocardial}} band', which proposes that the ventricular myocardial cone is arranged like skeletal muscle, provides an attractive framework <b>for</b> understanding <b>haemodynamics.</b> The original idea was developed by Francisco Torrent-Guasp. Using boiled hearts and blunt dissection, Torrent-Guasp created a single band of ventricular myocardium extending from the pulmonary trunk to the aortic root, with the band thus constructed encircling both ventricular cavities. Cooked hearts can, however, be dissected in many ways. In this review, we show that the band does not exist as an anatomical entity with defined borders. On the contrary, the ventricular cardiomyocytes are aggregated end to end and by their branching produce an intricate meshwork. Across {{the thickness of the}} left ventricular wall, the chains of cardiomyocytes exhibit a gradually changing helical angle, with a circumferential zone formed in the middle. There is no abrupt change in helical angle, as could be expected if the wall was constructed of opposing limbs of a single wrapped band, nor does the long axis of the cardiomyocytes consistently match with the long axis of the unique myocardial band. There are, furthermore, no connective tissue structures that could be considered to demarcate its purported boundaries. The unique myocardial band should be consistent with evolution, and although the ventricular wall of fish and reptiles has one or several distinct layers, a single band is not found. In 1965, Lev and Simpkins cautioned that the ventricular muscle mass of a cooked heart can be dissected almost at the whim of the anatomist. We suggest that the unique myocardial band should have ended ther...|$|R

Whilst pulmonary vein isolation is an effective strategy, other ablation targets are being evaluated to improve sinus rhythm maintenance, especially in patients with chronic forms of AF.

This has led to an increase in catheter-based technology to achieve durable pulmonary vein isolation.

Hypothyroidism was induced in rats by the administration of 6 -n-propyl- 2 -thiouracil in drinking water (final concentration of 0. 05 %) for 3 weeks, HYPO rats, and untreated rats served as controls (Control). Isolated aortic rings with or without endothelium (E+, E-) were contracted with KCl (10 - 60 mM) and phenylephrine (PE) (10 - 10 - 10 - 5 Μ). Maximal tension (Tmax) in g and EC 50 in response to PE and KCl were measured. Tmax was significantly lower while EC 50 was significantly higher in response to PE in HYPO(E+) than in Control(E+). Upon endothelial removal, Tmax was not significantly different between the groups but EC 50 was still significantly higher in HYPO(E-) than in Control(E-). EC 50 in response to KCl was significantly higher in HYPO with or without endothelium and no difference was found in Tmax. In conclusion, hypothyroid aortic rings respond less to a 1 adrenergic stimulation probably due to the endothelium modulatory effect as well as to intrinsic smooth muscle defect.

The therapy has two main goals: (1) to reduce or prevent an increase in ICP (ICP-targeted goal) and (2) to improve perfusion and oxygenation around contusions (perfusion-targeted goal).

The therapeutic measures mean normalization of all essential haemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, plasma oncotic pressure, plasma and erythrocyte volumes, PaO 2, PaCO 2) the use of enteral nutrition, and avoidance of overnutrition.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure show an aggravated hyperdynamic circulation. We evaluated, in a {{controlled}} manner, potential changes in systemic haemodynamics induced by the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) and the Prometheus system liver detoxification devices {{in a group of}} patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure. METHODS: Eighteen patients (51. 2 +/- 2. 3 years old; Child-Pugh score, 12. 5 +/- 0. 2; Maddrey score, 63. 1 +/- 5. 0; hepatic venous pressure gradient, 17. 6 +/- 0. 9 mmHg) with biopsy-proven alcoholic cirrhosis and superimposed alcoholic hepatitis were either treated with standard medical therapy (SMT) combined with MARS (n = 6) or Prometheus (n = 6) or were treated with SMT alone (n = 6) on three consecutive days (6 hours/session). Liver tests, systemic haemodynamics and vasoactive substances were determined before and after each session. RESULTS: Groups were comparable <b>for</b> baseline <b>haemodynamics</b> and levels of vasoactive substances. Both MARS and Prometheus decreased serum bilirubin levels (P < 0. 005 versus SMT), the Prometheus device being more effective than MARS (P = 0. 002). Only MARS showed significant improvement in the mean arterial pressure (Deltachange, + 9 +/- 2. 4 mmHg versus - 0. 3 +/- 2. 4 mmHg with Prometheus and - 5. 2 +/- 2. 1 mmHg with SMT, P < 0. 05) and in the systemic vascular resistance index (Deltachange, + 131. 5 +/- 46. 2 dyne x s/cm 5 /m 2 versus - 92. 8 +/- 85. 2 dyne x s/cm 5 /m 2 with Prometheus and - 30. 7 +/- 32. 5 dyne x s/cm 5 /m 2 with SMT; P < 0. 05), while the cardiac index and central filling remained constant. This circulatory improvement in the MARS group was paralleled by a decrease in plasma renin activity (P < 0. 05), aldosterone (P < 0. 03), norepinephrine (P < 0. 05), vasopressin (P = 0. 005) and nitrate/nitrite levels (P < 0. 02). CONCLUSION: The MARS device, and not the Prometheus device, significantly attenuates the hyperdynamic circulation in acute-on-chronic liver failure, presumably by a difference in removal rate of certain vasoactive substances. These findings suggest conspicuous conceptual differences among the albumin dialysis devices. status: publishe...|$|R

Rats were divided into four groups (n= 6 each) : time-control, haemorrhage-control, haemorrhage after treatment with FR 139317 (ETA-receptor antagonist), and haemorrhage after treatment with BQ- 788 (ETB-receptor antagonist). In the time-control rats, {{there were no significant}} changes in any <b>haemodynamics</b> <b>for</b> the duration of the experiments. Relative to the time-control rats, rats given haemorrhage had reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO) and mean circulatory filling pressure (MCFP), but increased systemic vascular resistance (RSV). Venous resistance (RV) was slightly (but insignificantly) reduced by haemorrhage. MAP, however, gradually returned towards baseline (− 17 ± 4 and − 3 ± 2 [*]mmHg at 10 and 60 [*]min after haemorrhage, respectively) {{as a result of a}} further increase in RSV.

Pulmonary hypertension is suggested {{to be an important}} contributor but its nature and severity in these patients and how best to non-invasively assess it are controversial. We hypothesised that a high-output state rather than primary pulmonary vascular pathology may be the major abnormality in {{sickle cell disease}}. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and severity of pulmonary hypertension in patients with sickle cell disease using detailed echocardiography. We undertook a prospective study in 122 consecutive stable outpatients with sickle cell disease and 30 age, gender and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Echocardiographic evaluation included 3 D ventricular volumes, sphericity, tissue Doppler, and non-invasive estimation of pulmonary vascular resistance. 36 % of patients had a tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥ 2. 5 m. s(- 1) but only 2 % had elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and the prevalence of right ventricular dysfunction was very low. Patients with raised tricuspid regurgitant velocity had significantly elevated biventricular volumes and globular left ventricular remodelling, related primarily to anaemia. In a subgroup of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, invasive pulmonary haemodynamics confirmed the echocardiographic findings. Elevated cardiac output and left ventricular volume overload secondary to chronic anaemia may be the dominant factor responsible <b>for</b> abnormal cardiopulmonary <b>haemodynamics</b> in patients with sickle cell disease. 3 D echocardiography with non-invasive estimation of pulmonary vascular resistance represents a valuable approach for initial evaluation of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in sickle cell disease...|$|R
40|$|Current {{artificial}} heart valves either have limited lifespan or require the recipient {{to be on}} permanent anticoagulation therapy. In this paper, effort is made to assess a newly developed bileaflet valve prosthesis made of synthetic flexible leaflet materials, whose geometry and material properties are based on those of the native mitral valve, {{with a view to}} providing superior options for mitral valve replacement. Computational analysis is employed to evaluate the geometric and material design of the valve, by investigation of its mechanical behaviour and unsteady flow characteristics. The immersed boundary (IB) method is used for the dynamic modelling of the large deformation of the valve leaflets and the fluid-structure interactions. The IB simulation is first validated for the aortic prosthesis subjected to a hydrostatic loading. The predicted displacement fields by IB are compared with those obtained using ANSYS, as well as with experimental measurements. Good quantitative agreement is obtained. Moreover, known failure regions of aortic prostheses are identified. The dynamic behaviour of the valve designs is then simulated under four physiological pulsatile flows. Experimental pressure gradients for opening and closure of the valves are in good agreement with IB predictions for all flow rates for both aortic and mitral designs. Importantly, the simulations predicted improved physiological <b>haemodynamics</b> <b>for</b> the novel mitral design. Limitation of the current IB model is also discussed. We conclude that the IB model can be developed to be an extremely effective dynamic simulation tool to aid prosthesis design...|$|R
30|$|The first {{research}} {{trend is}} focused {{on the use of the}} resistive index as a tool <b>for</b> measuring intrarenal <b>haemodynamics.</b> A recent experimental study reported that measuring RBF was impossible using Doppler sonography. Indeed, there was no relationship between measured RBF and estimated RBF by sonographic Doppler and the time for ultrasonographic transit, which was previously validated for regional blood flow measurements [40]. The same study highlighted that the interpretation of variations in the resistive index is difficult due to a very low relationship between variations in RBF after various therapeutic manoeuvres and variations in resistive index [40]. The most predictive parameter of 20  % variation in RBF issued from the Doppler was the variation in diastolic velocity, but the AUC was poor (0.75) [40]. Several authors have assessed resistive index variation in response to increasing doses of noradrenaline or “renal low” dose dopamine. Results suggest that the resistive index might be a guided goal measurement allowing the optimization of catecholamine doses in order to potentially improve renal perfusion [41, 42]. Finally, a further study did not find any variation in the resistive index following an intravascular load, regardless of pre-existing renal function and the response to this load as assessed by a variation in the systolic ejection volume [43]. Despite promising results, these preliminary studies show a poor level of proof. Both the significance of resistive index variation and doubts related to the reproduction of measurements are major limitations for the interpretation of these results as well as for their recommendation in daily practical clinical use.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Flat {{detector}} {{computed tomography}} (FDCT) is an imaging tool that generates three-dimensional (3 -D) volumes from data obtained during C-arm rotation using CT-like reconstruction algorithms. The technique {{is relatively new}} and, at current levels of performance, lags behind conventional CT in terms of image quality. However, the advantage of its availability in the interventional room has prompted neuro-radiologists to identify clinical settings where its role is uniquely beneficial. METHODS: We performed {{a search of the}} online literature databases to identify studies reporting experience with FDCT in interventional neuro-radiology. The studies were systematically reviewed and their findings grouped according to specific clinical situation addressed. RESULTS: FDCT images allow detection of procedural complications, evaluation of low-radiopacity stents and assessment of endosaccular coil packing in intra-cranial aneurysms. Additional roles are 3 -D angiography that provides an accurate depiction of vessel morphology with low concentrations of radiographic contrast media and a potential for perfusion imaging due to its dynamic scanning capability. A single scan combining soft tissue and angiographic examinations reduces radiation dose and examination time. Ongoing developments in flat detector technology and reconstruction algorithms are expected to further enhance its performance and increase this range of applications. CONCLUSION: FDCT images provide useful information in neuro-interventional setting. If current research confirms its potential <b>for</b> assessing cerebral <b>haemodynamics</b> by perfusion scanning, the combination would redefine it as an invaluable tool for interventional neuro-radiology procedures. This facility and its existing capabilities of parenchymal and angiographic imaging would also extend its use to the triage of acute stroke patients...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: In {{the last}} decade, there was been {{increasing}} interest in finding imaging techniques {{able to provide}} a functional vascular imaging of the thoracic aorta. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to present an imaging method combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to obtain a patient-specific haemodynamic analysis of patients treated by thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). METHODS: MRI was used to obtain boundary conditions. MR angiography (MRA) was followed by cardiac-gated cine sequences which covered the whole thoracic aorta. Phase contrast imaging provided the inlet and outlet profiles. A CFD mesh generator was used to model the arterial morphology, and wall movements were imposed according to the cine imaging. CFD runs were processed using the finite volume (FV) method assuming blood as a homogeneous Newtonian fluid. RESULTS: Twenty patients (14 men; mean age 62. 2  years) with different aortic lesions were evaluated. Four-dimensional mapping of velocity and wall shear stress were obtained, depicting different patterns of flow (laminar, turbulent, stenosis-like) and local alterations of parietal stress in-stent and along the native aorta. CONCLUSIONS: A computational method using a combined approach with MRI appears feasible and seems promising to provide detailed functional analysis of thoracic aorta after stent-graft implantation. KEY POINTS : * Functional vascular imaging of the thoracic aorta offers new diagnostic opportunities * CFD can model vascular <b>haemodynamics</b> <b>for</b> clinical aortic problems * Combining CFD with MRI offers patient specific method of aortic analysis * Haemodynamic analysis of stent-grafts could improve clinical management and follow-up...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} value of echo score with that of Doppler subvalvar flow {{broadening}} in deciding the type of mitral stenosis surgery. PATIENTS: 30 patients, mean age 47 years, with severe stenosis undergoing surgery {{were divided into two}} groups according to type of surgery: open heart commissurotomy (group 1, n = 12), or prosthesis (group 2, n = 18). A control group of 10 patients with prosthesis served as reference, representing mild stenosis without subvalvar connection. METHODS: For echo, the score proposed by Wilkins for cross sectional imaging was used. For Doppler, the flow diameters were measured in cm by an independent examiner from the long axis view in early diastole at two levels: (1) {{at the level of the}} stenosis (origin flow diameter), and (2) 1. 5 cm downstream from the stenosis in the left ventricle (subvalvar flow diameter) with calculation of a Doppler ratio relating these two measurements, expressed as a percentage of broadening. Diagnostic value was compared for both procedures. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in age, mitral valve areas, or <b>haemodynamics</b> <b>for</b> the two groups. Mean values (SD) were: echo score: group 1, 9. 83 (1. 26) v group 2, 10. 8 (8. 1), NS; Doppler ratio %: group 1, 44 (24) v group 2, 12 (21) (P 25 % (range 71 % to 87 %); echo score < 10 (range 50 % to 75 %). CONCLUSIONS: The new Doppler ratio diagnostic value agreed better with surgical management, repair or prosthesis, in this study. Thus, it appears to better reflect the subvalvar involvement and changes in kinetics than the echo score alone. This easy Doppler method might become a routine examination for follow up of patients with open heart commissurotomy, to avoid performing repeated transoesophageal echocardiography...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Return of {{spontaneous}} circulation (ROSC) elicits ischaemia/reperfusion injury and myocardial dysfunction. The combination of adenosine and lidocaine (AL, adenocaine) {{has been shown}} to (1) inhibit neutrophil inflammatory activation and (2) improve left ventricular function after ischaemia. We hypothesized that resuscitation with adenocaine during early moments of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) attenuates leucocyte oxidant generation and myocardial dysfunction. Methods: Pigs were randomized to: (1) sham (n = 7), (2) cardiac arrest (CA; n = 16), or 3) cardiac arrest + adenocaine (CA + AL; n = 12). After 7 min of electrically induced ventricular fibrillation, start of CPR was followed by infusion of saline (CA) or adenocaine (CA + AL) <b>for</b> 6 min. <b>Haemodynamics,</b> cardiodynamics (pressure–volume loops) and leucocyte superoxide anion generation were assessed. Neurological function was evaluated after 24 h by histology and neurological deficit score (0 = normal; 500 = brain dead). Results: Rate of ROSC was comparable between groups: CA group 11 / 16 and CA + AL group 7 / 12 p = 0. 57). Cardiac index transiently increased after ROSC in both groups. Left ventricular dysfunction demonstrated by a rightward shift of the intercept of end-systolic pressure–volume relations in CA was avoided in the CA + AL group. Leucocyte superoxide anion generation 2 h after ROSC was significantly attenuated in the CA + AL group compared to the CA group. Neurological deficit scores [CA: median: 17. 5 (IQR: 0 – 75) and CA + AL: 35 (IQR: 15 – 150) ] and histopathological damage were comparable in both groups (p = 0. 37). Conclusion:Infusion of adenocaine during early resuscitation from CA significantly improved early post-resuscitation cardiac function and attenuated leucocyte superoxide anion generation, without a change in post-ROSC neurological function.

40|$|Aims Heart failure (HF) is {{associated}} with tissue hypoperfusion and congestion leading to organ dysfunction. Although cerebral blood flow (CBF) is preserved {{over a wide range}} of perfusion pressures in healthy subjects, it is impaired in end-stage HF. We aimed to compare CBF, autoregulation, and cognitive function in patients with mild non-ischaemic HF with healthy controls. Methods and results Fifteen patients with mild idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 15 matched healthy controls were studied. Co-existing cerebrovascular disease was excluded. All subjects, except five patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, underwent magnetic resonance imaging for measurements of both CBF by arterial spin labelling and quantitative volume flow entering the brain. Cardiocerebral vascular function was assessed with Doppler techniques testing cerebral dynamic autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity. Cognitive analysis was performed by neuropsychological testing. Global and regional CBF did not differ between HF patients (44. 3 mL/ 100 g. min) and controls (42. 1 mL/ 100 g. min). Basilar but not carotid artery inflow was reduced in patients (1. 95 mL/s vs. 2. 51 mL/s, P = 0. 009). Testing autoregulation revealed fewer dampened blood flow fluctuations in HF patients vs. controls (0. 96 % vs. 0. 67 %, P < 0. 001). Vasomotor reactivity in HF patients showed a reduced CBF velocity (48. 4 % vs. 61. 0 %, P = 0. 05) and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (18. 3 % vs. 23. 8 %, P = 0. 02). Cognitive function overall was not affected. Conclusion Although global CBF was unaffected in patients with mild HF, significant changes in basilar inflow volume, cerebral autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity were observed. We describe a model of dynamic cerebral mechanisms required to compensate <b>for</b> the impaired <b>haemodynamics</b> in early-stage HF...|$|R
40|$|Brain {{death has}} {{adverse effects on}} the organ donor, {{increasing}} organ dysfunction and affecting transplantation outcomes. It can also render organs unsuitable for transplantation. Another determinant of organ quality is ischaemia-reperfusion injury, which limits ischaemic storage time for hearts to six hours. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} effectiveness of hormone resuscitation (HR) of the donor to ameliorate the effects of brain death. Another aim was to develop a donor management and organ preservation strategy to ameliorate the effects of ischaemia-reperfusion injury on the heart, thereby extending ischaemic preservation times. A porcine model of the brain-dead multi-organ donor with orthotopic cardiac transplantation was utilised. Donor HR was shown to improve cardiac contractility and haemodynamics, thereby reducing inotrope requirements. A follow-up study investigating the effects of three different donor management protocols demonstrated that donor haemodynamics, renal arterial flow and creatinine clearance were superior in HR animals compared with animals treated with noradrenaline or intravenous fluid alone. Noradrenaline was associated with a significant deterioration in pulmonary function (PaO 2 and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient) and a decline in donor pH. HR was not associated with any detrimental effects on the lungs, liver or pancreas compared with the other two groups. Preservation strategies incorporating glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and cariporide, a Na+-H+ exchange inhibitor, were investigated to safely extend cardiac ischaemic preservation times. Pre-treatment with intravenous cariporide prior to heart explantation (donor) and reperfusion of the transplanted heart (recipient) was shown to effectively extend ischaemic time to 14 hours, evidenced by weaning off cardiopulmonary bypass. GTN and cariporide-supplemented Celsior, used as a cardioplegic/storage solution, was also effective in extending preservation time to 14 hours, with superior cardiac contractility compared with cariporide pre-treated hearts. Both treatments also ameliorated reperfusion injury, stabilising <b>haemodynamics</b> <b>for</b> up to three hours post-bypass. This thesis has demonstrated the effectiveness of HR to ameliorate the negative effects of donor brain death. It also provides evidence that combined GTN and cariporide-supplemented Celsior improves long-term preservation of the donor heart. These strategies offer the potential to increase the proportion of transplantable organs, to improve donor organ quality, and thereby improve transplantation outcomes...|$|R

Animals were given continuous i. v. infusions of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, or the dual metallopeptidase inhibitor, MDL 100, 240 (both at 3 [*]mg kg− 1, 3 [*]mg kg− 1 h− 1; n[*]=[*] 8 for regional and cardiac <b>haemodynamics),</b> <b>for</b> 32 [*]h. Twenty four hours after the onset of infusion of enalaprilat or MDL 100, 240, the bradykinin (B 2) -receptor antagonist, Hoe[*] 140 (1 [*]mg kg− 1, i. v.), was given and measurements were continued for a further 8 [*]h, to assess any possible involvement of bradykinin. Over the first 8 [*]h of infusion, both enalaprilat and MDL 100, 240 had significant antihypertensive effects, accompanied by similar regional vasodilatations. However, the blood pressure lowering effect of MDL 100, 240 (− 54 [*]±[*] 9 [*]mmHg) was {{greater than that of}} enalaprilat (− 38 [*]±[*] 4 [*]mmHg), because the former caused a significantly greater reduction in cardiac index. Between 8 – 24 [*]h after the onset of infusion, there was a reduction in the effect of enalaprilat on blood pressure, because cardiac index rose, with no further increase in total peripheral conductance. In contrast, the antihypertensive effect of MDL 100, 240 persisted, in spite of a recovery in cardiac index, because there was further vasodilatation, particularly in the mesenteric and hindquarters vascular beds. There were no apparent haemodynamic changes associated with the injection of Hoe[*] 140, and over the following 8 [*]h, the difference between the haemodynamic effects of enalaprilat and MDL 100, 240 persisted; there was little evidence of suppression of the effects of either drug. These results are more consistent with the antihypertensive effects of enalaprilat or MDL 100, 240 in transgenic ((mRen- 2) 27) rats being due to suppression of angiotensin II production, than due to inhibition of bradykinin degradation. The additional effects of MDL 100, 240 may be accounted for by inhibition of the degradation of natriuretic peptides reducing cardiac output, initially, and decreasing vascular tone, subsequently. Alternatively, the additional increase in vascular conductance following treatment with MDL 100, 240 may represent an autoregulatory response to the reduced pressure...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Despite major {{advances}} in renal replacement therapy acute kidney injury (AKI) is still {{associated with high}} morbidity and mortality. Beside risk factors like mechanical ventilation, acidosis {{has been identified as}} one factor contributing to AKI. However, in critically ill patients with multiple risk factors a differentiated analysis of the influence of acidosis is hard to perform. Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of an acidaemia on renal function excluding sepsis or other infections. Methods: 35 young and healthy pigs were randomized into 6 groups. Three test pairs were settled with or without exposition to a continuos veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH), respectively. The groups differed by: normoxaemia-balanced acid-base-status (NB-CVVH and NB-CTRL), normoxaemia-acidaemic (NA-CVVH and NA-CTRL) and hypoxaemia-acidaemic (HA-CVVH and HA-CTRL). Due to low-tidal-volume-ventilation and acid-infusion a mixed acidaemia (pH 7. 19 - 7. 24) was induced into acidaemic groups. HA-groups underwent an additional hypoxaemia. Acidemia and hypoxaemia were maintained <b>for</b> five hours. <b>Haemodynamics,</b> ventilation parameter, blood gas analysis and diuresis were monitored constantly as well as interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), TNF-aplha and interleukin- 18 (IL- 18) in blood and tissue samples, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) was analyzed in urine specimen. Tissue samples of the kidneys were (immuno-) histologically examined. Results: All animals were haemodynamically stable throughout the entire experiment. Animals had sufficient diuresis facing a physiologic cardiac output at any time. Interestingly, diuresis increased in acidemia groups while urine-pH decreased. Increased plasma levels of IL- 18 and NGAL indicated a developing AKI in the acidaemia groups. Concordantly, normoxic-acidaemia groups had significantly more reversible and irreversible cell damage in histopathological examination, just exceeded by hypoxaemia- acidaemia groups. Due to measurements of proinflammatory cytokines in tissue and plasma a biotrauma induced AKI was excluded, because subgroup analysis of immunohistology revealed an inverse correlation between tissue levels of proinflammatory cytokines and histopathological cell damage. Conclusion: We were able to demonstrate that an isolated acidaemia without concomitant sepsis already leads to a relevant histologically detectable damage of the kidneys after only five hours exposition to acidaemia. Immunohistochemical investigations showed that other than inflammatory factors induced the renal damage. Results are leading to the hypothesis that the acidaemia works as a kind of „first hit“ by increasing renal workload with respect to the correction of acid-base-status abnormalities and thereby contributing to a depletion of renal energy reserves. Initially increasing diuresis clinically masks the early onset of an AKI due to the compensation for acidosis by the kidneys...|$|R
40|$|A clot in a {{cerebral}} aneurysm can either accelerate {{the road to}} rupture, through inflammatory processes and furthering vascular wall degradation, or stabilise the situation by occluding the aneurysm, and thus prevent rupture. A three-dimensional computational model of clotting in patient-derived {{cerebral aneurysm}} geometries is presented. The model accounts for the biochemical reactions {{that make up the}} clotting process, <b>for</b> realistic three-dimensional <b>haemodynamics</b> in image-derived vasculature representations and for the growing clot’s interaction with and impact on the flow field. The flow is accounted for by the Navier Stokes equations and the transport equation describes the changes in biochemical species concentrations. Level Set methods are used to track the surface of the growing clot in the three-dimensional geometries studied. The influence of the thrombosed region on the <b>haemodynamics</b> is accounted <b>for</b> by modifying the local porosity and permeability, to reflect the fibrous and permeable nature of the clot. The model is first developed, examined and parameterised for a physiological model of clotting in two dimensions and is then extended and demonstrated for the pathological case in three dimensions. The framework developed is used to examine various aspects of clotting. The two-dimensional model is used to investigate the effects of critical thrombin concentration, tissue factor and the underlying biochemical cascade. The critical thrombin concentration at which coagulation transitions from the initiation to the propagation phase was found to be [TH] = 1 – 10 nM. The inclusion of blood-borne tissue factor was found to reflect a more realistic thrombin production curve and an increase in initial tissue factor concentration led to a decrease in thrombin production lag time. The different underlying biochemical cascades produce similar results. The model is then extended to three dimensions and is used to investigate clot propagation and initiation in patient-derived aneurysms. The propagation velocity is linked to mechanical factors and biochemical species concentrations. An inverse relationship between strain rate and propagation velocity showed realistic clot growth. Realistic growth was also observed for a direct relationship with thrombin concentration and this seemed to be the most suitable approximation. The ways in which tissue factor, strain rate threshold and location of endothelial damage affect initiation are also examined. A strain rate of 500 s- 1 was found to be the highest strain rate at which fibrin controlled clot initiation took place. Above that value, no clotting was observed. The location of endothelial damage affected clot growth as evidenced by the reproduction of the clots observed under Lawton’s classification scheme. The three-dimensional model is then applied to patient-derived geometries and is used to examine the efficacy of flow diverter treatment. For a given geometry, clot growth is predicted for the case with and without a flow diverter. In some cases, clotting is a positive outcome while in other cases, the clot occludes the parent vessel. The unique contribution of this thesis is the combination of computational fluid dynamics, biochemistry and Level Set methods in complex, realistic, three-dimensional aneurysm geometries for clot prediction. The impact of the clot on the flow field is modelled by altering the porosity and permeability values of the clot region...|$|R
40|$|With the {{advancement}} of tomographic imaging techniques and high performance computing facilities, more realistic blood flow simulations based on patient-specific geometries have become feasible. One important application of such simulations is the haemodynamical assessment of carotid artery stenosis in order to assist the physicians in the planning of endoscopic or surgical interventions. However, despite the considerable capabilities of the various tools available, the clinical use of CFD methods is still limited due to the following reasons: â¢	Even the simplest possible flow models are still computationally expensive. In many cases, {{a large amount of}} the computation time is spent on the complex mesh generation. In addition, more advanced model specifications such as pulsatile flow, non-Newtonian flow models, and fluid-structure interaction, will drastically increase the computational costs. â¢	The accuracy of the simulation results, depends on the choices of inflow and outflow conditions. These conditions involve the imposition or extrapolation of unknown velocities or pressure values which often do not correspond with the ones in reality. â¢	The workflow for constructing the models is complex and user-dependent, and currently can only be done by CFD experts. In fact, apart from very few research tools, no specialized software is available <b>for</b> performing computational <b>haemodynamics.</b> We present a software framework for image-based blood flow analysis in an effort to meet the above challenges. Our software solution spans a broad range of techniques, from MRI image processing to parallel flow simulation and finally, to a flow analysis geared towards specific clinical problems. For our flow simulation, we use the Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) method. This method provides advantages compared to traditional flow solvers due to its simplicity and parallel performance. In- and outflow conditions are based on 4 D flow-sensitive MRI measurements (Phase-contrast MRI), which are increasingly used in clinical establishments and provide an ideal basis for parameterization of simulation models. The simulation geometry (segmented vessel) is constructed from the MRI anatomic data. Furthermore, the initial and boundary conditions are set {{with a high degree of}} automation using flow-sensitive MRI measurements. A surface model is then generated and voxelized to a desired grid resolution. The flow solver is implemented with the help of the open-source Lattice-Boltzmann library OpenLB using BGK dynamics and Skordos boundary conditions. For analysis of simulation results and quantification of clinical parameters, a research software dedicated to cardiovascular flow analysis is used. Quantification methods include the evaluation of flow rates and velocity profiles on user-defined vessel cross-sections, centerline pressure analysis and probabilistic flow tracking. In our first evaluation study, the workflow has been tested for steady flow in stenosed vessel phantoms. At moderate Reynolds numbers (Re= 625 at stenosis), velocity and pressure results are accurate compared to established FEM flow solvers. For our second evaluation, results for steady systolic flow in a healthy human carotid artery bifurcation were compared to 4 D flow-sensitive MRI image data. In our current study, we investigate the effects of virtual treatment of carotid artery stenosis. For this purpose, steady systolic flow is simulated in a patient with plaque in the internal carotid artery (ICA), based on MRI anatomy and flow measurements. The stenosis is then virtually removed by local dilation of the surface mesh. The efficiency of treatment is evaluated by quantifying the pressure drop along the centerline of the ICA...|$|R
