500|$|Doggystyle {{is seen by}} many hip hop pundits as a [...] "classic" [...] and an [...] "essential" [...] album. It is {{credited}} with defining West Coast hip hop; shifting the emphasis to more melodious, synth-driven, and funk-induced beats. About.com stated during the period the album was released, [...] "Gangsta rap never sounded so sweet." [...] The album {{is credited}} for further establishment of the slurred [...] "lazy drawl" [...] that sacrificed lyrical complexity <b>for</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>and</b> rhythmic cadence on Doggystyle and The Chronic.

500|$|Despite {{its initial}} low sales, the album had a {{profound}} impact on the hip hop underground circuit, and marked a major stylistic change in hip hop music by introducing a new standard of lyricism. Before the album's release, hip-hop lyricism was mostly defined by two popular forms. One was characterized by a fast-paced ragga-flow accompanied with a whimsical, often nonsensical lyrical delivery, and had been popularized by the Brooklyn-based groups Das EFX and The Fu-Schnickens. The other was characterized by a slurred [...] "lazy drawl" [...] that sacrificed lyrical complexity <b>for</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>and</b> rhythmic cadence, and was exemplified by West Coast hip hop emcees including Snoop Doggy Dogg and Warren G. However, Nas' content, verbal pace, and intricate internal rhyme patterns inspired several rappers to modify their lyrical abilities. [...] Music critic Rob Marriott notes, [...] "appers like Mobb Deep, Tragedy Khadafi, Nature, Cormega, Noreaga, Capone, Raekwon, Ghostface, and even the Windy City wordsmith Common seemed to find new inspiration in Nas' self awareness, internal rhyme schemes, and mastery of street detail." [...] Marriott also describes the impact of Illmatics [...] "poetic approach" [...] on Jay-Z, writing: [...] "The Brooklyn MC switched his style up from his fast-talking Jaz-O days enough to produce Reasonable Doubt, an album marked by Nas-like introspection..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Innovations in the {{philosophy}} of language during the 20th century renewed interest in whether mathematics is, as is often said, the language of science. Although some mathematicians and philosophers would accept the statement [...] "mathematics is a language", linguists believe that the implications of such a statement must be considered. For example, the tools of linguistics are not generally applied to the symbol systems of mathematics, that is, mathematics is studied in a markedly different way from other languages. If mathematics is a language, it is a different type of language from natural languages. Indeed, because of the need <b>for</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>and</b> specificity, the language of mathematics is far more constrained than natural languages studied by linguists. However, the methods developed by Frege and Tarski for the study of mathematical language have been extended greatly by Tarski's student Richard Montague and other linguists working in formal semantics to show that the distinction between mathematical language and natural language may not be as great as it seems.|$|E
2500|$|The {{completed}} version contained 334 {{poems and}} {{was published in}} Buenos Aires.

[...] "A vista de hombre", for example, was begun in a New York hotel and deals {{with a view of}} an unnamed metropolis from a skyscraper. [...] It develops the poet’s thoughts on his relationship with the mass of people living and working in this city until it closes with the poet retiring to his bed. [...] Unlike García Lorca in Poeta en Nueva York or countless other poets, the city is not inhuman, cold, abstract. [...] The emphasis is on the mass of humanity it holds. The city is a mix of good and evil, man’s heroic endeavours and barbarity – a reality that has to be embraced in totality even when you cannot understand it. The poet is both an isolated individual in a hotel room and a member of this society.|$|E

2500|$|The Revised Standard Version of the Bible, {{which first}} {{appeared}} in 1946, retained the pronoun thou exclusively to address God, using you in other places. This was done to preserve the tone, at once intimate and reverent, that would be familiar to those who knew the King James Version and read the Psalms and similar text in devotional use. The New American Standard Bible (1971) made the same decision, but the revision of 1995 (New American Standard Bible, Updated edition) reversed it. Similarly, the 1989 Revised English Bible dropped all forms of thou that {{had appeared in the}} earlier New English Bible (1970). The New Revised Standard Version (1989) omits thou entirely and claims that it is incongruous and contrary to the original intent of the use of thou in Bible translation to adopt a distinctive pronoun to address the Deity. When referring to God, [...] "thou" [...] is often capitalized <b>for</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>and</b> reverence. While Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic (the languages of the Bible) do not have a special orthography (such as capitalization) for indicating that the Deity is being referred to, their grammars are more successful than English in making noun/pronoun agreement unambiguous.|$|E
6000|$|The {{peculiar}} {{circumstances of}} Trafford's birth and upbringing had accentuated his natural disposition toward this new thoroughness of intellectual treatment {{which has always}} distinguished the great artist, and which to-day is also the essential quality of the scientific method. He had lived apart from any urgency to produce and compete in the common business of the world; his natural curiosities, fed and encouraged by his natural gifts, had grown into a steady passion <b>for</b> <b>clarity</b> <b>and</b> knowledge. But with him there was no specialization. He brought out from his laboratory into the everyday affairs of the world the same sceptical restraint of judgment which is the touchstone of scientific truth. This made him a tepid and indeed rather a scornful spectator {{of political and social}} life. Party formulae, international rivalries, social customs, and very much of the ordinary law of our state impressed him as a kind of fungoid growth out of a fundamental intellectual muddle. It all maintained itself hazardously, changing and adapting itself unintelligently to unseen conditions. He saw no ultimate truth in this seething welter of human efforts, no tragedy as yet in its defeats, no value in its victories. It had to go on, he believed, until the spreading certitudes of the scientific method pierced its unsubstantial thickets, burst its delusive films, drained away its folly. Aunt Plessington's talk of order and progress and the influence of her Movement impressed his mind very much as the cackle of some larger kind of hen--which cackles because it must. Only Aunt Plessington being human simply imagined the egg. She laid--on the plane of the ideal. When the great nonsensical issues between liberal and conservative, between socialist and individualist, between [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] and [...] "Teuton," [...] between the [...] "white race" [...] and the [...] "yellow race" [...] arose in Trafford's company, he would if he felt cheerful take {{one side or the other}} as chance or his amusement with his interlocutors determined, and jest and gibe at the opponent's inconsistencies, and if on the other hand he chanced to be irritable he would lose his temper at this [...] "chewing of mesembryanthemum" [...] and sulk into silence. [...] "Chewing mesembryanthemum" [...] was one of Trafford's favourite images,--no doubt the reader knows that abundant fleshy Mediterranean weed and the weakly unpleasant wateriness of its substance. He went back to his laboratory and his proper work after such discussions with a feeling of escape, as if he shut a door upon a dirty and undisciplined market-place crowded with mental defectives. Yet even before he met and married Marjorie, there was a queer little undertow of thought in his mind which insisted that this business could not end with door-slamming, that he didn't altogether leave the social confusion outside his panels when he stood alone before his apparatus, and that sooner or later that babble of voices would force his defences and overcome his disdain.|$|E
