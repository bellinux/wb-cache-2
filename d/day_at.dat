40|$|Effects of {{temperature}} and leaf wetness on the latent period of Rhynchosporium secalis (leaf blotch) on winter barley {{were examined in}} controlled environment experiments. At 100 % relative humidity (continuous leaf wetness) the mean length of the latent period was c. 24 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 5 degrees C, c. 19 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 10 degrees C, c. 16 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 15 degrees C and c. 13 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 20 degrees C. The mean number of days between {{the appearance of the}} first and the last lesions was c. 13 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 5 degrees C, c. 6 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 10 degrees C, c. 5 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 15 degrees C and c. 3 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 20 degrees C. A negative curvilinear regression of latent period on temperature accounted for 99 % of the variance. The mean area of lesions per leaf was 38 mm(2) at 5 degrees C, 46 mm(2) at 10 degrees C, 24 mm(2) at 15 degrees C and 24 mm(2) at 20 degrees C. At 10 degrees C, after a 48 h wet infection period, the interruption of leaf wetness for 5 or more <b>days</b> <b>at</b> any time during the next 15 days of the latent period did not decrease subsequent lesion area. However, absence of leaf wetness after these 15 <b>days,</b> <b>at</b> the onset of sporulation, did decrease the area of lesions which developed...|$|R

50|$|A. verbasci has a {{life cycle}} ranging from 1-3 years, {{depending}} upon the environmental conditions. A study in 1958 found that temperature is able to affect larval development, concluding that the periods of incubation and pupation of A. verbasci decrease with increase of temperature (the life cycle is thus quickened with a modern rise in temperature). Incubation decreased from 54 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 15°C to 12 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 30°C, and the pupation decreased from 89 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 10°C to 9 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> 25°C.
