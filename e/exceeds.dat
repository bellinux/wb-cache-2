When the tissue pressure drops below this cross-over criterion the tissue is modelled by exponential kinetics.

5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand <b>exceeds</b> supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand <b>exceeds</b> available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
