It is the {{historic}} center of Baghdadi book-selling, a street filled with bookstores and outdoor book stalls. It was named after the 10th-century classical Iraqi poet Al-Mutanabbi. This street is well established for bookselling and has often {{been referred to as}} the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the Baghdad literacy and intellectual community.|$|E

Cluny the Scourge—the evil one-eyed rat warlord, is hell-bent on destroying the tranquility {{as he prepares to}} fight a bloody battle for the ownership of Redwall. This dazzling story in the Redwall series is packed with all the wit, wisdom, humor, and blood-curdling adventure of the other books in the collection, but has the added bonus of taking the reader right back to the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Redwall Abbey and the characters who live there.|$|E

That's what happened and that's what he's gone through, and that's that.” Jackson felt the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the character were still the same; the foundation of Lucky was still the product of Luke and Laura. He described his portrayal as working through the contradictory traits Lucky inherited from his parents, the purity of Laura versus the con artist side of Luke. He explained that he was taking the essence of being their son and translating him into adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{major part}} of the NASCAR circuit North Carolina now only has one track on the schedule, Charlotte. The 167,000-seat Charlotte track is arguably the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> NASCAR. The track, {{actually}} in Concord, hosts three Cup Series events every season, including the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race (formally The Winston). Charlotte also hosts NASCAR's longest and most grueling race, the Coca-Cola 600, every May. The winner of the race earns tremendous respect among peers and fans due to the distance (the longest on the circuit) and the weather (North Carolina is known for extremely humid and hot summers). During race weeks Concord is said to balloon from its normal population of just under 56,000 to over 300,000.|$|E
25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first. Virgin Killer is none other than the demon of our time, the less compassionate side of the societies we live in today—brutally trampling upon the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> innocence.|$|E

500|$|Time Out New York {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 5, calling it [...] "acceptable escapism for those {{old enough to}} see it yet still young enough to shriek at undead dreamboats." [...] Jordan Mintzer from Variety stated, [...] "Stewart is the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the film", and added that she [...] "gives both weight and depth to dialogue...that would sound like typical chick-lit blather {{in the mouth of}} a less {{engaging}} actress, and she makes Bella's psychological wounds seem like the real deal." ...|$|E
500|$|Redding {{has been}} called the [...] "King of Soul", an honorific also given to Brown and Cooke. He remains one of the genre's most {{recognized}} artists. His lean and powerful style exemplified the Stax sound; he was said to be [...] "the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Stax", while artists such as Al Jackson, Dunn and Cropper helped to expand its structure. His open-throated singing, the tremolo/vibrato, the manic, electrifying stage performances and perceived honesty were particular hallmarks, along with the use of interjections (such as [...] "gotta, gotta, gotta"), some of which came from Cooke. Producer Stewart thought the [...] "begging singing" [...] was stress-induced and enhanced by Redding's shyness.|$|E

His opponents were Democratic incumbent Deval Patrick, Green-Rainbow candidate Jill Stein, and an Independent, State Treasurer and Receiver General Tim Cahill. For his running mate, Baker chose Senate minority leader Richard R. Tisei. At the state Republican Convention on April 17, 2010, Baker beat former Independent candidate Christy Mihos for the Republican nomination, winning with 89% of the delegate vote, thus avoiding a primary fight with Mihos.|$|E
500|$|During {{the sixth}} season the {{development}} of the character was praised, Glenn Diaz of BuddyTV commented that [...] "You gotta love Mer when she's gloomy.", in addition to praising Pompeo's performance. In her review of the episode Tainted Obligation she wrote [...] "I felt for Meredith, but after Lexie's heartfelt begging and pleading, I was happy that Mere finally grows up and casts her selfishness aside. Three seasons ago Meredith would never have dreamed of putting Lexie first, and I was proud of her for giving up part of her liver—her offer to get to know her dad was an even bigger milestone." [...] Reviewing {{the first part of the}} eighth season, TV Fanatic lauded the character and wrote: [...] "this season belongs to Meredith Grey. She is the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the show and has been outstanding. This is a character that used to be so dark and twisty and has now grown into a more mature woman. Ellen Pompeo has been at the top of her game this season." ...|$|E

500|$|The two-hour pilot episode, {{filmed in}} Toronto, Ontario, Canada, cost {{a total of}} $10 million to create. A {{basement}} of an old church was used for Walter's lab set in the pilot, and this set was replicated at other film sites in New York and Vancouver when the show moved. The lab set was designed by Carol Spier, the production designer for several of Cronenberg's films. John Noble called his character's lab [...] "the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Fringe", so consequently, [...] "That has to remain constant." [...] A cow used in the pilot episode had to be recast when production of Season 1 was moved to New York, due to livestock restrictions preventing it from being brought from Canada to the United States. Other locations used in the first season included other universities to stage for the Harvard University campus, where Walter's lab is located. These included Pratt Institute and Yale University, including its Old Campus (particularly Phelps Hall and Durfee Hall), Branford College, and the exterior of Yale Law School, University of Toronto's University College, Brooklyn College.|$|E
500|$|The writing {{style was}} {{positively}} received as being vivid and well-written, sometimes grim, but with appropriate language. Even an overall negative review by Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post remarked the writing was [...] "always lucid, sometimes elegant". In The New York Times Book Review Jennifer Schuessler said Weisman has a [...] "flirtation with religious language, his occasionally portentous impassivity {{giving way to}} the familiar rhetoric of eco-hellfire". Janet Maslin of The New York Times found the writing had [...] "an arid, plain, what-if style" [...] while being [...] "strangely uniform in tone". On the reporting techniques, Kamiya wrote that [...] " [...] science reporting, at once lucid and full of wonder ... is the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> this book" [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "written as if by a compassionate and curious observer on another planet". The Plain Dealer book editor Karen Long said Weisman [...] "uses the precise, unhurried language of a good science writer and shows a knack for unearthing unexpected sources and provocative facts".|$|E
500|$|In India, {{the film}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 {{is a winner}} all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of the}} biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not stop you from being dazzled by the film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai’s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer.|$|E

500|$|After {{the game}} was announced, the {{development}} faced serious problems, starting with Naka's resignation as head of Sonic Team to form his own company, Prope. With his departure, [...] "the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Sonic" [...] was gone, according to former Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske. Sonic the Hedgehog was originally intended for release on all major seventh generation consoles as well as Microsoft Windows, but when presented with development kits for Nintendo's less powerful Wii console, the team was split in two. Nakamura led one team to finish Sonic the Hedgehog for Xbox360 and PlayStation3 while producer Yojiro Ogawa led the other half to begin work on Sonic and the Secret Rings for the Wii. The split left an unusually small development team to work on Sonic the Hedgehog. Sega began pressuring the team to release the game by Christmas 2006, so with the deadline quickly approaching, Sonic Team rushed {{the final stages of}} development, ignoring existing bugs and control problems. Various planned features were dropped, such as a time of day and night mechanic similar to the one later implemented in Sonic Unleashed (2008), and additional multiplayer components.|$|E
500|$|This episode {{addresses}} {{the death of}} Dale Horvath, who is attacked and ripped open by a walker. Since writer Robert Kirkman felt that Dale epitomized a character of morality and humanity, much of [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] explores themes related to the declining morality of individuals during a catastrophic event. Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking {{a turning point for}} future development of The Walking Dead. [...] "Dale's character has been the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> the show," [...] he iterated. [...] "He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world change you and monitoring what lengths people are going to survive. His loss is going to mean a great deal for all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot." [...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and get to know him and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely going to miss him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{shooting}} script features {{a scene in}} Angela's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty; the scene differed from earlier versions, which set it as a [...] "big scene on a freeway" [...] in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body. The change was a practical decision, as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs. The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash, but only half a day was available. Ball agreed, {{but only if the}} scene could retain a line of Ricky's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman: [...] "When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back." [...] Jane asks: [...] "And what do you see?" [...] Ricky: [...] "Beauty." [...] Ball said, [...] "They wanted to cut that scene. They said it's not important. I said, 'You're out of your fucking mind. It's {{one of the most important}} scenes in the movie!' If any one line is the <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> this movie, that is the line." [...] Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence; set in a schoolyard, it presents a [...] "turning point" [...] for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela. By the end of filming, the script had been through 10 drafts.|$|E

Many of the women began to cry softly. Fervent amens broke {{from some of the}} members.
