50|$|Many {{concepts}} of modern hospital medicine are considered products {{of social and}} political change of the French Revolution, arising in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Medical reform was a contentious topic of the revolutionary movement, as the French medical system met neither the needs of the population nor its practitioners. Patients described Paris' hospitals as poorhouses, noting severe overcrowding, and that only those with the means to pay could secure a personal bed. Medical professionals also sought <b>hospital</b> <b>reform,</b> as a struggle for control with the religious nurses who had traditionally staffed Parisian hospitals under management of the Catholic church.|$|E

40|$|The {{inquiry is}} {{inspired}} by the author's interest in late medieval concepts of reform, and focuses specifically on the concrete case of <b>hospital</b> <b>reforms.</b> Since the structure of reform discourse is closely connected to legal arguments, the article concentrates on selected canonistic texts from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries concerning hospitals: the Tractatus hospitalitatis by Johannes Lapo of Castiglione (about 1370) and some commentaries on the Clementine decretal Quia contingit (1312 / 1317). The analysis deals with legal arguments which are relevant to reform (e. g. the convertibility a hospital founder’s testament), and furthermore discusses key notions related to problems like the affiliation of hospitals with the legal sphere of the Church. The ambivalence of canonistic arguments, which may either foster or prevent reform initiatives, {{is evident in the}} use of narrative figures such as the tension between origins and the present (i. e. the foundation of a hospital and its later evolution). Jurists employed such rhetoric devices {{to address the problem of}} the relationship between time and the development of law, but at the same time these narrative figures have a structural affinity with reform discourse. It may be concluded that the most important contribution of late medieval canonists to <b>hospital</b> <b>reforms</b> does not consist in straightforward instructions pro or contra reform, but in the fact that canon law elaborated the conditions that made it possible to think of reform...|$|R

50|$|Before {{the start}} of the 19th century, there were many {{problems}} existing within the French medical system. These problems were outlined by many seeking to reform hospitals including a contemporary surgeon Jacques Tenon in his book Memoirs on Paris Hospitals. Some of the problems Tenon drew attention to were the lack of space, the inability to separate patients based on the type of illness (including those that were contagious), and general sanitation problems. Additionally, the secular revolution led to the nationalization of hospitals previously owned by the Catholic Church and led to a call for a <b>hospital</b> <b>reform</b> which actually pushed for the deinstitutionalization of medicine. This contributed to the state of disarray Paris hospitals soon fell into which ultimately called {{for the establishment of a}} new hospital system outlined in the law of 1794. The law of 1794 played a significant part in revolutionizing Paris Medicine because it aimed to address some of the problems facing Paris Hospitals of the time.|$|E

Public <b>hospitals</b> and their performance was the major health issue in the 2007 national election.

He also stated his intention to hold a national referendum to allow the Commonwealth to take over the running of public <b>hospitals</b> if <b>reform</b> could not be achieved cooperatively with the States by the middle of 2009. The reform task, developing the long term plan for Australia 2 ̆ 7 s health care system, was given to the Health and <b>Hospitals</b> <b>Reform</b> Commission, a ten person committee under the chairmanship of a paediatrician, now working as the medical advisor for a large private insurer, with ex-politicians, medical practitioners, one nurse, and others with both corporate and public sector experience. The Interim Report of the Commission was publicly released in February 2009 and the Final Report in June of the same year. The Interim Report set out 116 reform directions, ranging from specific recommendations to aspirational goals. The Committee commented that the single most controversial issue it was called to address was the split of responsibilities between the Commonwealth and States and Territories, essentially the governance, funding and operating of public hospitals.
