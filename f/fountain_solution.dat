5000|$|<b>Fountain</b> <b>solution</b> is the {{water-based}} (or [...] "aqueous") {{component in}} the lithographic process that moistens the non image area of the plate {{in order to keep}} ink from depositing (and thus printing). Historically, fountain solutions were acid-based and made with gum arabic, chromates and/or phosphates, and magnesium nitrate. Alcohol is added to the water to lower the surface tension and help cool the press a bit so the ink stays stable so it can set and dry fast. While the acid <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> has improved in the last several decades, neutral and alkaline fountain solutions have also been developed. Both of these chemistries rely heavily on surfactants-emulsifiers and phosphates and/or silicates to provide adequate cleaning and desensitizing, respectively. Since about 2000, alkaline-based fountain solutions have become less common due to the inherent health hazards of high pH and the objectionable odor of the necessary microbiological additives.|$|E
50|$|Offset ink is a {{specific}} type of ink used in conjunction with offset printing presses such as those used to produce letterpress or lithography prints. Such ink must be specially formulated to resist other chemicals it will come in contact with on the printing press. It is crucial that offset ink resist water-in-ink emulsification (e.g. repel rather than absorb water). It should also withstand degradation by the <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> which covers the non-printing areas of the engraved plate.|$|E
5000|$|Dot gain {{is caused}} by ink {{spreading}} around halftone dots. Several factors {{can contribute to the}} increase in halftone dot area. Different paper types have different ink absorption rates; uncoated papers can absorb more ink than coated ones, and thus can show more gain. As printing pressure can squeeze the ink out of its dot shape causing gain, ink viscosity is a contributing factor with coated papers; higher viscosity inks can resist the pressure better. Halftone dots can also be surrounded by a small circumference of ink, in an effect called [...] "rimming". Each halftone dot has a microscopic relief, and ink will fall off the edge before being eliminated entirely by the <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> (in the case of offset printing). Finally, halation of the printing film during exposure can contribute to dot gain.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{thought that the}} water pick-up rate and {{capacity}} of an ink may have a profound affect on the press performance of an ink. As the water content of ink changes so do the Theological characteristics of the ink and this effects ink performance attributes such as ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. An emulsification curve can {{shed some light on}} how ink might perform on a press but this alone is not enough. The objective of this thesis research was to study the interaction of <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> and ink as used in the printing of newspapers, in terms of ink water pick-up rates and capacity. Further, this is a study of the effect of the <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> and ink interaction on ink transfer, drying, rub resistance, set-off and strength. In this study, three different black news inks and three different fountain solutions have been used to make a total of nine different ink and <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> combinations. One set was a specific black news ink and <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> combination, Flint Low Rub Black and Anchor Neutral <b>Fountain</b> <b>Solution,</b> used in the printing of USA Today at Boston Offset in Norwood, MA. The paper, a 30 # newsprint, was the only newsprint used throughout the testing. Water pick up rates have been determined and emulsification curves have been developed {{with the use of a}} Duke Tester for all nine ink and <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> combinations. The effect of these water pick-up rates on the rheological characteristics has been studied with the use of a Brookfield Rotational Viscometer. With the use of a motorized Little Joe printability tester, ink was laid down on the newsprint at a constant volume and any changes in ink strength were measured with a densitometer. Rub resistance was examined with a Rub Tester and a densitometer. The experimental data from this study show a direct correlation between the water pick-up capacity of an ink and the affect this has on the ink rheology and ink performance. The tests and data revealed that each ink had a tendency to pick-up more of the alkaline <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> than the neutral solution. The least was picked up with the acid <b>fountain</b> <b>solution.</b> The more <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> the inks picked up, the greater the changes in viscosity, strength, dryback and rub-off.

40|$|In offset lithography, ink {{has been}} shown to pickup {{significant}} quantities of <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> as emulsified droplets. Good printability of lithographic inks is dependent on the balance between the flow of ink and water (<b>fountain</b> <b>solution).</b> Water pickup of ink is directly related to emulsification capacity. Emulsification must be controlled by using the correct <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> and proper surface tension value of <b>fountain</b> <b>solution.</b> If inks do not properly emulsify, ink tack may vary on the press during printing. Ink tack is expected to strongly influence printability and runnability of offset lithographic inks.

40|$|With {{approximately}} 62, 355 {{firms and}} sales of $ 210 billion annually, the printing industry is a significant contributor to the overall U. S. economy. The printing industry {{is also an important}} environmental actor in several major areas, such as use of paper (about 8 percent of all the wood cut down worldwide is used for paper production, much of which is used in printing), use of hazardous materials in printing inks, and production of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from cleaning solvents used in the printing process. Regulatory standards and social pressures are requiring printing fi rms to reduce their use of resources and emissions of hazardous and other substances. Doing this can be costly. In 1994, for example, the printing and publishing industry reported spending over $ 57 million on pollution control equipment alone (United States Census Bureau). Many in industry and government agree that preventing pollution tends to be more efficient, from an economic and environmental perspective, than controlling it after the fact. Pollution prevention is accomplished through changes in production, operation, and raw materials use, in contrast to pollution control, which is accomplished by the adoption of emissions-abatement or waste treatment technologies. Indeed, many lithographic printing firms have achieved significant reductions in emissions and regulatory costs through the implementation of pollution prevention. Adoption of alcohol-free <b>fountain</b> <b>solutions,</b> solvent recovery and reuse, non- or low-VOC inks, and non- or low-VOC blanket and roller washes are but a few examples of the kinds of process changes implemented by this industry that have led to significant environmental improvements. While many lithographic printers, and their suppliers, have done a great deal to reduce the environmental impact of their operations, the call for further reductions has not dissipated. Printing firms continue to face the challenge of meeting or exceeding environmental requirements while staying competitive. The overall objective of this research effort is to provide insight into these challenges, the ways in which firms have succeeded in meeting them, and impediments that have caused some firms to be less successful. This monograph reviews several key aspects of environmental management in the lithographic printing industry and forms the foundation for future research. After a very brief description of the lithographic printing industry, the monograph presents a summary of the major environmental issues facing the industry today. Second, it presents a synopsis of relevant environmental regulations. Third, the paper focuses on the pollution prevention techniques that have been employed by the industry to reduce the emission of VOCs. VOC reduction has been a prime regulatory target for this industry and {{has been the focus of}} much pollution prevention activity. The paper reviews both general information on techniques for reducing VOCs — through process change — as well as a tabularized summary of 15 case studies of printing firms that were successful in reducing their environmental loadings through pollution prevention. Fourth, the monograph contains a review of a number of technical assistance and regulatory reform programs aimed at facilitating pollution prevention in the printing industry.

40|$|The {{permanence}} of printed documents and books {{appears to be}} primarily dependent on paper stability. Other researchers implicate pH as {{a major factor in}} the deterioration rate of paper and acidity as major the cause of this deterioration. During the lithographic printing process, ink is in direct contact with <b>fountain</b> <b>solution,</b> which can be acidic or alkaline. <b>Fountain</b> <b>solution</b> is a mixture of water and chemicals used to keep the non-image areas of a lithographic plate moist. On press the intimate contact of ink with <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> creates a fountain solution-in-ink emulsion. The emulsion used here is a stable suspension of <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> droplets within the ink. The objective of this study was to determine if ink/fountain solution emulsion, which is printed on paper during lithographic printing, affects the rate of deterioration of paper. The stability of four commonly available papers was observed. These paper types were groundwood, publication grade, coated book, and uncoated book. Samples of the four paper groups were printed with four different ink formulations. The ink formulations were ink, ink and distilled water, ink and acidic <b>fountain</b> <b>solution,</b> and ink and alkaline <b>fountain</b> <b>solution.</b> Samples of the unprinted and printed paper were subjected to an accelerated - aging process by heating the samples for 72 hours at 100 C. The properties of unaged and aged papers were evaluated by pH determination, folding endurance, and tearing resistance. On the basis of statistical analysis of the data, inferences were made about the effect of the ink formulations on the paper properties. This experiment indicates that ink/fountain solution emulsion did affect the paper pH, but this effect is due to the ink with little change in pH due to the addition of acidic or alkaline <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> to the ink. The results of folding endurance and tearing resistance tests after accelerated aging established no clear pattern of variance that would indicate the differences observed in these properties were due to the pH change associated with the ink/fountain solution emulsions. Several unexpected occurrences were exhibited by this experiment. These include: groundwood was the paper least affected by the aging process; the pH of coated paper increased with the application of ink/fountain solution emulsion; a decrease in tearing resistance was associated with alkaline <b>fountain</b> <b>solution...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{curing time}} and the end use {{properties}} {{are as important as}} printing quality for the printer. Shorter curing time equals more jobs and higher productivity each week. The latest available technology for decreasing curing time is Ultraviolet curing technology. This technology uses ultraviolet radiation as the energy source to excite the active site of the monomer in the ink to start the polymerization process. The desired result is a hard polymerized ink film. Another advantage of Ultraviolet curing technology is that the ink is solventless. The screen printing process has the advantage of being a single-fluid printing process. Ink is the only chemical compound to be considered in this printing process. Lithography requires compatibility between ink and <b>fountain</b> <b>solution.</b> Extensive research has been done to better understand the relationship between <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> and ink, primarily with conventional ink. The water pickup characteristics of conventional ink is mainly studied for the effect of water on the printing quality. Due to the nature of Ultraviolet ink, the water-ink relation is more complicated. The water pickup by the ink is thought to {{have an effect on the}} curing process. This thesis studies the effect of water pickup of ultraviolet ink on curing time and end use properties. The water pickup of the ink was varied by using three levels of acidity for the <b>fountain</b> <b>solution.</b> To simulate the actual printing condition, the fountain solutions used were those commonly used on press. Three resistance properties including film hardness, abrasion resistance and adhesion resistance were measured in this study for responses relating to end use. The effect of the substrate absorptivity on the curing time was also reviewed. This study indicates that the higher water pickup of the Ultraviolet ink needed longer curing time. There is a significant effect of acidity of <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> on water pickup of the ink. Curing time is considerably affected by the color of the ink or by the transmission properties of the pigment. Cyan acts like a neutral density filter on the printed film. Increased absorptivity of the substrate helps shorten the curing time. Water pickup of the UV inks affects its film hardness. High water pickup decreased film hardness. On the other hand, the effect of water pickup of the ink with regard to abrasion resistance and adhesion resistance is insignificant. Tack as a rheological property of the ink and the curing stages are also reviewed in this study...|$|E

At present there are no good ways for mills to easily test the printing quality on newsprintpaper. There is a great need for a fast {{way to do this}} on different paper qualities; with a laboratory-offset press this can be both a time and money saving method. At PAPRO Forest Research, NewZealand, a laboratory offset press has been developed and designed, during the past seven years, concerningthis issue. Earlier projects were made concerning the press, e. g. to establish the optimal settings. The mission with this project was to partly determine the present variability of the print quality andto evaluate if the <b>fountain</b> <b>solution,</b> distilled water and 2 % Diol green concentrate, used at the momentmixed with different percentages of Isopropanol could decrease the variability and contribute to morestabile results. Throughout the whole project the print quality showed a high variation and was evenmore variable when the Isopropanol was added. All in all 50 print rounds times twelve printed paperstrips was carried out through the project divided into three parts. To analyse the print quality, amicroscope with an image capture camera has been used. Data from the taken images was analysedand inserted into charts to see the variations. The conclusions of the whole project are not satisfying because no final evaluations were possible tomake. Main conclusions are that the additive of Isopropanol to the ordinary <b>fountain</b> <b>solution,</b> used atpresent, only contributed to more unstable results of the print quality. And it seems to be difficult toget some stable results from the lab press as long as the room where it is placed is not fully conditionedas required for the process of offset printing.

The four factors were (1) <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> pH, (2) paper types (coated vs. uncoated), (3) plate-to-blanket pressure, and (4) blanket-to-paper pressure;Overall the results suggested that the main effect of paper was the dominant variable affecting on press dot gain. A stepwise regression analysis revealed that the main effect of paper was so overwhelming that it outweighed the significance of the other effects. Thus, the paper factor was controlled for a second statistical analysis to study the conclusive relationships among the other variables and obtain more accurate estimations for their associated effects. The findings of the second analysis yielded the following recommendations: (1) For prints that require high fidelity and emphasize highlight areas, the process should use coated paper with a combination of lower blanket-to-paper pressures, higher plate-to-blanket pressures, and higher <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> pH values. (2) For prints that require high fidelity and emphasize midtones and shadows, the process should use coated paper with a combination of lower blanket-to-paper pressures, lower plate-to-blanket pressures, and lower <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> pH values.

The film splitting sound derives from the cavitation formed by the pressure drop {{in the second half of}} the print nip flow passage. As the ink film is strained, the cavities expand and eventually implode into breaking filaments at the nip exit, while emitting a partly audible, broadband, high frequency, noisy sound. A free-field microphone, A/D-converter and laptop computer were used to record pressure signals in the frequency range of 10 Hz to 50 kHz emitted by a variety of printing instruments and presses for a range of offset ink and paper types. After signal acquisition and filtering two signal averages of power and frequency were estimated. This average power increased with increasing loads of sheet-fed offset ink on an ink distributor, in accordance with a mass-conservation model developed. The behaviour of average frequency and power over different ink load ranges indicated transitions between different flow regimes. A glossy fine-coated paper gave higher average power than a corresponding matte paper during printing with such inks on a laboratory device, possibly due to an air sealing effect. The sound from tack measurements with the Deltack instrument during setting of heat-set offset inks printed on MWC papers showed a relation between the measured tack rise and average power, reflecting changes in splitting mechanism during the course of setting. With the Hydroscope instrument the interaction between these heat-set inks and <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> was studied, with the measured tack and sound emission displaying a clear, but non-linear, correlation. A heat-set offset pilot trial showed that the acoustic response from the printing nip sensitively and systematically detected changes in (LWC) paper type, optical density, ink-fount balance, and press stability. Pilot trials of cold-set offset inks on newsprint by sheet-fed presses indicated a strong correlation between evolution in average power, optical density and <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> consumption during the first thousand sheets normally needed for stabilisation. Acoustic measurements of ink film splitting have, aside from the laboratory studies performed by one Japanese group, previously received little attention, with the current study showing that a great deal of information useful to the printer can be accessed from this sound emission. Although the detailed mechanisms for ink film splitting have to be further studied and supported by mathematical simulation, the sensitivity of the acoustic method recommends its implementation for monitoring and control of offset printing.

40|$|Lithography is {{the most}} common {{printing}} process. However, very {{little is known about the}} theory of lithography. Pressroom practices have evolved more out of experience than on the basis of any theory. The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model for the non-image area of the offset lithographic plate. A model of this kind would provide a rationalization for the observed behavior in lithographic process. The study concentrates on the various materials and the phenomena involved. Properties of aluminum oxide surface and gum arabic that make them suitable for the process have been presented. Rheological properties of ink have been discussed to show their effect on the print quality. Most importantly the subject of surface energetics has been used to explain the interfacial behavior of the three phases involved - ink, <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> and plate surface. The study of the interfacial behavior helps in arriving at the final model. There are several phenomena taking place in making lithography work. Adsorption of gum arabic, wetting of the plate by <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> and film splitting at the nip exit are explained and the interrelationship between them derived. Surface energetic equations and Griffith 2 ̆ 7 s free energy for fracture have been used to present the final model for the system. The model as proposed in this paper gives a deeper insight into the lithographic process and helps- in understanding the reasons for the printing aberrations. There is a need to model other aspects of the process and design methods to test them so as to help in development of better equipment and standard practices for lithography...|$|E
40|$|Silicic acid is a {{water soluble}} {{colloidal}} resin {{which can be}} obtained commercially. The effect of silicic acid as a desensitizer in <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> was studied. The resin of this colloidal solution was compared to gum arabic solution. The study included {{the investigation of the}} physical properties of the solution at different concentrations as well as press performance. Comparisons were drawn regarding wettability, viscosity, surface tension, dot size change, minimum dampening rate to clean-up the non-image areas, resolution, resistance to scum, blinding of image areas, rate of de-inking over- run non-image areas, performance distinction between lithium silicate and sodium silicate, and changes with aging in solubility properties of silicates in fountain solutions. The experiments were carried out under carefully controlled conditions; the only variable present was one ingredient of the <b>fountain</b> <b>solution.</b> The concentration of the necessary solution was determined. The effect of concentration was discussed and reported. A considerable number of the results were statistically analyzed by the two factor analysis of variance. The effectiveness of silicic acid solution as a substitute for gum arabic solution varied. Silicic acid is comparable in regard to the ability of the solution to clean the plate with minimum number of sheets, resistance to scum, resolution, and blinding of image areas. Performance distinctions between lithium silicate and sodium silicate and solubility properties of silicates with aging were noted. Gum arabic produces smaller changes in dot size and does not blind images as quickly as silicic acid does. The advantages of silicic acid are good resistance to bacterial attack, longer shelf life, and better wetting of the plate than gum arabic when properly diluted...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlcohol free “wet” offset {{technology}} {{is important not}} only for the sake of printers but for a stronger, more profitable business. The optimization of automatic offset printing system for the environmentally friendly dampening components via free alcohol and filtration procedures is a further milestone of the classical offset technology environmental approach. Offset printing, also named “wet” offset, uses dampening solution in order to keep non-printing elements as a hydrophilic on the surface of offset printing plate. So <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> is a part of its process. Generally it is composed by water and around of 8 - 10 % isopropyl alcohol as a surface active agent improved wetting. However, there are inherent issues with this process, such as negative environmental impact, health hazardous, complex press operations and waste water and chemical regulations. Isopropyl alcohol used in water solution in offset printing has negative influence as: part of it vaporizes to form volatile organic compounds that pollute the working environment, also toxic and flammable. Measured by volume IPA is the most significant air pollutant in the offset printing companies. In the common ecology savings conditions there are alternative ways to reduce or even fully IPA-free printing, lowering costs and risks for health and safety the environment. In web offset printing are several possibilities to apply alcohol free dampening solution. In this study for the CSWO (Cold Set Web Offset) printing it was applied fully alcohol free solution with specially developed additive, compatible to individual tap water properties. In addition here was used ceramic filtration system in order to prevent fast contamination and also permit longer intervals between changing the <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> and keeps it clean during the long period. So in this way we achieved having stable printing process without any problems...|$|E

In this paper, the influence of conventional and ecological <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> concentrates was analysed during 31 months, {{as well as the}} influence of dissolved compounds from the paper surface on the corrosion of carbon steel. The rate of corrosion in the observed systems was quantified with gravimetric method, while it was qualified with FT-IR spectroscopic method. Transmission FT-IR spectra were recorded for the starting solutions and corrosion products. It was shown that the compounds from the paper surface, dissolved during the printing have the most significant influence on the course and dynamics of corrosion in the printing systems...|$|E
40|$|Apart from visual control, it is {{possible}} to controll the ink on a print by means of auxilliary instruments - densitometer, colorimeter and spectral photometer. One of the problems in offset printing reproduction is the inconstancy of theink flow and ink consumption during the run printing. This problem appears because of the change of ink viscosity, the change of ink temperature, the change of <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> quantity in ink, the change of printing speed etc. This article shows the measurements of the chromatic values performed by spectral photometer on the control - signal strip {{from the very beginning of}} the run printing till 20000 th print. Gray balance (CMY) by means of CIE L*a*b* system has been investigated. Densitometric values of the solid area, the growth of the screen values and doubling-shear have been determined. The results of the spectrophotometric measurements of gray balance and the densitometric measurements of the solid tint have been analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Complex fluids are {{materials}} that respond to applied stresses {{in a way}} that is intermediate between that of a purely viscous fluid or a fully elastic solid. The characterization of material properties depends upon the ability to both apply variable stresses or strains to the complex fluid and to measure the resulting response. Often the macroscopic response of these materials depends upon the microscale structure. In this dissertation, confocal laser scanning microscopy is used to analyze microscopic changes in complex fluids. We developed methods to apply the stress or strain that matches the application or environment of the material to be characterized. For instance, confocal images of the emulsion structure of <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> in ink exposed to oscillatory shear flow on model substrates were acquired. We found that surfactants inhibit aqueous droplet wetting on hydrophobic substrates. Without surfactants, surface coverage of the aqueous <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> on the hydrophobic substrate became quite high. This result is relevant to defects in lithographic printing. To characterize the material properties of biofilms a tunable small-scale device was needed. We developed a flexible microfluidic rheometer to apply a compressive force of ~ 200 pL volume. We used confocal microscopy to detect the deformation of a membrane in contact with a test material when compressive stresses were applied. This measurement allowed us to characterize material properties including elastic modulus and relaxation time of soft viscoelastic solids, biofilms in particular. We report evidence of strain hardening in biofilms; a result that could have implications for the understanding of clearance of biofilms in industrial and physiological environments. To understand the source of this phenomenon we applied confocal microscopy to characterize the structure of bacteria aggregated in a polysaccharide matrix. Interestingly, while aggregated bacteria and bacteria in biofilms are held together by ostensibly the same material we find their inter-bacterial distance to be quite different. Once this tool was developed the origin of strain-hardening in biofilms could be addressed. The strain-induced trajectories of individual bacteria found using image processing of confocal micrographs were analyzed to show that strain hardening occurs without an increase in volume fraction...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of Surland 2 ̆ 7 s Emulsification Method, and is {{intended}} to demonstrate the effect of change in emulsification rate curve with different types of <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> whose surface tension was varied. The surface tension of a <b>fountain</b> <b>solution</b> can be changed {{by the addition of}} isopropyl alcohol. Two inks were modified to produce the same tack reading but a different emulsification capacity. Using the Surland method the two inks and two fountain solutions generate four different emulsification rate curves and these four curves are tested for their effect on printed quality. The printing performance of an ink is judged by the ease with which an ink can obtain ink-water balance as well as the degree of freedom from printing problems such as 2 ̆ 2 catching up 2 ̆ 2 and plate scumming. The printed sheets are sampled and the data is analyzed statistically using solid ink density and dot gain as response variables. The RIT Symmetrical Scale was included in the printing form design to facilitate solid ink density measurement and dot gain calculation. Solid ink density and dot gain variations are calculated within each printing run. The addition of isopropul alcohol to a dampening solution not only reduces its surface tension and increase its wettability but it also suppresses an ink 2 ̆ 7 s continuous emulsification tendency. Ink and water balance is easily controlled when a printing ink is able to reach a state of equilibrim with dampening solution. On the basis of observation during the on press printing run it was found that a high percentage of isopropyl alcohol in a dampening solution can dissolve the blue toner from the black ink and requires an increase of ink feed to obtain the desired optical density. This study indicates the tendency of plate 2 ̆ 2 catching up 2 ̆ 2 can be associated with emulsification rate curves. The Pb type of emulsification rate curve can be so modified that press run will encounter fewer problems. Density variation within a press run is then more easily controlled...|$|E
