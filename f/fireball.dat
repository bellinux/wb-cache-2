40|$|<b>Fireballs</b> are {{discharge}} phenomena on positively biased small electrodes in plasmas. The discharge {{arises from}} electron energization at a double layer. <b>Fireballs</b> can collect relatively large electron currents from the ambient plasma. <b>Fireballs</b> can become unstable to relaxation oscillations. This paper addresses the space–time evolution of pulsed <b>fireballs.</b> Growth and collapse of <b>fireballs</b> produce large density and potential variations near the electrode which couple {{into the background}} plasma production. Unstable <b>fireballs</b> emit bursts of fast ions and ion acoustic waves. High-frequency emissions near the electron plasma frequency have been observed and associated with the sheath–plasma instability rather than electron beam–plasma interactions. New shapes of <b>fireballs</b> have been observed in dipole magnetic fields. (Some figures {{in this article are}} in colour only in the electronic version) 1...|$|R

5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish <b>fireball</b> is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight <b>Fireball</b> above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 <b>fireball</b> was more than a thousand times as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating the trajectory of another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E

5|$|Because the <b>fireball</b> was {{recorded}} by two cameras of the European <b>Fireball</b> Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E

5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed {{fragments of}} Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere {{at a speed}} of approximately 60kilometres per second.

While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a <b>fireball</b> that reached a peak temperature of about 24,000K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the <b>fireball</b> reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Challenge (known as Dueling Dragons from 1999 to 2010) {{was a pair}} of intertwined, {{inverted}} {{roller coasters}} in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter area of Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, United States. The ride was themed to two chasing dragons, one side being Chinese <b>Fireball</b> and the other Hungarian Horntail. It featured a layout in which the two trains shared adjacent lift hills but traversed two unique courses. The ride was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard of Switzerland. The Chinese <b>Fireball</b> dragon reached a top speed of 60mph, and the Hungarian Horntail dragon reached a top speed of 55mph. Both versions featured five inversions and a total ride time of two minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the growing debate over Zeus' abilities, the US {{conducted}} its first high yield, high altitude tests – Hardtack Teak on 1 August 1958, and Hardtack Orange on 12 August. These demonstrated a number of previously unknown or underestimated effects, notably that nuclear fireballs grew to very large size and caused all of the air in or immediately below the <b>fireball</b> to become opaque to radar signals, an effect that became known as nuclear blackout. This was extremely worrying for any system like Zeus, which {{would not be able to}} track warheads in or behind such a <b>fireball,</b> including those of the Zeus' own warheads.|$|E

5000|$|LaPaz's {{last known}} {{comments}} on the green <b>fireballs</b> occurred in 1965 during a visit by astronomer Dr. J. Allen Hynek, {{a consultant to the}} Air Force's Project Blue Book. Hynek was also investigating the Socorro incident. According to Hynek, LaPaz felt the <b>fireballs</b> were {{the most important part of}} the UFO phenomenon. He remained convinced that the fireballs' anomalous characteristics had never been adequately explained by the official investigation. LaPaz continued to think the green <b>fireballs</b> were artificial, but now believed the <b>fireballs,</b> and also the Socorro craft, to be highly secret projects of the U.S. government. He also accused Hynek, Project Blue Book, and others of being part of [...] "a grand cover-up for something the government does not want discussed".|$|R
5|$|The {{meteoroid}} was a typeI <b>fireball,</b> i.e. {{an ordinary}} chondrite. When it entered Earth's atmosphere its mass was about 44kg, which was estimated {{on the basis}} of the measured values of its absolute magnitude and velocity. It lost approximately 350g during the encounter. Computer simulations showed that it started losing mass approximately at the moment it became visible to the cameras of the European <b>Fireball</b> Network, at a height of 100.6km. It lost mass for 25 seconds, until it reached a height of 215.7km. Its surface melted and solidified again after leaving, which means its surface became a typical meteoritic fusion crust.|$|E
5|$|The {{software}} also {{calculated the}} fireball's instantaneous apparent magnitude at the ground. The computation started {{and ended with}} heights of approximately 250km, long {{before and after the}} cameras of the European <b>Fireball</b> Network could observe it. Its apparent magnitude started at a value of +5.7 and it became brighter quite quickly. The program gave an apparent magnitude of −5.7 when it was seen by one camera and −6.3 at perigee. The <b>fireball</b> subsequently dimmed, with an apparent magnitude of −5.4 when it was last seen by the cameras and a final calculated value of +6.0 at a height of 257km. These values are not entirely certain, because the program worked with the simplified assumption that the luminous efficacy of the <b>fireball</b> did not change along the track. The starting apparent magnitude is not far from the naked eye visibility limits. For example, faint stars of the magnitude +6 can be observed only in dark rural areas approximately 150km away from large cities. This magnitude corresponds to the apparent magnitude of Uranus. At its brightest, it was several times as bright as the maximum brightness of Venus.|$|E
5|$|The Červená hora {{image was}} {{especially}} valuable. It recorded the fireball's trajectory over approximately 110°, starting 51° above the southern horizon, passing the zenith just 1° westward and disappearing only 19° above the northern horizon (thus crossing about 60% of the sky). Its camera was also {{equipped with a}} rotating shutter that interrupted the exposure 12.5 times per second and divided the captured track of the <b>fireball,</b> allowing the determination of its speed. Over the last 4°, the fireball's angular velocity was lower than {{the resolution of the}} instrument. The Svratouch image recorded the trajectory only for about 15°, beginning at 30° above the northwest horizon, and the pictured <b>fireball</b> was quite weak. Despite this, the data were sufficient for the calculations.|$|E

Jerry (Jim O'Heir) is sent to get propane for the flame but buys lighter fluid instead; this causes a huge <b>fireball</b> to shoot into the air when Ron lights it, which singes off his eyebrows, part of his mustache and hair.
