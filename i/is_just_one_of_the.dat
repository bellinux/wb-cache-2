Patriarchy <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hierarchies. Relational hierarchies between women within the same family are more adverse. Here women are pitted against one another.

25|$|Delhi {{was once}} {{the capital of the}} Mughal empire, and it became the birthplace of Mughlai cuisine. Delhi is noted for its street food. The Paranthewali Gali in Chandani Chowk <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> culinary {{landmarks}} for stuffed flatbread (paranthas). Delhi has people from different parts of India, thus the city has different types of food traditions; its cuisine is influenced by the various cultures. Punjabi cuisine is common, due to the dominance of Punjabi communities. Delhi cuisine is actually an amalgam of different Indian cuisines modified in unique ways. This is apparent in the different types of street food available. Kababs, kachauri, chaat, Indian sweets, Indian ice cream (commonly called kulfi), and even western food items like sandwiches and patties, are prepared in a style unique to Delhi and are quite popular.|$|E

25|$|Sternberg & Lubart’s Investment Theory. Using {{the metaphor}} of a stock market, they {{demonstrate}} that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> six factors that can either solely, or {{in conjunction with the}} other five factors, generate creative thoughts.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} WM was launched alongside the VE Commodore on 16 July 2006 at the Melbourne Exhibition and Convention Centre. With the Statesman's export plans, {{it was decided}} that its launch should be simultaneous with that of the Commodore, rather than months later, as had been the convention. The WM development programme reportedly cost General Motors A$190million with another $1.04billion devoted to the VE Commodore model which the Statesman is based upon. The WM series utilises the GM Zeta platform developed by Holden. Unlike previous models, the WM no longer shares its architecture with an Opel sedan, and has rear doors different from those found on the Commodore. Previously, it had to share the doors, or at least the lower parts, with the lesser Commodore. This <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ways Holden has tried to create greater differentiation between the Statesman and the Commodore on which it is based.|$|E

[...] Billboard critic Timothy White called it [...] "bittersweet serenade." [...] J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun called the song [...] "the album's {{greatest}} surprise". He explained, [...] "this David Foster song is quite demanding vocally, requiring a wider range and more power than anything else on the album. Yet Madonna more than lives up to the challenge, showing enough power and polish to make even Madonna-phobes admit she can sing. Louis Virtel from music website Idolator wrote, [...] "No other Madonna song sounds quite like it, and it holds up as a melancholic statement against grander compositions like 'You'll See' and 'I'll Remember'." ...|$|E

A nod to Taiwanese animation <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highlights in this homage to 24-style mayhem." [...] Similarly, Umika Pidaparthy of CNN's The Marquee Blog commented that [...] "there were a lot of light laughs in this episode, like when Wayne walks through the Ukrainian part of Springfield (Tsarbucks, anyone?). Pop culture references like the Taiwanese animation of the robbery were hilarious. I was disappointed, though, to see that Marge's daydream about being on Top Chef didn't become a side story." [...] Mike Hughes of the Lansing State Journal commented that the episode was [...] "inconsistent, but [...] great moments", and that it was [...] "much better than Fox's other season-openers" [...] that premiered on the same day.|$|E

[...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions of civility and ethical choice. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third." [...] She deemed The Other Hand essentially a novel about [...] "the borders we draw, and the real damage they inflict".|$|E
500|$|Paramount Pictures {{dropped its}} {{original}} {{protest against the}} film after their director Ivan Reitman, re-titled his film No Strings Attached. Screen Gems then moved forward with the title Friends with Benefits. At the same time, NBC was developing a sitcom with the same title, but the movie production company stated that due to its production schedule, they didn’t expect an issue to arise. Screen Gems chose to accelerate production fearing that they would lose their title to the competing Paramount project. Director Will Gluck spoke about the frustration of comparing the two films, stating: [...] "I wish there was more space between them. The thing that's irking me now is people are saying we're remaking No Strings Attached. We're not remaking it. The two movies were being made at the same time." [...] Gluck, {{in an interview with}} The New Zealand Herald, said that both films are different. Similar sentiments were expressed by Kunis, stating, [...] "It's just two different movies.

[...] Billboards Keith Caulfield opined that the track [...] "showcased Madonna's newly-trained vocal abilities, which would prepare audiences for her lead role in the following year's Evita". AllMusic's Jose F. Promis described the song as [...] "an empowered, somewhat melodramatic, Latin-tinged ballad that helped to even further cement Madonna as a constant on adult contemporary radio, which, in turn, further distanced her from her raunchier days earlier in the decade". Promis also praised the Spanish version [...] "Verás"; [...] " [...] sings the Spanish lyrics surprisingly well". Billboard critic Timothy White called it a [...] "bittersweet serenade."
