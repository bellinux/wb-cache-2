40|$|Performance-based {{earthquake}} engineering (PBEE) is a methodology that incorporates desired performance levels {{into the design}} process. Performance in PBEE can be economic (e. g., <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>losses),</b> or {{expressed in terms of}} operability and safety performance (e. g., expected downtime due to safety tagging and/or repair). These performance objectives are relevant to various types of stakeholders and should be addressed in building loss estimation procedures. In this study, we consider the structural and economic performance of a codeconforming office building. An analytical approach for PBEE is implemented to evaluate the performance of this reinforced-concrete moment-frame building. The PBEE approach used is consistent with the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) center’s framework, which is divided into four core analytical stages: hazard analysis, structural analysis, damage analysis, and loss analysis. Future losses of the building are uncertain because they depend on uncertain quantities, such as the shaking intensity of the earthquake, the mechanical properties of the facility, and the uncertain damageability and unit repair costs of the facility. An analytical approach is developed to propagate these uncertainties. This paper presents the mathematical foundation for the damage and loss analyses, and a description of its implementation into software. The results from running this software on multiple design variants of the building are presented, including seismic vulnerabilities as a function of shaking intensity and corresponding <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R

Using Australia as a case study, the analysis compares expected disaster losses and government capacity to finance losses.

Unusually but critically, the dataset includes direct as well as indirect losses, allowing for the analysis to consider the oft-ignored issue of indirect <b>losses.</b> <b>Expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>losses</b> (direct, and direct plus indirect) are overlaid with a risk-layer approach, to distinguish low, medium and extreme loss events.

When indirect losses are also estimated, we find that even medium loss levels are expected to overwhelm available fiscal resources, thereby violating the available resources assumption underlying arguments for {{sovereign risk}} neutrality. Our analysis provides empirical support for the assertion that indirect losses are a major, under-recognised concern for industrialized countries.

Only few studies have assessed in detail the potential range of losses in the future and the factors contributing to the projected increase. Here we estimate future potential damage from river flooding, and analyse the relative role of land-use, asset value increase and climate change on these losses, for a case study area in The Netherlands. Projections of future socioeconomic change (land-use change and increase in the value of assets) are used in combination with flood scenarios, projections of flooding probabilities, and a simple damage model. It is found that due to socioeconomic change, <b>annual</b> <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> may increase by between 35 and 172 % by the year 2040, compared to the baseline situation in the year 2000. If no additional measures are taken to reduce flood probabilities or consequences, climate change may lead to an increase in expected losses of between 46 and 201 %. A combination of climate and socioeconomic change may increase expected losses by between 96 and 719 %. Asset value increase has a large role, as it may lead to a doubling of losses. The use of single loss estimates may lead to underestimation of the impact of extremely high losses. We therefore also present loss-probability curves for future risks, in order to assess the increase of the most extreme potential loss events. Our approach thus allows a more detailed and comprehensive assessment than previous studies that could also be applied in other study areas to generate flood risk projections.

40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: <b>Expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>loss</b> (EAL), {{which can}} be {{expressed}} in dollars, is an effective way of communicating the seismic vulnerability of constructed facilities to owners and decision makers. A concise method for computing EAL without the inherent bias of requiring a specific analytical probability distribution is presented. The relationships between intensity measures and engineering demand parameters resulting from an Incremental Dynamic Analysis are sorted into fractal intervals by way of spectral reordering and modified to incorporate additional sources of uncertainty and randomness. Damage measures are defined to determine thresholds for damage states. Damage is quantified by loss ratios defined as repair cost divided by replacement cost. The results are numerically integrated to give EAL. An example illustrating the method is performed, comparing the seismic vulnerability of two highway bridge piers; one pier traditionally designed for ductility, and the other designed for damage avoidance. The damage avoidance pier has a clear advantage over the conventional pier, with an EAL some 85 % less than its ductile counterpart. This is shown to be primarily due to its inherent damage-free behaviour for almost all ground motions, except for very rare events that could potentially lead to toppling. ...|$|E

In particular, potential problems in determining an adequate yet efficient region of integration are discussed. An algorithm called “Magnitude-oriented Adaptive Quadrature ” (MAQ) is developed, which is an integration algorithm with both locally and globally adaptive capabilities. MAQ allows efficient integration over the entire integration domain and requires only an error tolerance and maximum number of function evaluations to be specified. The advantages of utilizing the MAQ algorithm over other conventional integration methods such as Romberg integration and conventional adaptive quadrature are illustrated for the numerical computation of (1) expected annual loss; and (2) annual rate of collapse. It is shown that for determination of the <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>loss</b> a 4. 5 - to 8. 8 - fold reduction in the computational demand is obtained using MAQ compared to conventional integration methods. For annual rate of collapse the computational demand reductions range from 30 % to two-fold. The computational reductions are a function of the error tolerance prescribed, with greater computational reductions as stricter tolerances are enforced. ...|$|E

Uncertainty in global mean and regional sea level was derived from four different climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5, each combined with three land-ice scenarios based on the published range of contributions from ice sheets and glaciers. Without adaptation, 0. 2 - 4. 6 % of global population is expected to be flooded annually in 2100 under 25 - 123 cm of global mean sea-level rise, with <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>losses</b> of 0. 3 - 9. 3 % of global gross domestic product. Damages of this magnitude are very unlikely to be tolerated by society and adaptation will be widespread. The global costs of protecting the coast with dikes are significant with annual investment and maintenance costs of US 12 - 71 billion in 2100, but much smaller than the global cost of avoided damages even without accounting for indirect costs of damage to regional production supply. Flood damages {{by the end of this}} century are much more sensitive to the applied protection strategy than to variations in climate and socioeconomic scenarios as well as in physical data sources (topography and climate model).

40|$|Large {{earthquakes}} near {{densely populated}} {{areas such as}} the 1994 Northridge and 1995 Kobe events have caused extensive damage to the physical infrastructure and losses to the regional and national economies. Economic losses are due in part to direct damage and in part to business interruption caused by non- functioning infrastructure and interdependencies among industrial sectors. We developed a regional earthquake loss methodology that emphasizes economic interdependencies at regional and national scales and the mediating role of the transportation network. In an application to the Central U. S. under threat from earthquakes from the New Madrid Seismic Zone, we (1) evaluate regional and national losses from scenario earthquakes, (2) quantify uncertainty on the losses through loss risk curves including contributions from seismicity, attenuation, fragilities, etc. and (3) assess the effectiveness of alternative mitigation strategies. The loss assessment methodology includes spatial interactions (through the transportation network) and business interaction (through an input-output model) and extends geographically to the entire conterminous U. S. The losses reflect damage to buildings and transportation components, reduced functionality, changes in the level of economic activity in different economic sectors and geographical regions, and the speed of the reconstruction/recovery process. Evaluation of losses for a number of scenario earthquakes indicates that losses from business interruption may be as significant as infrastructure repair costs. The overall loss is also contributed by the increase in transportation costs due to network damage. (cont.) As part of the uncertainty evaluation, we assess the sensitivity of earthquake losses to various component models and model parameters. Using a detailed model of regional seismicity, scenario earthquake building losses, and a relation between business losses and building losses, we develop risk curves for building losses, business losses, and total economic losses. The results underline the importance of considering uncertainty in risk assessment. Finally, we investigate the effectiveness of alternative loss mitigation strategies such as retrofitting of buildings or bridges and faster recovery of functionality for various occupancy classes or bridges. For a number of cases, we develop loss risk curves for mitigated conditions and calculate <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>losses,</b> which might be used for rational decision making e. g. through cost-benefit comparison. by Erdem Karaca.

40|$|Engineered {{facilities}} are deemed safe {{if they have}} little or no probability of incurring damage when subjected to regular actions or natural hazards. Any probability of the performance of any designed system (i. e. capacity) not being able to meet the performance required of it (i. e. demand) results in risk, which might be expressed either as a likelihood of damage or potential financial loss. Engineers are used to dealing with the former (i. e. damage), which gives a fair indication of repair/strengthening work needed to bring the system back to full functionality. Nevertheless, other non-technical stakeholders (such as owners, insurers, decision-makers) of the designed facilities cannot read too much from damage. Hence, risk, if interpreted in terms of damage only, will not be comprehended by all stakeholders. On the other hand, financial risk expressed in terms of probable dollar loss in easily understood by all. Therefore, there is an impetus on developing methodologies which correlate the system capacity and demand to financial risk.

A simplified method for estimating EAL without conducting time consuming non-linear dynamic analyses is presented. Relationships between intensity measures and engineering demand parameters resulting from a pushover analysis and a modified capacity-spectrum method are combined with epistemic and aleatory uncertainties {{to arrive at a}} probabilistic demand model. Damage measures are established to determine thresholds for damage states from which loss ratios can be defined. Financial implications due to damage can then be quantified in the form of EAL by integrating total losses for all likely earthquake scenarios. This rapid loss estimation method is verified through the computationally intensive Incremental Dynamic Analysis, with results processed using a distribution-free methodology. To illustrate the application of the proposed method, the seismic vulnerability of two highway bridge piers is compared; one bridge is traditionally designed for ductility while the other is based on an emerging damage avoidance design (DAD) philosophy. The DAD pier is found to have a clear advantage over the conventional pier; the EAL of the DAD pier is less than 20 percent of its ductile counterpart. This is shown to be primarily due to its inherent damage-free behaviour for small to medium earthquake intensities, whose contribution to EAL is significantly more than that of very rare events...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a new {{methodology}} for the seismic risk assessment of masonry buildings is presented. It {{is based on}} a probabilistic approach, which makes it possible to determine seismic risk using various performance measures such as the probability of exceeding a certain damage state, the probability of exceeding a certain economic loss, the <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>loss,</b> and the loss dependent on a given seismic intensity. Using these performance measures engineers and project stakeholders can make informed decisions as to whether particular existing buildings should be repaired, strengthened, or replaced, or simply choose the best variant in the design of a new building. The methodology consists of four main steps: hazard analysis, structural analysis, damage analysis and loss analysis. The results from these four separate analyses are combined together in a probabilistic manner, using the total probability theorem, thus making it possible to explicitly take into account numerous uncertainties. However, in this study the main focus was on the modelling uncertainties, and on the aleatoric uncertainties which are due to record-to-record variability. A database of experimental data obtained in the testing of numerous masonry specimens was established, and analysed in order to define fragility functions for masonry elements failing in shear or flexure, while also evaluating the uncertainties in the limit-state deformations of the masonry walls. The possibility of reducing the impact of uncertain input parameters by means of non-destructive tests was also explored. By measuring its ambient and forced vibrations, the vibration periods of an old masonry building in Ljubljana were determined, and used to calibrate corresponding structural models. It was shown that such non-destructive experimental investigations can contribute to more reliable seismic performance assessments of buildings, even when the performance assessment procedure {{is based on a}} nonlinear method of analysis. In addition to the explicit consideration of uncertainties, damage to the components of buildings was also explicitly simulated {{on the basis of the}} relationship between the seismic intensity and the engineering demand parameters which were obtained by simplified nonlinear analysis. The latter consisted of pushover analysis, together with incremental dynamic analysis of a SDOF model. The applicability of the proposed methodology was demonstrated by means of examples of a residential and a commercial building, which were constructed from hollow clay bricks or solid bricks. Under the presumptions of this study, the <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>loss</b> for buildings constructed with hollow clay bricks was 60 €/ 100 m 2 of the gross floor area, and 125 €/ 100 m 2 in the case of buildings which were made from older material consisting of solid bricks. Disaggregation of the results showed that weaker earthquakes with lower intensities contribute significantly towards the expected annual losses. It was also found that nonstructural elements, which are key components in the loss assessment model, can contribute more than 50 % of the total loss. The modelling uncertainties have a large impact on the results of the pushover analysis and of those obtained by incremental dynamic analysis, as well as on the probability of exceeding damage states. However their impact on loss estimates is more pronounced in the case of the fragility and loss functions, seismic hazard, and the costs of replacing the building...|$|E
40|$|A seismic {{financial}} risk analysis of typical New Zealand reinforced concrete buildings constructed with topped precast concrete hollow-core units is {{performed on the}} basis of experimental research undertaken at the University of Canterbury over the last five years. An extensive study that examines seismic demands on a variety of multi-storey RC buildings is described and supplemented by the experimental results to determine the inter-storey drift capacities of the buildings. Results of a full-scale precast concrete super-assemblage constructed and tested in the laboratory in two stages are used. The first stage investigates existing construction and demonstrates major shortcomings in construction practice that would lead to very poor seismic performance. The second stage examines the performance of the details provided by Amendment No. 3 to the New Zealand Concrete Design Code NZS 3101 : 1995. This paper uses a probabilistic {{financial risk}} assessment framework to estimate the <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> <b>loss</b> (EAL) from previously developed fragility curves of RC buildings with precast hollow core floors connected to the frames according to the pre- 2004 standard and the two connection details recommended in the 2004 amendment. Risks posed by different levels of damage and by earthquakes of different frequencies are examined. The structural performance and financial implications of the three different connection details are compared. The study shows that the improved connection details recommended in the 2004 amendment give a significant economic payback in terms of drastically reduced financial risk, which is also representative of smaller maintenance cost and cheaper insurance premiums...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Agricultural water {{supplies}} {{are becoming increasingly}} uncertain in the western United States due to rising demand from competing water users, environmental restrictions on surface water withdrawals due to water quality and endangered species concerns, and, potentially, climate-induced hydrological changes. Since many rural areas in the West depend economically upon irrigated agriculture, increased water supply variability may not only affect the agricultural sector, but may also have significant regional economic impacts. This study investigates the distribution and magnitude of farm and community level economic impacts of water supply fluctuations through {{a case study of}} an irrigation district located in an agriculturally-dependent county in southeastern Oregon. In addition to estimating the value of irrigation water, this study examines the effectiveness of three strategies to mitigate the economic consequences of fluctuating {{water supplies}}: 1. increased accuracy of water supply forecasts, 2. additional irrigation technology adoption, and 3. implementation of a water market or water bank. Two models were utilized to estimate the economic impacts. First, a linear programming model written in the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) was used to estimate the profit and revenue effects of four water supply scenarios on six representative farm types. Second, results from the linear program were used to conduct a regional impact analysis in an input-output model to ascertain how the farm revenue effects impact community-level employment and income. Results indicate that <b>expected</b> <b>annual</b> revenue <b>losses</b> due to water shortages under current conditions range from 4 to 14...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{interactions}} between natural and anthropogenic risks is necessary for quantitative risk assessment in areas affected by active natural processes, high population density and strong economic activities. We present a multiple quantitative risk assessment on a 420 km 2 high risk area (Brescia and surroundings, Lombardy, Northern Italy), for flood, seismic and industrial accident scenarios. <b>Expected</b> economic <b>annual</b> <b>losses</b> are quantified for each scenario and annual exceedance probability-loss curves are calculated. Uncertainty on the input variables is propagated by means of three different methodologies: Monte-Carlo-Simulation, First Order Second Moment, and point estimate. Expected losses calculated {{by means of the}} three approaches show similar values for the whole study area, about 64 000 000 &euro; for earthquakes, about 10 000 000 &euro; for floods, and about 3000 &euro; for industrial accidents. Locally, expected losses assume quite different values if calculated with the three different approaches, with differences up to 19 %. The uncertainties on the expected losses and their propagation, performed with the three methods, are compared and discussed in the paper. In some cases, uncertainty reaches significant values (up to almost 50 % of the expected loss). This underlines the necessity of including uncertainty in quantitative risk assessment, especially when it is used as a support for territorial planning and decision making. The method is developed thinking at a possible application at a regional-national scale, on the basis of data available in Italy over the national territory...|$|R
