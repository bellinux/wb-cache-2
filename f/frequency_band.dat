5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower energy state that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow <b>frequency</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
5|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High <b>Frequency)</b> <b>band</b> (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.|$|E

40|$|Bidirectional {{wireless}} communication is advantageously achieved by using {{at least two}} <b>frequency</b> <b>bands,</b> wherein during a first time period a first one of the <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> is used for signal transmission (e. g., downlink) while a second one of the <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> is used for signal reception (e. g., uplink), and during a second time period (subsequent to the first time period) the first one of the <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> is used for signal reception (e. g., uplink) while the second one of the <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> is used for signal transmission (e. g., downlink). By alternating {{the use of the}} two <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> repeatedly between signal transmission and signal reception throughout the communication, overall communication efficiency is improved and latency times considerably reduced, particularly when implemented in a system having multiple antennas (i. e., antenna arrays) and employing coherent beam forming and antenna diversity...|$|R

Zopiclone is less selective to the α1 site and has higher affinity to the α2 site than zaleplon. Zopiclone is therefore very similar pharmacologically to benzodiazepines.|$|E

30|$|To {{cater to}} the {{exponentially}} increasing traffic volume requirements in public mobile network, higher <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> with wider spectrum are exploited to further extend the capacity of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) network. Unfortunately, compared with lower <b>frequency</b> <b>bands,</b> higher <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> suffer from severer propagation loss which seriously limits the coverage. Hence, cells working at higher <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> are called small cells. On the account of mobility performance, small cells are usually overlaid on the coverage of macro cells that use lower <b>frequency</b> <b>bands,</b> which forms heterogeneous network. However, as deployment gets increasingly dense, the huge redundant control signaling interaction caused by frequent handovers between small and macro cells reduces the efficiency of heterogeneous networks. In order to mitigate this situation, C/U-plane decoupled architecture is proposed for upcoming 5 G wireless communication network [1, 2]. In this architecture, the relatively important C-plane is extended and kept at lower <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> of macro cells. In addition, the main capacity demander U-plane is moved to the small cells using available higher <b>frequency</b> <b>bands</b> with wider spectrum. With considerable coverage of macro cells, much fewer handovers happen to the C-plane compared to conventional coupled architecture of heterogeneous networks. Therefore, under a macro cell, the handover process is just simplified to the U-plane handover, which saves lots of control signaling interaction.|$|R
