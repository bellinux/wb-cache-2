5|$|A {{significant}} and growing {{proportion of the}} collection is now made available to readers as surrogate facsimiles, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> microfilm, or, more recently, in digitised form. In 2010 a ten-year programme of digitisation of the newspaper archives with commercial partner DC Thomson subsidiary Brightsolid began, and the British Newspaper Archive was launched in November 2011. A dedicated newspaper reading room opened at St Pancras in April 2014, including facilities for consulting microfilmed and digital materials, and, where no surrogate exists, hard-copy material retrieved from Boston Spa.|$|E
5|$|Although {{civilian}} evacuations {{had begun}} in January for the Gulf Coast and San Antonio de Béxar, the Texian military was <b>either</b> <b>on</b> the offensive or standing firm until the smaller Gulf Coast skirmishes happened in February. Houston was now facing a choice of whether to retreat to {{a safe place to}} train his new army, or to meet the enemy head-on immediately. He was wary of trying to defend a fixed position – the debacle at the Alamo had shown that the new Texian government was unable to provide sufficient provisions or reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Among other decorations {{for their}} valour, eight cavalrymen were awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for bravery {{in the face}} of the enemy. Three of the awards came in the first month of the war.

Bedsitcom's eight episodes were 'stripped' over two weeks: the first four were broadcast nightly until 11 December and the remaining four were shown each night from 15 December.

5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based <b>either</b> <b>on</b> prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E
5|$|Head pain {{occurs in}} 50–75% {{of all cases}} of {{vertebral}} artery dissection. It tends to be located {{at the back of}} the head, <b>either</b> <b>on</b> the affected side or in the middle, and develops gradually. It is either dull or pressure-like in character or throbbing. About half of those with VAD consider the headache distinct, while the remainder have had a similar headache before. It is suspected that VAD with headache as the only symptom is fairly common; 8% of all cases of vertebral and carotid dissection are diagnosed on the basis of pain alone.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that some behaviours might be homologous, based <b>either</b> <b>on</b> sharing across related taxa or on common origins of the behaviour in an individual's development, though this remains controversial. For example, D. W. Rajecki and Randall C. Flanery, using data on humans and on nonhuman primates, argue that patterns of behaviour in dominance hierarchies are homologous across the primates.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{classification}} of endometrial carcinomas is based <b>either</b> <b>on</b> clinical and endocrine features (Type I and Type II), or histopathological characteristics (endometroid, serous, and clear-cell).
