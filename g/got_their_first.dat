5|$|The team <b>got</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> win of the season, {{in their}} first stage race, at the Étoile de Bessèges.

Later in February, Moncoutié won the queen stage of the Tour Méditerranéen, finishing at Mont Faron. He had previously won stages there in 2003 and 2009, but his win this year was enough to win him the race overall thanks to his time gap. The squad also won the teams classification. Dumoulin took another win later in February, in the first stage of the two-day Tour du Haut Var. He stayed latched onto Rinaldo Nocentini's wheel during the stage's final climb, and came around him in the sprint.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United brought Giggs on at {{the start}} of extra time, the Welshman taking Fletcher's place in the midfield. They {{immediately}} tried to play him in down the left wing, but the pass was over-hit and went beyond Giggs. Arsenal finally <b>got</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> shot on target in the seventh minute of extra time, when a Van Persie free kick – awarded for a foul by Silvestre – forced a diving save from Carroll. Four minutes later, Manchester United appealed for a penalty kick when a cross from Giggs struck Cole, but replays showed that the ball hit the Arsenal full-back in the midriff. United sustained their attack, and the ball came to Scholes in the penalty area, but his shot on the turn was well saved by Lehmann. The resultant corner was taken short by Scholes, before it was played back to him; his cross found Van Nistelrooy unmarked in the area, but the Dutchman headed over the bar {{from the edge of the}} goal area. United then had another penalty shout when Giggs volleyed a long ball from Scholes into Touré's body and up onto the Ivorian's hand, but referee Rob Styles turned their claims down. Arsenal then brought on Edu to replace Pirès for the remaining 15 minutes.|$|E

While Jeff and Nitro continued battling over the Intercontinental Championship on Raw, Matt and Mercury feuded on SmackDown!.
