40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{subgraph}} counting problem in data streams. We provide the first non-trivial estimator for approximately counting {{the number of}} occurrences of an arbitrary subgraph H of constant size in a (large) graph G. Our estimator works in the turnstile model, <b>i.</b> e., <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> both edge-insertions and edge-deletions, and is applicable in a distributed setting. Prior to this work, only for a few non-regular graphs estimators were known in case of edge-insertions, leaving the problem of counting general subgraphs in the turnstile model wide open (cf. [13, Problem 11]). We further demonstrate the applicability of our estimator by analyzing its concentration for several graphs H and the case where G is a power law graph. ...|$|R

The new method {{is an extension}} of the progressive interpolation technique for B-splines.

It can be shown that the iterative process is convergent for Loop subdivision surfaces. Hence, the method is well-defined.

This {{can be achieved}} by the generality of the proposed scale and move transformations. The method works by first constructing a new inference rule via manipulating two given adjacent rules, and then by using scale and move transformations to convert the intermediate inference results into the final derived conclusions. This generalised method has two advantages thanks to the elegantly proposed transformations: <b>I)</b> It <b>can</b> easily <b>handle</b> interpolation of multiple antecedent variables with simple computation; and 2) It guarantees the uniqueness as well as normality and convexity of the resulting interpolated fuzzy sets.

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for both gradient descent image and object alignment in the Fourier domain. Our method centers upon the classical Lucas & Kanade (LK) algorithm where we represent the source and template/model in the complex 2 D Fourier domain rather than in the spatial 2 D domain. We refer to our approach as the Fourier LK (FLK) algorithm. The FLK formulation is advantageous when one pre-processes the source image and template/model with a bank of filters (e. g. oriented edges, Gabor, etc.) as: (<b>i)</b> it <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> substantial illumination variations, (ii) the inefficient pre-processing filter bank step can be subsumed within the FLK algorithm as a sparse diagonal weighting matrix, (iii) unlike traditional LK the computational cost is invariant to the number of filters and as a result far more efficient, and (iv) this approach can be extended to the inverse compositional form of the LK algorithm where nearly all steps (including Fourier transform and filter bank pre-processing) can be pre-computed leading to an extremely efficient and robust approach to gradient descent image matching. Further, these computational savings translate to non-rigid object alignment tasks that are considered extensions of the LK algorithm such as those found in Active Appearance Models (AAMs) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{pinwheel}} is a hard-real-time {{scheduling problem}} for scheduling satellite ground stations to service {{a number of}} satellites without data loss. Given a multiset of positive integers (instance) A = {a 1, [...] . an}, the problem is to find an infinite sequence (schedule) of symbols from { 1, 2, [...] . n} such that {{there is at least}} one symbol i within any interval of ai symbols (slots). Not all instances A can be scheduled; for example, no 'successful' schedule exists for instances whose density is larger than 1. It has been shown that any instance whose density is less than 2 / 3 can always be scheduled. Two new schedulers are proposed which improve this 2 / 3 result to a new 0. 7 density threshold. These two schedulers can be viewed as a generalization of the previously known schedulers, <b>i.</b> e., they <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> a larger class of pinwheel instances including all instances schedulable by the previously known techniques. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for gradient de-scent image alignment in the Fourier domain. Specifically, we propose an extension to the classical Lucas & Kanade (LK) algorithm where we represent the source and template image’s intensity pixels in the complex 2 D Fourier domain rather than in the 2 D spatial domain. We refer to this ap-proach as the Fourier LK (FLK) algorithm. The FLK for-mulation is especially advantageous, over traditional LK, when it comes to pre-processing the source and template im-ages with a bank of filters (e. g., Gabor filters) as: (<b>i)</b> it <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> substantial illumination variations, (ii) the ineffi-cient pre-processing filter bank step can be subsumed within the FLK algorithm as a sparse diagonal weighting matrix, (iii) unlike traditional LK the computational cost is invari-ant to the number of filters and as a result far more efficient, (iv) this approach can be extended to the inverse composi-tional form of the LK algorithm where nearly all steps (in-cluding Fourier transform and filter bank pre-processing) can be pre-computed leading to an extremely efficient and robust approach to gradient descent image matching. We demonstrate robust image matching performance on a va-riety of objects in the presence of substantial illumination differences with exactly the same computational overhead as that of traditional inverse compositional LK during fit-ting. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes Efficient Sleep Scheduling {{based on}} Application Timing (ESSAT), a novel power {{management}} scheme that aggressively exploits the timing semantics of {{wireless sensor network}} applications. We present three ESSAT protocols each of which integrates (1) a lightweight traffic shaper that actively shapes the workload inside the network to achieve predictable timing properties over multiple hops, and (2) a local scheduling algorithm that wakes up nodes just-in-time based on the timing properties of shaped workloads. Our ESSAT protocols have several distinguishing features. First, they can save significant energy with minimal delay penalties. Second, they do not maintain TDMA schedules or communication backbones; as such, they are highly efficient and suitable for resource constrained sensor platforms. Moreover, the protocols are robust in highly dynamic network environments, <b>i.</b> e., they <b>can</b> <b>handle</b> variable multi-hop communication delays and aggregate workloads involving multiple queries, and can adapt to varying workload and network topologies. Our simulations showed that DTS-SS, an ES-SAT protocol, achieved an average node duty cycle 38 - 87 % lower than SPAN, and query latencies 36 - 98 % lower than PSM and SYNC. ...|$|R
