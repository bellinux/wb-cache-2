Chambers claimed there would always be athletes using performance-enhancing drugs because drug testers did not <b>keep</b> <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> advances in science and that athletes who took drugs had an immense advantage over those who remained clean. Chambers was roundly condemned for his comments in the interview by both the press and his former colleagues in the athletics world, including Sir Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah, and Sebastian Coe, although former 100m world record holder Asafa Powell supported Chambers' claims.|$|E

Up {{until the end of}} June 1945, No.5 Squadron had flown almost 2,000 sorties and No.17 AOP Flight over 1,300, while No.10 Local Air Supply Unit and the No.36 Squadron detachment had accounted for almost 1,000 between them. As the navigational efficiency of the New Zealander pilots increased, demands on the Boomerangs and Wirraways lessened, and the bulk of the reconnaissance duties fell to the Austers of No.17 AOP Flight.|$|E

5|$|In Egypt, Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps were {{defeated}} by British forces under Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in October 1942. The Allies landed in Sicily in July 1943 and in Italy in September. Meanwhile, American and British bomber fleets based in Britain began operations against Germany {{and in an}} effort to destroy German morale many sorties were intentionally given civilian targets. Soon German aircraft production could not <b>keep</b> <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> losses and without air cover the Allied bombing campaign became even more devastating.

5|$|Rwanda is {{a country}} of few natural resources, {{and the economy is}} based mostly on {{subsistence}} agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014. Farming techniques are basic, with small plots of land and steep slopes. Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have been decreasing, {{due in part to the}} resettlement of displaced people. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not <b>keep</b> <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> population growth, and food imports are required.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} developments, {{while they}} brought work and wealth, were so rapid that housing, town-planning, and provision {{for public health}} did not <b>keep</b> <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> them, {{and for a time}} living conditions in some of the towns and cities were notoriously bad, with overcrowding, high infant mortality, and growing rates of tuberculosis. The companies attracted rural workers, as well as immigrants from Catholic Ireland, by inexpensive company housing that was a dramatic move upward from the inner-city slums. This paternalistic policy led many owners to support government sponsored housing programs as well as self-help projects among the respectable working class.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris is seriously threatened by hunting and trade. Within its geographic range and neighbor countries, {{the trade in}} the pygmy slow loris has recently increased due to economic changes and human population growth, and the trend is expected to continue. Decreased sightings {{in the field and}} at animal markets indicate that wild populations are being depleted since the low reproduction rate of the pygmy slow loris cannot <b>keep</b> <b>pace</b> <b>with</b> these large-scale off-takes. Accordingly, conservationists and field biologists fear local extinctions in the near future. Between 1998 and 2006, 70% of pygmy slow lorises seized by authorities died before reaching a sheltering zoo, resulting in replacement demand and additional captures from the wild.|$|E

Although the situation never forced the UN to halt its air operations, on several occasion the situation became quite dire, and was only rectified by the rapid procurement of supplies from Japan.
