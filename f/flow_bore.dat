40|$|Changes in {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} with increasing intracranial pressure were studied in anaesthetized baboons during expansion of a subdural balloon {{in one of two}} different sites. With an infratentorial balloon, cerebral blood <b>flow</b> <b>bore</b> no clear relation to intracranial pressure, but was linearly related to cerebral perfusion pressure. Apart from an initial change in some animals, cerebrovascular resistance remained constant with increasing intracranial pressure, and autoregulation appeared to be lost from the outset. With a supratentorial balloon, {{cerebral blood flow}} remained constant as intracranial pressure was increased to levels around 60 mm Hg, corresponding to a cerebral perfusion pressure range of approximately 100 to 40 mmHg. Cerebrovascular resistance fell progressively, and autoregulation appeared to be effective during this phase. At higher intracranial pressure levels (lower cerebral perfusion pressure levels), autoregulation was lost and cerebral blood flow became directly dependent on cerebral perfusion pressure. The importance of the cause of the increase in intracranial pressure on the response of the cerebral circulation and the relevance of these findings to the clinical situation are discussed...|$|E

Their results showed that in emphysema expira-tory obstruction occurred in large airways whereas in asthma it was in small airways. It had already been established, in particular by Dayman (2), that emphysema was characterized by a marked increase in airway resistance during forced ex-piration, due to airway compression, and that this increase limited expiratory flow. Subsequently Hyatt, Schilder, and Fry (3) and Fry and Hyatt (4) showed that the inability of the patient with emphysema to breathe was directly attributable to expiratory airway compression and that maximal expiratory <b>flow</b> <b>bore</b> a unique relationship to lung volume. Out of these investigations grew the concept of the "flow-limiting segment, " which was regarded as the airway or airways which {{were the first}} to narrow enough to limit flow. Thus, Koblet and Wyss's work took on added importance be-cause it suggested that the flow limitation in em-physema was due to narrowing of large bronchi. Our laboratory has confirmed and extended their results by measuring bronchial pressures during cinebronchography (5). It was found that in emphysema the expiratory obstruction as demon-strated by the pressure measurements coincided with collapse of the lobar bronchi visualized cine-bronchographically.

However, many of the mound springs referred to above have dried up due to a drop in water pressure, probably resulting in extinction of several invertebrate species.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] A {{study was}} {{performed}} to produce reference standards for spirometric lung function in white children and to calculate standard deviation scores adjusted for gender and pubertal stage. METHODS [...] A cross sectional study was made of 772 white children aged 4. 6 to 18. 8 years (455 male) tested on an OHIO 840 spirometer and assessed anthropometrically and pubertally. RESULTS [...] Before puberty there was a linear increase in all lung function measurements with height. During puberty a sudden increase occurred, but subsequently the relationship was again linear. No simple single equation described this pattern. Advanced puberty in younger children conferred a respiratory advantage, whilst delayed puberty resulted in the converse. Girls had poorer volumes per unit height, but young girls had superior airflow/unit lung volume.

40|$|The {{tidal bore}} of the Garonne River (France) was {{investigated}} on 29 August, 31 August and 27 October 2015, during which instantaneous velocity measurements were performed continuously at high-frequency (200 Hz). The tidal bore occurrence had a marked {{effect on the}} flow field and turbulent Reynolds stress data, indicating large shear stresses, together with large and rapid fluctuations, during the bore passage and the early flood tide. Like many natural process <b>flows,</b> the tidal <b>bore</b> <b>flow</b> motion was dominated by coherent structure activities and turbulent events, with {{significant impact on the}} natural systems including in terms of sediment processes. Herein a new turbulent event analysis was developed for the highly-unsteady rapidly-varied tidal <b>bore</b> <b>flow.</b> The analysis was based upon basic concepts, in which turbulent bursting events were defined in terms of the instantaneous relative turbulent flux, and the method was extended to the rapidly-varied, highly-unsteady tidal bore motion. The turbulent event data showed relatively close results for most fluxes during the tidal bores. The event duration showed some tidal trend, with longer turbulent events immediately after the tidal bore passage, occurring simultaneously with major sediment erosion processes. The field data set and analyses suggested that a turbulent event analysis may be applicable to highly-unsteady rapidly-varied flows, providing quantitative details into the turbulent bursts that are responsible for major mixing and sedimentary processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between classical hydraulics and modern turbulence modelling is discussed {{for the case}} of two-dimensional open channel flow down an inclined plane. A second order turbulence model describing the flow is treated asymptotically for the parameter range F ≥ O (1), δ ≪ 1, β ≪ 1, and δ = O (β 2), where F is the Froude number, δ is the aspect ratio, and β is the square root of a characteristic drag coefficient. The Chezy law formulation of mathematical hydraulics is derived as the lowest order approximation to the solution for the <b>flow</b> outside <b>bore</b> regions, and the transverse variation of the longitudinal velocity component is determined at {{the next stage of}} the analysis. It is shown that flow discontinuities calculated using the equations of mathematical hydraulics are resolved in bore regions of transverse length scale O (H o), where H o is the characteristic fluid depth. The bore structure is found to consist of a highly turbulent outer region with transverse length scale O (H o) in which the turbulence intensity is O (1), and a bottom boundary layer of transverse length scale O (β 2 H o), in which the turbulent stresses decrease rapidly to satisfy the bottom boundary conditions.

40|$|The {{prediction}} of compressor drum cavity heat transfer {{is an important}} factor in the overall design of an aero engine. The rotationally dominated flow field within the cavity governs the heat transfer conditions by suppressing the motion of the fluid. Without heating, the fluid in the outer region of the cavity can approach solid body rotation. The outer cavity fluid is disturbed by the <b>bore</b> <b>flow</b> at the inner radius. The resultant <b>bore</b> <b>flow</b> vortex has been shown to exhibit many different modes of behaviour, dependent on the Rossby number. At higher Rossby number the <b>bore</b> <b>flow</b> vortex has been shown to break down into a precessing radial arm. It has also been shown that the hot drive arm (shroud) between the compressor stages destabilises the flow field through natural convection.

It features titanium alloy discs, which are instrumented with surface thermocouples. This paper presents data which helps to separate the effects of throughflow Reynolds number, rotational Reynolds number and Grashof number on the dimensionless disc temperature profiles.

While calculation of fracturing flowback rate is always lack of theoretical model to predict, it is always been solved by accumulation of filed fluid after fracturing finished in oil filed. In order to tackle this problem, a great deal of work has been done to establish a model for solving fracturing flowback rate, in which procedures like fracture closing, fluid loss, formation fluid <b>flows</b> and well <b>bore</b> <b>flow</b> are entirely considered. Based on comprehensive procedures, a few functions are established in this model. The average fracture pressure was calculated by adjusting time that might affect fracture closure degrees. According to wellhead pressure, bottom hole flowing pressure and average fracture pressure which was used to calculate flowback quantity leaded by fracture closure were achieved. Besides, total time that fracture was entirely closed was also achieved after fracture being fully closed, flowback quantity consisted of two parts, fracture and formation. In addition, the model was solved through finite difference method and simulated by Matlab. In comparison with the target result, fracturing flowback rate, the modeling results, are almost identical with that of conventional methods. Therefore, this model can be taken as a reliable theoretical guidance to predict fracturing flowback rate in oil flied...|$|R
