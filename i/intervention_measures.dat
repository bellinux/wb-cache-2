In 1967, Schiller introduced the Law for Promoting Stability and Growth, which was subsequently passed by the Bundestag. Regarded as the Magna Carta of medium-term economic management, the legislation provided for coordination of federal, Lander, and local budget plans in order to give fiscal policy a stronger impact. It also set a number of optimistic targets for four basic standards by which West German economic success would henceforth be measured, which included trade balance, employment levels, economic growth, and currency stability.|$|E

The primary outcome of this systematic review was to assess glycaemic control and incidence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) diagnosis after exercise and dietary <b>intervention</b> (<b>measured</b> with any validated scale). The secondary outcome assessed body mass index change, weight change, and physical exercise capacity after diet and exercise <b>intervention</b> (<b>measured</b> with any validated scale). 1, 780 studies were identified from searching electronic databases.

The inclusion criteria for all studies were people with prediabetes diagnosed by either impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Lifestyle adaptation reduced the incidence of diabetes development more than standard treatment. Furthermore, better glycaemic control, improved physical exercise capacity, and increased weight reduction were observed with lifestyle intervention over standard treatment. Finally, improvements {{over the long term}} deteriorated, highlighting problems with long-term adherence to lifestyle changes. Overall, cumulative incidence of diabetes is drastically reduced in the intervention groups compared to control groups (standard care).

40|$|In {{response}} to {{reports that the}} contamination of food can occur during the on-farm primary phase of food production, we report data that describes a possible cost-effective <b>intervention</b> <b>measure.</b> The effect of time before soil incorporation of livestock wastes spread {{to land on the}} rate of decline of zoonotic agents present in the waste was investigated. Fresh livestock wastes were inoculated with laboratory-cultured Salmonella, Listeria, and Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli O 157 before they were spead onto soil. Incorporation of the spread wastes was either immediate, delayed for 1 week, or did not occur at all. Bacterial decline was monitored over time and found to be significantly more rapid for all waste types when they were left on the soil surface. There {{were no significant differences in}} initial bacterial decline rates when wastes were spread in summer or winter. Our results indicate that not incorporating contaminated livestock wastes into soil is a potential <b>intervention</b> <b>measure</b> that may help to limit the spread of zoonotic agents further up the food chain. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to current advice for livestock waste disposal.

The results of the surveillance carried out in one's own hosptital were (partly) distributed in practically all cases to infection committee and to surgeons, as well as, in most cases, to nursing units and management. In comparison with the other PREZIES hospitals, the questionnaire was distributed in almost every case to the infection committee and surgeons, and less often to nursing units and management. The report on results was used in half the hospitals to provide information and, according to the contacts in all the hospitals, contributed to more awareness on infection prevention. In almost half the hospitals the results led to an <b>intervention</b> <b>measure.</b> A number of contacts in these hospitals stated that the measure led to decreased surgical site infections.

50|$|Further advancements in tank {{defence systems}} {{has led to}} the {{development}} of active protection systems. These involve either one of two options: Soft-kill or Hard-kill protection systems. The Soft-kill protection system uses an integrated onboard radar warning receivers which can detect incoming anti-tank missiles and projectiles. Once detected, soft-kill measures will be deployed which involves deploying smoke screens or smoke grenades which interfere with the incoming missile's infra-red tracking system. This will cause the incoming missile to miss the tank or to deactivate entirely. The more advanced approach involves the Hard-kill measures. These involve directly destroying the incoming enemy missile or projectile by deploying the tank's own anti-missile projectile. This is seen as a more reliable approach due to its direct <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> rather than interference measures of the soft-kill measures. Both these active protection systems can be found on several main battle tanks including the K-2 Black Panther, the Merkerva and the Leopard 2A7.|$|E

Grazing exclusions have been known to preserve plant species composition in most rangelands of the world Todd (2006).

50|$|Historically, {{water sources}} in Bangladesh came from surface water {{contaminated}} with bacteria. As {{a result of}} drinking infected water, infants and children suffered from acute gastrointestinal disease, causing significant burden of mortality. During the 1970s, UNICEF worked with the Department of Public Health Engineering to install tube-wells, which drew water from underground aquifers, to provide a presumably safe source of water for the nation. The wells consist of tubes 5 cm in diameter that were inserted less than 200 m into the ground, and capped with an iron or steel hand pump. At that time, standard water testing procedures did not include arsenic testing. This lack of precaution led {{to one of the}} largest mass poisoning of a population twenty years later because the ground water used for drinking is naturally contaminated with arsenic. Because arsenic has no taste, no smell, and no color, its long term health risks can be harder for the inhabitants to grasp compared to the immediate threats caused by diarrhoea. Nonetheless, <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> such as awareness programs and painting tube-wells red if the water is above the government limit of 50 ppb arsenic (green otherwise) have seen success. As of 2010, 80% of Bangladeshis recognize arsenic as a problem.

Between 2000 and 2009, more than 160,000 safe water devices have been installed in arsenic-affected regions of Bangladesh.|$|E
