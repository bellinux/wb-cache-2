Kroz teorijski dio su definirani ključni pojmovi za razumijevanje rada poput novih medija, identiteta, političke komunikacije te je dan kontekst u povezanost Istarskog demokratskog sabora i političke promocije identiteta te u političku situaciju vezanu za parlamentarne izbore 2016. godine. Metodom studije slučaja promatrana je internetska stranica, pet Facebook stranica te po jedan Twitter i Instagram profil vezan uz stranku u periodu od 13. kolovoza do 13. rujna 2016. godine. Zaključak rada je da Istarski demokratski sabor prati sve trendove korištenja novih medija te da na taj način uspješno „pakira“ svoju politiku pod regionalni identitet koji ističe u dvije trećine ukupnih objava sadržajno vezanih uz kampanju. This paper {{deals with}} the online {{communication}} of the <b>Istrian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Parliament during the 2016 election campaign for the parliamentary elections, setting regional identity and decentralization as main thematic. Through the theoretical part, I've explained key concepts for understanding this paper such as new media, identity, political communication {{and all of them}} I've also defined by the context of the link between the <b>Istrian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Parliament and the political promotion of identity and the political situation related to the 2016 parliamentary elections. The case study method looked at main assemby internet site, five Facebook pages, and one Twitter and one Instagram profile related to the party in the period from August 13 to September 13, 2016. The conclusion of the paper is that the <b>Istrian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Parliament follows all the trends of using the new media in politics and thus successfully "packs" its politics under a regional identity theme that points out in two-thirds of the overall announcements related to the campaign...|$|R
50|$|The main {{policy of}} the IDS is intercession of {{cultural}} and economical identity of Istria and equal status for Italian and Croatian in Istria. This was in opposition to Tuđman and his hard-line nationalism. Other Croatian political parties were more pragmatic, and IDS cooperated {{with them in the}} Croatian Parliament and during elections. In Istria, however, IDS is bitterly opposed by local branches of SDP, as well as their former member and first Istrian prefect Luciano Delbianco who had defected and formed a new party called <b>Istrian</b> <b>Democratic</b> Forum.|$|R
