3000|$|We prove Theorem 3.1 using similar {{techniques}} {{as described in}} [19]. We define a series of hybrid experiments. In each experiment, we modify the way session keys are chosen <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> involved in protocol execution. We start by choosing random session keys <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> <b>for</b> which the Execute oracle is called. Then, we continue to choose random session keys <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> <b>for</b> which the Send oracle is called.

We generalize on-line {{learning}} to handle delays in receiving labels <b>for</b> <b>instances.</b> After receiving an instance x, the algorithm {{may need to}} make predictions on several new instances before the label for x is returned by the environment. We give two simple techniques for converting a traditional on-line algorithm into an algorithm for solving a delayed on-line problem. One technique is <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> generated by an adversary; the other is <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> generated by a distribution. We show how these techniques effect the original on-line mistake bounds by giving upper-bounds and restricted lower-bounds {{on the number of}} mistakes. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{toxicity}} of Narcissus varies with species, N. poeticus being more toxic than N. pseudonarcissus, <b>for</b> <b>instance.</b> The distribution of toxins within the plant also varies, <b>for</b> <b>instance</b> {{there is a}} five times higher concentration of alkaloid in the stem of N. papyraceus than in the bulb, making it dangerous to herbivores more likely to consume the stem than the bulb, and {{is part of the}} plant's defence mechanisms. The distribution of alkaloids within tissues may also reflect defence against parasites. The bulbs can also be toxic to other nearby plants, including roses, rice, and cabbages, inhibiting growth. <b>For</b> <b>instance</b> placing cut flowers in a vase alongside other flowers shortens the life of the latter.|$|E

The career of Soekarno, meanwhile, lasted through the 1970s; he was mostly credited as Rendra Karno after changing his name in the 1950s.

40|$|We {{consider}} a scheduling problem {{in which a}} bounded number of jobs can be processed simultaneously by a single machine. The input {{is a set of}} n jobs J = {J 1, [...] .,Jn}. Each job, Jj, is associated with an interval [sj,cj] along which it should be processed. Also given is the parallelism parameter g ≥ 1, which is the maximal number of jobs that can be processed simultaneously by a single machine. Each machine operates along a contiguous time interval, called its busy interval, which contains all the intervals corresponding to the jobs it processes. The goal is to assign the jobs to machines such that the total busy time of the machines is minimized. The problem is known to be NP-hard already for g = 2. We present a 4 -approximation algorithm <b>for</b> general <b>instances,</b> and approximation algorithms with improved ratios <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> with bounded lengths, <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> where any two intervals intersect, and <b>for</b> <b>instances</b> where no interval is properly contained in another.
