On August 27, 2010, however, {{on the advice of}} doctors who refused to clear him to play, Kariya announced that he would sit out the 2010–11 season with post-concussion syndrome. While the symptoms eventually did subside somewhat, the same doctors advised Kariya that it was too risky to try to play again, and Kariya officially announced his retirement from hockey on June 29, 2011, through the NHLPA.

500|$|Tupelo Honey {{was well}} {{received}} by critics upon the album's release. Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone: [...] "Tupelo Honey {{is in one}} sense but {{another example of the}} artist making increased use of the album as the unit of communication as opposed to merely the song or the cut. Everything on it is perfectly integrated." [...] ZigZag magazine reviewer John Tobler, who also reviewed the album just after its release, gave the album high praise, saying [...] "If all music were as good as this, there wouldn't be any reason to make any more, because this is the real thing." [...] Critic Dave Marsh called it [...] "the perfect album for Van: he does everything...so incredibly well. There isn't a bad cut on it, of that I'm really sure." [...] Robert Christgau from The Village Voice voiced reservations in his praise of the album, writing that it was [...] "almost as rich in cute tunes as The Shirelles' Greatest Hits, but <b>I</b> <b>worry</b> that domestic bliss with Janet Planet has been softening Van's noodle more than the joy of cooking requires." [...] Tupelo Honey was later ranked the fourth best album {{of the year in the}} Village Voice's first annual Pazz & Jop Critics Poll.|$|E
500|$|Monroe {{returned}} to Hollywood in July 1958 to act opposite Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis in Billy Wilder's comedy on gender roles, Some Like It Hot. Although she considered {{the role of}} Sugar Kane another [...] "dumb blonde", she accepted it due to Miller's encouragement and the offer of receiving {{ten percent of the}} film's profits in addition to her standard pay. The difficulties during the film's production have since become [...] "legendary". Monroe would demand dozens of re-takes, and could not remember her lines or act as directed– Curtis famously stated that kissing her was [...] "like kissing Hitler" [...] due to the number of re-takes. Monroe herself privately likened the production to a sinking ship and commented on her co-stars and director saying [...] " [...] why should <b>I</b> <b>worry,</b> I have no phallic symbol to lose." [...] Many of the problems stemmed from a conflict between her and Wilder, who also had a reputation for being difficult, on how she should play the character. Monroe made Wilder angry by asking him to alter many of her scenes, which in turn made her stage fright worse, and it is suggested that she deliberately ruined several scenes to act them her way.|$|E
