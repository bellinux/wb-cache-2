5|$|Considering {{the weight}} of attack against airfields, hardly any fighters were {{destroyed}} on the ground. Figures indicated just two Spitfires and six Hurricanes were lost in this manner. The main reason for this was the high state of readiness of RAF units during daylight.

5|$|Early on, {{the economy}} <b>depended</b> greatly upon the railroads in the area.

The city's economy not only <b>depended</b> on the rails but the goods, such as timber and cotton, transported on them. With these {{rail-based}} industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people.|$|E

Black non-commissioned Officers led by First Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi, a veteran of the East Africa Campaign, munitied at Luluabourg in the central Congolese province of Kasaï in February 1944; the trigger for this was a plan to vaccinate troops who had served at the front, though the soldiers were also unhappy about the demands placed on them and their treatment by their white officers.|$|E
5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming <b>depended</b> on the labor of women, while the production of income <b>depended</b> on the labor of {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{military}} {{victory of the}} absolutist city authorities was complete, the war had also shown them that they <b>depended</b> very much on their rural subjects. Soon after the war, the ruling aristocrats instituted a series of reforms and even lowered some taxes, thus fulfilling some of the peasants' original fiscal demands.

5|$|Attempts {{to resolve}} the {{electrical}} units in terms of length, mass, and time using dimensional analysis was beset with difficulties—the dimensions <b>depended</b> on whether one used the ESU or EMU systems.

The fourth unit could be chosen to be electric current, voltage, or electrical resistance.|$|E
