40|$|Real estate {{development}} from raw land to completed structures is a multistage process. Given the current view of development as {{the exercise of}} a real option, the question arises whether development should be modeled as a compound option. This paper tests {{the validity of the}} compound option characterization by determining whether builders start units for which they have permits and then complete units started consistent with the predictions of the real options model. To do so, I first identify a reduced form relationship between permits and starts and then between starts and completions. The parameters of this relationship indicate how well permits proxy for starts and starts for completions. Then, I determine whether controlling for this structural relationship, new information, and uncertainty in returns affect permit exercise and completion rates, as in the exercise of real options. I find that current and previous quarter permits forecast current single-family starts, while multifamily starts require more quarterly lags of permits. More than one and two year's worth of lagged starts numbers are needed to estimate current quarter completions for single- and multifamilys buildings, respectively. The principal result is that once building permits have been obtained, the development process proceeds to completion. While {{there is no evidence that}} completion is the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>option</b> embedded in a start, some aspects of permits are consistent with builders treating them as an option for starts. However, even if they do, given permits obtained, it takes large changes in market conditions to affect small changes in starts. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001. ...|$|E

However, in the current US housing crisis, borrowers may choose to defer a mortgage payment in order to mitigate a cash flow problem or improve their equity position. This option is available when the lender does not automatically foreclose on the delinquent borrower. Invariably, a negotiation commences between lender and borrower, each motivated by different sets of objectives. We model those negotiations by considering future unavoidable foreclosure costs.

But Chapter 11 and indeed all market-mimicking reorganization regimes other than a speedy auction entrust the shutdown decision to a bankruptcy judge who lacks information and expertise, as well as the ability to control the timing of her decisions. Understanding the costs of entrusting the shutdown decision to a bankruptcy judge is central to assessing any law of corporate reorganizations. This paper models the shutdown decision as the <b>exercise</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> real <b>option.</b> The model suggests that the shutdown decision may loom so large in the early parts of the bankruptcy case that it erases any significant difference between Chapter 11 and many alternative market-mimicking regimes.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a portfolio}} theory for real assets with main focus on petroleum {{exploration and development}} assets. Exploratory assets are prospects with chances to find out development assets (oilfields in this case). By the real options point of view, exploratory assets are compound options. In opposition to financial assets portfolio theory, the paper shows that positive correlation between exploratory assets is a desirable feature because it increases both the (endogenous) learning option value and the synergy gain with development assets. In the first case due to the learning sequential nature, with the option to limit losses if occur bad news and creating the option to develop if occur good news. In the second case because a higher (positive) correlation increases the probability of multiple success and so the synergy gain by sharing the development infrastructure. The analysis of the simplest portfolio, i. e., with only two exploratory assets, provides important insights about learning, synergy and option to defer exploration.
