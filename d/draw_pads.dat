5000|$|Cortez {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the arts in elementary school but did not take his first formal art class until he was in seventh grade. During this time, Cortez describes his early passion for drawing {{as a way to}} cope with feeling like an outsider at school. As a self-proclaimed nerd, Cortez recalls this time as when [...] "nerds were nerds, unlike now, when nerd is a code word for cool." [...] Cortez further recalls that his love of drawing at an early age lead him to steal money from his mother's purse to buy a <b>drawing</b> <b>pad.</b> He filled this <b>drawing</b> <b>pad</b> with comic book imagery, and imitations of advertisements for beauty salon's.|$|R

25|$|Villeneuve uses {{a yellow}} helmet, with {{the upper part}} blue, and pink, red and green lines. Villeneuve {{apparently}} designed his helmet while doodling on a <b>drawing</b> <b>pad.</b> The pink line forms a 'V' on each side, which Villeneuve has {{been quoted as saying}} was 'unintentional'. Some say that the colors of the helmet were based on the shirt of his mother Joann.|$|R
50|$|Machines are {{becoming}} more ubiquitous in the artistic process itself, with computerized <b>drawing</b> <b>pads</b> replacing pen and paper, and drum machines becoming nearly as popular as human drummers. This is perhaps most notable in generative art and music. Composers such as Brian Eno have developed and utilized software which can build entire musical scores from a few basic mathematical parameters.|$|R

50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot in three places: Aira sitting beside a bathtub full of water, another was Aira on a light blue studio in {{multiple}} angle shots, and on the bedroom. The music video starts with Aira beside a bathtub attempting to call someone on her mobile phone and then switches to a scene with Aira singing on a light blue studio in multiple angles, also shifting {{to the scene of}} her and the bathtub in which she looked worried. On the second verse of the song, Aira is seen lying on a bed with a <b>drawing</b> <b>pad</b> and colored pencils. On the second chorus, she draws something on the <b>drawing</b> <b>pad</b> while singing and smiling (pictured). On the bridge, on the scene of Aira and the bathtub, snow began to fall. The scene changes again to Aira on the blue room shot in multiple angles while she is singing. {{at the end of the}} song, the scene shifts finally to Aira and the first setting while snow is falling.|$|R
50|$|Initial {{attempts}} {{to sell the}} products on the West German market were unsuccessful; however, in 1960, the breakthrough came about with notebooks and <b>drawing</b> <b>pads</b> with illustrated covers, which was an absolute novelty at the time. In the following years, from 1960 to 1994, the company was able to double its turnover each year. This meant an increase in annual turnover from 2 million Euros in 1960 to 885 million Euros in 1994.|$|R
5000|$|Deborah's name {{is changed}} from Blau (which means [...] "blue" [...] in German, and {{parallels}} the author's pseudonym [...] "Green") to Blake. Another major {{theme of the}} book, Deborah's artistic talent which flourished {{in spite of her}} illness, was reduced to a scene in which she scribbles childishly on a <b>drawing</b> <b>pad.</b> The Kingdom Of Yr is portrayed on-screen, as are some of its gods, but never seen in its original ethereal beauty, only the wasteland that it became much later.|$|R
50|$|Prosveta Publishing House was {{established}} within the Ministry of People’s Education on February 15, 1945 by a Decree of the Regents of Bulgaria {{with the purpose}} of “publishing textbooks, teaching aids, notebooks, and <b>drawing</b> <b>pads</b> for all academic subjects in all types of schools and academic institutions.According to statistics, Prosveta has published and circulated the works of over 50,000 authors and 28,000 titles in 788 series in more than two billion copies.Prosveta Publishing House {{is a member of the}} EEPG (European Educational Publishers Group).|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{political}} situation in Germany at the time, it became increasingly difficult {{for the company to}} get its goods from West Germany to Berlin. As a result, Günter Herlitz decided to manufacture his own stationery. The company began with the production of exercise books, <b>drawing</b> <b>pads</b> and index cards. In 1955, the company was already processing 60 tons of paper each month. Even though {{the political}} situation at the time initially prevented Herlitz from supplying customers outside West Berlin, the company was able to boast an annual turnover circa 1.1 million Euro.|$|R
50|$|Long {{before he}} became one of Broadway's most {{prolific}} playwrights, Herb Gardner was a comic strip artist for the New York Daily News. Mr. Gardner was invited to appear on Kartoon Klub where he engaged members of the studio audience and home viewers in chalk talks (he would draw pictures on a <b>drawing</b> <b>pad</b> to help illustrate his stories about an unusual group of creatures known as The Nebbishes). The segment was so successful that on Saturday evening, September 23, 1956, the program's title was changed to Shari & Her Friends.|$|R
50|$|Wilson {{started off}} in sand racing in 1995, he quickly {{moved up the}} classes, debuting in the Supersport class in 2000 gaining a 15th place finish at Oulton Park at his very first meeting. Ben then ran a mixture of Championships, {{including}} the Supersport and Superstock bikes until 2005. Ben and his grandmother exchange delightful emails with interesting details of their daily lives as often as possible. Rumor has it that he will give his <b>drawing</b> <b>pad</b> to Sydney when he gets a new one. Ben goes by the nickname of benniemac.|$|R
50|$|In 1958 after observing school {{children}} drawing in Baker Lake, Oonark casually remarked {{to the school}} teacher that she could draw better than that. The next summer in 1959, the teacher shared this comment with Canadian Wildlife Service biologist, Dr. Andrew Macpherson, who was in Baker Lake studying Arctic fox. Macpherson gave her coloured pencils and paper, purchased her drawings and brought {{some of them to}} Ottawa. Macpherson continued to send her coloured pencils and a <b>drawing</b> <b>pad</b> after his return to Ottawa in the late fall of 1959. In the spring of 1960 Oonark sent him twelve completed drawings in the sketchbook via the Northern Services Officer Tom Butlers.|$|R
5000|$|Hobbes' {{appearance}} {{changed over}} the strip's run; in the beginning he was slightly shorter, his tufts of fur less defined and shorter. His eyes also had more of a round shape, {{as opposed to the}} oval shape of later years. The most notable change, however, were the pads on Hobbes's hands. In earlier years, Watterson <b>drew</b> the <b>pads</b> on Hobbes' hands as a reminder that they were really paws, but later removed them on the grounds that he found them to be visually distracting. However, in one strip after Waterson stopped <b>drawing</b> the <b>pads,</b> Hobbes remarks in response to a complaint by Calvin, [...] "my fuzzy mittens have pads!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Starting on January 28, {{the band}} tweeted {{a series of}} four videos to tease the album's first single. The {{time-lapse}} videos featured lead singer Dan Reynolds drawing surreal images on a <b>drawing</b> <b>pad.</b> Morse code was hidden in the videos and translated to [...] "objects of same color". On February 1, [...] "Believer" [...] was released as the lead single. To promote the single, it was used in a Super Bowl LI commercial for the Nintendo Switch. It was also used in the trailer for the reboot of Murder on the Orient Express. The song has since peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. Its music video starring Reynolds and actor Dolph Lundgren was released on March 7.|$|R
5000|$|On September 27, 2016, Imagine Dragons began teasing {{their third}} studio album with a tweet simply saying [...] "studio".

40|$|Bare PWB test systems {{require an}} {{exhaustive}} TP (test point) list {{to process the}} test operation. As not all CAD and CAM users {{talk to each other}} using intelligent data transfer, test information is usually lost. This is true as most systems today support only the Gerber format. Smart CAM tools have thus been developed to extract test information. The TP research is based on Gerber flashes. Software puts a TP everywhere a flash is plotted. Unfortunately, over 50 % of SMT <b>pads</b> are <b>drawn</b> and not flashed due to their small width or because they represent network extremities. The current solution is to manually reconvert <b>drawn</b> <b>pads</b> to flashes before TP extraction. On one hand, the software is unreliable, while on the other, the intervention of an operator can inconvenience the exhaustive TP list generation and is in any case time consuming and expensive. TIMA laboratory and IMD Test Systems Div. have developed an alternative: new software based on image processing and pattern recognition to automatically extract full test data, including the netlist. In essence, this software converts the Gerber file to a bitmap image, and then does an intelligent vectorization by tracking net by net (a net is an object of connected pixels) while running pattern recognition to extract TPs. The main advantages of this original method are that tracking connected pixels on the bitmap avoids the mistakes of vectorial calculations (nets are always correct) and the software is not limited by <b>drawn</b> <b>pads</b> as it does not use flash information (no need to convert draws to flashes). Test data are thus complete and the netlist is correct...|$|R
5000|$|A talented sketch artist, she {{sketches}} {{an accurate}} likeness of {{a suspect in}} the episode [...] "Marine Down". During the same episode, it was shown that she had drawn caricatures of the team, some of which showed DiNozzo lusting after a pretty girl, and NCIS forensic scientist Abby Sciuto as a bat. She also drew one of Gibbs as well, but managed to take her <b>drawing</b> <b>pad</b> back from DiNozzo before he revealed it. In season three, when Ziva David joined the team full-time and moved into Todd's cubicle, she presented Gibbs with Todd's sketch pad. There were portraits of each cast member in it, including Gibbs. McGee later finds one of Kate's sketches in his desk during season thirteen.|$|R
5000|$|The body of {{the works}} include single drawings, groups of related drawings, collections, such as [...] "Varieties of Religious Experience," [...] (undated), and {{illustrated}} books, such as [...] "Presto," [...] 1973, that combine drawings with prose or poetry. Some works, such as the collection [...] "Ipglok," [...] ca. 1973, are [...] "word art," [...] in which words themselves, in unusual spellings and arrangements, {{are the subject of}} the work. Most are in a linear style, favored by Saul Steinberg and Picasso, and are executed in Rapidograph or Flair felt tip pens in <b>drawing</b> <b>pads,</b> 12 x 18 in., 8 1/2 x 11 in. or smaller sheets of paper. He also made paintings on 12 x 16 in. canvas panels. Some of Waldron's correspondence includes his drawings.|$|R
25|$|There {{have been}} several {{attempts}} {{to make use of}} modern technology for enhanced binocular eye training, in particular for treating amblyopia and interocular suppression. In some cases these modern techniques have improved patients' stereoacuity. Very early technology-enhanced vision therapy efforts have included the cheiroscope, which is a haploscope in which left- and or right-eye images can be blended into view over a <b>drawing</b> <b>pad,</b> and the subject may be given a task such as to reproduce a line image presented to one eye. However, historically these approaches were not developed much further and they were not put to widespread use. Recent systems are based on dichoptic presentation of the elements of a video game or virtual reality such that each eye receives different signals of the virtual world that the player's brain must combine in order to play successfully.|$|R

5000|$|Gene London (born Eugene Yulish in Cleveland, Ohio on June 9, 1931) was {{the host}} of a long-running, Philadelphia local children's show, Cartoon Corners (aka The Gene London Show). He was tall, slender, had dark hair and a soft-spoken manner. He starred on the children's show in the Philadelphia area on WCAU-TV Channel 10 from 1959 to 1977, in which several cartoons, {{particularly}} those of Disney, were shown. Early programs began with Gene London opening the door of his General Store and flipping the sign to read [...] "Open for Business." [...] As the kids passed by Gene, he palmed the tops of their heads and sang the opening theme song. Once inside the General Store, Gene, an accomplished artist and story-teller, told stories and used a large <b>drawing</b> <b>pad</b> to illustrate key scenes and characters from the tales, as children sat around him. With little budget, he and his cast also did clever interpretations of classic novels such as She Who Must Be Obeyed and various Greek myths.|$|R

50|$|Lily Green: Lily narrates {{the novel}} in first person. She is {{the eldest of}} the Green {{children}} and takes care of her siblings most of the time. She is eleven years old. Although she likes {{taking care of her}} siblings, she uses her vivid imagination to play a 'Lily Alone' game where she fantasizes that she lives alone in a big white house with beautiful rooms. She views it as being as 'pristine as a palace' - a palace which she will design all by herself. She uses an expensive <b>drawing</b> <b>pad,</b> purchased by her mother, upon which to draw. Lily is patient, gentle and responsible, but her mother uses her as a nanny and leaves her alone with Baxter, Bliss and Pixie most nights to club and drink. Lily loves her mother so much she does not realise that her mother is a failure as a parent for leaving her children alone and will often breakdown crying due to the pressure of responsibility. At {{the end of the book}} she is put into a care home apart from her siblings and mother, but believes that they will all be together soon.|$|R
25|$|If the player's Pokémon defeats the {{opposing}} Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives experience points. After accumulating enough experience points, it may level up; most Pokémon {{evolve into a}} new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level. Apart from battling, capturing Pokémon {{is the most important}} element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player may use a Poké Ball on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it in the PC if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used unless it is a Master Ball which has a 100% capture rate; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Platinum features largely the same Pokémon as in Diamond and Pearl, with some added and some missing. Platinum features the Pokétch, a wristwatch-like device, introduced in Diamond and Pearl. It features simple applications such as a calculator, map, counter, and <b>drawing</b> <b>pad.</b> Platinum also features the Underground mode, a mode where players dig for spheres and Fossils.|$|R
