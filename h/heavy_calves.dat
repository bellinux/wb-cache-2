40|$|Milk-fed <b>heavy</b> <b>calves</b> utilize dietary protein {{with a low}} {{efficiency}} and often develop hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Distributing the daily nutrient intake over {{an increasing number of}} meals increases protein deposition and improves glucose homeostasis. Therefore, we examined effects of feeding frequency (FF) and feeding level (FL) on the diurnal pattern of substrate oxidation and on the fate of dietary carbohydrates in milk-fed <b>heavy</b> <b>calves.</b> Eighteen milk-fed calves weighing 136 ± 3 kg were assigned to FF (1, 2, or 4 meals daily) at each of 2 FL (1. 5 or 2. 5 times maintenance), except for calves at FF 1 (only at a low FL). Urea, leucine, and glucose kinetics were assessed for each treatment by use of [13 C]urea, [1 - 13 C]leucine, [U- 13 C], and [2 - 13 C]glucose, respectively. FF altered the diurnal pattern, but not the total, of urea production production. Although urea production correlated well with nitrogen retention, oxidation of oral L-[1 - 13 C]leucine did not. Dietary glucose was almost completely oxidized (80 % based on [13 C]glucose and 94 % from indirect calorimetry measurements) regardless of FL. Fatty acid synthesis from glucose appeared to be negligible based on similar recoveries of 13 CO 2 from orally supplied [U- 13 C]glucose and [2 - 13 C]glucose. The increased fat deposition at the higher FL originated almost exclusively from greater transfer of fatty acids to body lipid stores. These findings contrast with both glucose and lipid metabolism in growing pigs and indicate that alternative adaptive mechanisms operate in heavy milk-fed calves...|$|E
40|$|Unlike most Rangifer herds, free-ranging female {{reindeer}} {Rangifer tarandus) on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska frequently {{give birth}} as yearlings (12 months). In other reindeer herds this early reproduction {{has led to}} negative effects such as decreased future weight gain and reproduction. We analyzed reindeer data collected on the Seward Peninsula between 1987 and 1997 to determine what effect lactating as yearlings had on future weight gain, reproductive rates, and survival. Reindeer were rounded up during June and early July. Individual ear tag numbers were recorded, females were visually inspected {{for the presence of}} a distended udder, and some animals were weighed. Females with distended udders as yearlings had subsequent recapture rates, survival rates, weight gain, and future reproductive success comparable to females that did not have distended udders as yearlings. These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of increased calf weight gain outweigh potential negative effects of early reproduction in these reindeer. This may be due to high quality range leading to <b>heavy</b> <b>calves</b> and the ability of females to maintain body reserves during lactation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Selection {{response}} was investigated after 11 years of selection in the herding district of Ruvhten Sijte in Sweden (63 °N, 12 °E) {{by comparing the}} weights of calves owned by herders applying selection with the weights of calves owned by herders not applying selection. Three owner groups in Ruvhten Sijte have selected calves at the autumn slaughter every year since 1986 by retaining <b>heavy</b> <b>calves.</b> They own approximately 45 % of the reindeer in Ruvhten Sijte. The other owners do not select on recorded weights, and all animals mix during the mating season. The recorded data on calf weights (1986 to 1997) consisted of 12 484 observations, with mean selection differentials of 2. 9 kg and 4. 6 kg for female and male calves, respectively (phenotypic standard deviation equal to 4. 4 kg). The female generation interval was 6. 4 years. In 1996 and 1997, autumn live weights of calves owned by herders applying selection (n = 971) were compared with the weights of calves owned by herders not applying selection (n = 1125). The observed difference was 0. 67 kg (total mean = 42. 6 kg), of which 0. 32 kg was {{due to differences in}} dam age structure between the two types of herds, therefore the estimated difference in selection {{response was}} 0. 35 kg. The realized heritability was 0. 2. The potential response that would have been realized if the selected part of the herd had been isolated from gene flow was predicted to be 2. 0 kg. In conclusion, the introduction of a selection programme applied by all owners in a herding district would result in an increase in calf weights of approximately 2 kg after two generations of selection.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{gross energy}} and {{nitrogen}} contents of muscle, fat, and connective tissue of calves were determined, and from these data and feed analyses the gross energetic (GEE) and nitrogen efficiency (GNE) of growth, and the gross efficiencies of accretion since birth (GEA, GNA) were calculated. The percentage range of actual efficiency values for calves were GEE 55. 3 - 7. 7, GEA 18. 1 - 1. 4, GNE 58. 1 - 22. 8, and GNA 28. 1 - 7. 3. Within each treatment group these values were {{higher in the}} <b>heavier</b> <b>calves.</b> An hypothesis for the apparent temporary rise in these values in the <b>heavier</b> <b>calves</b> is that a compensatory mechanism acts in calves on low energy and possibly low N intake to enable them better to utilize their food.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to quantify the contribution of low-protein solid feed (SF) intake, in addition to milk replacer, to protein and energy retention in veal calves. Because of potential interactions between milk replacer and SF, occurring at either the level of digestion or postabsorption, this contribution might differ from that in calves fed either SF or milk replacer alone. Forty-eight Holstein Friesian male calves, 55 ± 0. 3 kg of body weight (BW), were divided across 16 groups of 3 calves each. Groups were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 incremental levels of SF intake: 0, 9, 18, or 27 g of DM of SF/kg of BW 0. 75 per day. The SF mixture consisted of 25 % chopped wheat straw, 25 % chopped corn silage, and 50 % nonpelleted concentrate (on a DM basis). Each group was housed in a respiration chamber for quantification of energy and N balance at each of 2 BW: at 108 ± 1. 1 kg and at 164 ± 1. 6 kg. The milk replacer supply was 37. 3 g of DM/kg of BW 0. 75 per day at 108 kg of BW and 40. 7 g of DM/kg of BW 0. 75 per day at 164 kg of BW, irrespective of SF intake. Within a chamber, each calf was housed in a metabolic cage to allow separate collection of feces and urine. Indirect calorimetry and N balance data were analyzed by using regression procedures with SF intake-related variables. Nitrogen excretion shifted from urine to feces with increasing SF intake. This indicates a higher gut entry rate of urea and may explain the improved N utilization through urea recycling, particularly at 164 kg of BW. At 108 kg of BW, the gross efficiency of N retention was 61 % for calves without SF, and it increased with SF intake by 5. 4 %/g of DM of SF per day. At 164 kg of BW, this efficiency was 49 % for calves without SF, and it increased by 9. 9 %/g of DM of SF per day. The incremental efficiency of energy retention, representing the increase in energy retained per kilojoule of extra digestible energy intake from SF, was 41 % at 108 kg of BW and 54 % at 164 kg of BW. Accordingly, the apparent total-tract digestibility of NDF increased with BW, from 46 % at 108 kg of BW to 56 % at 164 kg of BW. On average, 5. 5 % of gross energy from SF was released as CH 4 in veal calves, which is similar to reported values in cattle fed only SF. In conclusion, the provision of low-protein SF resulted in improved N utilization for protein gain, particularly {{toward the end of the}} fattening period. In <b>heavy</b> <b>calves,</b> recycling of urea originating from amino acids in milk replacer potentially contributes substantially to the N retention of veal calves fed SF...|$|E

30|$|Results {{revealed}} {{that almost all}} non-genetic factors were observed with significant influence on growth, reproductive and milk production traits. Sex {{has an effect on}} all of the growth traits. Male are heavier and grew faster than female calves until post weaning growth period. AEZ has an effect at most live weight, in all reproductive traits and for two milk yield traits considered, indicating differences in agro–climate adaptation, production system, grazing area, management practice and availability of true phenotype of Sheko in the environments to which the breed is raised. Season of birth affected all of the reproductive traits, and many of the growth and milk production traits. Results suggest dry season calves give rise to <b>heavier</b> <b>calves</b> at weaning while short rainy season calves give rise to <b>heavier</b> <b>calves</b> at 6 -, 18 -month, and PrWDG. Whereas the main rainy season calves give rise to <b>heavier</b> <b>calves</b> at 12 -month suggest seasonal differences in growth traits showed variation for different season. For milk yield traits, calves born in short rain season performs better LYD, 305 DY and LL than others while for reproductive traits, calves born in dry season performs better DO and CI than others. The trend observed for most live weight and milk yield traits increased with increasing parity from the first to the third considered in the present study whereas the trend for reproductive rate (CI and DO) gradually decreased with increasing parity. Results of the study also {{revealed that}} growth, milk yield and reproductive traits considered for Sheko cows were found to be low. Feeding resources, management levels and true type Sheko cattle are important factors influencing and determining the productivity of the breed. It is apparent that most progress can be achieved through management factors and improving the level of nutrition. Results of the present study highlight the relevant factors affecting variability of traits considered and this give useful information for preferential treatments. Though, most of the factors exerted great influence, calls for further improvement of herd productivity. It was also observed that milk yield were higher at the early lactation stage, then it decreased linearly up to the end of late stage of lactation Generally, the effects of non-genetic factors on growth, reproductive and milk yield traits considered were significant and hence will need to be considered in cattle breed improvement program.|$|R

The objective was to estimate heterosis for F 1 and to compare between two groups of F 2 females for these reproductive traits. Breed groups included A, B, F 1 Brahman-sired (BA; a pair of letters designate the cow?s sire breed and dam breed, respectively) cows (n = 92 purebreds, 53 F 1, 49 F 2). F 2 breed groups included cows sired by AB and out of BA dams (ABBA) and cows sired by BA and out of BA dams (BABA). Data from 2 -yr-old females were analyzed separately from cows ages 3 -yr-old and older. As 2 -yr-olds, Brahman had the lowest calf crop born (0. 36 ? 0. 07; P < 0. 01) and a lower calf crop weaned than every breed group except BABA (0. 26 ? 0. 08; P < 0. 01). Also as 2 -yr-olds, BABA had a lower calf crop born (P < 0. 05) than BA and ABBA (0. 92 ? 0. 05 and 0. 88 ? 0. 08, respectively). As 3 -yr-olds and older, BABA had <b>heavier</b> <b>calves</b> (38. 74 ? 0. 86; P < 0. 05) than Brahman, BA, and ABBA, while Brahman had calves with the lightest (P < 0. 001) birth weight.

That group (BABA) was represented by a small number of cows for much of the data in later years, because of culling for reproduction, and means for that group may not be representative of the true group performance (i. e., their reproductive performance, as reported in this document, may be inflated).

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of protein utilization for growth in preruminant calves is decreasing with increasing body weight. In contrast to calves weighing less than 100 kg of body weight, <b>heavy</b> preruminant <b>calves</b> {{do not respond}} in protein retention to an increased intake of indispensable amino acids in dose-response studies. The marginal {{efficiency of}} protein utilization is low compared with pigs and milk-fed lambs at a similar stage of maturity. A reductionist approach was taken to perceive the potential mechanisms for the low protein utilization in preruminant calves. Neither an imbalance in the dietary protein to energy ratio nor a single limiting indispensable amino acid {{was responsible for the}} low efficiency. Also, amino acids were not specifically used to detoxify ammonia. Alternative hypotheses to explain the low efficiency are discussed and result in (i) a reduced post-absorptive supply of amino acids: e. g. by fermentation of milk in the (premature) rumen or preferential amino acid utilization by specific tissues; or (ii) a reduced post-absorptive amino acid utilization: e. g. by decreased insulin sensitivity, utilization of amino acids for gluconeogenesis or an asynchronous nutrient supply. In conclusion, several mechanisms for the low efficiency of protein utilization in <b>heavy</b> preruminant <b>calves</b> were excluded. Other physiological processes which are potentially involved remain to be studied, because the large potential for improving protein utilization in <b>heavy</b> preruminant <b>calves</b> asks for further exploration of their amino acid metabolis...|$|R

Second generation breed groups included cows sired by HB {{and out of}} HB dams (F 2 HB) and BH dams (HBxBH); and cows sired by BH and out of HB dams (BHxHB) and BH dams (F 2 BH). Least squares means were calculated for calf crop born, calf crop weaned, and calf birth and weaning weights, using numerous different models, where the trait was the dependent variable. Previous research and these preliminary analyses showed {{that the effects of}} year and cow age are real as is their interaction each other and with breed type. In each attempted model designed to remove these effects, different breed groups received excessive adjustments, rendering the resultant heterosis estimates inappropriate. To more clearly assess differences, presentation and visual evaluation of unadjusted means were conducted. The model for mature cow weight (cows at 6 years of age) included breed group as fixed effects and cow within breed group and year as random effects. F 2 cows appeared to retain approximately 39 % of F 1 heterosis for calf crop born and approximately 50 % for calf crop weaned.

The percentage of calves (calves/hinds proceeding year) was on average 79. 2 %. The newborn sex ratio was 1 : 1. There was a large range (1. 8 to 8. 5 kg) in the birth-weight of newborn calves; male calves weighed about 0. 3 kg more than female. The total loss of calves during summer and autumn was about 34. 5 % (range 6. 3 to 100. 0 %). During the calving period 111 calves (12. 2 %) died. They were usually younger than one day, and on average weighed 1. 3 kg less at birth than calves who lived until autumn. The hinds of calves dying very early were usually young and calving for the first time. The autumn-weight of hinds correlated significantly (r = 0. 49) with the birth-weight of their calves. Over- 5 -year-old and over 80 kg hinds bore the <b>heaviest</b> <b>calves</b> (mean weight 6. 3 kg) and the survival of these calves was very good. The first hinds to calve in the spring (calving up to 22. 5.) are 5 -year-old and older, which arc also the heaviest and produce the most vital calves...|$|R
40|$|Commercial cow/calf pairs (Angus based, n= 103) {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of calf weaning age on cow body weight and body condition score (scale= 1 to 9) and calf performance in terms of subcutaneous fat and marbling deposition. Only cows with male progeny (steers, n= 52; bulls, n= 51) were used in this study. Treatments were: 1) early-weaned bulls, 2) early-weaned steers, 3) traditionally weaned bulls, and 4) traditionally weaned steers. Cow/calf pairs grazed pastures at four different locations. Calving began February 1, 2003, and ended in early April. In the early-weaned treatment group, calves were weaned June 25, with an average age of 115 days. In the late-weaned treatment group, calves were weaned October 6, with an average age of 218 days. The data indicate that the cows in the early-weaned treatment group gained 121 lb more weight (P< 0. 0001), had 0. 13 inches more external backfat (P< 0. 0001), and had an average body condition score 1. 2 greater (P<. 0001) than their late-weaned counterparts. All steer calves were implanted before they entered the feedlot. Early weaning and subsequent feedlot placement produced <b>heavier</b> <b>calves</b> at approximately nine months of age. Ultrasound technology indicated that early-weaned calves had greater backfat and marbling scores 26 days after feedlot placement than did traditionally weaned calves. However, the early–weaned bulls had less backfat at a similar average weight to their steer contemporaries...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heavy</b> veal <b>calves</b> (4 – 6 months old) {{are at risk}} of {{developing}} insulin resistance and disturbed glucose homeostasis. Prolonged insulin resistance could lead to metabolic disorders and impaired growth performance. Recently, we discovered that <b>heavy</b> Holstein-Friesian <b>calves</b> raised on a high-lactose or high-fat diet did not differ in insulin sensitivity, that insulin sensitivity was low and 50 % of the calves could be considered insulin resistant. Understanding the patho-physiological mechanisms underlying insulin resistance and discovering biomarkers for early diagnosis would be useful for developing prevention strategies. Therefore, we explored plasma metabolic profiling techniques to build models and discover potential biomarkers and pathways that can distinguish between insulin resistant and moderately insulin sensitive veal calves. The calves (n = 14) were classified as insulin resistant (IR) or moderately insulin sensitive (MIS) based on results from a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, using a cut-off value (M/I-value 90 % and Q 2 Y > 66 %), which allowed discrimination between MIS and IR calves. A total of 7 and 20 metabolic features (for RP-LC-MS and HILIC-LC-MS respectively) were most responsible for group separation. Of these, 7 metabolites could putatively be identified that differed (P < 0. 05) between groups (potential biomarkers). Pathway analysis indicated disturbances in glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism, the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, and primary bile acid biosynthesis. These results demonstrate that plasma metabolic profiling can be used to identify insulin resistance in veal calves and can lead to underlying mechanisms. </p...|$|R
40|$|Little {{work has}} been {{conducted}} to compare maternal disposition scores assigned to a heifer/cow after calving, and if these scores remain stable over consecutive calvings. The objective of this trial {{was to determine if}} calf birth weight, sex, and the number of calvings affects the cows maternal disposition scores. The fall data set included observations from 406 calvings, which were pure Angus (n = 316), pure Simmental (n = 75), or crosses of the two breeds (n = 43). The spring data set included observations from 550 calvings, which were Angus (n = 253) or Simmental (n = 338). All calvings occurred on pasture. The data set included date and time of birth, birth weight (kg), sex of the calf, and a maternal disposition score. The maternal disposition score was based on the cow’s reaction to both the calf and human interaction. The scale used to score cows ranged from one through five and was created at the ISU beef farm. Data was analyzed using PROC GLIMMIX. There were no observed differences for disposition score in either season when cows birthed <b>heavier</b> <b>calves</b> (P 3 ̆e 0. 86), if the cow had a bull versus a heifer (P 3 ̆e 0. 50) or the number of calvings that they experienced (P 3 ̆e 0. 76). In conclusion, using this particular maternal disposition scoring, no observed changes in disposition score occurred with calf birth weight, calf sex or the number of calvings...|$|R
40|$|Genetic and {{environmental}} parameters for calf growth traits were determined from data collected over a 5 -year period at the Whatawhata Hill Country Research Station, Hamilton, using least squares mixed model procedures. From {{a total of}} 497 female and 46 O male calves sired by 29 Friesian bulls and from Friesian, Friesian-Jersey, Angus and Friesian-Angus dams, paternal half-sib heritability estimates were close to zero for both sexes of calf. Higher heritabilities were calculated by the same method using records from 179 female and 161 male straightbred Angus calves, the progeny of 17 bulls, and giving females first and males second were: birth weight, - 0. 14 and 0. 44; pre-weaning growth rate, 0. 19 and 0. 29; and weaning weight, 0. 25 and 0. 40. Because of large standard errors, the differences between calf sexes were not conclusive. Genetic correlations between birth weight and pre-weaning growth rate and birth weight and weaning weight calculated for the Angus males were 1. 06 and 1. 07, respectively, and the genetic correlations between pre-weaning; growth rate and weaning weight calculated for all individuals except the Friesian-sired female calves ranged from 0. 88 to 1. 06. Other genetic correlations were not obtained because negative sire components of varian. precluded tneir estimation. The ranges of the phenotypic correlations were: birth weight and pre-weaning growth rate, 0. 07 to 0. 43; birth weight and weaning weight; 0. 25 to 0. 61, and pre-weaning growth rate and weaning weight, 0. 85 to 0. 98. An investigation of Cow - calf weight relationships using 340 Angus and 404 Friesian cow - calf pairs showed that heavier Friesian cows gave birth to significantly <b>heavier</b> <b>calves,</b> such that every 10 kg increase in cow liveweight was associated with an approximate 0. 40 kg increase in calf birth weight. Regressions of weaning weight on dam liveweights showed that heavier Angus cows weaned significantly <b>heavier</b> male <b>calves</b> by approximately 0. 45 Kg per 10 kg increase in cow weight. The other associations for the remaining animals were considerably smaller and non-significant. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that where Friesian sires are used, genetic improvement in calf growth characters would be slow and less effective than in Angus cattle. The genetic parameters for the Angus breed compare favourably with the majority of published estimates while comparable findings for dairy breeds and dairy x beef crossbreds are few in number...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{synchronizing}} {{the availability}} of amino acids and glucose within a day on protein and energy metabolism were studied in <b>heavy</b> preruminant <b>calves.</b> Thirty-six preruminant calves (148 ± 1. 6 kg body weight) were assigned to 1 of 6 degrees of nutrient synchrony (SYN, 1 ¿ 6) and to 1 of 2 meal sequences (i. e., the high-protein meal {{in the morning or}} in the evening). Calves at SYN 1 received 2 balanced meals: one at 0600 and one at 1800. Nutrient synchrony decreased stepwise from SYN 1 to SYN 6 in which calves received 85 % of the daily protein supply in 1 meal. The digestible energy intakes at 0600 and 1800 were equal between treatments. Daily intakes of all nutrients and dietary ingredients were identical for all treatments. Calves were housed individually in respiration chambers. Apparent fecal nutrient digestibility and nitrogen and energy balances were measured. Apparent nutrient digestibility decreased when > 71 % of the dietary protein was fed in one meal. Nutrient synchrony did not affect the efficiency of digestible protein utilization in calves at a identical digestible nutrient intake. Heat production decreased from 691 to 629 kJ/(kg 0. 75 ·d) (P < 0. 05) and energy retained as fat increased from 116 to 184 kJ/(kg 0. 75 · d) (P < 0. 01) with decreasing nutrient synchrony. Meal sequence did not affect any of the traits. In conclusion, synchronizing {{the availability of}} amino acids and glucose within a day did not increase the efficiency of protein utilization but substantially decreased fat retention in <b>heavy</b> preruminant <b>calves...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of feeding frequency (FF) and feeding level (FL) on protein and energy metabolism in adapted, <b>heavy</b> preruminant <b>calves.</b> It was hypothesized that an increased FF would increase protein utilization by an improved synchrony between the supply of and requirements for protein during the day when a quickly hydrolyzable protein source was used. Eighteen Holstein Friesian calves of 136 ± 3 kg of body weight were assigned to FF (1, 2, or 4 meals daily) at 2 FL (1. 5 or 2. 5 times the metabolizable energy requirements for maintenance), except for calves fed once daily (only at a low FL). Calves were individually housed in respiration chambers during 2 experimental periods of 10 d. Whey protein was the only protein source in the diet. Neither FL nor FF affected apparent fecal nutrient digestibility. Increasing FF increased the efficiency with which digestible protein was utilized in calves. The increase was greater at a high FL (+ 11 % from 2 to 4 meals/d) than at a low FL (+ 5 % from 2 to 4 meals/d), but no significant interaction occurred between FL and FF. An increased FF and a higher FL enhanced fat deposition. Heat production was not affected by FF, but its circadian rhythm differed considerably between FF. Activity-related heat production was not affected by FF or FL. Thus, increasing FF improved the efficiency with which protein and energy were utilized in <b>heavy</b> preruminant <b>calves</b> when a quickly hydrolyzable protein source was used...|$|R
40|$|Reproductive {{success is}} the most {{important}} factor in beef cattle production and is affected by timing of pubertal onset in heifers, and reproductive biotechnologies utilized. Three studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of pubertal status, ADG, and 2 fixed time AI protocols on reproductive success in beef heifers. In the first study, heifers that were pubertal prior to breeding had a greater AI and overall pregnancy rate; produced more calves born within the first 21 d of the calving season; and weaned older, <b>heavier</b> <b>calves</b> than non-pubertal heifers. Additionally, heifers that had ≥ 2 estrous cycles, prior to the first breeding season, had a greater second season pregnancy rate than those heifers that had 0 or 1 estrous cycles prior to the first breeding season. In the second study, as ADG increased leading up to breeding the odds of attaining puberty increased for Gudmundsen Sandhills Laboratory heifers. For West Central Research and Extension Center heifers, as ADG increased the odds of puberty attainment decreased. Odds of pregnancy were affected by BW gain and pubertal status interaction; however, pubertal status had the greatest influence on increasing the odds of pregnancy. In the third study, 2 progestin-based fixed time AI protocols, MGA and 14 -d CIDR, were compared to evaluate pregnancy rates. Fixed time AI pregnancy rate and final pregnancy rate was similar between MGA and 14 -d CIDR. An economic analysis suggested synchronizing heifers with MGA was a more cost-effective treatment.

40|$|Cow-calf {{prices are}} {{determined}} by interaction of many factors. At a particular auction, cow-calf pair prices often had a range of 75 % of the mean price. This variability suggests that producers need to be informed regarding cow-calf price determinants. This study uses auction data during 1993 to estimate price differentials associated with cow-calf pair characteristics using a hedonic model. Cow breed, age, health, conditions, horns, frame, and whether the cow had been bred back were significant price determinants. Calf weight, health, and frame had significant price impacts. Highest prices were paid for pens containing 9 - 12 pairs of young Angus, dehorned, bred back, healthy cows with <b>heavy</b> healthy <b>calves.</b> Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heavy</b> veal <b>calves</b> (4 - 6 mo old) often develop {{problems}} with insulin sensitivity. This {{could lead to}} metabolic disorders and impaired animal growth performance. Studies in various animal species {{have shown that the}} supplementation of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (scFOS) can improve insulin sensitivity. We therefore studied the effects of scFOS supplementation on insulin sensitivity in <b>heavy</b> veal <b>calves.</b> Forty male Holstein-Friesian calves (BW = 190 ± 2. 9 kg; age = 162 ± 1. 4 d {{at the start of the}} trial) were fed either a control milk replacer (MR) diet or a diet in which one-third of the lactose was replaced by glucose, fructose, or glycerol for 10 wk prior to the start of the trial. At the start of the trial, calves were subjected to a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test to assess whole-body insulin sensitivity (muscle and hepatic insulin sensitivity). Calves within each dietary treatment group were ranked based on their insulin sensitivity value. Half of the calves received scFOS (12 mg/kg of BW) with the MR for 6 wk (supplementation was equally distributed over the insulin sensitivity range). Subsequently, a second frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test was conducted to assess the effect of scFOS. In addition, fasting plasma levels of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol were determined to calculate the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and triglyceride:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (fasting indicators of insulin sensitivity). Whole-body insulin sensitivity was low at the start of the trial and remained low in all groups [1. 0 ± 0. 1 and 0. 8 ± 0. 1 (mU/L) - 1 · min - 1 on average, respectively]. Supplementation of scFOS did not improve insulin sensitivity in any of the treatment groups. The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index and the triglyceride:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio also did not differ between scFOS and non-scFOS calves and averaged 0. 326 ± 0. 003 and 0. 088 ± 0. 004, respectively, at the end of the trial. We conclude that scFOS supplementation does not improve insulin sensitivity in <b>heavy</b> veal <b>calves</b> regardless of the carbohydrate composition of the MR. This is in contrast to other animals (e. g., dogs and horses), where scFOS supplementation did improve insulin sensitivity. The absence of an effect of scFOS might be related to the dosage or to metabolic differences between ruminants and nonruminants. Increasing evidence indicates that dietary interventions in veal calves have little or no effect on insulin sensitivity, possibly because of low levels of insulin sensitivity. </p...|$|R
