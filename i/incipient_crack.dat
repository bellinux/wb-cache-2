In such models, damage is balanced by “healing”, or the temperature and pressure-driven dynamic recrystallization of smaller grains into larger ones. If the reduction of grain size (damage) is intensely localized in a stagnant lid, an <b>incipient</b> <b>crack</b> in the mantle can turn into a full-blown rift, initiating plate tectonics. Conversely, a high surface temperature will have more efficient lithospheric healing, which is another potential explanation for why Venus has a stagnant lid and Earth does not.|$|E
40|$|A {{probabilistic}} method {{to predict the}} crack formation in polycrystalline materials with a random microstructure under cyclic loading is developed. In particular, transgranular crack growth in 3 D grain structures generated randomly by the Voronoï process is considered. The potential crack extension planes in the individual grains are dependent on the different grain orientations and the crystal structure of the considered material. Under cyclic loading fatigue cracks initiate and propagate along the slip planes of the crystal structure. For this reason, an energy-based criterion is used in order to describe the successive material damage under cyclic loading which is completely projected into the crack extension planes and finally causes the crack propagation. Subsequently, the computation of the crack path {{in a number of}} randomly generated grain structure models provides a raw data base in order to determine probability distributions of the number of cycles up to a pre-defined crack depth. As an input for many fracture mechanics evaluation concepts which are based on an assumed <b>incipient</b> <b>crack</b> depth, the number of cycles and the corresponding scatter band width up to a postulated <b>incipient</b> <b>crack</b> depth is of great interest...|$|E

Focusing on this challenge, a new approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is proposed for multicrack localization in rotors. A two-disc rotor-bearing system with breathing cracks is established by the finite element method and simulated sensors are distributed along the rotor to obtain the steady-state transverse responses required by POD. Based on the discontinuities introduced in the proper orthogonal modes (POMs) at the locations of cracks, the characteristic POM (CPOM), which is sensitive to crack locations and robust to noise, is selected for cracks localization. Instead of using the CPOM directly, due to its difficulty to localize <b>incipient</b> <b>cracks,</b> damage indexes using fractal dimension (FD) and gapped smoothing method (GSM) are adopted, in order to extract the locations more efficiently.

40|$|Modern {{engineering}} materials, such as concrete, composites (nano-composites), and functionally graded materials, contain {{large amount}} of internal interfaces which are either coherent (interfaces separating different components of the material) or incoherent (faces of micro-cracks or micro-voids). This type of material characteristic is also very common in biomaterials, such as bones, tissues etc. These interfaces usually serve as the sites of catastrophic failure in applications.

The problem of evaluating the severity of FOD and the induced reduction of component life was investigated in the laboratory, by reproducing the damage conditions accurately and subjecting the impacted blade to fatigue loading simulating the service conditions. One particular aspect of post-FOD analysis focuses on the evaluation of residual stresses {{in the vicinity of}} the notch.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the fatigue}} design of rails in the {{transition}} from bridge to abutment is examined. The current fatigue design of rail systems is carried out with simplifying assumptions concerning the stresses in the rail. Thus, the determination of a fatigue endurance limit is done with stresses based on the Smith-Diagram. By applying this means of design, the assumption is made that there are mainly normal stresses in a rail. Those may originate from changes in temperature, accelerating or slowing down of the trains as well as bending stresses caused by the passing of trains. Horizontal components of the load (from the train's sine run, lateral shift of bridges or the cant of curves) are not considered in this design format. At the same time, specimens in fatigue tests with pulsing vertical loads regularly show unexpected and inexplicable cracks {{at the edge of}} the rail foot and a huge scatter of the results. In cases of rail breaks the location of the <b>incipient</b> <b>crack</b> is not necessarily in the cross section's area with the largest tensile stresses, but can be shifted to areas of smaller tensile stress (e. g. the edge of the rail foot).

This paper presents an approach to evaluate the importance and priorities of the named influencing factors and criteria on the fatigue design of rails by means of fracture mechanics.

First, the fluid distribution within the cooling jacket has been deeply investigated, in order to point out critical aspects of the current jacket layout and propose modified gaskets aiming at modifying the coolant path and increasing the cooling performance. A new generation polyhedral grid has been employed to combine high resolution surface spacing, computational demand, and numerical stability of the CFD simulations. Different turbulence models and near-wall approaches have been tested in order to accurately predict the boundary layer behaviour, which is fundamental for the subsequent thermal analysis. Comparisons {{have been carried out}} between the different gasket layouts in terms of both cylinder to cylinder flow balancing and cooling effectiveness in the critical regions of the engine head. At a second stage, the CFD model has been extended to the whole engine head, i. e. covering both the cooling jacket and the metal cast, and heat flux distribution on the fluid/solid interface has been computed and transferred as a boundary condition to a structural finite elements code for the analysis of the fatigue strength of the component.

The pressure load, with speeds exceeding 2 km/s, {{can be characterized as}} a pressure peak (ranging from 2 to 6 MPa) followed by an expansion wave. The unique combination of this particular traveling load and tube geometry produced fracture data not available before in the open literature. Experimental data of this type are useful for studying the fluid-structure-fracture interaction and various crack curving and branching phenomena, and also for validation for multi-physics and multi-scale modeling. Axial surface flaws were introduced to control the crack initiation site. Fracture threshold models were developed by combining a static fracture model and an extensively studied dynamic amplification factor for tubes under internal traveling loads. Experiments were also performed on hydrostatically loaded preflawed aluminum 6061 -T 6 tubes for comparison. Significantly different fracture behavior was observed and the difference was explained by fluid dynamics and energy considerations. The experiments yielded comparison on crack speeds, strain, and pressure histories. In other experiments, the specimens were also pre-torqued to control the propagation direction of the cracks. Measurements were made on the detonation velocity, strain history, blast pressure from the crack opening, and crack speeds. The curved crack paths were digitized. The Chapman-Jouguet pressure, initial axial flaw length, and torsion level were varied to obtain different crack patterns. The <b>incipient</b> <b>crack</b> kinking angle was found to be consistent with fracture under mixed-mode loading. High-speed movies of the fracture events and blast wave were taken and these were used in interpreting the quantitative data.

40|$|During {{recent years}} it has been {{observed}} an increasing attention to the shrinkage of concrete by considering it as an action that cannot be neglected in structural design. In fact, the distance between the joints of the buildings or walls depends significantly on the shrinkage of the material. In design of floors, the shrinkage is the main cause of cracking that has generated numerous disputes between customers and manufacturers. Shrinkage makes cracks when some restraint prevents the free deformation of concrete. Therefore, the risk of shrinkage cracking should be evaluated through restrained shrinkage tests since free shrinkage tests are not representative. National technical codes and international experimental investigations of drying shrinkage of concrete, do not provide direct information on the risk of cracking when the material is subjected to boundary conditions. In fact, the reference standard method for the evaluation of the cracking risk is based on the so-called "ring test" (ASTM C 1581) which, however, mainly detects the time of <b>incipient</b> <b>cracking</b> in concrete but does not provide direct measures of the cracking risk or indications on the behavior of post-cracking material failure.

An examination of the pavement and a few cores from the cracked areas {{was made by the}} I. S. H. C. Materials Department and later by David Stark of the P. C. A. Additional surveys were conducted on other concrete pavement made with coarse aggregate from similar rock from two different sources. Blue-line cracking was found on some primary pavement and the indications of <b>incipient</b> <b>cracks</b> were seen on I- 29 in Pottawattamie County, north of Council Bluffs. A good "D"-crack pattern is now evident. Surveys were then made of the entire Interstate concrete pavement. No other sections of Interstate were "D"-cracking, although some sections showed joint discoloration. None of these pavements, including the discolored sections, contained "D"-crack associated aggregates. At {{the same time as the}} Interstate survey additional pavements and sources were checked. Some "D"-cracking was noticed on certain sections of primary pavement 5 - 10 years old, in the vicinity of Waterloo and Cedar Rapids. The "D"-cracked pavement was from three aggregate sources, the Newton, Otis, and Burton Ave. quarries. Other pavements in this area that were older or from· different· coarse aggregate sources were not "D"-cracked. We believe that all the "D"-cracking is related, although dedolomitization is probably involved in the intermediate dolomite rocks...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{drop-weight}} test {{is taken}} as a convenient basis for assessing the fidelity and predictive ability of cohesive models of fracture in applications involving dynamic crack growth. In the experimental phase of the study, coherent gradient sensing (CGS) {{has been used to}} study dynamic fracture in C 300 maraging steel. The specimens were subjected to three-point bend impact loading under a drop weight tower. High-speed photographs of the CGS interferograms were analyzed to determine the crack tip location, the velocity and the dynamic fracture toughness as a function of time. Post-mortem examination of the specimens revealed the fractography of the fracture surfaces, including the development of shear lips. In a parallel numerical phase of the study, fracture has been modeled by recourse to an irreversible cohesive law embedded into cohesive elements. These cohesive elements govern all aspects of the separation and closure of the <b>incipient</b> <b>cracks.</b> The cohesive behavior of the material is assumed to be rate independent. The finite element model is three dimensional and consists of quadratic ten-noded tetrahedra. The numerical simulations have proven highly predictive of a number of observed features, including: the crack growth initiation time; the trajectory of the propagating crack tip; and the formation of shear lips near the lateral surfaces. The simulations therefore establish the feasibility of using cohesive models of fracture and cohesive elements to predict dynamic crack-growth initiation and propagation in three dimensions. 7 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
