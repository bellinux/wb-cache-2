We see this in different organisms, which when placed under similar conditions vary in a different manner, whilst closely-allied organisms under <b>dissimilar</b> <b>conditions</b> often vary in nearly the same manner.

60|$|It {{has been}} remarked that a growing {{diversity}} between twins may be {{ascribed to the}} tardy development of naturally diverse qualities; {{but we have a}} right, upon the evidence I have received, to go farther than this. We have seen that a few twins retain their close resemblance through life; in other words, instances do exist of an apparently thorough similarity of nature, in which such difference of external circumstances as may be consistent with the ordinary conditions of the same social rank and country do not create dissimilarity. Positive evidence, such as this, cannot be outweighed by any amount of negative evidence. Therefore, in those cases where there is a growing diversity, and where no external cause can be assigned either by the twins themselves or by their family for it, we may feel sure that it must be chiefly or altogether due to a want of thorough similarity in their nature. Nay, further, in some cases it is distinctly affirmed that the growing dissimilarity can be accounted for in no other way. We may, therefore, broadly conclude that the only circumstance, within the range of those by which persons of similar conditions of life are affected, that is capable of producing a marked effect on the character of adults, is illness or some accident which causes physical infirmity. The twins who closely resembled each other in childhood and early youth, and were reared under not very <b>dissimilar</b> <b>conditions,</b> either grow unlike through the development of natural characteristics which had lain dormant at first, or else they continue their lives, keeping time like two watches, hardly to be thrown out of accord except by some physical jar. Nature is far stronger than Nurture within the limited range that I have been careful to assign to the latter.|$|E

40|$|Are manual {{gestures}} {{affected by}} inner speech? This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} phonological form influences gesture by investigating whether phonological similarity between words that describe motion gestures creates interference for production of those gestures {{in the absence of}} overt speech. Participants learned to respond to a picture of a bottle by gesturing to open the bottle’s cap, and to a picture of long hair by gesturing to twirl the hair. In one condition, the gestures were introduced with phonologically-similar labels “twist” and “twirl” (similar condition), while in the other condition, they were introduced with phonologically-dissimilar labels “unscrew” and “twirl” (<b>dissimilar</b> <b>condition).</b> During the actual experiment, labels were not produced and participants only gestured by looking at pictures. In both conditions, participants also gestured to a control pair that was used as a baseline. Participants made significantly more errors on gestures in the similar than <b>dissimilar</b> <b>condition</b> after correction for baseline differences. This finding shows the influence of phonology on gesture production in the absence of overt speech and poses new constraints on the locus of the interaction between language and gesture systems...|$|R

40|$|Indignation is a {{discrete}} social emotion specifying disapproval of a blameworthy action explicitly perceived as violating the objective order, and implicitly perceived as injurious to the self-concept. Two experiments {{were conducted to}} examine the effects of defensive attributions and implicit theories of moral character on indignation. Both studies attempted to influence the defensive attribution process by manipulating apparent similarity between participants and an imagined offender while exploring the relationship between people's implicit theories about moral character (ITM) and measures indicative of indignation. Two implicit attribution theory perspectives were examined: Entity theorists believe that personal moral attributes are fixed and unchanging, while incremental theorists believe that personal moral attributes are malleable. Entity theorists, who tend to base their attributions on internal characterological dispositional information, were hypothesized to show greater indignation after offensive episodes than incremental theorists, who prefer to use more external situation-relevant information in forming their attributions. Subjects in the similar conditions were expected to form more defensive attributions than those in the <b>dissimilar</b> <b>conditions,</b> thus a second hypothesis predicted that those in the similar conditions would show greater indignation after offensive episodes than those in the <b>dissimilar</b> <b>conditions.</b> Study 1 used a computer program to manipulate certain aspects of similarity while designating subjects as either entity or incremental theorists based on their responses to three ITM scale measures. It revealed a positive correlation between the presence of an entity theory and the experience of indignation. Study 2, using a cognitive response set induction to operationalize similarity while experimentally manipulating ITM, provides evidence for a causal relationship between ITM and indignation. As predicted, entity theorists in both studies responded with significantly higher levels of indignation after offensive episodes than did incremental theorists. Only modest support was found for an hypothesized relationship involving defensive attribution and indignation...|$|E

40|$|Abnormal fear {{responding}} to threat cues {{may contribute to}} the aetiology and maintenance of persistent fears and pathological anxiety. Chronic anxiety may also involve abnormal fear {{responding to}} 'safety' cues, which do not signal danger. Yet investigations of fear responding to acquired safety cues are scarce and the basis of such responding remains unclear. Moreover, previous studies do not distinguish between stimulus generalization (an associative mechanism based on perceptual similarity between threat and safety cues) and sensitization (a non-associative mechanism whereby fear responses to any novel, intense, or fear-related stimulus are temporarily elevated). This study investigated responses to acquired safety cues in volunteers with varying trait anxiety, using a novel fear conditioning paradigm designed to distinguish between effects of trait anxiety on generalization and sensitization. The paradigm used three conditioned stimuli: a threat cue (CS+) and two safety cues (CS-), one perceptually similar to the CS+ and one perceptually <b>dissimilar.</b> <b>Conditioned</b> fear to these cues was indexed by fear potentiation of the startle blink reflex, skin conductance responses, and self-report. To examine how trait anxiety moderated responses to safety cues, participants were divided into high and low trait anxiety subgroups. Startle, skin conductance, and self-reported fear measures indicated that generalization of fear occurred for the safety cue which resembled the threat cue, but not for the perceptually dissimilar safety cue, consistent with the stimulus generalization hypothesis. There was some evidence that stimulus generalization was exaggerated in anxious individuals. The current study sheds light on the mechanism by which fear responses to safety cues arise in healthy individuals, and offers some insight into the influence of this mechanism in chronic anxiety. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012...|$|R

New words were tested under two conditions: perceptually similar (presented in studied fonts) or perceptually dissimilar (presented in novel fonts). There were two old adult groups and one young adult group. Each word in the study phase was presented twice, randomly spaced apart to one old adult group (old-spaced-repetition) and the other (old non-repetition) received identical encoding condition to the young group, which involved each word at the study phase being shown only one time. The old-spaced-repetition group was included as a control group. Kornell, Castel, Eich, and Bjork, (2010) found that both young and old adults benefitted from spaced-repetition at the study phase. Therefore, if levels of hits between young and old-spaced-repetition groups were comparable and if levels of false alarms for the old non-repetition group were higher than the young group, the current study would find clear effects of perceptual similarity on false alarms in normal cognitive ageing. However, the current study found no effect of perceptual similarity on normal cognitive ageing. This result illustrated that levels of false alarms between young, old-spaced-repetition and old non-repetition groups were comparable. This appeared to suggest that false alarms in old adults were not driven by general (gist) perceptual information (Koutstaal, Reddy, Jackson, Prince, Cendan, & Schacter, 2003). There was a significant effect of conditions on false alarms. Levels of false alarm for perceptually similar condition were higher than perceptually <b>dissimilar</b> <b>condition.</b> However, there was no reliable interaction between groups and conditions. Overall, these findings appeared to suggest that young as well as old adults mistakenly accepted new words as old words when they were perceptually similar to studied words...|$|R

40|$|Received; {{accepted}} Context. Modern solar X-ray imagers did not breakthrough {{the problem}} of detailed diagnostics of faint hard X-ray sources {{in the presence of}} stronger ones. This is the case of the impulsive phase of solar flares in which footpoint sources are usually stronger than loop-top ones. Aims. For this aim, flares being partially occulted by the solar limb, are the best reservoir of our knowledge about hard X-ray loop-top sources. Recently, the survey of partially occulted flares observed by the RHESSI has been published (Krucker & Lin 2008). The extensive Yohkoh database still awaits such activities. This work is an attempt to fill this gap. Methods. Among from 1286 flares in the Yohkoh Hard X-ray Telescope Flare Catalogue (Sato et al. 2006), for which the hard X-ray images had been enclosed, we identified 98 events that occurred behind the solar limb. We investigated their hard X-ray spectra and spatial structure. Results. We found that in most cases the hard X-ray spectrum of partially occulted flares consists of two components, non-thermal and thermal, which are co-spatial. The photon energy spectra of the partially occulted flares are systematically steeper than spectra of the non-occulted flares. Such a difference we explain as a consequence of intrinsically <b>dissimilar</b> <b>conditions</b> ruling in coronal parts of flares, in comparison with the footpoints which usually dominate the hard X-ray emission of disk flares.

Estimation of clinical effectiveness was done by using decision modeling. The model developed informed funding recommendations and ultimately led to an agreement with the manufacturer allowing funding of idursulfase in Ontario. ConclusionsThis policy framework attempts to address the policy challenges of funding drugs for {{rare diseases}}.

30|$|Transfer theory {{originates}} in psychology and educational theory and considers {{the transfer of}} knowledge attained by learning in prior settings to subsequent, similar situations. In order to distinguish this from knowledge transfer, Ellis et al. (2011 : 1261) stress that “[t]ransfer theory concerns intraperson (or intragroup or intraorganizational) transfer of practices and routines.” Thorndike and Woodworth (1901) originated the theory of identical elements, implying that the transfer of learning depends on the proportion to which the learning situation and the new situation have similar characteristics. If {{the conditions of the}} learning situation and the subsequent situation are similar, generalization—which means the application of experience—leads to positive transfer effects and, thus, positive outcomes (Finkelstein and Haleblian 2002; Haleblian and Finkelstein 1999; Hearst and Koresko 1968). If conditions are dissimilar, generalization leads to negative transfer effects. This might be the case especially when situations are at first glance recognized as similar, but are structurally different (Finkelstein and Haleblian 2002; Haleblian and Finkelstein 1999; Novick 1988). Discrimination of experience—which means the non-application of experience—normally leads to neutral or no transfer effects. In the case of <b>dissimilar</b> <b>conditions,</b> this is the correct behavior, {{but in the case of}} similar conditions, this behavior is inappropriate; it may lead to the repetition of prior mistakes (Haleblian and Finkelstein 1999) or at least be inefficient. Therefore, the similarity and dissimilarity of prior and focal situations is crucial for transfer effects.|$|E
40|$|The Image {{binarization}} plays a {{vital role}} in text segmentation which is used in OCR application. Binarization of text in degraded images is a challenging task due to the variations in size, color and font of the text and the results be often affected by complex backgrounds, <b>dissimilar</b> lighting <b>conditions,</b> reflections and shadow. A robust solution to this problem can significantly enhance the precision of scene text recognition algorithms leading to a variety of applications such as scene understanding, navigation, automatic localization and image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel method to extract and binarize text as of images that contains complex background. We apply an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based technique to map out the text region, which is uniform in nature, while removing specularity, shadows and reflections, which are included in the background. This algorithm works better on images with different degradations. We implement our method on various DIBCO datasets...|$|R
40|$|Observing {{an action}} {{activates}} action representations in the motor system. Moreover, the representations of manipulable objects are {{closely linked to}} the motor systems at a functional and neuroanatomical level. Here, we investigated whether action observation can facilitate object recognition using an action priming paradigm. As prime stimuli we presented short video movies showing hands performing an action in interaction with an object (where the object itself was always removed from the video). The prime movie was followed by a (briefly presented) target object affording motor interactions that are either similar (congruent <b>condition)</b> or <b>dissimilar</b> (incongruent <b>condition)</b> to the prime action. Participants had to decide whether an object name shown after the target picture corresponds with the picture or not (pictureword matching task). We found superior accuracy for primetarget pairs with congruent as compared to incongruent actions across two experiments. Thus, action observation can facilitate recogni tion of a manipulable object typically involving a similar action. This action priming effect supports the notion that action representations play a functional role in object recognition...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} explore the nature of verbal {{repetition}} deficits and infer the cognitive systems involved in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A total of 63 patients (13 semantic variant (sv-PPA), 17 nonfluent/agrammatic variant (nfv-PPA), 10 logopenic variant (lv-PPA), 23 AD) and 13 matched healthy controls completed a battery of tests that included naming, word comprehension, digit span, repetition of multisyllabic single words, monosyllabic word span presented under similar and <b>dissimilar</b> phonological <b>conditions,</b> and sentence repetition. All patient groups displayed some level of impairment, however, specific patterns emerged in each variant. Participants with sv-PPA were the least impaired, showing marginal difficulties exclusively for sentence repetition, whereas those with lv-PPA had the worst overall performance. Cases with nfv-PPA showed compromised repetition of multisyllabic and phonologically similar words. The deficit in cases with AD was confined to span tasks. These distinctive patterns of language impairments can assist in the differential diagnosis of PPA variants and point toward the vulnerability of specific cognitive systems in each syndrome. 11 page(s...|$|R
