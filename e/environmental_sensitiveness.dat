Infrastructure Projects (a) Projects to create industrial zones [...] ) of this Decree shall be submitted to an EIA in the manner laid down by this law, as the environmental body with local jurisdiction shall decide. This decision shall be reasoned and published in accordance with the criteria established in Annex III.” Further, Article 1(3) of the same Law contains an alternative provision stating that “That established in the above paragraph shall not apply to those projects for which the regulations of the Autonomous Communities, in the exercise of their competences, either require an EIA or in any case, establish thresholds in accordance with the criteria of Annex 3, to determine when such projects must be subject to an EIA.” In spite of this, the Port Authority has no such EIA for the overall Project to convert a substantial part or all of the Port Extension Zone into an industrial zone. No such EIA (for the creation of the whole zone, that is, all the cement projects, the biodiesel industrial production factory, the liquid fertilizer industrial production plant together), and in the absence of such an overall assessment it can only be assumed that no reasoned and published decision based on the criteria established by Annex III (which explicitly requires taking into account characteristics of the projects such as the size of the project, the overall effect in addition to other projects, pollution and other negative impacts, the risk of accidents, with special consideration of clouds of dust particles suspended in the air. In regard to the siting of projects for the creation of industrial zones, Annex III stipulates that the <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitiveness</b> of the geographical areas that might be affected by the projects shall be taken into account, in particular, the current use of the zone, with special attention to be paid to: coastal areas (as in the case of the Port of Alicante), nature reserves and parks (as in the case of the nearby Site of Community Interest, the Island of Tabarca, recognised by the European Commission) for its enormous environmental importance, areas of great democratic density (like the residential neighbourhoods of Alicante right next to the zone) and zones of historical and cultural interest (such as the coastal landscape of Alicante). This beautiful coastal landscape is also protected by the European Landscape Convention 2000, Spanish Law 4/2004 of the Autonomous Region of the Communidad of Valencia and European Directive 92/43/EEC.Alicante Port Authority’s President has replied that the construction of the cement dust mega-silos was decided in 1992, although this was not mentioned in the previous President’s declarations to the press in December 2006. The new President, Campos, has stated that the number of new silos is negotiable but insists that a minimum height of 12 m for the various mega-silos is technically necessary merely for the trucks to be able to drive underneath for the vertical loading of the cement dust. On top of this height, he has stated, sit the silos themselves (currently 8 m high on Quay 14 of Alicante Port). Against what the Port says is this “technically necessary height” of a total of 20 m, the residents say that the silos need only be raised some 4 or 5 m from the ground in order to vertically unload into trucks, and adding the 8 m high silos above this would give a total of some 12 m, within the general height restrictions of the Port, and would allow the re-siting of the four silos on Quay 14 with the minimum visual and environmental (including noise, cement dust and traffic) impact.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to define}} the meaning of {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) {{in the context of}} the European framework and examine three different European countries. The main elements which encompass the meaning of CSR focus on activities with social and <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitiveness,</b> on a voluntary basis. The paper analyses the dimensions of CSR and presents its benefits. Furthermore, the paper provides a brief description of the recent CSR activities in the European Union, and attempts a comparative analysis of CSR activities and their respective impacts on three European countries: Greece; Denmark; and Hungary. Finally, the paper concludes that the effective implementation of CSR strategy cannot follow strict rules and should be adjusted to the culture, needs and particularities of each country. © 2010 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
40|$|This {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} public perception on coastal sea waters and coastal pollution at Atakum and Atakent(Samsun). Fort his purpose, the suvey questionnaire was applied at June 2006 to 100, at July 2007 to 45 householder and data were collected from them by direct interviewing. The majority(62 %) of respondents indicated that at their vicinity the most important problem is coastal sea water pollution. 76 percent of the respondents thought sewerage is the most important factor at coastal sea water pollution. Only 27 % of respondents indicated that Primary school, Secondary school and Higher education was their main source of <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitiveness</b> and consciousness. According to questionnaire results, it was also found that the many of people seemed to have positive information and suggests on the environment but it is insufficient at practical life...|$|E

Marketing segmentation, as first step of the STP process, is significant to reach this goal. However, the environment is currently followed by technical and technological innovation, the state of the natural environment is alarming. Since that fact, there is a place for new segmentation related to <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitiveness,</b> the interest and motivation for purchasing green products. In Slovakia, there is no official segmentation. This paper is ambitious to propose it based on questionnaire survey that was randomly mailed to inhabitants in Slovakia. The results are compared with Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Therefore, it explores the relation between results of questionnaire and official Hoftede's score. In addition, papers contains of several developed research questions that are tested by statistical methods. To sum up, article recommends marketing strategy for green product placement and type of credible and responsible communication policy...|$|E
40|$|In certain {{plausible}} circumstances, {{the introduction}} of labelling schemes can lead to adverse effects. In the case of ecolabelling, the adverse effects are an environmental degradation rather than an environmental improvement. To {{take into account the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitiveness</b> or responsiveness of consumers, we introduce the concept of environmental elasticity which enables us to classify goods. In a basic analytical model, we describe the conditions under which different outcomes –overall impacts of change in environmental quality due to environmental labelling– arise after {{the introduction of}} an ecolabelling scheme. We show that an ecolabelling scheme can lead to an increase in purchases of environmentally sustainable products. The net effect on the environment can be worse than the initial situation without ecolabelling, because the environmental unit improvement is compensated by an overconsumption. We suggest several tests to detect this potential perverse effect, some policy implications to avoid it and stress the need for further research...|$|E

However, those studies which involved students practical experiences, conducted in educational context with a participatory approach can be subject to argument. One of the processes which is involved raising, particularly primary school pupils <b>environmental</b> <b>sensitiveness</b> is raising students environmental. Bringing out students’ creative thinking abilities as well as raising their awareness concerning the recycling of the waste material is vital. The main {{purpose of the present study}} is, to evaluate the contribution of the musical instrument to raising students’ environmental awareness as part of the ECO Schools Project. This study is a qualitative study and a semi structured interview form was used to gather data. The form was developed by the researcher. Content analysis method was used to analyze research data. The samples of this study consisted 20 students. The results o the study revealed students’ development in terms of environmental awareness and how students produced and played instruments with other waste materials...|$|E
