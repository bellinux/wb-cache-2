50|$|Microwave heating, as {{distinct}} from RF heating, is a sub-category of dielectric heating at frequencies above 100 MHz, where an electromagnetic wave can be launched from a small dimension emitter and guided through space to the target. Modern microwave ovens make use of electromagnetic waves with electric fields of much higher frequency and shorter wavelength than RF heaters. Typical <b>domestic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens</b> operate at 2.45 GHz, but 915 MHz ovens also exist. This means that the wavelengths employed in microwave heating are 10−1 to 10 cm.

However, the environmental benefit {{which could have been}} achieved from the low carbon nature of AAFA is often offset by the higher energy consumption from thermal curing. Since microwave heating is usually considered as a low-energy and low-carbon heating method, some pilot attempts {{have been made in the}} literature to cure AAFA with <b>domestic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens.</b> However, due to the lack of control on the temperature and humidity in <b>domestic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens,</b> splashing of fresh AAFA pastes and microcracks of hardened AAFA are two main reasons causing the unsatisfactory performance of microwave cured AAFA. In this study, a custom-made microwave oven equipped with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control was employed to cure AAFA samples. The microwave power was automatically regulated through the real-time temperature feedback from the fibre Bragg grating (FBG) sensor embedded in the AAFA sample. The microwave curing regime consisted of four curing stages at four different temperatures, namely 65 oC, 85 oC, 105 oC and 125 oC.

The system consists of an impedance analyzer, a high-temperature coaxial cable, a high-temperature coaxial probe, a micro-climatic chamber and a metal sample holder.

Both dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor rapidly increased from - 20 °C to 0 °C.

40|$|A {{series of}} biomass wastes from Malaysia known as Malaysian wood pellets, and rubberwood were {{employed}} in the present work. Using these materials as the feedstock, two different heating techniques; external heating by means of conventional slow pyrolysis (SP) and volumetric heating by means of microwave pyrolysis (MP) were carried out. Two distinct temperatures; 500 °C and 800 °C were used. The main objective was to characterise both the microwave-pyrolysed products and slow pyrolysed products including the influence of temperature so as to compare and contrast in terms of yield, and composition of the char, oil and high-value fuel gas (H 2) or syngas (H 2 +CO). Whilst there is an increasing interest in comparing microwave pyrolysis with conventional pyrolysis, {{much of the research}} work done in the past focussed on using <b>domestic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens</b> with power control features where indirect temperature measurements were carried out at different power and time settings. In the present research, the control feature for both heating techniques is similar, where the user can conveniently set the desired pyrolysis temperature and therefore, this would allow for a more direct and reliable comparison of products obtained from conventional pyrolysis and microwave pyrolysis. The research found that the use of the microwave oven system to conduct pyrolysis boosted the production of oil but reduced the total gas yield. The char proportion also reduced when microwave heating method was applied. This research also revealed that the configuration of the microwave oven with mode stirrer and bottom-fed waveguide that produces a cyclic controlled output power of 1000 W at any set temperature has yielded different results when compared to previous studies and so provides a new understanding for the microwave pyrolysis community. The results demonstrated that the microwave-pyrolysed chars were slightly more porous than slow-pyrolysed chars at 500 °C. However, at a higher temperature of 800 °C, lower surface area was obtained from microwave pyrolysis which can be attributed to significant damage to the char structure as the consequence of high power supplied into the cavity and high temperature used. SEM microphotographs revealed that microwave pyrolysis at 500 °C {{led to the formation of}} char with clearly defined pore structure. In the case of gaseous product, both heating approaches were found to produce a comparable level of H 2 +CO content except those produced by MP at higher temperature (800 °C). Regarding bio-oil quality, the microwave-pyrolysed oil was found to present compounds with higher aliphatic content and contain less polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content, which is an added quality value as PAH is toxic to the environment. As demonstrated in the present work, employing a microwave oven to conduct pyrolysis process leads to a great time saving where the woody samples required only 8 - 10 minutes and 15 - 16 minutes to reach 500 and 800 ºC respectively. On the other hand, the electric furnace used to conduct conventional pyrolysis process demonstrated a slower performance where the time required to reach 500 and 800 ºC were about 49 and 72 minutes respectively. This again emphasizes that microwave oven is powerful to speed up the pyrolysis process due to the nature of rapid heating within the internal body of the sample. Additionally, from the viewpoint of energy consumption, microwave oven used approximately 62...|$|E
40|$|Vermiculite is a {{clay mineral}} that is {{generally}} {{used for a}} wide range of applications such as in agricultural, horticultural and construction industries. This is due to its various properties which include high porosity, lightweight, thermo-insulating, non-toxic and good absorption capacity when exfoliated. The objective of this research was to critically evaluate the fundamental interaction of electromagnetic waves with vermiculite from different source locations and to understand the mechanism of exfoliation in an applied microwave field. When vermiculite minerals are placed under the influence of high electric fields, they expand due to the rapid heating of their interlayer water, which subsequently builds up pressure that pushes apart the silicate structure. The degree of exfoliation is directly related to the intensity of the applied electric field. The principal areas covered in this thesis include: a detailed review of the fundamentals of microwave processing and issues surrounding scale up; a critical literature review of vermiculite mineralogy, and previous methods of vermiculite processing and their limitations; understanding the interaction of microwave energy with vermiculite by carrying out mineralogical and dielectric characterisation; microwave exfoliation tests of vermiculite minerals from different source locations and a comparative energy and life cycle analysis of microwave and conventional exfoliation of vermiculite. A detailed review of the literature revealed that conventional exfoliation of vermiculite by gas or oil fuelled furnaces has significant limitations such as emissions of greenhouse gases, high-energy requirements (greater than 1 GJ/t), health and safety issues and poor process control. All work reported so far on microwave exfoliation of vermiculite has been limited to laboratory scale using <b>domestic</b> <b>microwave</b> <b>ovens</b> (2. 45 GHz, power below 1200 W) and the route to scale up the process to industrial capacity has not given due consideration. Mineralogical characterisation of vermiculite from different geographical locations (Australia, Brazil, China and South Africa) revealed that only the sample from Brazil is a pure form of vermiculite while the other samples are predominantly hydrobiotite. All the samples have varying degrees of hydration with the Brazilian sample having the highest total water content. The presence of water in any form in a material influences its dielectric response and ultimately the microwave absorbing properties. The dielectric characterisation carried out on the different vermiculite samples shows that the vermiculite mineral structure is effectively transparent to microwave energy, but it is possible to selectively heat microwave absorber, which is the interlayer water in the vermiculite structure. The continuous microwave exfoliation tests carried out at both pilot scale at 53 - 126 kg/h and the scaled up system at 300 - 860 kg/h demonstrated that microwave energy can be used for the industrial exfoliation of vermiculite at high throughputs and is able to produce products below the specified product bulk densities standard required by The Vermiculite Association (TVA). The degree of vermiculite exfoliation depends on factors such as power density, feedstock throughput, energy input, interlayer water content, particle size of the feedstock, and vermiculite mineralogy. The highest degree of exfoliation was recorded for the Brazilian sample, which also had the highest water content. Life cycle analysis (LCA) frameworks by the International Organisation for Standardisation (The ISO 14040 : principles and framework and ISO 14044 : Requirements and guidelines) and British standards institution (PAS 2050) were used to carry out comparative life cycle analysis of vermiculite exfoliation using microwave heating and conventional (industrial and Torbed) heating systems. The results showed that the microwave system potentially can give an energy saving of about 80...|$|E
