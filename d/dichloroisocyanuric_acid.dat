40|$|Kinetics of {{reactions}} of enolisable ketones (S = acetone/ 2 -butanone) with <b>dichloroisocyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> (DCICA) were studied in aqueous acetic acid and perchloric acid media in absence and presence of added chloride ions. The reactions {{were found to}} be pseudo zero order and pseudo first order on [DCICA] in absence and presence of chloride ions respectively. Both in presence and absence of chloride ions, first order and fractional order in substrate and perchloric acid were observed respectively. An increase in the rate of reaction was observed with an increase in chloride ion concentration as well as acetic acid composition. The results were interpreted in terms of probable mechanisms involving (i) rate-determining enol formation from the conjugate acid of the ketone (SH+) in the absence of added chloride ions and (ii) rate-determining interaction of SH+ with the most effective molecular chlorine species produced by the hydrolysis of DCICA (rather than a rate-determining interaction of enol with chlorine) in the presence of added chloride ions, prior to the rapid steps of product formation.

40|$|The {{development}} of an eco-friendly anti-felting treatment based on a calcium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide (Ca(ClO) 2 + H 2 O 2) system, the so-called MEFT (Mori Eco-friendly Treatment) process, is reported in this paper. This treatment is not new in the processing of wool; however, controlling the temperature and time gives rise to further effectiveness of the system, resulting in excellent anti-felting property, fabric handle, color intensity and whiteness. The relationship of the anti-felting and scale structure of Merino and Corriedale wool fabrics treated with the present system is discussed. Although the anti-felting effect was slightly {{lower than that of}} the chlorination treatment based on <b>dichloroisocyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> and NARS (improved new method of the Agricultural Research Service) treatment, the excellent handle characteristics of wool fabrics were retained. The anti-felting property, based on various other oxidative and non-oxidative treatments, was compared and the rank was obtained approximately in the following order: chlorination > NARS = MEFT > plasma > Caroat. © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub. co. uk/journalsPermissions. nav...|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} a micropropagation procedure for the Slovenian frost-tolerant olive cultivar ‘Istrska belica’. Establishing an in vitro culture was very difficult due to constant contaminations, tissue browning and stunted shoot growth. A sterile shoot culture was finally achieved by washing with running tap water, immersing in a mixture of ascorbic and citric acid and sterilizing with 70 % ethanol and <b>dichloroisocyanuric</b> <b>acid.</b> Shoot growth was optimal on DKW medium supplemented with 4 mg/L of 2 iP. Even in optimized conditions, sporadic fungal outbursts occurred. Fungi were isolated and their taxonomic origin was determined by morphological observation and molecular identification. Based on BLAST queries in the NCBI database, five genera of fungi were identified: Cladosporium, Chaetomium, Preussia, Biscogniauxia and Sistotrema, the last three genera being isolated from olives for the first time. A detailed literature search was performed to provide data on previous reports of these genera in relation to their putative endophytic presence and their possible pathogenic status. This is the first study reporting the presence of endophytic fungi in olive tissue culture. The information provided in this work can be very useful for the optimization of micropropagation protocols of recalcitrant olive cultivars and can potentially improve field performance of nursery plants...|$|E
40|$|Cleaning {{agents and}} {{disinfectants}} from housekeeping, hospitals and canteen kitchens are important sources of adsorbable halogenated organic compounds (AOX) in municipal wastewater. They often contain inorganic compounds which {{are able to}} release activated chlorine. Together with organic wastewater compounds the activated chlorine can generate halogenated organic compounds. Within {{the scope of this}} research project the generation of AOX through these active agents is compared. The effects of different reaction parameters like concentration, pH, time or temperature are investigated and discussed. For the investigations the most common active agents sodium hypochlorite, <b>dichloroisocyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> sodium salt and trichloroisocyanuric acid were tested for their potential of chlorination by reacting with selected organic substances. The selected substances were on the one hand organic compounds with different molecular structures and reactivity, on the other hand real municipal wastewater. The amount of AOX generated strongly depends on the nature and concentration of dissolved and solid organic compounds, the concentration of active substances, the temperature, pH and the reaction time. The generation of AOX can also form toxic compounds. So, toxic chloroanilines are found by gaschromatography/mass spectrometry, generated from the metabolism product indole by reacting with activated chlorine. According to the results, generation of AOX is an important non-point source of AOX in sewage. (orig.)

40|$|Flowering {{stems of}} Curcuma alismatifolia (Zingiberaceae) cv. Chiang Mai Pink contain small flower buds and open flowers, {{surrounded}} by large pink bracts. Vase life {{is limited by}} browning at the bract tips. This browning may relate to ethylene production as it was hastened by treatment with exogenous ethylene. Browning was apparently not {{due to lack of}} carbohydrates, as sugar treatment had no effect, and was also apparently not due to xylem plugging with microbes because antimicrobial compounds (8 -hydroxyquinoline sulphate (HQS) and <b>dichloroisocyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> (DICA)) were ineffective. The stems had a very short vase life after 3 days of dry storage. When stored in water, the optimum temperature for storage was 7 degreesC. After 3 or 6 days of storage at 7 degreesC the vase life was not different from that of unstored controls (about 18 days). However, if flowers were held at 5 degreesC for 3 days they had a vase life of only 2 days. It is concluded that C. alismatifolia is an attractive cut flower with a considerable length of vase life (usually more than 2 weeks, in freshly harvested stems). The flowers are chilling-sensitive, and cannot be stored dry but they can be stored in water at 7 degreesC for about 6 days. Since vase life is rather long, it is also possible to store the flowers in water for a few days at ambient temperatures. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we wanted to examine how the {{adhesion}} of Legionella pneumophila subsp. pneumophila ATCC 33152 bacterial cells {{is affected by the}} properties of various types of materials, such as roughness, hydrophobicity and charge, and how the bacteria are affected by different temperature conditions, shear forces and the presence of disinfectants <b>dichloroisocyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> and water softeners sodium polyphosphate. In {{the first part of the}} study we determined the adhesion of bacterial cells on borosilicate glass coupons of different roughness, while in the second part adhesion on the surface of materials that are most commonly used for plumbing and ventilation sistems in buildings. The materials differed in composition, roughness and contact angle. The adhesion of the bacteria to different surfaces was determined by the spectrophotometric measurement of the optical density of crystal violet dye released from the stained bacterial cells adhering to the test surface. In the first part of the study, it was established that the roughness of the material affects the adhesion of bacterial cells, as adhesion was higher on rougher glass coupons. The results of the study of bacterial adhesion to materials most commonly used in plumbing showed that adhesion not only depended on the roughness of the material but also on its other properties, as adhesion was not the lowest on the smoothest material. The test bacteria adhered the most firmly to galvanised pipes and the least firmly to polypropylene pipes. Bacteria adhesion was also affected by the incubation temperature, because adhesion was the highest at a temperature of 36 ° C and the lowest at a temperature of 15 ° C. The results show that incubation temperature of 15 ° C is bacteriostatic and temperature of 55 ° C is bactericidal...|$|E
40|$|Lord Baltimore’ hardy {{hibiscus}} (Hibiscus moscheutos L.) {{was used}} in the mass encapsulation protocol, rinsing effects on bulk encapsulation, growth comparisons using K-NAA, acclimatization to greenhouse environment, and leaf anatomy comparisons. Nodal segments, each containing a single axillary bud, were harvested and cut to 4 mm prior to mass encapsulation. Results showed that using 2. 75 % alginate with a concentration of 60 or 80 mM calcium chloride produced an alginate mass, or “cookie”, which was able to hold together during rinsing protocols. 	The rinsing study resulted with the potential to reduce rinse times from 2 three-minute rinses to 1 one-minute rinse. After 4 weeks under mist, ~ 58 % of root growth was generated when using 1 one-minute rinse. After 8 weeks under mist, the greatest percentage of shoot and root growth occurred when using 1 one-minute rinse. 	The use of K-NAA in the gel matrix, after four weeks, resulted in no discernable differences. Concentrations of 0 or 0. 1 µM will generate a greater percentage of shoot and root growth. Using 1. 0 µM K-NAA, and extending the time under mist to 8 weeks, will result in a greater percentage of shoots and roots generated. Acclimatization study investigated the survival rates on mass encapsulated nodal segments, looking at different media, depth of planting and humidity. Increases in shoot lengths can be expected up to 8 weeks under mist and planted either on top or 1 cm deep. A reduction in root growth was seen when placed on top of the medium after 4 weeks. The anatomical study found differences in the leaf cell lengths based on the stage of leaf development. However, there was no indication of a gradual change in anatomy as they adapted from in vitro to greenhouse environment. The best results were found when comparing epidermal, palisade and spongy mesophyll cells on the fourth fully expanded leaf under mist. Hydrangea quercifolia ‘Snow Queen’ was used to test the effects of tissue culture media and plant growth regulators. Research found that using <b>dichloroisocyanuric</b> <b>acid</b> (NaDCC) resulted in a decrease of contamination on explants without a {{reduction in the number of}} shoots produced. This would reduce the amount of time and labor on the encapsulation procedure, as no rinsing is required. The best result, looking a nutrient formulation, was found to be WPM with 1 µM BA added...|$|E
