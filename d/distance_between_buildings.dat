In the second step, more detailed urban land use classification is undertaken based on analysis of regional radar backscatter patterns in terms of density of dark linear features, density of bright features, and urban contextual information. Density analysis was conducted at three levels: individual building�road, urban block, and suburban commercial�industrial.

Given a suitable combination of loads, number of and <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings</b> they can offer economic and environmental advantages compared to the supply by individual heating systems per building. We present a novel method using data analysis techniques on geo-referenced building stock data to identify suitable configurations of buildings that yield a cost-efficient thermal microgrid. For the identification both semantic and spatial data from a database are combined using fuzzy logics and cost-benefit analysis. We apply the method using a case study featuring a database of 306 buildings potentially to be retrofitted. As a result, we can identify 9 groups of in total 25 buildings that would form a microgrid featuring up to 17. 4 % cost benefits compared to an individual heat supply.

These requirements are formulated by the regulatory body, for ease of use and enforcement, in a very simple manner: 10 m minimum separation <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings,</b> if both buildings have combustible exterior linings, 7. 5 m if only one building has a combustible exterior lining, and 5 m if both buildings have non-combustible exterior linings. However, no quantitative guidance is given on how to reduce these distances, e. g. in cases where existing buildings are involved. In this paper, an overview on design methods for calculating separation distances {{in order to prevent}} fire spread between buildings is given. A model is described to calculate the probability of fire spread between buildings at several distances, taking into account relevant uncertainties. It appears that there is a 1 in 20 chance that a combustible exterior building lining can ignite if exposed to a burning building (room fire conditions) at a distance of 10 m, and a 1 out of 3 chance if at a distance of 5 m. The level of risk implicitly accepted by the Swiss fire codes is discussed, and a method is presented on how to derive separation distances imposing an equal level of risk for different building geometries and occupancies...|$|E

40|$|As {{the role}} of the cities has gained {{currency}} in the sustainability discourse since 1990 s, improvement of livability has been emphasized alongside with environmental conservation to enhance urban sustainability. Many developed countries increase urban density purposely to pursue better livability and environmental sustainability. Contrarily, cities in the developing countries densify haphazardly without any policy directives. Dhaka is a case in point. The goal of this pioneering study is to formulate recommendations for improving Dhaka’s planning system and policy in order to enhance its livability, by investigating the livability of Dhaka’s dense urban neighborhoods. To achieve this goal, this study addresses three research questions: what are the density attributes of Dhaka; how livable is Dhaka’s urban neighborhoods under a dense environment; and how have the urban planning system and policy influenced the density of Dhaka? The literature related to density, livability and sustainable urban forms was reviewed to establish the analytical framework. To examine the density attributes, this study investigated population density, building density and housing form mix. For the livability of the dense neighborhoods, it investigated public facilities and services provision, and the sense of community and safety. Further, the planning strategy, land use planning, planning and building regulations and land policy were examined to identify their influence on density and livability. Five neighborhoods from the planned and unplanned areas were selected for case studies, involving a questionnaire survey, interviews, field observation and documentary analysis. This study found that as a low-rise city, Dhaka’s extremely high density implies a very compact urban form. The planned areas are of relatively lower population density but have taller buildings and greater <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings</b> than in the unplanned areas. High density was also found in congruence with the Bangladeshi culture. Across the neighborhoods, the community facilities, safety and dwelling space standards were satisfactory. However, the provision of and accessibility to public transport, open space and sense of community were less satisfactory. The neighborhoods of the planned areas were more livable. Nonetheless, in the neighborhoods of the unplanned areas, the greater use of street corners fostered social contacts and safety feeling. The absence of density zoning and land subdivision controls, the ineffective land use planning mechanism, violation of the planning standards and building regulations have led to uncontrolled population growth exceeding infrastructure capacity. The lack of planning vision and the weak institutional capacity of the planning authority mainly accounted for these problems. This study recommends introducing land subdivision restrictions, density zoning, and scientific designation and formulation of land use zones. Strengthening of the institutional capacity of the planning authority is also important for enabling effective enforcement of planning tools, regulations and standards. By comparing the planned and unplanned areas, this study also recommends that planning and building controls should be effectively enforced to ensure greater <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>buildings.</b> Open spaces should also be located within walking distance and more street corners should be planned to enhance the sense of community and safety. published_or_final_versionUrban Planning and DesignDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

The objective is to propose appropriate spacing distances for various configurations of this type of buildings layout in a suburban area of Kuala Lumpur, which would enable harnessing the full ventilation potential of the local wind conditions.

Using principal component analyses, it is shown that out of the many urban morphological factors, only five morphological variables (plan area density, occlusivity, aerodynamic roughness height, mean built volume, compactness factor) and four land development factors (aspect ratio, distance between building, mean building height and standard deviation of building height) correlate with particulate matter.
