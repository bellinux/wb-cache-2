50|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the <b>gearbox</b> input <b>shaft</b> and the other on the <b>gearbox</b> output <b>shaft.</b> To make a gear change, both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. The gearchange occurs with all gears stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. After the gear change, both clutches re-engage.

50|$|In {{many modern}} designs, the engine {{sits in front}} of the gearbox. From a {{sprocket}} {{on one side of the}} crankshaft, a chain or sprocket directly mounted to the clutch will drive the clutch, which can often be found behind a large circular cover on one side of the gearbox. The clutch is connected to the <b>gearbox</b> input <b>shaft.</b> For motorcycles with chain drive, the <b>gearbox</b> output <b>shaft</b> is typically connected to the sprocket which drives the final drive chain.|$|R
5000|$|Automatic and semi-automatics {{typically}} use a {{centrifugal clutch}} which operates {{in a different}} fashion. At idle, the engine is disconnected from the gearbox input shaft, allowing both it and the bike to freewheel (unlike torque converter automatics, there is no [...] "idle creep" [...] with a properly adjusted centrifugal clutch). As the throttle is opened and engine speed rises, counterweights attached to movable inner friction surfaces (connected to the engine shaft) within the clutch assembly are thrown gradually further outwards, until they start {{to make contact with}} the inside of the outer housing (connected to the <b>gearbox</b> <b>shaft)</b> and transmit an increasing amount of engine power. The effective [...] "bite point" [...] is found automatically by equilibrium where the power being transmitted through the (still-slipping) clutch is equal to what the engine can provide. This allows relatively fast full-throttle takeoffs (with the clutch adjusted so the engine will be turning near its maximum-torque rpm) without the engine slowing or bogging down, as well as more relaxed starts and low-speed maneuvers at lower throttle settings and rpms.|$|E

40|$|Metso {{develops}} (among {{many other}} things) refiners. The refiner grinds the wood chips intopulp. The grinding {{is done by}} segments that are placed on a rotor inside the refiner hosing. In time this segments wear {{and needs to be}} replaced. When changing refiner segments or performing service to the refiner the rotor needs to berotated. To perform the rotating motion today the overhead crane is used. This procedure isboth impractical, dangerous and takes precious time from the overhead crane. Because ofthis Metso wanted to create a new way to rotate the rotor. The aim of this thesis is to create a tool or equipment which can be used to rotate therefiner rotor and can be installed as an upgrade on all Metso refiner models. The proposed design is driven with a 1. 1 kW electrical motor and a gearbox with a gear ratioof approximately 1 : 217. The torque is transferred from the outgoing <b>gearbox</b> <b>shaft</b> to therefiner shaft with the help of gearwheels. To connect the gearbox gearwheel with the refinershaft gearwheel, the gear motor has to be moveable in a radial direction. This is done by themeans of two shafts that glides in four bushings. On the <b>gearbox</b> <b>shaft</b> a gearwheel with 120 mm of face width is mounted. The large face width is used to take up the axial movement ofthe refiner shaft. The proposed concept fulfills all of the demands set in the pilot study. The design is goodbecause of the low cost and straight forward design that is easy to build and simple to use. The disadvantage is that the equipment is a bit large and heavy, but as stationary equipmentthis should not be a problem...|$|E

30|$|The working {{principle}} of the beam pumping units is as follow: firstly, the motor converts the electrical energy into the rotational motion. Secondly, after twice reduction by the gearbox and the four-bar linkage, the rotary motion transforms into a linear reciprocating motion. At last, by the horse head, the beam hanger and the polished rod, the sucker rod drives the deep oil well pump. The core component of the beam pumping units is the four-bar linkage that is composed of the crank, the link bar, the rear arm, the connection line between the <b>gearbox</b> <b>shaft</b> and the shaft of the support. The four-bar linkage has the function that transforms the rotary motion of the gearbox into the reciprocating motion required to operate the downhole pump. The geometric parameters of the four-bar linkage have extremely important impact to the contour size and the working performance of the beam pumping units.|$|E

Relatively small final fracture area of the fracture surface indicated that the shaft was under a low stress at the time of failure. It is concluded that the shaft failed by fatigue fracture and that premature failure occurred due to high stress concentration at the corners of the wobbler of the shaft which led eventually to fatigue crack initiation, crack growth, and final fracture.

40|$|Vibration {{diagnosis}} {{is one of}} the most common techniques in condition evaluation of wind turbine equipped with gearbox. On the other side, gearbox {{is one of the}} key components of wind turbine drivetrain. Due to the stochastic operation of wind turbines, the <b>gearbox</b> <b>shaft</b> rotating speed changes with high percentage, which limits the application of traditional vibration signal processing techniques, such as fast Fourier transform. This paper investigates a new approach for wind turbine high speed shaft gear fault diagnosis using discrete wavelet transform and time synchronous averaging. First, the vibration signals are decomposed into a series of subbands signals with the use of a multiresolution analytical property of the discrete wavelet transform. Then, 22 condition indicators are extracted from the TSA signal, residual signal, and difference signal. Through the case study analysis, a new approach reveals the most relevant condition indicators based on vibrations that can be used for high speed shaft gear spalling fault diagnosis and their tracking abilities for fault degradation progression. It is also shown that the proposed approach enhances the gearbox fault diagnosis ability in wind turbines.

40|$|This {{report is}} aimed at {{providing}} a computerised design procedure based on Australian Standard AS 1403 : 1979, 2 ̆ 7 Design of Steel Shafts for Transmission of Power 2 ̆ 7 which is a metrication and revision of ASB 249 : 1969, 2 ̆ 7 Recommendations for the Design of Shafts for Cranes and Hoists 2 ̆ 7, which it supersedes. The presentation given in AS 1403 and particularly ASB 249 lends itself to computerised calculations owing to the rigorous design procedure and time required for complete analysis. The programme {{has the capacity to}} analyse shafts supported by two bearings, being either simply-supported or cantilevered and is best suited to the design of gearbox shafts. The programme may also be used to analyse drive shafts where the peak shaft torque is entered directly in the input data. Shafts with one or two gears being either spur, helical or double-helical type may be analysed. AS 1403 also provides for- the design of hollow construction shafts. In keeping with modern design practice, a comprehensive array of gear and bearing fits have been provided. Optimisation in this study {{is aimed at}} developing a solution criterion for minimising the shaft diameter. Recent design practice requires reduced shaft diameters where possible in order to locate components and reduce drive inertia. Savings in material and manufacturing costs can thus be expected. Execution of the optimisation programme follows entry of all input data in the required format. Within the data arrays, all geometrical restrictions and operational requirements are detailed. The programme does not rely on the designer 2 ̆ 7 s need to use 2 ̆ 7 previous experience 2 ̆ 7 in shaft design.

In addition, the slopes and deflections at gears and bearings are displayed with which to compare with manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations. As an aid in the presentation of final shaft geometry, computer graphics has been utilised. Each <b>gearbox</b> <b>shaft</b> analysed may be displayed on a single frame in which all critical shaft diameters and relevant data are shown...|$|E
40|$|Conventional gearbox {{vibration}} monitoring techniques {{are based on}} the assumption that changes in the measured structural response are caused by deterioration in the condition of the gears in the gearbox. However, this assumption is not valid under fluctuating load conditions, since the fluctuating load will amplitude modulate the measured vibration signal and cause the rotational speed of the system to change. In general monitoring of machines subject to fluctuating load conditions is dealt with by considering the constant load conditions on gearboxes or during free rotational tests. The need to monitor the condition of large gearboxes in mineral mining equipment has attracted greater interest in order to improve asset management. An inherent need for signal processing techniques, with the ability to indicate degradation in gear condition, under fluctuating load conditions exist. Such techniques should enable the online monitoring of gearboxes that operate under fluctuating load conditions. A continued flow of up to date information should consequently be available for asset and production management. With this research, a load demodulation normalisation procedure was developed to remove the modulation caused by fluctuating load conditions, which obscures the detection of an incipient gear fault conditions. A rotation domain averaging technique is implemented which combines the ability of computer order tracking and time domain averaging to suppress the spectral smearing effect caused by the fluctuation in speed, as well as to suppress the amplitude of the vibration which is not synchronous with the rotation of the gear shaft. It is demonstrated that the instantaneous angular speed of a <b>gearbox</b> <b>shaft</b> can be utilised to monitor the condition of the gear on the shaft. The instantaneous angular speed response measurement is less susceptible to phase distortion introduced by the transmission path when compared to conventional gearbox casing vibration measurements. A phase domain averaging approach was developed to overcome the phase distortion effect of the transmission path under fluctuating load conditions. The load demodulation normalisation and rotation domain averaging signal processing procedures were applied to both the conventional gearbox casing vibration and instantaneous angular speed measurements prior to the calculation of a smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution of the data. Statistical parameters such as the energy ratio were calculated from the distribution. These parameters could be monotonically trended under different load conditions to indicate the degradation of gear conditions.
