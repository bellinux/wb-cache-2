40|$|This paper {{presents}} a home-based robot-rehabilitation instrument, called ”MAGNI Dynamics”, that utilized a vision-based kinematic/dynamic module and an adaptive haptic feedback controller. The system {{is expected to}} provide personalized rehabilitation by adjusting its resistive and supportive behavior according to a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>intelligence</b> controller that acts as an inference system, which correlates the user’s performance to different stiffness factors. The vision module uses the Kinect’s skeletal tracking to monitor the user’s effort in an unobtrusive and safe way, by estimating the torque that affects the user’s arm. The system’s torque estimations are justified by capturing electromyographic data from primitive hand motions (Shoulder Abduction and Shoulder Forward Flexion). Moreover, we present and analyze how the Barrett WAM generates a force-field with a haptic controller to support or challenge the users. Experiments show that by shifting the proportional value, that corresponds to different stiffness factors of the haptic path, can potentially help the user to improve his/her motor skills. Finally, potential areas for future research are discussed, that address how a rehabilitation robotic framework may include multisensing data, to improve the user’s recovery process...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{dependence}} of modem society on telecommunication and information networks has become inevitable. The {{increase in the}} number of networks interconnected over the Internet has led to an increase in security threats. The existing mobile and fixed network systems and telecommunication protocols are not appropriately designed to deal with current developed distributed attacks. I started my research work by exploring the deployment of intelligent Agents that could detect network anomalies and issue automated response actions. An Intelligent Agent (IA) [Knapik et at, 1998] is an entity that carries out some set of operations on behalf of a user or other software with some degree of independence or autonomy. The investigation of the Agents paradigm led to a deep understanding of the underlying problem; therefore, machine learning has turned my attention to Bayesian learning and Fuzzy logic approaches. A modelled network intrusion detector has been proposed. This model sets Agents with learning capabilities for detecting current as well as similar future distributed network attacks. In order to detect those anomalies as early as possible, the Bayesian network approach has been proposed. This approach is considered to be a promising method in determining suspicious network anomaly events that consequently relates them to subsequent dependent illegitimate activities. This research suggests innovative ways to develop Intelligent Agents that incorporate Bayesian learning to address network security risks associated with the current Networks Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) designs and implementations. Because NIDSs have traditionally focused on detecting attacks, and while detection serves a vital purpose, it does not provide the ultimate solution. As aresult, an effective response mechanism to those detected attacks is required to minimise their effect and hence enhance NIDSs capabilities. Therefore, other Agents with <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>intelligence</b> capabilities have been proposed to initiate successful automated response actions. Fuzzy Agents have been proposed to handle this task with the ability to respond quickly and dynamically control the availability of allocated network resources. The evaluation methodology used to assess the performance of the developed models has been concentrated on detecting as well as predicting unauthorised activities in networks. By means of evaluation and validation, as well as empirical evidence, we are able to determine the effectiveness of the developed models and assumptions. The performance of developed detection model algorithms for unsupervised learning tasks has been evaluated using well known standard methods such as Confusion matrix. The achieved results indicate that the developed model led to a substantial reduction of the false alarms, with significant increase in the detection rates. This research work is operating within the context of two domains the first drawn from the network security community and the other from the machine learning community. It investigates the deployment of both Bayesian Learning as a probabilistic approach and <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>Intelligence</b> as a possibilistic approach to networks security. This is to detect as well as predict future evolving network anomalies, and to effectively respond to those developed attacks and minimise their effects. Consequently, it may provide innovative solutions that can be implemented in a cost-effective manner. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

Little Fuzzy brings his family/tribe to meet Holloway and the lot of them promptly adopt Holloway as well. Upon discovery that the <b>Fuzzies</b> <b>intelligence</b> may qualify them as a sapient species, the Company moves against them. The reason for such an action, which if carried through to conclusion would be genocide, is that such a discovery would turn the planet a protected aboriginal zone, install a proper government there, and deprive the Chartered Zarathustra Company of its complete control of the resources there. Leonard Kellogg, one of Grego's staff, kills a Fuzzy and provokes a court case {{to decide whether the}} Fuzzies are sapient. In the midst of the proceedings, the Terran Navy commander reveals that his people have been studying Fuzzies, and prove that Fuzzies have at least the mental capacity of a ten-year-old human child. They also show that the [...] "yeek" [...] noises made by the Fuzzies are merely the human-audible edge of the Fuzzies' voices and that their normal speaking range is in the ultrasonic; and tell the court that they have developed an elementary Fuzzy grammar and dictionary. As a result, the charter of the Chartered Zarathustra Company is invalidated, and Kellogg commits suicide in his cell. Chief Justice Frederic Pendarvis officially rules that the Fuzzies are sapient beings, and Holloway is reunited with his Fuzzy family.|$|R

40|$|The global {{importance}} of {{and need for}} sustainable development demand an informed decision-making process from the built environment to ensure optimum service life, which depends {{on the ability to}} quantify changes in condition of building materials over time. The objective of this thesis is to develop a model, which translates expert knowledge and reasoning into probability values through the application of <b>Fuzzy</b> Logic Artificial <b>Intelligence</b> to supplement limited historical performance data on degradation of building materials for the development of Markov Chain transitional probability matrices to predict service life, condition changes over time, and consequences of maintenance levels on service life of buildings. The Markov Chain methodology, a stochastic approach used for simulating the transition from one condition to another over time, has been identified as the preferred method for service life prediction by a number of studies. Limited availability of historic performance data on degradation and durability of building materials, required to populate the Markovian transition probability matrices, however restricts the application of the Markov Chain methodology. The durability and degradation factors, defined as design and maintenance levels, material and workmanship quality, external and internal climate, and operational environment, similar to the factors identified in the state-of-the–art ‘Factor Method’ for service life prediction, and current condition are rated on a uniform colour-coded five-point rating system and used to develop “IF-THEN” rules based on expert knowledge and reasoning. <b>Fuzzy</b> logic artificial <b>intelligence</b> is then used to translate these rules into crisp probability values to populate the Markovian transitional probability matrices. Historic performance data from previous condition assessments of six academic hospitals are used to calibrate and test the model. There is good correlation between the transitional probability matrices developed for the proposed model and other Markov applications in concrete bridge deck deterioration and roof maintenance models, based on historic performance data collected over extended periods, which makes the correlation more significant. Proof is presented that the Markov Chain can be used to calculate the estimated service life of a building or component, quantify changes in condition over time and determine the effect of maintenance levels on service life. It is also illustrated that the limited availability of historic performance data on degradation of building materials can be supplemented with expert knowledge, translated into probability values through the application of <b>Fuzzy</b> Logic Artificial <b>Intelligence,</b> to develop transition probability matrices for the Markov Chain. The proposed model {{can also be used to}} determine the estimated loss of or gain in service life of a building or component for various levels of maintenance.

40|$|Heterogeneity in robot model mix is {{advantageous}} {{in emerging}} robotic material handling systems. For instance, in a fully automated industrial package {{loading and unloading}} scenario, a variety uncertain types of packages need to be continuously sorted and loaded onto designated trucks. To handle the variation of tasks, multiple types of robots, or heterogeneous robots, are designed in the system. However, in such a collaborative system consisting of heterogeneous robots, ineffective task assignments often lead to bad collaboration and thus poor efficiency. In this thesis, to improve the robot collaboration, the collaborative task assignment problem is defined; and a protocol with <b>fuzzy</b> collaborative <b>intelligence</b> to optimize the assignment plans is developed. Specifically, the collaboration type, the collaboration matrix and the assignment matrix are specified; and the model for adaptive fuzzy collaborative task assignment relies on intuitionistic fuzzy set theory. An unsorted package loading and unloading tasks by heterogeneous robots are used as a case example to validate the new method. Experiments indicate with statistical significance that the new approach shortens total completion time by 21 %, reduces total energy consumption by 23 %, and increases loading accuracy by 31 %, compared with the traditional static task assignment method commonly practiced.
