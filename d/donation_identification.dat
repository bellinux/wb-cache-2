Objective: To examine young adults’ knowledge about organ donation and to use a theory of planned behavior framework to determine the differences in behavioral, normative, and control beliefs between young adults who had {{and those who had}} not registered and discussed their organ donation decision with family or significant others. Participants: Australian university students (N = 233) completed a questionnaire assessing knowledge about the organ donation process and beliefs related to organ donation decision registration and decision discussion. Results: Young adults demonstrated knowledge deficits about the support of Western religious denominations for organ donation and the circumstances surrounding donation. Unregistered donors were more likely to focus on the costs of registering; however, no belief based differences for decision discussion emerged. Young adults who had registered and discussed their decision were more likely to believe that family members and friends thought they should do so. Lack of motivation was reported as preventing registering and discussing, and uncertainty about how and when to raise the topic prevented young adults discussing their donation decision. Conclusions: Understanding of young adults’ knowledge and beliefs enables the development of strategies encouraging donation decision registration and donation decision discussion with family or significant others, thereby increasing the likelihood that the donor’s wishes will be carried out...|$|E

40|$|Modern {{transplantation}} of cells, {{tissues and}} organs has been practiced within the last century achieving both life saving and enhancing results. Associated risks have been recognized including infectious disease transmission, malignancy, immune mediated disease and graft failure. This has resulted in establishment of government regulation, professional standard setting and establishment of vigilance and surveillance systems for early detection and prevention and to improve patient safety. The increased transportation of grafts across national boundaries has made traceability difficult and sometimes impossible. Experience during the first Gulf War with miss-identification of blood units coming from multiple countries without standardized coding and labeling has led international organizations to develop standardized nomenclature and coding for blood. Following this example, cell therapy and tissue transplant practitioners have also moved to standardization of coding systems. Establishment of an international coding system has progressed rapidly and implementation for blood has demonstrated multiple advantages. WHO has held two global consultations on human cells and tissues for transplantation, which recognized the global circulation of cells and tissues and growing commercialization {{and the need for}} means of coding to identify tissues and cells used in transplantation, are essential for full traceability. There is currently a wide diversity in the identification and coding of tissue and cell products. For tissues, with a few exceptions, product terminology has not been standardized even at the national level. Progress has been made in blood and cell therapies with a slow and steady trend towards implementation of the international code ISBT 128. Across all fields, there are now 3, 700 licensed facilities in 66 countries. Efforts are necessary to encourage the introduction of a standardized international coding system for <b>donation</b> <b>identification</b> numbers, such as ISBT 128, for all donated biologic products...|$|E
50|$|Research may {{indicate}} that the identifiable victim effect only affects identified individuals, not identified groups (Kogut & Ritov, 2005). A 2005 study by Kogut and Ritov asked participants how much {{they would be willing}} to donate to either a critically ill child or a group of eight critically ill children. Although identification of the individual child increased <b>donations,</b> <b>identification</b> of the group of children as a whole did not. Researchers also found that, although both the individual and group evoked similar amounts of empathy, individual victims evoked more emotional distress than groups of victims. Continuing from this, researchers hypothesized that emotional distress, not empathy, appears to be positively correlated with desire to help, or “willingness to contribute.” This supports the idea that altruistic acts may serve as coping mechanisms to alleviate negative emotions, such as guilt (Yam & Reynolds, 2016). This also supports later research that suggests distress and sympathy are the driving emotional factors behind the identifiable victim effect (Erlandsson, Björklund, & Bäckström, 2015).|$|R
40|$|Reports of {{successful}} transplantation of bone marrow obtained from unrelated donors who were histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical prompted the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service in Ottawa {{to assess the}} possibility of developing a bone marrow donor registry in Canada. We sent a pamphlet that explained the program to 1568 people who had undergone apheresis {{and asked them to}} reply, stating their interest. At the same time the pamphlets and a poster were placed in the blood donor clinic. We received 1232 replies (78. 6 %) from the apheresis donors, 838 (68. 0 %) of which indicated a willingness to attend information sessions. Of the 7158 people who gave blood during the 3 -month study period, 225 (3. 1 %) were interested. At the time this paper was written 47 information sessions had been held, and 721 people had attended, 624 (86. 5 %) of whom had signed a consent form. This indicates a clear interest in a bone marrow donation program. We believe that the ethical issues are overcome by requesting the <b>donation</b> before <b>identification</b> of any patient. From our experience a national registry of unrelated donors seems feasible, and steps are being taken to implement such a program...|$|R
40|$|With an {{empirical}} study in two nonprofit industries (a money-collecting and blood-collecting organization), the authors investigate how organizational identification and identity salience together function {{in relation to}} satisfaction, loyalty, and behavior. They develop and test a model that best represents relationships featuring donor-nonprofit identification and donor identity salience in existing satisfaction-loyalty studies. Overall, the study empirically confirms that donor-nonprofit identification and donor iden-tity salience are distinct constructs and that both have direct positive effects on loyalty, but not that much on donations. Within the money <b>donation</b> context, both <b>identification</b> constructs have stronger total effects on donor loyalty than donor satisfaction, whereas in the blood donation context, donor satisfaction has a stronger effect on loyalty. In testing the causal direction between donor-nonprofit identification and donor satisfaction, the authors also find that the path should be conceptualized from satisfac-tion to identification. The study contributes {{to the theory of}} organizational identification and identity salience by highlighting the advantages of taking a combined theoretical approach. Finally, the study suggests several means to implement donor identification management, including group activities, development of online communities, donor events, and more long-term-oriented tactics, all of which treat the donor as a cocreator of value.

40|$|Relatives of {{potential}} organ donors {{are the most}} critical link in maintaining organ availability, as they must express their lack of objection before organ retrieval may take place. The often sudden and unexpected nature {{of the death of}} a potential organ donor, plus acceptance of a non-stereotypical death, brain stem death, could be expected to create certain challenges for families; yet, their anonymity means little is understood about their experiences. This three-year, longitudinal study sought to clarify the needs of families throughout their decision-making and bereavement, to provide a rationale for further preparation of professionals involved in this sensitive work and the voluntary organisations, such as BODY, that seek to support them. It is the first detailed, longitudinal study of families with whom organ donation was discussed. It was sponsored by the British Organ Donor Society and funded by National Lottery Community Fund. The researchers worked closely with transplant co-ordination services and intensive care units throughout the UK. Face-to-face interviews and two, self-completed, psychometric measures, the Grief Experience Inventory and the Beck Depression Inventory, were used to elicit the bereavement experiences of 46 family members who chose to donate their deceased relative’s organs and three who declined donation. Participants who chose to donate were interviewed on three occasions at 3 - 5, 13 - 15 and 18 - 26 months post bereavement. Single interviews were carried out with participants who declined donation. Researcher’s field notes aided reflexivity, provided context and explanatory rigour to judgements and decision-making, providing a credible audit-trail of the investigation. Data were analysed using a constant comparative approach concerned with detecting and highlighting important similarities and differences between participants. Data provided strong evidence regarding issues surrounding sudden death and organ <b>donation,</b> such as <b>identification</b> of participants’ needs (need was defined as the help participants felt they required or would have liked throughout their bereavement). HyperResearch 2. 2. 3 was used to store and work with transcribed data. Sque’s theory of Dissonant Loss, Walter’s Biographical Model of Grief and the Dual Processing Model of Grief provided the theoretical and analytic frameworks. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were used to analyse the grief and depression measures, using The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Findings from the interviews indicated participants’ bereavement needs during the hospital stay included: the need for correct, timely information, the need for contact with the deceased, the need to understand the diagnosis of brainstem death, the need to have their special role as next-of-kin recognised, the need for healthcare professionals, from all areas, to understand their ‘emotional mind-set’ at this time. Families needed easy access to both formal (transplant co-ordinators, support groups and bereavement organisations) and informal (friends and family) sources of support after leaving the hospital. They needed to hear from transplant co-ordinators about the use of the organs. Their need to hear about and from the recipients of their loved ones organs increased over time. They needed support and the opportunity to talk about the deceased with friends and families or bereavement support personnel. Results of the psychometric measures indicated that participants’ depression levels were elevated at 3 - 5 months post bereavement and reduced to minimal levels, for all but six participants, by 18 - 26 months. These six participants reported poor formal and informal bereavement support. The lack of such support could therefore have a consequence for on-going depression and grief related distress. The ability to interchange human organs and tissues introduces a relatively unexplored dimension to grieving that requires specific attention. Bereavement support must begin at the bedside and continue until it is no longer needed. This calls for a much greater integration of support services with a seamless transfer of care from the hospital to a support organisation specifically designed to meet the on-going bereavement needs of families, whatever their decision regarding organ and tissue donation <br/...|$|R
