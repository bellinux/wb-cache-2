5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1864 the Beetons again visited the Goubauds in Paris—the couple's third visit to the city—and Isabella was {{pregnant}} during the visit, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been the previous year. On her return to Britain she began working on an abridged version of the Book of Household Management , {{which was to be}} titled The Dictionary of Every-Day Cookery. On 29 January 1865, while working on the proofs of the dictionary, she went into labour; the baby—Mayson Moss—was born that day. Isabella began to feel feverish the following day and died of puerperal fever on 6 February at the age of 28.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. In {{the middle}} of the month, President George H. W. Bush, in keeping with the Carter Doctrine, sent the first of several hundred {{thousand}} troops, along with a strong force of naval support to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf area to support a multi-national force in a standoff with Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. On 7 August, Wisconsin and her battle group were ordered to deploy in defense of Kuwait for Operation Desert Shield, and they arrived in the Persian Gulf on 23 August. On 15 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced operations, and Wisconsin found herself serving alongside her younger sister Missouri, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done in Korea forty years previously. Both Wisconsin and Missouri launched Tomahawk Missile attacks against Iraq; they were among the first ships to fire cruise missiles during the 1991 Gulf War. Wisconsin served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and firing a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign. Wisconsin also assumed the responsibility of the local anti-surface warfare coordinator for the Northern Persian Gulf Surface Action Group.|$|E

25|$|On {{the episode}} {{broadcast}} on Monday, August 30, 2010, {{it was revealed}} that Nancy had died in her sleep; the next day's episode dealt with Nancy's memorial service. Nancy Hughes's memorial aired just two weeks before the series finale. The show's producers stated in interviews that they had to revise their plans for the final episode because of Wagner's death – they had hoped that Wagner would say the final lines of the last episode <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> said the first words of the first episode.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Memorial Bridge, which Foley {{had helped}} dedicate in 1923, was permanently closed on July 27, 2011, due to disrepair and serious safety hazards. Eileen Foley tied a blue ribbon onto the bridge's plaque at its closing ceremony on October 1, 2011. A replacement was constructed. The new, $88 million replacement Memorial Bridge was officially opened during a ceremony on August 9, 2013. Foley, who was 95 {{years old at}} the time, cut the ribbon for the bridge's reopening, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done for the original span in 1923.|$|E
25|$|The show ends on a {{high and}} in a similar style to how it all began. At Fiona's mansion {{boarding}} house, a young couple arrive, {{and ask for a}} room. The young woman is heavily pregnant.

The woman gives birth to twins, {{a boy and a girl}} and the story seems to have finally come full circle. The final episode ends with a montage of many cast members, both past and present.|$|E

25|$|Chopin {{appeared}} {{to express her}} belief in the strength of women. Marquand draws from theories about creative nonfiction {{in terms of her}} work. In order for a story to be autobiographical, or even biographical, Marquand writes, {{there has to be a}} nonfictional element, but more often than not the author exaggerates the truth to spark and hold interest for the readers. Kate Chopin might have been surprised to know her work has been characterized as feminist in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been in her own time to have it described as immoral. Critics tend to regard writers as individuals with larger points of view addressed to factions in society.|$|E

Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster: Salvatore Valestra. He breaks into Valestra's home and discovers a photograph of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont seated at a table. When he visits Andrea {{to try to get}} more answers she rebuffs him, intimating that she knows his identity. Meanwhile, Valestra believes Batman killed the others and will come for him, so he turns to the Joker for help.|$|E
500|$|Angelou's {{need for}} {{security}} for her young son motivates her choices in Singin' and Swingin', especially {{her decision to}} marry Tosh Angelos. She feels {{a deep sense of}} guilt and regret when she has to leave her son to tour with Porgy and Bess, which prevents her from fully enjoying the experience. In spite of this, Singin' and Swingin has been called [...] "a love song to Angelou's son". Just as she changes her name as the story progresses, so does Guy, who becomes an intelligent, sensitive boy in the pages of this book. As Guy grows, so does his mother; Hagen stated that this growth moves Angelou's story forward. When Angelou discovers how deeply their separation injures Guy, she leaves the Porgy and Bess tour before it ends, at great personal cost. By the end of the book, their bond is deepened and she promises never to leave him again. As Hagen states, Maya embraces the importance of motherhood, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done {{at the end of her}} previous autobiographies.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{shall be}} done," [...] said Simon Agricola; so Babo paid back the money, {{and the doctor}} dipped {{the woman in the}} water.

500|$|She proved {{popular as}} a First Lady. [...] She was a {{frequent}} speaker at events and before civic groups and became known for her eloquence. [...] She was thus useful to his political career, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been to his business one. [...] Like her husband, she did not make public appearances on Sundays. [...] He was re-elected in 1964 and 1966, and she campaigned frequently with him. [...] Moreover, she played more of an active and partisan role within her party than any Michigan first lady before or after her. [...] She knew his policy positions at least {{as well as any}} of his official aides, went with him on almost all of his out-of-state trips, and gave his speeches for him if sudden events made him unable to attend. [...] Over time an impression grew among some in the public that she was smarter than he was. [...] George Romney biographer T. George Harris concluded in 1967 that [...] "she has been considerably more than a first lady." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Robert Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in 1968, Alice again {{supported}} her friend Richard Nixon, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> done in his 1960 campaign against John F. Kennedy. Her long friendship with Nixon ended {{at the conclusion of}} the Watergate Scandal, specifically when Nixon quoted her father's diary at his resignation, saying, [...] "Only if you've been to the lowest valley can you know how great it is to be on the highest mountain top." [...] This infuriated Alice, who spat curse words at her television screen as she watched him compare his early departure from the White House (in the face of probable impeachment and possible criminal prosecution) to her idealistic young father's loss of his wife and mother on the same day due to illness. Nixon, however, called her [...] "the most interesting [...] " [...] and said, [...] "No one, no matter how famous, could ever outshine her." ...|$|E

Yesterday they went to the Gerhardts and spent two hours, and Ward came away bewitched with those people and marveling at the winning innocence of the young wife, who dropped {{naturally}} into model-attitude beside the statue (which is stark naked from head to heel, now--G. had removed the drapery, fearing Ward would think he was afraid to try legs and hips) <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> always done before.|$|R

Reality and truth depend on whose perspective one believes. Kesa sees murdering Morito {{as a way to}} cleanse herself of her guilt and shame, while Morito believes he is bringing justice to Kesa and renewing his honor.|$|R

2500|$|In Steubenville, the Stantons welcomed two children, a {{daughter}} in March 1840 whom they named Lucy Lamson, {{and a son}} they called Edwin Lamson in August 1842. Within months of Lucy's birth, she was stricken with an unknown illness. Stanton put aside his work and spent the summer at baby Lucy's bedside. She died in late 1841. Edwin, however, was healthy and active. The boy's birth refreshed the spirits in the Stanton household after baby Lucy's death. However, grief would return once again to the Stanton household in 1844. Mary Stanton was left bedridden by a bilious fever. Her condition continued to worsen until she died in March 1844. Stanton's sorrow [...] "verged on insanity", say historians Benjamin P. Thomas and Harold M. Hyman. He had Mary's burial attire redone repeatedly, as he demanded she look <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> when they were wed seven years prior. In the evenings, Stanton would emerge from his room with his {{eyes filled with tears}} and search the house frantically with a lamp, all the while asking, [...] "Where is Mary?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Various transformations were {{effected}} for {{the relatives}} of the Corsini pope in the Palazzo Riario alla Lungara, which had been modified for Christina, queen of Sweden in the previous century but became now the Palazzo Corsini alla Lungara, purchased on 27 July 1736 by Don Neri and Don Bartolomeo Corsini, for 70 thousand scudi from [...] Duke Riario. [...] After Christina's death in 1689, her sculpture gallery and her library were emptied. Fuga {{was called in to}} pull together the 15th and 16th-century amenagements for the Corsini brothers, works which took from 1736 to 1758 before all was finally completed. The Corsini retained Christina's bedroom <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> left it, and the [...] "urban" [...] front in piazza Fiammetta had to be left untouched, but the weight of her library had produced cracks in the vaulting below it, and repairs to the existing structure were not finished until 1738 (Holste). Fuga worked on the garden front of the palazzo, beginning with work on the library wing for Neri Corsini. In 1751-53 he added an identical central block containing a theatrical divided staircase, lit with large windows that looked onto the garden parterres, which had been modified and brought up to date in 1741. Then the two were linked with a ground-floor portico. In the interiors, fuga managed in innovative ways to maintain a separation of the functional service circulation from the suites of parade rooms.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Viki is {{introduced}} to a new man, Sloan Carpenter (Roy Thinnes), who admired Viki's father and Dorian's dead husband, Victor. Sloan writes a biography of Victor entitled, [...] "Lord of The Banner", which implicates Dorian (Strasser, onward) in his death. Dorian is deeply offended by this and wages war on Sloan. Sloan plants seeds of intrigue in Viki's mind, and Viki goes to the Llanview police requesting they reopen the investigation on her father's death. An autopsy of Victor finds pillow threads in his lungs, leading them {{to believe that he}} was smothered with a pillow. Dorian is then assumed to be guilty and brought to trial for the crime. Dorian is found guilty for the murder of Victor Lord—18 years after the fact. Dorian, however, is aided by a young reported, David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) who forged an entry into Irene Manning's diary, implicating Irene in the murder. Dorian is freed and plots revenge against Viki. Dorian seduced Viki's son, Joey Riley Buchanan (Nathan Fillion) and causes a rift between Joey and Viki, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> caused between Victor and Viki almost 20 years before. Viki is even more disturbed when Sloan died in early 1995, shortly after their wedding. Viki confronts Dorian and splits into a new personality, [...] "Jean Randolph", when Dorian reveals to Viki that Victor had molested Viki as a child—a fact which was implied throughout the series, that Viki was not consciously aware of, and that Dorian had always known since her marriage to Victor in the 1970s, when he remarked of such events in his sleep. Jean Randolph imprisoned Dorian in Victor's secret room for months. Eventually, Dorian is released and blackmailed by Jean into (invalidly) marrying David. Viki eventually undergoes therapy, and it is discovered that Viki, not Dorian, had indeed murdered Victor in 1976. This revelation exonerates Dorian from wrongdoing, though she confesses to Viki that she withheld Victor's medication as he suffered from a heart attack (a fact never shown on-screen). Viki and Dorian reconcile, but only temporarily.|$|E

In one of his comics, Katz quips that marriage is a breeze - it's the living together that's so damned hard. Tess is offended, an argument ensues, and Sam announces he no longer can deal with the couple's fraying love life. The time moves forward to the present, and it's time for Tess to accept her award, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> lost the man she loves.|$|R

The woman successfully rehabilitates both, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been.
