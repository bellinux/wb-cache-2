However, he was deemed to have forced Button wide and was handed a five-second penalty {{to be added to}} his <b>finishing</b> <b>time.</b> Lap 53 saw Romain Grosjean move into the final point scoring {{position}} of tenth by passing Carlos Sainz Jr. into turn eight. Just one lap later, he took ninth place from Daniil Kvyat. At the front, Hamilton proved unable to reach his teammate, who took the checkered flag for his sixth win of the season. Kimi Räikkönen completed the podium, followed by Vettel, Pérez and Ricciardo.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the race's {{first week}} and {{beginning}} of its second were three hilly medium-mountain stages. These stages took the Giro through Austria and Switzerland before returning to Italy. Each of these stages took more than five hours to complete, and the rain that fell each day combined with the difficulties presented by the numerous ascents and descents made the courses potentially unsafe in the riders' opinion. This opinion was perhaps validated by the life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo in the eighth stage after he crashed while descending a mountain. While the ninth stage {{was meant to be a}} showy criterium in celebration of this being the 100th anniversary of the Giro d'Italia, the riders collectively protested the safety conditions of that stage and the ones before it. This meant it would be neutralized, with every rider receiving the same <b>finishing</b> <b>time</b> as the stage winner regardless of when they finished.|$|E
5|$|Zersenay {{failed to}} make the podium for a second time at the 2006 World Cross Country Championships, but his fourth-place finish headed the Eritrean team towards silver medal in the team competition. The {{following}} month, Zersenay overcame both Fabiano Joseph and Boniface Kiprop to win the Great Manchester Run. He sprinted to the line with a <b>finishing</b> <b>time</b> of 27:36; an Eritrean record and the second fastest that year. In August that year, he significantly improved his 10,000m best at Memorial Van Damme; his time of 26:37.25 knocked almost thirty seconds off his previous mark, but he still finished behind the emerging Micah Kogo who ran the tenth fastest ever time. A new best of 59:16 by Zersenay at the Rotterdam Half Marathon equalled Samuel Wanjiru's course record and boded well for the upcoming championship race.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We develop {{multi-path}} reservation algorithms for inadvance scheduling {{of large}} file transfers in connection-oriented optical networks. Specifically, {{to schedule a}} single file transfer to complete at the earliest possible time, a new max-flow based greedy algorithm(GOS) and four variants that adapt the k-shortest paths and k-disjoint paths algorithms are proposed. Meanwhile, to find an earliest-finishing schedule for a batch of file transfers, a linear programming based algorithm(BATCH) is developed. Extensive experiments using both real world and random networks show that our GOS algorithm provides a good balance among maximum <b>finish</b> <b>time,</b> average <b>finish</b> <b>time,</b> and computational complexity. Although our BATCH algorithm results in the smallest maximum <b>finish</b> <b>time,</b> this algorithm has a significantly larger computational requirement than our other algorithms. GOS yields file transfer schedules with similar maximum <b>finish</b> <b>time</b> and reduces average <b>finish</b> <b>time</b> while having a significantly less computational requirement. I...|$|R

5|$|Hamilton made a {{pit stop}} on lap 35, coming out behind his teammate, driving {{over the white}} pit exit line in the process. This handed him a five-second time penalty {{to be added to}} his <b>finishing</b> <b>time.</b> Sebastian Vettel came in two laps later, being {{stationary}} for more than 13 seconds due to a problem with the wheelnut of his rear right tyre and came out behind Felipe Massa in fourth place. Meanwhile, Romain Grosjean retired with gearbox issues. Vettel closed the gap to Massa in the last podium position, but was eventually unable to pass the Brazilian, handing Massa his first podium finish of 2015. Toward the end of the race, Pastor Maldonado was racing Max Verstappen for seventh place. Going past the start/finish straight, Maldonado almost lost the rear of his car coming out of the Toro Rosso's slipstream, while Verstappen locked up going into turn one, handing the position to the Lotus driver. Rosberg, who complained about vibrations in his front tyres during the last laps, crossed the finish line three seconds ahead of teammate Hamilton, taking his third victory of the season and the second consecutive one at Spielberg, reducing his championship gap to ten points.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year's {{race was}} the last Giro to be run with a points system. The race saw the first appearance of Costante Girardengo, who won the sixth stage, and would come to dominate the Giro in the future. Carlo Oriani— who had just gotten out of serving the Italian military in the Italo-Turkish War— won the event by six points over the second-place finisher, Eberardo Pavesi. The 1914 Giro d'Italia saw the calculation of the general classification shift from a points system to a time based system. In the new system, every rider's <b>finishing</b> <b>time</b> for each stage is totaled together and the rider with the lowest total time is the overall leader. Out of the eighty-one riders entered the race only eight of them finished. The grueling race was won by Alfonso Calzolari, who won by almost two hours over the second-place finisher. A Giro was planned for 1915, but the plans were scrapped when Italy entered World War I.|$|E
50|$|To reduce {{computational}} load, {{the concept}} of virtual <b>time</b> is introduced. <b>Finish</b> <b>time</b> for each packet is computed on this alternate monotonically increasing virtual timescale.

Using virtual time, it is unnecessary to recompute the <b>finish</b> <b>time</b> for previously queued packets. Although the <b>finish</b> <b>time,</b> in absolute terms, for existing packets is potentially affected by new arrivals, <b>finish</b> <b>time</b> on the virtual time line is unchanged - the virtual time line warps with respect to real time to accommodate any new transmission.|$|R

25|$|Born in the Ethiopian {{capital of}} Addis Ababa, Atsede Habtamu's first {{appearances}} at elite level came about after a {{performance at the}} Ethiopian 20km trials for the 2007 IAAF World Road Running Championships. Her <b>finishing</b> <b>time</b> of 1:11.06 for second place behind Bezunesh Bekele was a surprise result for the unknown athlete. At the World Road Running Championships in Udine, Italy, she was fifth and finished behind Bezunesh who set a national record for the distance and led the Ethiopians to the team silver medal. Her time of 1:08:29 made the 19-year-old Atsede the fastest ever teenager to run the half marathon at that point. She ran at the Delhi Half Marathon two weeks later and led {{through much of the}} race, eventually clocking 1:10:30 to finish as runner-up behind Deriba Alemu. The Great Ethiopian Run the following month was her first major race over 10kilometres, but she faded in the final third of the race and finished in ninth position.|$|E

He was likewise tenth at Vattenfall Cyclassics, in a 34-rider finale. Hushovd turned in a strong ride at the GP Ouest-France, taking fourth place in an odd finish. Sprinter Grega Bole jumped early for the win, while attackers Simon Gerrans and Thomas Voeckler were caught out {{between him and the}} peloton behind for second and third. Hushovd led the peloton across the line for fourth, but all the riders were credited with the same <b>finishing</b> <b>time.</b> Martin took a further two podium placings at Italian races in October. He finished third in the Memorial Marco Pantani, before just missing out on the victory at the fall monument, the Giro di Lombardia. He was the strongest rider in the five-rider chase group that trailed solo winner Oliver Zaugg, and won the sprint to take second overall.

500|$|Sánchez' overall hopes took an {{immediate}} hit. Near {{the end of}} stage 1, two crashes greatly {{reduced the number of}} riders who contested the finish at the Mont des Alouettes.

The second of the two crashes occurred inside , but the first did not, and it was behind that first crash that Sánchez, as well as two-time defending champion Alberto Contador, was caught. As a result of little more than bad luck, Sánchez was immediately a minute and 20 seconds down, in 79th place. The next day, despite extra team time trial training prior to the Tour, the squad finished still finished last of the 22 teams, losing a minute and 22 seconds to the day's winners [...] This dropped Sánchez to 104th place. Sánchez began to climb back up the standings in stage 4, similar in profile to stage 1 as it was largely flat but with an uphill finish. Sánchez took eighth atop the Mûr-de-Bretagne, gaining 47 places in the standings as he took time out of {{the vast majority of the}} field. Sánchez finished close to the front of the race on stage 8 on Super Besse.
