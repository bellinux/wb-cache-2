5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} feeds on a {{diverse range of}} {{invertebrates}} and small vertebrates, though plant matter does constitute {{a major part of}} its diet. It is known to eat beetles, including weevils, rove beetles, and click beetles from the genus Psephus, butterflies, ants from the genera Dorylus and Pachycondyla, grasshoppers, cockroaches from the family Blattidae, earwigs, caterpillars, ant-lions, silverfish, and earthworms. Small lizards, frogs, snails, and slugs are also eaten, as are crabs from the genus Potamon, fruits, flower buds, mosses, and leaves. Fish have also been identified as a prey item in Nigeria. At at least one nesting site, it relies heavily on the arthropods feeding on the bat guano near the cave for sustenance, while this behaviour has been reported to a lesser extent at other sites. It is known to regurgitate what it has eaten <b>in</b> <b>pellet</b> form. Overall, between 52 and 60 percent of the bird's diet is believed to be composed of animals. Rove beetle larvae and ants were the most frequently eaten prey in a study in Nigeria.|$|E

25|$|Apart from distillation, ethanol may be dried by {{addition}} of a desiccant, such as molecular sieves, cellulose, and cornmeal. The desiccants can be dried and reused. Molecular sieves {{can be used to}} selectively absorb the water from the 95.6% ethanol solution. Synthetic zeolite <b>in</b> <b>pellet</b> form can be used, as well as a variety of plant-derived absorbents, including cornmeal, straw, and sawdust. The zeolite bed can be regenerated essentially an unlimited number of times by drying it with a blast of hot carbon dioxide. Cornmeal and other plant-derived absorbents cannot readily be regenerated, but where ethanol is made from grain, they are often available at low cost. Absolute ethanol produced this way has no residual benzene, and can be used to fortify port and sherry in traditional winery operations.|$|E
2500|$|Paintball marker: {{also known}} as a [...] "paintball gun", this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the {{opposing}} player with paintballs. The paintball gun must have a loader or [...] "hopper" [...] or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a compressed-air tank or CO2 tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable silver capsules (12-gram CO2 cartridges) normally seen <b>in</b> <b>pellet</b> guns. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and semi-automatic operation. Further improvements included increased rates of fire; carbon dioxide (CO2) tanks from 3.5 [...] to 40 ounces, and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 5000 PSI. The use of unstable CO2 causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of such markers.|$|E

40|$|Aims To assess {{seasonal}} variation in Redshank diet {{at a major}} passage site, and to compare data derived from analysing pellets or faeces. Methods At the Odiel Marshes <b>in</b> 2001, <b>pellets</b> from spring migration (39), autumn migration (121) and midwinter (15) were analysed, together with faecal samples from autumn (84). Results The abundance of different invertebrate groups <b>in</b> <b>pellets</b> varied between seasons. In spring, Chironomus salinarius pupae and larvae dominated by volume, followed by Ephydridae larvae and the beetle Paracymus aenus. Polychaetes and molluscs dominated in autumn, and isopods in midwinter. In autumn, chironomid larvae, Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum seeds and Artemia cysts were relatively more abundant in faeces, whereas polychaetes, isopods, molluscs and cestode cysticercoids were more abundant <b>in</b> <b>pellets.</b> Harder and/or larger items were thus relatively more abundant <b>in</b> <b>pellets</b> than faeces. Pellet analysis gave more emphasis to mudflat prey, and faeces to saltpan prey. Conclusion Pellet and faecal analysis give different results for wader diet, and {{it is useful to}} combine the two methods. However, they show significant correlations both in diet range and rank abundance of prey items. Redshank diet shows much seasonal and spatial variation in southern Europe. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In a three-step {{development}} process CaCu 3 Ti 4 O 12 -based bulk ceramic pellets, tape-casted multilayer ceramic laminates, and multilayer ceramic capacitors with cofired electrodes were fabricated. The sintering behavior, microstructure, electrical resistivity, and dielectric properties were studied. At a firing temperature of 1050 °C, an effective permittivity of about ε′ = 60 000 and 10 000 was observed for sintered pellets and multilayer laminates, respectively. The typical grain growth observed <b>in</b> <b>pellets</b> is suppressed <b>in</b> multilayer laminates. Impedance spectroscopy {{was employed to}} show that the bulk grain resistivity is similar <b>in</b> <b>pellets</b> and multilayer laminates, but the grain-boundary resistivity is higher <b>in</b> <b>pellets.</b> Tapes were processed into multilayer capacitors with Ag/Pd electrodes and cofired at 1050 °C. All three types of samples, pellets, laminates, and capacitors were also processed with a glass additive, in which case they can be cofired at a lower temperature of 900 °C. <b>In</b> glass-containing <b>pellets,</b> the temperature dependence of permittivity is weak and exhibits X 7 R characteristics for frequencies below ≈ 60 kHz.

40|$|Capsule: Barn Owl pellets {{can be used}} {{to assess}} {{population}} changes in small mammals though with certain important reservations. Aims: To conduct a large-scale, long-term analysis of pellets regurgitated by Barn Owls collected from a defined area of countryside within the UK south Midlands and compare results with those of other studies that have used pellet analysis to investigate the diet of Barn Owls. Methods: Over 61 000 Barn Owl pellets collected over 20 years in the south Midlands of England were analyzed. Results: We recorded a steady increase in the proportion of Field Voles <b>in</b> <b>pellets</b> over time at the expense of Wood Mice, and a positive relationship between various rainfall measures and the proportion of Field Voles <b>in</b> <b>pellets.</b> We suggest that the conclusions of previous studies of the diet of Barn Owls have often been predicated on inconsistent or untenable assumptions. Conclusion: We challenge some of the premises on which Barn Owl pellet analyses have traditionally been based. We do not think that either a shortage of Field Voles <b>in</b> <b>pellets,</b> or of pellets containing the remains of more, smaller prey items, are indicative of foraging difficulty. Barn Owl pellets {{can be used to}} assess population changes in small mammals, so long as possible causes of bias, which we discuss, are acknowledged...|$|R
