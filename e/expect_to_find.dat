5|$|Natural England {{took over}} the role of {{designating}} and managing SSSIs from English Nature in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service. Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the 1974–1996 county system, and as such the same approach is followed here, therefore some sites you may <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in this list could be in the Avon list. The data in the table is taken from English Nature in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI.|$|E
5|$|Due to the lord's {{presence}} in a castle, it was a centre of administration from where he controlled his lands. He relied on the support of those below him, as {{without the support of}} his more powerful tenants a lord could expect his power to be undermined. Successful lords regularly held court with those immediately below them on the social scale, but absentees could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> their influence weakened. Larger lordships could be vast, and it would be impractical for a lord to visit all his properties regularly so deputies were appointed. This especially applied to royalty, who sometimes owned land in different countries.|$|E

5|$|On the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between the hamlet of Asch and Stockach. A third charge succeeded in taking the road, but the Austrian forces reformed the line and the artillery, now at the head of a wedge, bombarded the French troops. In a bayonet charge, the French took the hamlet of Wahlweiss, but Ferino's troops could not hold it and withdrew during the night. Jourdan then ordered a general withdrawal from the region, instructing his divisions to retreat along the lines of march they had followed into the region, and himself establishing a command post at Hornberg. He sent the cavalry to the western side of the Black Forest, where the horses could <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> better forage.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{there were}} 1,000fishermen missing at sea, despite {{warnings}} {{not to leave}} port. After being presumed lost, 162boats returned to port {{four days after the}} storm, and additional fishermen returned over the succeeding days. However, there were 569fishermen killed or left missing due to lost boats at sea. Many of these fishermen had departed days before the storm, and those that survived had transistors in their boats. Lacking advanced warning, many shrimp farmers in remote villages were swept away by waves. Hundreds of dead bodies were discovered along the shore; after they were identified, the corpses were cremated instead of bringing the bodies into local villages. Most of the fatalities on land were the result of buildings collapsing on people who stayed inside. A ferry crossing the Godavari River sank amid rough waves, killing all 42people on board. Overall, the cyclone killed at least 978people in Andhra Pradesh, with 1,375people listed as missing in January 1997. However, the Red Cross did not <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> all of the missing bodies, as some were likely washed into the Bay of Bengal. A later report to the Food and Agriculture Organization indicated there were 1,077confirmed deaths, with an unconfirmed death toll as high as 2,760.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which {{contains}} a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase {{to the east of}} the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.|$|E

25|$|For the PacBio platform, too, {{depending}} on what methylation you <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> coverage needs can vary. As of March 2017, other epigenetic factors like histone modifications have not been discoverable using third-generation technologies.

25|$|The only {{difficulty}} is that most systems like the Hulse–Taylor binary are so far away. The amplitude of waves given off by the Hulse–Taylor binary at Earth would be roughly h ≈ 10−26. There are some sources, however, that astrophysicists <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that produce much greater amplitudes of h ≈ 10−20. At least eight other binary pulsars have been discovered.|$|E

25|$|At 11:55, {{local police}} {{received}} {{reports of a}} helicopter crash. Six minutes later, at 12:01, this was relayed to the national rescue service. Rescue workers, police and fire fighters arrived at the scene at 12:20, and the wreckage was located partially submerged soon after. At 13:15, authorities confirmed that the wreckage had been found, and {{that they did not}} <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> survivors.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, {{it would}} be a mistake to <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the modern fully {{developed}} doctrine of papal primacy in the first centuries, thereby failing to recognize the Church's historical reality.

25|$|Decompression {{procedures}} {{may take}} into account that the cave diver usually follows a very rigidly constrained and precisely defined route, both {{into and out of the}} cave, and can reasonably <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> any equipment such as drop cylinders temporarily stored along the guideline while making the exit. In some caves, changes of depth of the cave along the dive route will constrain decompression depths, and gas mixtures and decompression schedules can be tailored to take this into account.|$|E
60|$|Washington reconnoitred the British posts {{from various}} points of view. Everything about them was in admirable order.

He had <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> some degree of system and discipline; whereas all were raw militia.

25|$|Delaware's largest {{employer}} is also Dover's – the state government. A large portion, but not all, of the state's bureaucracy {{is located in}} and around Dover. However, like some other American states, Delaware's capital is not its largest city. Consequently, Wilmington, {{in the northern part}} of the state and its largest city, has many state offices and employees one would normally <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in the state capital, including the headquarters of the Office of the Attorney General, especially as many large American corporations maintain nominal offices in that city to register their Delaware corporation.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Medical Equipments in the Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MOHME) is {{responsible}} for supervising imports in this segment, but the import and distribution of such equipment is mostly handled by the private sector. Iran has undergone the primary stages of development in terms of industrialisation and a rather strong indigenous manufacturing capability exists in the country. Therefore, one can <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a handful of local producers for basic medical equipment, making {{it very hard to}} penetrate into the Iranian market for similar imported ones.|$|E
25|$|It {{is in the}} gospels, however, {{that the}} analogy between the Latin Vulgate and the Syriac Vulgate can be {{established}} by evidence. If the Peshitta {{is the result of}} a revision as the Vulgate was, then we may <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Old Syriac texts answering to the Old Latin. Such texts have actually been found: three texts have been recovered, all showing divergences from the Peshitta, and believed by competent scholars to be older than it, and therefore better translations for use in text criticism. These are, to take them in the order of their recovery, (1) the Curetonian Syriac, (2) the Syriac of Tatian's Diatessaron, and (3) the Sinaitic Syriac.|$|E

25|$|For a {{long time}} {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were made to}} detect a link between Australian and Papuan languages, the latter being represented by those spoken on the coastal areas of New Guinea facing the Torres Strait and the Arafura Sea. In 1986 William A. Foley noted lexical similarities between Robert M. W. Dixon's 1980 reconstruction of proto-Australian and the East New Guinea Highlands languages. He believed that it was naïve to <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a single Papuan or Australian language family when New Guinea and Australia had been a single landmass (called the Sahul continent) for most of their human history, having been separated by the Torres Strait only 8000 years ago, and that a deep reconstruction would likely include languages from both. Dixon, in the meantime, later abandoned his proto-Australian proposal.|$|E
25|$|The Neutral Nation {{formed a}} league of eight hundred Upper Algonquians in 1653. This league was located {{southwest}} of Skenchioe, near a Fox {{village in the}} Flat Country of The Thumb, Michigan. The Cat Nation Neighbored the Upper Algonquians {{to the east and}} scattered around the southern shore of Lake Erie. From the other direction, kindred Kentaientonga villages were destroyed by Iroquois as they told to the French years afterward. At Le Chine in 1669 at Montreal Island, La Salle was told to <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Chaouanon (Algonquian) and Honniasontkeronon (Iroquois) villages on the Ohio above the falls or above Louisville, Kentucky. Exploration information was seldom shared between different European nations. The Andasté (Chiroenhaka) found on maps as Calicuas territory impeded the New York Haudenosaunee and the French Canadien trade in this region at the time.|$|E
25|$|Dave Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the two paramedics {{who were}} called {{to the scene of}} Kelly's death, have since gone public with their opinion that there was not enough blood at the {{location}} to justify the belief that he had died from blood loss. Bartlett and Hunt told The Guardian that they had seen a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly's body and a patch of blood the size of a coin on his trousers. They said they would <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> several pints of blood at the scene of a suicide involving an arterial cut. Two forensic pathologists, Chris Milroy of Sheffield University and Guy Rutty of Leicester University, dismissed the paramedics' claims, saying it is hard to judge blood loss from the scene of a death, as some blood may have seeped into the ground. Milroy also told The Guardian that Kelly's heart condition may have made it hard for him to sustain any significant degree of blood loss.|$|E
