5|$|Its fourth artistic {{director}} Chris Coleman {{took over in}} May 2000, and recruited experienced actors to the company. Coleman had previously co-founded Actor's Express in Atlanta, Georgia, and was the {{artistic director}} there. Coleman initially signed on for a three-year contract. Before Coleman began as artistic director with PCS, the company was already the largest live theater production company in Portland. However, the organization was facing sporadic attendance at performances as well as financial difficulties, with a deficit {{at the end of}} 1999 of $700,000. In 2000 PCS had a deficit of $880,000 and a base of 10,000 subscribers. The financial position of the company later stabilized, and Coleman had a 2000 budget of $3.2million to work with when he came on. A 2003 consultant's report, however, found that PCS relied more heavily on gifts and grants to fund its operations than <b>its</b> <b>peers</b> around the company.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{called the}} General Assembly into special session in February 1917. At issue was reformation of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt {{unjustly}} burdened agricultural interests. The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually. Though Kentucky was {{in better shape}} financially than many of <b>its</b> <b>peers,</b> Stanley still sought to balance the budget. The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed {{of many of the}} bills he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by M. M. Logan. Additional taxes were passed on distilled spirits, oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses. Assessments on the value of property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of fair market price, rose dramatically. To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property. With the dramatic increase in funds yielded by the special session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education. The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.|$|E

40|$|Other {{than three}} {{extensively}} researched earnings thresholds, avoiding earnings declines, avoiding negative earnings and avoiding negative earnings surprises (Burgstahler and Dichev 1997; Degeorge, Patel, and Zeckhauser 1999), peer performance {{is an additional}} threshold that is often mentioned in news reports, compensation contracts and analysts’ reports, while largely ignored in the academic research. Thus, I examine whether firms manage earnings to achieve peer performance. First, I examine accruals-based earnings management to achieve peer performance. The empirical results show that firms exhibit more income-increasing accruals management in the current year under the following situations: 1) when firms’ prior year performance is below that of their peer group; 2) when firms’ average performance over the prior two years is below that of <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group; 3) when firms’ expected performance is below <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group’s expected performance. In addition, firms with cumulative performance that is {{lower than that of}} <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group through the first three quarters of the fiscal year exhibit more upward accruals management in the fourth quarter. Second, I investigate real activities manipulation to achieve peer performance. The empirical results show that that firms exhibit more income-increasing real activities manipulation in the current year under the following situations: 1) when firms’ prior year performance is below that of their peer group; 2) when firms’ average performance over the prior two years is below that of <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group. Third, firms that are under pressure to achieve peer performance benchmarks tend to restate financial statements in subsequent years. Specifically, firms under the following four situations are more likely to restate current earnings in the future: 1) firm’s prior year performance is below that of <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group; 2) firm’s average performance over the prior two years is below that of <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group; 3) firm’s expected performance is below that of <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group; and 4) firm’s cumulative performance for the first three fiscal quarters is below that of <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group. The influence of peer performance on earnings management behavior implies that relative performance evaluation can induce income-increasing earnings management and subsequent restatements...|$|R

But Benefis also said its costs fell 2 percent in the 2008-2009 period, and another 8 percent in 2010. Benefis denied the accusation, saying the 16 percent figure was overstated because much of that number came from a discontinuation of health care price breaks the health system used to provide. Benefis officials also said their charges for inpatient care were still 2.6 percent below those of <b>its</b> <b>peers,</b> while charges for outpatient service were 29.2 percent lower.

25|$|Another {{factor for}} the losses was poor revenue management. MAS {{substantially}} lagged <b>its</b> <b>peers</b> on yield. Some of this gap was {{due to differences in}} traffic mix, with less business traffic to and from Malaysia than to and from Singapore, but much of it was due to weaknesses in pricing and revenue management, sales and distribution, brand presence in foreign markets, and alliance base. Morever, MAS had one of the lowest labour costs per available seat kilometres (ASK) at USD0.41, compared to other airlines such as Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines at USD0.59 and USD0.60 respectively. Despite low labour costs, however, the ratio of ASK revenue to this cost was, at 2.8, much lower than Singapore Airlines, where the ratio is 5.0, and slightly higher than Thai Airways There are other factors listed in the later-revealed Business Turnaround Plan of Malaysia Airlines, all leading to the net loss of RM1.3 billion in the year 2005.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} interest in deploying data mining methods for fault detection. For the case where we have potentially large numbers of devices to monitor, we propose to use peer group analysis to identify faults. First, we identify the peer group of each device. This consists of other devices that have behaved similarly. We then monitor the behaviour of a device by measuring how well the peer group tracks the device. Should the device’s behaviour deviate strongly from <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group we flag the behaviour as an outlier. An outlier is used to indicate the potential occurrence of a fault. A device exhibiting outlier behaviour from <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group need not be an outlier to the population of devices. Indeed a device exhibiting behaviour typical for the population of devices might deviate sufficiently far from <b>its</b> <b>peer</b> group to be flagged as an outlier. We demonstrate the usefulness of this property for detecting faults by monitoring the data output from a collection of privately run weather stations across the UK...|$|R
