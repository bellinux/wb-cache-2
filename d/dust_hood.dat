40|$|NIOSH {{continues}} to conduct respirable dust control research for surface mine blasthole drilling operations. Research areas have included testing variables (shroud leakage area, drill deck cross-sectional area, shroud height, collector-to-bailing airflow ratio, etc.) {{that have the}} most impact on respirable dust control, development of a <b>dust</b> collector inlet <b>hood,</b> development of a dust collector dump point shroud, and testing of a small diameter water separating sub. This paper summarizes the results of the aforementioned research that has been completed. Additionally, past dust control research for drilling operations of both underground and surface mines completed by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, created in 1910 and incorporated into NIOSH in 1997, is reviewed...|$|R
5000|$|His 2006 GMC Envoy {{was found}} {{abandoned}} on the Bear Mountain Bridge on June 10, 2008 {{with the following}} written in <b>dust</b> on the <b>hood,</b> [...] "Suicide is Painless," [...] {{the title of the}} theme song for both the movie and TV series M*A*S*H. Police suspected that this was an attempt by Israel to fake his own death in order to avoid prison. Israel's girlfriend, Debra Ryan, was arrested later that same month for aiding and abetting his escape, and was released on bail. According to police, Ryan admitted that she and Israel parked an RV loaded with Israel's belongings near Bear Mountain Bridge on the day before his disappearance. The pair were featured on America's Most Wanted.|$|R
40|$|The 1956, 1971, and 1973 major {{dust storms}} on Mars {{affected}} the apparent contrast {{and extent of}} the northern polar hood. A survey of photography from seven apparitions indicates that this seasonal feature is consistently prominent and identified {{in the absence of}} major storms throughout half of the Martian year. During the 1956 <b>dust</b> storm, the <b>hood</b> was not seen for a period of over one month on Lowell photographs. The effects of a storm are also seen in 1971 International Planetary Patrol photographs; the hood quickly became faint and tenuous even in ultraviolet light, which normally shows it as very bright. Patrol photographs of 1973 cover the complete progression from a prominent and extensive hood before the storm, to an intermittent disappearance {{at the height of the}} storm, to the subsequent return of a normal hood as the storm died out...|$|R
40|$|In present scenario, {{transportation}} {{is one of}} the major requirements of the people for transportation of goods or self from one place to a different place. For a physically disabled or a debilitated person, {{transportation is}} a major hindrance and so the mobility of physically disabled people is among the great concern of the human civilization. It is really very hard to realize the problems and sorrows of a physically disabled or debilitated person who is dependent on others or is confined on a wheel chair with a limited mobility. In India, the contemporarily modified scooters used by the physically disabled people for transportation are not ergonomic and do not provide protection from adverse weather conditions which can be more dangerous for physically disabled people compared to the normal person while driving. It is very risky and uncomfortable to drive such modified scooters during the rain or in other adverse weather conditions. It is also difficult for physically disabled person to ride the three wheel scooter for a longer duration. This project focuses at providing a feasible designsolution in form of a user friendly three wheel scooter, which allows physically challenged or debilitated person with partial disability to commute themselves and perform their activities without anyoneâ€™s assistance. Problems were identified by the survey regarding the dimensions. Major issues like seat height, ground clearance etc, ereutilized to develop the concepts and its selection. Then the detailed design of the selected concept was carried out using CATIA. The designed scooter will be ergonomically suiting disabled person in comparison to the conventionally modified scooters used by them. The improved design of the scooter was also incorporated with a foldable hood which will provide protection to the rider from adverse weather conditions and <b>dust.</b> This <b>hood</b> can be used to cover the scooter or uncover the user and the scooter as well. The seats of the conventional scooters are not suitable for the physically handicapped riders ergonomically. This scooter will also consist of the optimized seating for physically disabled person which provides greater comfort, making it more easy and comfortable to ride. Subjective analysis has been carried out for this purpose. After completing the CATIA model, a prototype model was build with rapid prototyping...|$|R
