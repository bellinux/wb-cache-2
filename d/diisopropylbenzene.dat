40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} properties of the IM- 12 to address a catalyst for acidic conversion reaction of larger organic molecules. The acidic characteristics of the IM- 12 are investigated by density functional theory (DFT) considering both the local density and generalized gradient approximations, LDA and GGA, respectively. Based on quantum mechanical (QM) calculation results, we find that the zeolite with All element prefers the tetrahedral (T) sites, T 4 and T 6, when replacing Si in IM- 12 framework. Isomorphously substituted IM- 12 on the T 4 and T 6 sites by B, Al, and Ga is studied, respectively. Both of the sites give the Bronsted acidity order: B-IM- 12 < Ga-IM- 12 < Al-IM- 12, which is the same as other zeolites. The calculated NH 3 adsorption energies are compared with the calculated and experimental results of H-[Al]MOR [M. Elanany, D. P. Vercauteren, M. Koyama, M. Kubo, P. Selvam, E. Broclawik, A. Miyamoto, J. Mol. Catal. A 243 (2006) 1; C. Lee, D. J. Parrillo, R. J. Gorte, W. E. Farneth, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 118 (1996) 3262]. Molecular dynamics (MD) results show that IM- 12 zeolite allows the large molecules such as <b>diisopropylbenzene</b> (DIPB) and triisopropylbellzene (TIPB) to diffuse faster than those in MOR zeolite and IM- 12 may have significant selectivity for TIPB over DIPB. We conclude that the IM- 12 with At impurity would be a good candidate for large organic molecule acidic conversion reaction. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{catalytic}} {{synthesis of}} hydroquinoneutilize benzene {{as the starting}} material. The manufacture of hydroquinone by oxidation of phenol and 1, 2 - <b>diisopropylbenzene.</b> The first route begin with Friedel-Crafts alkylation of petroleum â€“derived benzene to afford cumene. Subsequent Hock-type, air oxidation of the cumene leads to formation of acetone and phenol. The phenol is oxidized by using 70 %hydrogen peroxide either {{in the presence of}} transition metal or in formic acid solution where formic acid is the actual oxidant. The generated catechol and hydroquinone mixture is separated into its pure components by distillations. The second synthesis way, which is also manufactured, is the reaction with propene and benzene to 1, 4 -diisopropylbenzene, which reacts afterwards to the hydroquinone. Nevertheless there are more than this two synthetic routes benzene reacts to nitrobenzene by using HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 and after that to the corresponding aniline. Next, benzoquinone is synthesized by a route employing stoichiometric amounts of MnO 2 to oxidize aniline, followed by iron catalyzed reduction to the corresponding hydroquinone. While benzene is a volatile carcinogen derived from non-renewable fossil fuel feed stocks, an alternative way to hydroquinone has been elaborated. Glucose is nonvolatile, nontoxic, and derived from renewable plant polysacharrides and plays an important role for these benzene free 3 -dehydroshikimic acid (DHS). Shikimicacid as well as quinic acid are known for the hydroquinone Synthesis. In this work the starting material for the hydroquinone synthesis usin...|$|E
30|$|Reinsch first {{isolated}} C in 1839 by distilling catechin (from catechu, {{the juice}} of Mimosa catechu (Acacia catechu L.f)). The pyrocatechol is {{formed by the}} heating of catechin above its decomposition point. C is produced industrially by the hydroxylation of P using hydrogen peroxide [9]. C has also been produced by the hydrolysis of 2 -substituted phenols, especially 2 -chlorphenol, with hot aqueous solutions containing alkali metal hydroxides. Its methyl ether derivative, guaiacol, converts to C via hydrolysis of the CH 3 -O bond as promoted by hydriodic acid. R is obtained by fusing many resins (galbanum, asafoetida, etc.) with potassium hydroxide or by the distillation of brazilwood extract. It may be prepared synthetically by fusing 3 -iodophenol, phenol- 3 -sulfonic acid, or benzene- 1, 3 -disulfonic acid with potassium carbonate; {{by the action of}} nitrous acid on 3 -aminophenol; or by the action of 10 % HCl on 1, 3 -diaminobenzene [10]. Many ortho- and para-compounds of the aromatic series (for example, the bromophenols, benzene-para-disulfonic acid) also yield R by fusion with potassium hydroxide. HQ is obtained from few methods: oxidation of aniline with manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid, followed by reduction with iron dust and water [11]. The second method consists of the alkylation of benzene with propylene to produce a mixture of <b>diisopropylbenzene</b> isomers from which, in a first step, the para-isomer is isolated. This is oxidized with oxygen to produce the corresponding dihydroperoxide, which is treated with an acid to produce HQ and acetone [12]. Finally, the oxidation of P with hydrogen peroxide can be used to produce a mixture of products from which both HQ and C (1, 2 -dihydroxybenzene) can be isolated [12].|$|E
40|$|Cesium Recovery from Ores. Adaptation of the phenol {{extraction}} (Phenex) {{process to}} {{the recovery of}} cesium from ore leach liquors continued to show promise. In roast-leach tests, 98 to 99 % of the cesium was dissolved from pollucite ore by roasting the ore at 800 deg C with 1. 8 parts of Na/sub 2 /CO/sub 3 / plus 1. 2 parts of NaCl and leaching with water. More than 99 % of the cesium was recovered from the leach liquor and separated from other alkali metals by extracting with 4 -sec-butyl- 2 -(alpha -methylbenzyl) phenol (BAMBP) in <b>diisopropylbenzene</b> and stripping with hydrochloric acid. Santophen- 1 also extracted cesium effectively, but, because of the limited solubility of the cesiumSantophen- 1 complex in the diluent, the utility of this phenol in ore processing is questionable. Separation of Alkali Metals. The extraction and separation of alkali metals from nitrate solutions was studied with several different types of extractants, including substituted phenols, alkylphosphoric acids, sulfonic acids, carboxylic acids, and mixtures of some of these. With all of these reagents, cesium was extracted more strongly than rubidium, which in turn was extracted more strongly than the other alkali metals. Separation factors were higher with the phenols than with the other extractants. Acid Recovery by Amine Extraction. Preliminary tests showed the potential usefulness of tertiary amines for recovering and purifying phosphoric acid from the highly contaminated wet-process acid produced in the fertilizer industry. Water stripping of the amine solvent yielded a product {{that was more than}} 1. 5 M in H/ sub 2 /PO/sub 6 / and was almost free of iron and aluminum. Final-Cycle Plutonium Recovery by Amine Extraction. Batch equilibration tests with both aged and fresh samples of Purex-plant 1 BP solution showed that the aged but not the fresh samples contained a considerable quantity of zirconium-niobium species highly extractable by the hydrocarbon diluents used with amines and other extractants. The amounts of zirconium-niobium extractable from the aged solution were sufficient to account for the low decontamination previously obtained when aged plant 1 BP solution was used to continuous countercurrent testing of the plutonium- recovery flowsheets. Individual and batch cascade tests with the fresh plant solution showed separation and decontamination factors high enough for use in the projected process. Extraction of Lanthanides and Transplutoniums by Dialkylphosphoric Acids. The behavior of americium and curium relative to the lanthanides in extraction by di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) from carboxylic acids was shifted from the behavior in extractions from mineral acids, where americium is similar to promethium. The shift was greatest in extractions from oxydiacetic acid, where cerium was 4 times as extractable as americium, while differences within the element groups were very small. Extractions from nitric acid were increased by adding glycine (aminoacetic acid). Extractions were greatly reduced by adding a phenol to HDEHP. Ditridecylphosphoric acid (HDTDP) was a stronger extractant than HDEHP and gave smaller differences beplease delete the above abstract 1799...|$|E
