5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|In most {{variations}} Black has {{the opportunity}} to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced to take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black that fully compensates the loss of the bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E

25|$|A {{player who}} {{declares}} {{for the draft}} will lose his college eligibility, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not drafted, if he signs with any agent. Before 2016, the NCAA only allowed a player to enter the draft once without losing eligibility, but current NCAA rules now allow players to declare for and withdraw from multiple drafts while retaining college eligibility. The CBA allows a player to withdraw twice.|$|E
25|$|The first attempt, an {{unsuccessful}} one, at gene therapy (as {{well as the}} first case of medical transfer of foreign genes into humans not counting organ transplantation) was performed by Martin Cline on 10 July 1980. Cline claimed {{that one of the}} genes in his patients was active six months later, though he never published this data or had it verified and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> correct, it's unlikely it produced any significant beneficial effects treating beta-thalassemia.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rest}} of the book Ehrlich {{discusses}} things which readers can do to help. This is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests, which he believed were not politically possible in 1968. At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, so that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E

25|$|This {{principle}} generalizes {{the notion}} of an inertial frame. For example, an observer confined in a free-falling lift will assert that he himself is a valid inertial frame, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> accelerating under gravity, so long as he has no knowledge about anything outside the lift. So, strictly speaking, inertial frame is a relative concept. With this in mind, we can define inertial frames collectively as a set of frames which are stationary or moving at constant velocity with respect to each other, so that a single inertial frame is defined as an element of this set.|$|E
25|$|As a Google search shows, {{the phrase}} ad orientem is today much more {{commonly}} used to describe a particular orientation of a priest in Christian liturgy, facing the apse or wall behind the altar, with priest and people looking in the same direction, {{as opposed to the}} versus populum orientation, in which the priest faces the congregation. In this use, the phrase is not necessarily related to the geographical direction in which the priest is looking and is employed <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> not facing to the east or even has his back to the east.|$|E
25|$|Billy's levels {{involve a}} degree of stealth. Unlike Ray, Billy can move totally silently whilst in sneak mode, and can hide in bushes and shadows. When he does so, he is hidden from enemy sight, and his {{character}} icon on the HUD is blacked out to show he cannot be seen. Often, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> seen, if he can hide quickly enough, he will escape permanent detection. Both Billy and Ray can also ride horses during the game, from which they can shoot, jump large distances and enter gallop mode. Gallop mode can only be maintained for {{a certain amount of}} time, however, before the horse becomes tired.|$|E

25|$|Some {{modifications}} to STV {{have been proposed}} in order to pass monotonicity and other criteria. The most common method of proposed modification to STV is to alter {{the order in which}} candidates are eliminated: theoretically, a candidate who ranked second on every ballot could be the first candidate eliminated <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> a Condorcet winner. Meek noted this problem in proposing his variation of transferring votes to nearly eliminate tactical voting in STV, however Meek himself did not propose a method for satisfying the Condorcet criterion. Other theorists have proposed further refinements of STV, such as using a Condorcet method to rank candidates for elimination order. Some of these modifications alter STV in a way such that it no longer reduces to instant-runoff voting when applied to a single seat but instead reduces to some other single winner system, such as a Condorcet method.|$|E
25|$|The {{driver of}} the car Barry crashed into, Gustavo Castillo Gutierrez (born June 28, 1988), was arrested on {{criminal}} complaints of manslaughter, causing an accident while operating a vehicle without a driver's license, and making an illegal U-turn. He was also charged with possession of a controlled dangerous substance when jailers found a one-half gram bag of cocaine in Gutierrez's possession. Gutierrez was placed on an immigration hold at the Oklahoma County Jail until his legal status in the United States was determined, prohibiting him from being released <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> able to post a set $18,500 bond. Gutierrez was formally arraigned on the multiple complaints on June 22, appearing before a judge via video link from the jail facility; a court date will be set for Gutierrez upon filing of charges against him. Gutierrez was deported from the United States thrice before this fatal accident. A public memorial service for Barry was held on June 26, 2015 at Crossings Community Church in Oklahoma City.|$|E
25|$|Edmonds later (to Liddell Hart in 1937 {{and in his}} own {{unpublished}} memoirs) told {{an exaggerated}} version of these events, that Wilson had stitched up the job for himself whilst acting as Director of Staff Duties, by recommending May ("a really stupid Irishman") for the job and placing himself as the second recommendation. Tim Travers (in The Killing Ground, 1987) used this story to help {{paint a picture of}} a prewar Army highly dependent on patronage for senior appointments. John Hussey, in his research into the matter, described Wilson’s appointment as “a collegiate decision about a difficult but suitable man” and dismisses Edmonds’ story as “worthless as evidence to prove anything about the structural defects of the old Army”. Keith Jeffrey argues that Travers’ argument is not entirely without substance – <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> misinformed about this particular incident – and that Wilson’s career took place at “a transitional period” in which the Army was becoming more professionalised, so that Lyttelton was not able to use patronage to appoint May, his preferred candidate.|$|E

25|$|An {{application}} {{for permission to}} bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in July 2015, with a hearing held on 26 January 2016. The application {{was made in the}} hopes of reducing Rahman incapacity from holding elective office from five years to three years. While maintaining that many of the election court findings are wrong, the application acknolwedged that challenges may only be made on those conclusions which amount to error of law. The court findings that canvassers were paid in contravention of section 111 of the 1983 Act, and that Rahman is guilty of bribery personally and by his agent in contravention of section 113 were challenged on the basis that they were reached without any sufficient evidence such that it amounts to an error of law, and that the Commissioner erred when interpretating the provision on bribery. A challenge was made to the finding of undue spiritual influence on the basis that the Commissioner conclusion was in contravention to authority, and incompatible with Article 9 or Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or both. The divisional court of Lloyd LJ and Supperstone J granted Rahman permission to launch a judicial review on the undue spiritual influence finding because the law had not been tested for over a century, but rejected the other two challenges, as a result leaving in place Rahman's five years ban from elective office <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> successful in a judicial review. The judicial review application was closed following the non-payment of court fee.|$|E
500|$|Kurt (Chris Colfer) gives Rachel a make-over, {{ostensibly to}} help her attract Finn, but in reality {{attempting}} to sabotage her chances with him. Finn is unimpressed with Rachel's new look before telling her he remembered having the conversation with Kurt about what he liked in girls. Rachel confronts Kurt, stating that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> in love with Finn, she will always {{have a better chance}} [...] "because [...] a girl". But Kurt tells her that they are both kidding themselves: Finn is in love with Quinn and nothing will change that.|$|E

There is an uncomfortable tension {{in his attempt to}} abandon the past and racial definitions in order to move into the future. Though the story has been traditionally read as having a happy ending, Wachtell emphasizes that 'Liza has no final lines which show her response to the husband who had forgotten her. Henry B. Wonham notes a significance to Ryder's referring to 'Liza not simply as wife but [...] "the wife of my youth", as if dissociating from her even as he acknowledges her.|$|E

500|$|Other {{than his}} brief {{mention in the}} Analects, nothing is concretely known of Zuo Qiuming's life or identity, nor of what {{connection}} he might have with the Zuo zhuan. [...] This traditional assumption that the title's [...] "Master Zuo" [...] refers to the Zuo Qiuming of the Analects {{is not based on}} any specific evidence, and was challenged by scholars as early as the 8th century. [...] <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the [...] "Zuo" [...] referenced in the Zuo zhuans title, this attribution is questionable because the Zuo zhuan describes events from the late Spring and Autumn period that the Zuo Qiuming of the Analects could not have known.|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare {{constantly}} {{reflects on}} the problem of synecdoche in his plays, a rhetorical term meaning [...] "the part representing the whole". For example, in Henry V, Shakespeare's has the Prologue beg forgiveness of the audience for attempting to portray an entire army with a few men, and for portraying so great a man as the King with a feeble actor. Shakespeare explores these same problems through Robin Starveling. The Mechanicals' decision to use Robin as moonlight in place of actual moonlight delves into the problem of synecdoche, of trying to represent something greater than yourself. Robin's standing there, attempting to be moonshine, does not make him so, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> holding a lantern to represent at least a part of the Moon. Similarly, Shakespeare seems to be arguing that no representation of anything in a play can really be completely real or truthful, no matter how hard its players may try. Rather than begging forgiveness of the viewer, he is exaggerating the problem for their entertainment.|$|E
500|$|In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus {{recalls the}} commandment, [...] "You shall not kill" [...] and then adds to it the proscriptions against anger, hatred and vengeance. Going further, Christ asks his disciples to love their enemies. The Catechism asserts that [...] "it is {{legitimate}} {{to insist on}} respect for one's own right to life." [...] Kreeft says, [...] "self-defense is legitimate {{for the same reason}} suicide is not: because one's own life is a gift from God, a treasure we are responsible for preserving and defending." [...] The Catechism teaches that [...] "someone who defends his life is not guilty of murder <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> forced to deal his aggressor a lethal blow." [...] Legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty for one who is responsible for the lives of others. The defense of the common good requires that an unjust aggressor be rendered unable to cause harm. For this reason, those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility.|$|E
