Bacon's influence can be seen in Peckham's works on optics (the Perspectiva communis) and astronomy.|$|E

5|$|As a tyrannosaurid, Albertosaurus was a bipedal {{predator}} with tiny, two-fingered {{hands and}} a massive head that had dozens of large, sharp teeth.

While Albertosaurus was large for a theropod, it was much smaller than its larger and more famous relative Tyrannosaurus rex, growing nine to ten meters long and weighing less than possibly 2 metric tons.|$|E

5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable where American alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death. Only nine fatal attacks occurred in the United States throughout the 1970s–1990s, but American alligators killed 12 people between 2001 and 2007. In May 2006, American alligators killed three Floridians {{in less than a}} week. There <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> least 28 fatal attacks by American alligators in the United States since 1970.|$|E
5|$|Before Edward the Confessor became king of England, he was exiled to the continent. Leofric {{served as}} Edward's chaplain, {{although}} how or when exactly {{the two met}} is unknown. The historian Frank Barlow speculates that it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> Bruges in 1039. When Edward returned to England {{at the invitation of}} King Harthacnut, Edward's half-brother, Leofric accompanied him, witnessing charters during Harthacnut's lifetime along with Herman who later became Bishop of Sherborne. Leofric remained a close supporter and friend of Edward for the king's entire life. In 1044, Edward granted him lands at Dawlish in Devon.|$|E
5|$|Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is a {{recreational}} drug with euphoriant and stimulant properties. The effects produced by BZP {{are comparable to}} those produced by amphetamine. Adverse effects have been reported following its use including acute psychosis, renal toxicity and seizures. No deaths have been reported following a sole ingestion of BZP, although there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> least two deaths from the combination of BZP and MDMA.

5|$|Bridgwater is {{mentioned}} {{both in the}} Domesday Book and in the earlier Anglo-Saxon Chronicle dating from around 800, owing its origin as a trade centre to its position {{at the mouth of}} the chief river in Somerset. It was formerly part of the Hundred of North Petherton. In a legend of Alfred the Great, he burnt some cakes while hiding in the marshes of Athelney near Bridgwater, after the Danish invasion in 875, while in 878 the major engagement of the Battle of Cynwit may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> nearby Cannington.|$|E

The available facilities of the house are rented out for business conferences, parties and weddings. In 2013 a fire damaged the northern wing. It was contained by Avon Fire and Rescue Service, otherwise the rest of the building would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> risk.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Anna's life or his reign, as few records have survived from this period. In 631 he may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>at</b> Exning, close to the Devil's Dyke.

Upon his return from exile, Cenwalh re-established Christianity in his own kingdom {{and the people of}} Wessex then remained firmly Christian.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with manganism, a rare neurological disorder associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation.

The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.|$|E
