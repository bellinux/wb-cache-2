50|$|In nature, {{the fungus}} forms {{a network of}} thread-like {{mycelium}} that penetrates the substratum on which it grows, and then after 3-5 days of growth begins to reproduce asexually with small (2-10 µm) conidia (asexual spores). These conidia are probably the main infectious particles produced by the fungus. They form on individual short stalks and readily become airborne when the colony is disturbed; their size places them well within the respirable size range for particles, meaning that they can deposit deeply in the lungs when inhaled. Sexual reproduction by the fungus requires the meeting of colonies of + and - mating type, probably a relatively rare event, and results {{in the production of}} small ascomata (sexual fruiting bodies) 200-350 µm, looking, to the naked eye, similar to a woollen <b>fuzz</b> <b>ball,</b> and in microscopic view consisting of a layer of spiralling, springy guard hairs surrounding a fertile core in which groups of 8 ascospores (sexual spores) are produced in small round reproductive sacs (asci). The ascospores, at 1.5-2.0 µm, are among the smallest reproductive particles produced by fungi, and are within the respirable size range. The budding yeast cells seen in infected tissues and bodily fluids are generally relatively large (ca. 8-15 µm) and characteristically bud through a broad base or neck, making them highly recognizable to the pathologist. A small (“nanic”) form is rarely seen with cells under 6 µm.|$|E
40|$|We study {{stars in}} M theory. First, we obtain the analog of Oppenheimer [...] Volkoff {{equations}} in a suitably general set up. We obtain analytically the asymptotic solutions to these equations when the equations of state are linear. We study perturbations around such solutions in several examples and, following a standard method, use their behaviour {{to determine whether}} an instability is present or not. In this way, we obtain a generalisation of the corresponding results of Chavanis. We also find that stars in M theory have instabilities. Therefore, if sufficiently massive, such stars will collapse. We discuss {{the significance of these}} (in) stabilities within the context of Mathur's <b>fuzz</b> <b>ball</b> proposal. Comment: 40 pages. Version 2 : Several minor changes in the text. Version 3 : Two paragraphs added and a few minor changes made in section 6. To appear in Physical Review...|$|E
40|$|Assume {{that there}} exists a {{fundamental}} theory of gravity which has a fundamental length scale and which is capable of explaining black hole evolution process fully in terms of fundamental microscopic degrees of freedom. The resultant evolution will clearly be unitary and will have no information loss. Carrying this assumption to its logical conclusion and, in particular, by considering {{the size of the}} region obtained by resolving the black hole singularity in such a theory, we arrive at a scenario very similar to that in Mathur's <b>fuzz</b> <b>ball</b> proposal where there is no horizon. We also comment on the consistency of such a picture with the recent results of Almheiri et al. Comment: 13 pages. Version 2 : A footnote + a few minor changes added, mentioning a point which was left implicit. Version 3 : A reference added. Version 4 : d dependence is restored in formulas where d = 4 was assumed implicitl...|$|E

[...] Most of Toy-Box's videos {{could be considered}} cartoonish, but [...] "Teddy Bear" [...] is a more realistic video. While [...] "Best Friend" [...] features Amir and Anila having a neon sword fight and turning into little <b>fuzz</b> <b>balls,</b> [...] "The Sailor Song" [...] showed several men flying off a boat, and [...] "Tarzan and Jane" [...] featured live monkeys and elephants in a cartoon parody, [...] "Teddy Bear" [...] is set in Paris and showed Amir and Anila in a more romantic way than the other videos.|$|R
