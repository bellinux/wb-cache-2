40|$|ABSTRACT. In the {{production}} of logic circuits in dual <b>inline</b> <b>packages,</b> various tedious assembly line tasks are performed by human operators using microscopes or television enlargements. One boring and difficult task is the detection of bent fingers in lead bonding frames to which integrated circuit chips are subsequently bonded. Bent fingers can cause stresses which may eventually lead {{to the failure of}} circuits. This. paper discusses the inspection problem and presents a computerized bent finger detection method which could be adapted to free human operators from this task. More immediately, it presents a method of examining an object and determining {{whether or not it is}} in focus based solely on inspection of the object's digitized light intensity profiles...|$|R
40|$|On {{or about}} November 10, 1988 an open circuit solder joint was {{discovered}} in the Magellan Radar digital unit (DFU) during integration testing at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). A {{detailed analysis of the}} cause of the failure was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory leading to the successful repair of many pieces of affected electronic hardware on both the Magellan and Galileo spacecraft. The problem was caused by the presence of high thermal coefficient of expansion heat sink and conformal coating materials located in the large (0. 055 inch) gap between Dual <b>Inline</b> <b>Packages</b> (DIPS) and the printed wiring board. The details of the observed problems are described and recommendations are made for improved design and testing activities in the future...|$|R

40|$|A new {{passive sensor}} for remote {{measurement}} of water content in sandy soil was designed, using a {{surface acoustic wave}} (SAW) reflective delay line. Information from this sensor {{can be obtained by}} an interrogation device via a radio link operating in the European 434 -MHz industrial-scientific-medical band. The SAW device, manufactured on the YZ cut of LiNbO 3, is mounted and sealed in a standard dual <b>inline</b> 16 <b>package</b> and contains four electroacoustic transducers. One transducer is connected to an external antenna to pick up an RF request signal from the interrogation device and to send back an RF response. The second transducer operates as a reflector. The bus bars of this transducer are connected with two measuring rods through an electrical transmission line. These rods can be inserted into sandy soil. The final two transducers operate as reflectors and are included for reference purposes. The transmission line and the two rods spanning the sand-water mixture have a ch aracteristic impedance Zload, which loads the second transducer. Changes in the soil water content are observed as a change of the total permittivity due to the high permittivity of free water, which, in turn, affects Zload as well. The amplitude and phase of the acoustic reflection at the second transducer changes due to a variation of the terminating Zload. This then results in a difference in attenuation and phase of the corresponding peak in the time domain. Thus, the RF response of the sensor carries information about the water content between the rods, which, therefore, can be detected by and evaluated in the interrogation unit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis work {{is divided}} into two parts that relate to each other. The first part investigates driving forces and {{limiting}} factors in the customisation of information on packaging and the second part focuses on how the customisation task should be performed in order to obtain high productivity and efficient logistics. Opportunities with hybrid printing solutions where conventional technology is combined with digital printing are discussed. The first of the included papers talks about the driving forces and limiting factors in the customisation of information on packaging and focuses on marketing aspects and consumer value. The second paper investigates the logistical aspects of using digital printing to add information on pre-printed packaging, with the primary focus on the opportunities to reduce changeover time and printing form costs. The third paper investigates how digital printing can be integrated into a packaging line and identifies critical productivity related parameters. These three papers are analysed together in this report, giving input to conclusions about the driving forces and limiting factors in the customisation of information on packaging and how the customisation task should be performed to obtain high productivity and efficient logistics. Hence, this thesis work does not originate solely in one discipline. Digital printing technology, logistics and marketing aspects are all considered to draw conclusions. It is shown {{that it is possible to}} obtain marketing advantages, fulfill market demands better, get increased consumer value and reduced costs by using a hybrid printing solution. There exists at the same time a number of limiting factors, such as print quality demands, additional costs and reliability issues that are crucial to consider before concluding whether or not customisation of information on packaging would be successful in any given business scenario. Different scenarios for where the customisation task can be inserted into a value chain are defined and discussed. Explicit studies of one of the scenarios are made. This scenario is defined as having a customisation task <b>inline</b> in a <b>packaging</b> line. The other scenarios, customisation at the packaging producer and customisation at the wholesaler/retailer, are not explicitly investigated, but it has been possible to discuss these scenarios as well through the research results obtained. The results show that there are factors that point towards the scenario where digital printing is performed at the producer as being the most beneficial. A number of critical productivity related factors for this scenario are identified in paper III, which gives guidelines on how to obtain high productivity when a digital printing task is integrated into a packaging line. It is finally shown that it is possible to obtain high delivery service and efficient logistics by using a hybrid printing solution. It is, however, of crucial importance that possible drawbacks be considered in order to accurately conclude whether a hybrid printing solution will be successful or not...|$|R
40|$|ADNS- 3080 is a {{high-end}} {{addition to the}} ADNS family of optical mouse sensors. This high performing sensor was designed specially for mice applications in both gaming and office environments, enabling it to navigate on virtually all surfaces. The ADNS- 3080 {{is based on a}} new, faster architecture with improved navigation performance, which measures changes in position by optically acquiring sequential surface images of over 6400 fps and mathematically determining the direction and magnitude of movement. The Navigation by Two Images Comparison sensor is capable of sensing high-speed mouse motion‚Äîup to 40 inches per second and acceleration up to 15 g ‚Äì for increased user precision and smoothness. The ADNS- 3080 along with the ADNS- 2120 /ADNS- 2120 - 001 lens, ADNS- 2220 /ADNS- 2220 - 001 clip and HLMPED 80 -XX 000 form a complete, compact optical mouse tracking system. There are no moving parts, which means high reliability and less maintenance for the end user. In addition, precision optical alignment is not required, facilitating high volume assembly. The sensor is programmed via registers through a four-wire serial port. It is packaged in a 20 -pin staggered dual <b>inline</b> <b>package</b> (DIP) ...|$|E

40|$|Oh no, {{this project}} uses SMT parts! ‚Äù Some homebrewers recoil {{at the thought}} of {{assembling}} a kit that uses surface mount technology (SMT) components. They fear the parts are too small to see, handle, solder or debug when assembled. I had these same concerns until I tried it and found that it wasn‚Äôt so difficult when using the right tools. Further, I discovered some benefits of using SMT parts that made my QRP projects smaller, lighter and more portable for optimized field use. I‚Äôve chosen two quite different projects to illustrate some successful SMT assembly techniques. One is a small DDS signal generator ‚Äúdaughtercard ‚Äù kit that comes with an assortment of SMT capacitors, resistors and inductors, and an SOIC integrated circuit. The other example circuit is a small one-stage audio amplifier built ‚ÄúManhattan-style‚Äù! Yes, you can homebrew using SMT parts ‚Äì results can sometimes be even better than when using conventional leaded parts. But first, here is some component history and {{what you need to do}} to get your work area ready for constructing an SMT project. What is an SMT component?

40|$|Description The Rcpp package {{provides}} R {{functions as}} well as a C++ library which facilitate the integration of R and C++. R data types (SEXP) are matched to C++ objects in a class hierarchy. All R types are supported (vectors, functions, environment, etc [...] .) and each type is mapped to a dedicated class. For example, numeric vectors are represented as instances of the Rcpp::NumericVector class, environments are represented as instances of Rcpp::Environment, functions are represented as Rcpp::Function, etc [...] . The ``Rcpp-introduction' ' vignette provides a good entry point to Rcpp. Conversion from C++ to R and back is driven by the templates Rcpp::wrap and Rcpp::as which are highly flexible and extensible, as documented in the ``Rcpp-extending' ' vignette. Rcpp also provides Rcpp modules, a framework that allows exposing C++ functions and classes to the R level. The ``Rcpp-modules' ' vignette details the current set of features of Rcpp-modules. Rcpp includes a concept called Rcpp sugar that brings many R functions into C++. Sugar takes advantage of lazy evaluation and expression templates to achieve great performance while exposing a syntax that is much nicer to use than the equivalent low-level loop code. The ``Rcpp-sugar' ' vignette gives an overview of the feature. Rcpp attributes provide a high-level syntax for declaring C++ functions as callable from R and automatically generating the code required to invoke them. Attributes are intended to facilitate both interactive use of C++ within R sessions {{as well as}} to support R package development. Attributes are built on top of Rcpp modules and their implementation is based on previous work in the <b>inline</b> <b>package.</b> Many examples are included, and around 891 unit tests in 430 unit test functions provide additional usage examples. An earlier version of Rcpp, containing what we now call the 'classic Rcpp API ' was written during 2005 and 2006 by Dominick Samperi. This code has 1 2 R topics documented: been factored out of Rcpp into the package RcppClassic, and it is still available for code relying on the older interface. New development should always use this Rcpp package instead. Additional documentation is available via the paper by Eddelbuettel an...|$|E
