500|$|The Tigers {{retained}} Pérez for the 2007 season, although Leyland {{acknowledged that}} Pérez {{would have to}} improve his play: [...] "I recommended that we trade for him. I take responsibility. I don't want people to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> impression. I like Neifi Pérez, {{but he did not}} perform well. It's that simple." [...] Pérez, however, continued to struggle, posting a [...]172 batting average over the 33 games he played in a Tigers' uniform. One bright spot came on June 12, 2007, when he saved Justin Verlander's no-hitter against the Milwaukee Brewers by turning a possible base hit into an inning-ending double play.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{consists of}} various computer beats and electronic effects. The song contains an ascending bridge {{incorporated into the}} chorus, which consists of the lines: [...] "If you're ready for me boy / You'd better push the button {{and let me know}} / Before I <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> idea and go." [...] Lyrically, the song is about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man. [...] Joe Macare of Stylus Magazine described Buena's delivery of the lyric [...] "my sexy ass" [...] as [...] "carefree", and noted that the lyrics adapt an [...] "idiosyncratic approach" [...] to the English language. Musically, [...] "Push the Button" [...] received comparisons to the sound of pop group ABBA.|$|E

In one, he seemingly {{uses the word}} nigga, which caused #PewdiepieIsOverParty to trend worldwide on Twitter. A few days later, PewDiePie created further controversy, when he uploaded a video featuring him reviewing the website Fiverr, which allows people to sell a service for $5 USD. In the video, PewDiePie shows his reaction to a duo he had paid to display the message [...] "DEATH TO ALL JEWS" [...] on a sign, as a joke and attempt to highlight the ridiculous things which can be provided as a paid service on the Internet. He immediately apologised within the same video stating, [...] "I am sorry. I didn't think they would actually do it. I feel partially responsible," [...] adding [...] "I'm not anti-Semitic, [...] so don't <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> idea. It was a funny meme, and I didn't think it would work, okay." [...] PewDiePie received criticism from some users in the video's comment section, {{as well as from}} some media outlets. As a result of this video, both PewDiePie and the duo were banned from Fiverr, prompting the latter to upload an apology video stating that they did not understand the meaning of the sign, and that they were sorry to all Jews.|$|E

2500|$|... "The {{reviewer}} {{found it}} difficult to understand for what class of readers the first chapter was written. For readers that are acquainted with hydrodynamics the majority of the cases cited as paradoxes belong either to the category of mistakes long since rectified, or in the category of discrepancies between theory and experiments the reasons for which are also well understood. On the other hand, the uninitiated would be very likely to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> ideas about some of the important and useful achievements in hydrodynamics from reading this chapter." ...|$|E

Usually they feel obliged to work out how things look to {{observers}} B or C. They find that B, for example, see C drifting further and further behind, so that a given piece of thread can no longer span the distance. It is only after working this out, and perhaps only with a residual feeling of unease, that such people finally accept a conclusion which is perfectly trivial in terms of A's account of things, including the Fitzgerald contraction." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nava {{began writing}} the script after {{recording}} the Quintanilla family on their stories about Selena. Suzette informed on how Nava took [...] "hours {{and hours of}} little stories {{of our lives and}} what we would do and how we felt." [...] Nava explained on how some stories [...] "had came out" [...] during his recording sessions with the family and published the first draft on March 4, 1996. The incident where Selena and Perez eloped was written in the draft which Abraham expressed disagreements on it. Citing the singer's popularity with children, he was concerned that they could <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> message about elopement as being the best decision. Nava took a few days to persuade Abraham about the scene's content before he agreed to it, noting that Selena's elopement was a major part of her story. He further insisted that his character's embracement after the scene would shade a more positive tone after his earlier negative judgments on Selena and Perez's relationship in the film. Curious on how Nava found out about the elopement, Abraham asked the director and found out that he had interviewed Perez. Abraham discovered that Selena had coaxed Perez into elopement; with earlier assumption that Perez had pressured her into secretly getting married.|$|E
