2500|$|The Sørlandet Line {{was being}} built in {{standard}} gauge, and when the line was to connect to the Flekkefjord Line at Moi Station, the Jæren Line {{would have to be}} rebuilt to standard gauge to avoid a break-of-gauge. Preliminary work to ease the conversion was done during the 1920s. The conversion itself took only two days, during which the line was closed. On 29 April 1944, a test train was run from Sira to Stavanger. The upgrade was officially opened on 1 May, after which the Jæren Line was connected to Oslo, and considered part of the Sørlandet Line. When the Jæren Line was built, the station in Egersund was located in the city center. With the opening of the Sørlandet Line, a new station was built [...] north of the city center. The old station remained in use, despite being located on a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track,</b> as it was served by trains terminating in Egersund. However, this section of line was not converted to standard gauge until 1948. Passenger traffic was terminated from 25 September 1952, although the spur remained in use as a port line until 1986.|$|E
50|$|The three {{platforms}} of {{the main}} station are located on five through tracks and one <b>dead-end</b> <b>track.</b> Tracks 1, 2, 3 and 4 are used by trains of the Mannheim-Saarbrücken route and track 5 is used by trains that run on the Maximilian Railway. Track 1a is a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track,</b> which is used for Palatine Northern Railway services.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} opened by Shin-Keihan Railway as the {{terminus}} of the branchline on November 9, 1928. It originally had six platforms serving five <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks,</b> which were later reduced to three platforms for two tracks.|$|R
50|$|The former Dremmen {{station is}} located at {{kilometre}} 7.8 km on Sootstraße in Dremmen. The loading road, the freight shed and the station building are still in ruins. In the Dremmen station area there were two <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks</b> for company connections.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two island platforms. The {{southern}} one has one pass-through track (No. 1) for the Chūō Main Line and two <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks</b> (Nos. 5, 6) for Minobu Line. The northern platform with two tracks (Nos. 2, 3) is exclusive for Chūō Main Line. There is no passenger track numbered 4.|$|R
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of discharging material below, a coal trestle carried a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track,</b> rather than a bridge.|$|E
50|$|Next {{to the two}} through tracks, {{there was}} a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track</b> in the {{northern}} part of the station and another freight track in the southern part. In the eastern railway station area, there was a signal box on the north side of the railway tracks. In the meantime the facilities have been dismantled and the station has been reclassified as a Haltepunkt (halt). Remains of the northern <b>dead-end</b> <b>track</b> still exist. In addition to the platform, there was an island platform between the two main tracks, which was later replaced by an external platform on the southern side of the station.|$|E
50|$|This {{station has}} two {{platforms}} serving four tracks {{on the ground}} - a side platform serving a track, an island platform serving two tracks a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track</b> on the north side. Each platform is connected with an overbridge with escalators.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the end of}} the Communist {{system in}} 1989/90 and the {{associated}} economic changes, the freight transport that had been important until 1990 has almost completely disappeared. The freight traffic to Neumark ended in 1995, passenger services still ran until 1997. In 1999, the Neumark-Greiz railway was closed and with the loss of its traffic, Greiz station lost further significance. The connections to nearly all freight tracks was cut during a renovation around 2000. In addition to three through tracks, there are now only two <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks</b> in use. DB Regio, which operates passenger traffic on the Gera Süd-Greiz railway together with Vogtlandbahn, now operates on the <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks.</b> The former station tracks were partly built over with the construction of federal highway 92. Since 2003, the new bus terminal has been located on the route of the Neumark railway line.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{being more}} than a decade since the rail line was officially abandoned, there are still {{remnants}} of the past railroad use including an engine house in Spring Park, various trestles, a rail spur in Mound, a rail spur at a scrapyard in Hutchinson, and a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track</b> from the Wayzata Subdivision jutting to the west and ending {{at the beginning of the}} Dakota Rail Trail.|$|E
5000|$|The {{village of}} North Stoke, now {{much smaller than}} in {{previous}} centuries, sits opposite South Stoke — with which it is linked by a 1/2 mi path across the River Arun. Road access between the two places requires an 8 mi drive around Arundel Park and down a long <b>dead-end</b> <b>track</b> from Houghton. [...] Access is also possible along a downland path from nearby Burpham.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, {{the station}} was {{expanded}} and modernised {{in response to the}} building of the line from the Hindenburg Bridge and Rüdesheim as well as the Trans-Hunsrück Railway and signal boxes (Lf and Ln) were installed. After the Hindenburg bridge had been destroyed in the Second World War, the associated track was rebuilt after 1945. Remains of this track work (crossover and <b>dead-end</b> <b>track)</b> still exist today.|$|E
50|$|Though {{there are}} track {{connections}} between the four railways, they are seldom used; {{each has its own}} dedicated <b>dead-end</b> platform <b>tracks.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1900, {{the station}} {{had a total}} of eight tracks. In the {{south-west}} area there were several <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks.</b> Over decades the track layout remained essentially unchanged. At {{the beginning of the}} 1960s, during the electrification work, the pedestrian subway, track layout and safety devices were modified. Thus, for example, the island platform between tracks 1 and 2 was replaced by a new island platform between tracks 2 and 3. At the end of the 1980s, the track layout was significantly reduced, so that since then there have been only three tracks. Track 1 next to the station building serves both freight trains as an overtaking track and the trains of the Cuckoo Railway, while tracks 2 and 3 serve the main line.|$|R
50|$|While {{the station}} now only has two main main through <b>tracks</b> and a <b>dead-end</b> main <b>track,</b> {{it used to}} have many more tracks that were {{successively}} dismantled over the decades. However, the railway station never had a great significance for freight, since the freight trains were mostly handled in Bingerbrück.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{ground-level}} opposed island platforms with one ground-level island platform sandwiched in-between. The platforms are reached by crossing the first track by a level crossing and {{walking up the}} stairs. The side platform furthest from the station building is not in service. The station is staffed. There is a depot with two tracks at {{the opposite side of}} the station building. To the east from the station building, there is a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track.</b>|$|E
50|$|With fixed train stops, {{the trip}} arm cannot be lowered. Fixed stops are {{positioned}} {{close to the}} end of a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track,</b> to stop a train before it runs out of track. They may also be used at the end of track sections beyond which certain trains should not pass, such as the end of electrified territory (e.g. Hamilton, NSW), or to test the automatic brake and tripgear of trains departing certain locations, e.g. storage sidings, near buffer stops.|$|E
50|$|The {{refurbished}} station building {{now serves}} as a physiotherapist’s practice. There is a temporary signal box at the junction to the chemical park. In the station area, {{there used to be}} a loop around the station, a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track</b> and two connecting tracks to the former Akzo works. Two fireless locomotives were available on these for shunting and the hauling of wagons from the station to the works site, even after the turn of the millennium. Parallel to the track, a headshunt runs to about km 9.8, which is shortly before the Kamperstraße level crossing. All traffic from there towards Heinsberg was discontinued on 28 May 1994.|$|E
50|$|At the {{northbound}} {{end of the}} station, {{the subway}} is entered {{and there is a}} single interline connection track (X track) between the South Line (Red and Gold Lines) and East Line (Blue and Green Lines) between Georgia State and Five Points stations. Below the Garnett platform is a little-known <b>dead-end</b> storage <b>track.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis is {{to study the}} complex {{reconstruction}} of the locomotive servicing depot Praha Liben. The locomotive depot is both operational maintenance and repair trains. The section reconstruction begins in turnout number 1, the whole area locomotive depot will be reconstructed. The main task is to propose an exchange of stepped old construction turnout for turnout new one in the whole area of the depot. The total number of changed points is 27. Depot demolition tasks in order to extend the track number 10 on the minimum usable effective length of 105 meters is the other task. Establishment of two <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks</b> number 15 and 17 will be extend to an effective length of 105 metres. Retaining wall with PU componentsis designed along track 17. The next task is to solve the drainage area. The area will be drained interconnected system drains into the sewer and trench walls...|$|R
50|$|Trackmobile is a {{well-known}} railcar mover worldwide and began as an in-plant project at Whiting Corporation, Harvey, Illinois. In 1947 a young ex Navy fighter pilot and engineer named Marshall Hartelius was assigned to modify an old industrial locomotive Whiting had used for years inside their plant. Their locomotive was constantly being trapped on <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks,</b> losing hours of productivity. Hartelius was charged {{to find a way}} to move it by road to avoid bottlenecks to railcar movements. He first designed a road wheel system to mount on the locomotive, but found it was cumbersome and complicated. Furthermore, in spite of the added utility of road-to-rail capability, the locomotive consumed a lot of fuel and oil and required constant repair. Marshall scrapped his first design and in its place submitted to his boss a concept for a vehicle specifically designed for in-plant rail movement. It had hard rubber tires to move by road and flanged steel wheels to work on rail.|$|R
50|$|The {{reason that}} the Keishin Line does not {{terminate}} at Sanjo Keihan as it originally did when above-ground, is that the necessary amount of space for a returning track could not be provided (not only is there a sharp curve directly {{to the west of}} that station, but the extra <b>dead-end</b> <b>track</b> would be directly underneath the Kamo River, so it was not feasible). The reason it did not originally continue to the (then-)terminus at Nijō was for the Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau to keep the calculated costs of running the trains balanced. However, since the opening of the extension in 2008, this is no longer the case and trains of the Keishin line now continue {{all the way to the}} present terminus at Uzumasa Tenjingawa.|$|E

50|$|The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals {{interpreted}} {{state and}} federal statutes to require that IQ Tests {{not be used in}} a manner that was determinative of tracking students into classes designed for the mentally retarded. Larry P. v. Riles, 793 F.2d 969 (9th Cir. 1984). The court specifically found that the tests involved were designed and standardized based on an all-white population, and had not undergone a legislatively mandated validation process. In addition, the court ruled that predictive validity for a general population is not sufficient, since the rights of an individual student were at issue, and emphasized that had the tests not been treated as controlling but instead used as part of a thorough and individualized assessment by a school psychologist a different result would have been obtained. In September 1982, the judge in the Larry P. case, Federal District Judge Robert F. Peckham, relented in part in response to a lawsuit brought by black parents who wanted their children tested. The parents' attorney, Mark Bredemeier, said his clients viewed the modern special education offered by California schools today as helpful to children with learning disabilities, not a <b>dead-end</b> <b>track,</b> as parents contended in the original 1979 Larry P. case.|$|E
5000|$|The line then {{runs along}} Pasteur Boulevard, where {{it makes a}} stop at Les Pavillons-sous-Bois Station before making its way north. After it reaches Gargan Station, which is located between Louis-Pasteur and Roy Boulevards, it travels up the former RN3 overpass, now known as Aristide-Briand Avenue, before {{returning}} to ground level again. The train then runs between Édouard-Vaillant and Maurice-Berteaux Boulevards. A bit further, the line stops at the Lycée Henri Sellier Station, then the old L'Abbaye Station before following an S-shaped route westward. It then stops at Freinville-Sevran Station, runs along the former RN370, which is now called Westinghouse Boulevard, before crossing the de l'Ourcq Canal. From this point on, the train heads directly westward. It makes a stop at Rougemont-Chanteloup Station then reaches the La Plaine à Hirson line near the bifurcation at Roissy and runs along {{it for a few}} hundred metres. The train completes its journey at Aulnay-sous-Bois Station on two <b>dead-end</b> <b>tracks</b> 7,900 metres from the line's starting point.|$|R
50|$|This first tunnel {{served the}} {{railways}} for 53 years, until the track was re-laid in 1929 to diminish a curve to accommodate larger locomotives. In the process a new concrete lined curved tunnel was sunk alongside the original. Since another crossing place had also become necessary, a siding named Tunnel was fashioned {{just east of}} the tunnel by laying two level <b>dead-end</b> spur <b>tracks</b> that branched directly off {{on opposite sides of the}} main line. This allowed trains to wait in one or the other of these sidings to allow an opposing train to pass. This latter tunnel remained in use for sixty years, until the line across the pass was closed to rail traffic in 1989.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened with the Hamburg-Lübeck railway by the Lübeck-Büchen Railway Company (Lübeck-Büchener Eisenbahn, LBE) on 1 August 1865. The station became a branch station on 10 December 1875 with the {{building}} of the line to Neumünster by the Altona-Kiel Railway Company (Altona-Kieler Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). The Altona-Kiel Railway Company was taken over 1884 by the Prussian state railways and it opened a line to Schwarzenbek on 1 August 1887. The line to Ratzeburg was put into operation on 15 August 1897, also by the Prussian state railways. Both lines crossed the line to Hamburg to the south of the station on flyovers. Operations of the Elmshorn-Bad Oldesloe railway began on 9 June 1907. The station was built as an Inselbahnhof ("island station", that is the station building was surrounded by rail tracks) to handle the increase of traffic. The Prussian state railways tracks were in the north-western part of the station, while the LBE's were in the southeastern part. This separation ended with the nationalisation of the LBE in 1938. The entrance building was destroyed during an air raid on 24 April 1945. Due to the progressive loss of traffic on branch lines from Bad Oldesloe from 1959, the north-western part of the station became superfluous. Today it consists only of a <b>dead-end</b> platform <b>track</b> with a bypass for trains to and from Hamburg. Its northern exit no longer exists. The existing signal boxes were replaced by a push-button signal box in 1973. The current entrance building was built in 1998 to the north-west of the remaining tracks. Tracks 1 and 2 were built over. The former island station platform and central platform 6/7 are reached by an underpass, which is also accessible from the south-eastern side of the station, and the platforms are connected by stairs and lifts. The goods yard to the east of the Lübeck-Hamburg line has lost all of its tracks and the area has been remodelled, although some goods sheds still exist. The shunting and storage sidings to the south have been largely dismantled. Between the line to Ratzeburg (now the industrial connecting track to Besendorf) and the main line, there are still remnants of the locomotive depot as well as the locomotive shed, which is used for commercial purposes. Since 2008 the Lübeck-Hamburg railway has been electrified, while the line branching to Neumünster is operated by Nordbahn with LINT 41 diesel multiple units. According to a 2010 survey, electrification of the line would have a benefit-cost ratio of only 0.6. The platform canopy of tracks 6/7 has heritage protection.|$|R
