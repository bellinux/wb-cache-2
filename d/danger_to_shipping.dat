25|$|All the {{previous}} assaults {{having failed to}} capture Gibraltar, a Franco-Spanish forced launched the biggest assault yet on the fortifications, on 13 September 1782. Anticipating the assault, and the <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping,</b> the British scuttled Brilliant, and Crawford went ashore to serve with the naval brigade encamped at Europa Point under Curtis. He served as Curtis's brigade major during the assault, which was eventually repulsed. With the attack decisively defeated, the sunken Brilliant was re-floated {{within a few days}} and Crawford resumed his post aboard her, serving under Curtis. He remained her until October 1782, when he was moved to the recently captured Spanish ship of the line San Miguel, which had run aground off Gibraltar and forced to surrender. The Spanish made several attempts to recapture or destroy her, sending flotillas against her on 12 November and 18 December. Both attempts failed, though several days later the San Miguel was blown from her anchorage and had to be run aground. She stayed in British hands {{for the remainder of the}} war. San Miguel was eventually sailed to Britain under the command of Sir Charles Knowles, and Crawford joined Roger Curtis aboard the Brilliant in March 1783. His lieutenant's commission was confirmed by the Admiralty on 10 August 1783, but with the conclusion of the American War of Independence and the drawdown of the navy, there was little service available. Crawford does not appear to have served at sea for some time after his commission.|$|E
2500|$|Resting at a {{depth of}} only [...] in the busy {{shipping}} lanes near the port of Rotterdam, with approximately [...] of fuel oil remaining inside the hull, the wreck of the Baltic Ace was both a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> and an environmental hazard.|$|E
5000|$|The Dames Point Light marked an 8 ft shoal at a {{sharp bend}} in the St. Johns River in Florida that was a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>ships</b> heading <b>to</b> or from Jacksonville.|$|R
50|$|The {{north side}} of the strait rises steeply to {{approximately}} 450 m, and the south shore to approximately 750 m. The current in the strait can run at up to 8 kn and often changes its direction. It is also often filled with small icebergs which pose a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>ships</b> in the strait.|$|R
50|$|Fuller Rock is a rock awash, {{one of the}} {{principal}} <b>dangers</b> <b>to</b> <b>ships</b> {{on the north side of}} Faure Passage, Marguerite Bay, Antarctica, about 4.2 nmi km south-southwest of Dismal Island. It was charted by a Royal Navy Hydrographic Survey Unit from RRS John Biscoe in January 1973 and named after Lieutenant Andrew C. Fuller, Royal Navy, who directed the survey.|$|R
2500|$|At 16:30 on 8 November 1975, Mi Amigos {{anchor chain}} broke {{and the ship}} began to drift, running aground on the Longsand Head Sands. She was refloated at 19:55 but {{continued}} to drift and entered United Kingdom territorial waters at 22:03. The Coastguard was flooded with calls from listeners to Radio Caroline. The engine on Mi Amigo failed about this time. On 9 November, the ship was anchored near to the South Edinburgh Number 2 buoy. Her position was confirmed by the lighthouse tender Mermaid but she was declared to be a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> at that position. On 13 November, Mi Amigo was towed to the South Edinburgh Number 3 buoy, from where she recommenced broadcasting. The following day, Mi Amigo was boarded by police and Home Office officials who ordered that broadcasting be stopped. On 17 November, coastguards at North Foreland were contacted and told that the ship had lost her main anchor. The Margate Lifeboat was sent to her aid and took off two crew. Mi Amigos captain was told that no tug was available to assist her. He refused an offer to return to shore. The two crew members were landed at Ramsgate as conditions were too rough to land them at Margate. On 23 November, Mi Amigo was anchored at , some [...] off Margate.|$|E
60|$|During fog {{there is}} more <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> {{than at any other}} time. In the daytime, in {{ordinary}} weather, rocks and lighthouses can be seen. At night, lights can be seen, but during fog nothing can be seen until danger may be too near to be avoided. The two great fog-bells of the lighthouse were therefore set a-going, and they rang out their slow deep-toned peal all that day and all that night, as the bell of the Abbot of Aberbrothoc is said to have done in days of yore.|$|E
60|$|While {{this was}} going on, the shades of night had been falling fast, and John Potter remembered {{that none of the}} candles had been lit, and that in a few minutes more the rock would be a source of greater <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> than if no {{lighthouse}} had been there, because vessels would be making for the light from all quarters of the world, in the full faith of its being kept up! Filled with horror at the thought that perhaps even at that moment vessels might be hurrying on to their doom, he seized a piece of rope that lay at hand, and managed to wind it so firmly round his mate as to render him helpless. Bounding back to the lantern, he quickly lighted it up, but did not feel his heart relieved until he had gazed out at the snowy billows below, and made sure that no vessel was in view. Then he took a long draught of water, wiped his brow, and returned to his friend.|$|E
50|$|A foghorn is a {{fog signal}} that uses sound to warn {{vehicles}} of navigational hazards like rocky coastlines or boats {{of the presence}} of other vessels, in foggy conditions. The term is most often used in relation to marine transport. When visual navigation aids such as lighthouses are obscured, foghorns provide an audible warning of rock outcrops, shoals, headlands, or other <b>dangers</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping.</b>|$|R
50|$|The region's {{network of}} {{waterways}} provided {{the means to}} export wheat and mining rushes, to import supplies, and to transport passengers. But boats had to be portaged around Cascade Rapids and Celilo Falls with mule-powered tramways. Drifting sandbars caused vessels to run aground and sometimes sink. Snags and debris in the rivers were constant <b>dangers</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> and coastal harbors were far from safe.|$|R
5000|$|The Abrolhos Archipelago (Arquipélago de Abrolhos) are a {{group of}} 5 small islands with coral reefs off the {{southern}} coast of Bahia state in the northeast of Brazil, between 17º25’—18º09’ S and 38º33’—39º05’ W. Caravelas is the nearest town. Their name comes from the abrolho ("Abre Olhos" [...] meaning: Open your eyes), a rock awash or submerged sandbank that is a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>ships.</b> There is a conspicuous shipwreck in the group.|$|R

5000|$|... a Type UB II {{submarine}} {{launched in}} 1916 and sunk on 8 February 1918; in 2008 UB-38s wreck {{was moved to}} reduce the <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|During their formation, {{these islands}} are fraught with <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>ships,</b> for sometimes, {{in parts of}} the ocean where charts show deep water, the sailor finds an {{unexpected}} coral reef, and, before he is aware, the good ship runs on this living wall and becomes a wreck. Many a noble vessel goes to sea well appointed and with a good brave crew, but never more returns;--who knows how many such have, when all on board thought themselves secure, been dashed to pieces suddenly, and lost upon the coral reefs of the Pacific? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay," [...] put in Hoseason. [...] "David kens; David's a good lad. Ye see, David my man, yon wild Hielandman is a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ship,</b> {{besides being}} a rank foe to King George, God bless him!" ...|$|R
5|$|The first Battersea Bridge was a toll bridge {{commissioned}} by John, Earl Spencer, {{who had recently}} acquired the rights to operate the ferry. Although a stone bridge was planned, difficulties in raising investment meant that a cheaper wooden bridge was built instead. Designed by Henry Holland, it was initially opened to pedestrians in November 1771, and to vehicle traffic in 1772. The bridge was inadequately designed and dangerous both to its users and <b>to</b> passing <b>shipping,</b> and boats often collided with it. <b>To</b> reduce the <b>dangers</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping,</b> two piers were removed and the sections of the bridge above them were strengthened with iron girders.|$|R
50|$|The icebergs {{released}} by the breakup now pose a potential <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> and offshore development in the region. Loss of microbial ecosystems caused by {{the release of the}} freshwater may also have far-ranging ecological impacts.|$|E
5000|$|The Rocks to {{the east}} of the Island are known as [...] "The Muglins" [...] and are a {{different}} group or chain. These form a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> and have been fitted with a distinctive beacon.|$|E
50|$|Resting at a {{depth of}} only 35 m in the busy {{shipping}} lanes near the port of Rotterdam, with approximately 540000 litres gal of fuel oil remaining inside the hull, the wreck of the Baltic Ace was both a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> and an environmental hazard.|$|E
50|$|Around 3000 BC the Norfolk {{coastline}} {{was roughly}} similar to today's outline, although the local cliffs continued to erode. Some of the eroded material goes {{to form the}} sand bar, a few kilometres offshore, that runs parallel with the coastline and is a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> local <b>shipping.</b>|$|R
60|$|The like is the <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>ships</b> going northward, {{if after}} passing by Winterton {{they are taken}} short with a {{north-east}} wind, and cannot put back into the Roads, which very often happens, then they are driven upon the same coast, and embayed just as the latter. The danger on the north part of this bay is not the same, because if ships going or coming should be taken short on this side Flamborough, there is the river Humber open to them, and several good roads to have recourse to, as Burlington Bay, Grimsby Road, and the Spurn Head, and others, where they ride under shelter.|$|R
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> Allied <b>shipping.</b> From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was unable to put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were unable to move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|R
50|$|The {{headland}} was a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping.</b> In 1831, construction {{began on}} the Belle Tout lighthouse on the next headland west from Beachy Head. Because mist and low clouds could hide the light of Belle Tout, Beachy Head Lighthouse {{was built in the}} sea below Beachy Head.|$|E
50|$|Mount's Bay is {{the biggest}} bay in Cornwall. Its {{half-moon}} shape {{is similar to that}} of Donegal Bay in Ireland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, although, unlike the aforementioned bays, Mount's Bay is relatively sheltered from the prevailing Atlantic westerlies. However, it is a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> during onshore southerly and south-easterly gales.|$|E
50|$|The {{container}} ship MSC Chitra collided with another vessel MV Khalijia III on 8 August 2010 in Jawaharlal Nehru Port causing the spillage of approximately 300 containers into the port waters. Jawaharlal Nehru Port and the adjacent Mumbai Port were closed {{for several days}} until the containers could be cleared and no longer present any <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping.</b>|$|E
50|$|Kes and Janeway {{have their}} last talk and Kes is {{overcome}} by a fit, her powers warping her very surroundings. She cannot control herself {{and becomes a}} <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> the <b>ship.</b> She and Janeway agree she should leave the ship before it is destroyed. Kes boards a shuttle and puts some distance between herself and Voyager.|$|R
5000|$|The Haisborough Sands {{are located}} {{parallel}} to the shore off the village of Happisburgh. Over the years the sands have constantly shifted and changed, and have been of great <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> coastal <b>shipping,</b> particularly {{in the age of}} sail. Although the spelling of the village and the sandbank are different they are pronounced the same ( [...] ).|$|R
50|$|The Black Middens is {{the name}} given to a reef {{at the mouth of}} the River Tyne in North East England, noted for the <b>danger</b> it poses <b>to</b> <b>shipping.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Mines, {{then called}} [...] "torpedoes", {{remained}} a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> in waters near Mobile, so Metacomet returned there {{to drag the}} Bay and Blakely Channel from 9 March-12 April. Returning north {{after the end of}} the conflict, Metacomet decommissioned at Philadelphia on 18 August and was sold there to John Roach & Sons on 28 October.|$|E
5000|$|Parliamentary debates listed {{several reasons}} why {{unlicensed}} broadcasting should be stopped. Opponents referred to [...] "pirate radio stations". Allegations of piracy included misappropriation of World War II military installations; wavelengths allocated {{to others and}} the unauthorised playing of recorded music. Other claims said the vessels were a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> and that signals could interfere with aircraft and police, fire and ambulance services.|$|E
50|$|Seagoing vessels {{must take}} great care {{navigating}} near Robben Island and nearby Whale Rock (it does not break the surface) as they pose a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping.</b> A prevailing rough Atlantic swell surrounds the offshore reefs and the island's jagged coastline. Stricken vessels driven onto rocks are quickly broken {{up by the}} powerful surf. There are a total of 31 known vessels that have been wrecked around the island.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Sea mines {{present a}} <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> {{commercial}} <b>shipping,</b> military operations, relief efforts, and can impact a nation’s homeland and economic security. This paper presents results of using evolutionary neural networks or rule-based classifiers {{to discriminate between}} active sonar returns from simulated sea mines and other background. The results indicate that both evolutionary methods {{can be used with}} considerable success. ...|$|R
50|$|An 1818 Report by the Surveyor-General of the Duchy of Cornwall on the <b>dangers</b> <b>to</b> <b>shipping</b> in Cornwall {{proposed}} that a lighthouse be built, {{similar to the}} Eddystone Lighthouse, upon Bishop Rock, given its location as the westernmost rock of the Isles of Scilly. The plan was considered by the Government and building was expected soon, as the engineer John Rennie the Elder made an offer to build it. The Government did not take up the offer, but Trinity House surveyed Bishop Rock in 1843, {{with a view to}} building a lighthouse, and work began in 1847. The engineer in chief, James Walker, decided on a 120 ft design consisting of accommodation and a light on top of iron legs. The light was never lit, since on 5 February 1850 a storm washed the tower away.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} islands {{included}} in the Copeland Islands: the Great Copeland Island, the Lighthouse Island (which {{does not have a}} lighthouse now) and Mew Island which does have a lighthouse. Over a century ago the Lighthouse Island had a population of about 100, including a school master with 28 pupils. In 1671 James Ross obtained a fee farm grant of these and in 1770 David Kerr purchased the islands from the Earl of Clanbrassil. As the islands were a <b>danger</b> <b>to</b> <b>ships</b> a light beacon was made on the Lighhouse Island (Cross Island) in about 1715, it burned over 400 tons of coal every year. In 1796 the new British and Irish Lighthouse Board announced the erection of oil lamps and in 1813 the new lighthouse was built. In 1884 a new lighthouse was built on Mew Island. In 1954 the Bird Observatory was established by Arnold Bennington.|$|R
