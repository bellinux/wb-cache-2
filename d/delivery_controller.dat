5000|$|Continental Airlines Flight 1713 was {{scheduled}} to depart Denver at 12:25, but many flights out of Denver that day were delayed by inclement weather. At 13:03, Flight 1713 taxied from its gate to the de-icing pad; air traffic controllers were not aware that Flight 1713 had departed the gate because the flight crew did so without requesting taxi clearance. De-icing was completed at 13:46. At 13:51, Flight 1713 contacted the clearance <b>delivery</b> <b>controller</b> for permission to [...] "taxi from the ice pad." [...] The clearance <b>delivery</b> <b>controller,</b> believing that Flight 1713 was still at the gate and requesting to proceed to deicing, instructed the flight to switch to ground controller frequency. Ground controllers then cleared Flight 1713 to taxi to the de-icing pad. Flight 1713, already at the de-ice pad, taxied from the pad to hold {{at the end of}} runway 35L and await takeoff clearance.

50|$|Application {{delivery}} uses {{one or more}} layer 4-7 switches, {{also known}} as a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch to intelligently distribute traffic to a pool, {{also known as a}} cluster or farm, of servers. The application <b>delivery</b> <b>controller</b> (ADC) is assigned a single virtual IP address (VIP) that represents the pool of servers. Traffic arriving at the ADC is then directed to one of the servers in the pool (cluster, farm) based on a number of factors including application specific data values, application transport protocol, availability of servers, current performance metrics, and client-specific parameters. An ADN provides the advantages of load distribution, increase in capacity of servers, improved scalability, security, and increased reliability through application specific health checks.|$|E
50|$|An {{application}} delivery network (ADN) is {{a suite of}} technologies that, when deployed together, provide application availability, security, visibility, and acceleration. Gartner defines {{application delivery}} networking as the combination of WAN optimization controllers (WOCs) and application delivery controllers (ADCs). At the data center end of an ADN is the application <b>delivery</b> <b>controller,</b> an advanced traffic management device that is often {{also referred to as}} a web switch, content switch, or multilayer switch, the purpose of which is to distribute traffic among a number of servers or geographically dislocated sites based on application specific criteria. In the branch office portion of an ADN is the WAN optimization controller, which works {{to reduce the number of}} bits that flow over the network using caching and compression, and shapes TCP traffic using prioritization and other optimization techniques. Some WOC components are installed on PCs or mobile clients, and there is typically a portion of the WOC installed in the data center. Application delivery networks are also offered by some CDN vendors.|$|E

40|$|Enterprise, system management, {{software}} deployment, model-based automation This paper {{shows how}} a Service <b>Delivery</b> <b>Controller</b> (SDC) [1, 11] {{can be created}} for Radia such that Radia can participate and operate {{as part of a}} broader management context that is highly automated and driven by external policy. The concept of a SDC has been introduced as building block of the Conceptual Architecture for Management of the Adaptive Enterprise [2] to provide uniform abstractions and the integration framework for different management systems participating in a solution. Like other management systems, Radia today primarily relies on an administrator role for configuring its policy. With SDC, “programmability ” can be introduced for an entire management platform such as Radia, enabling substantially more automation driven from outside systems rather than administrators. The Radia SDC follows the SDC conceptual architecture. It includes an abstracted, externally exposed "Shared Model " upon which an interface (based on web services management standards) provides operations, which in turn drive changes in the underlying system utilizing the existing (unchanged) Radia infrastructure. Two alternatives for implementing the shared model are discussed: Web-Services Distribute...|$|E
40|$|Many {{patients}} presenting hypertension before/after surgery should need {{to receive}} adequate medication. For example, patients with dissecting aneurysm often show extreme hypertension and an adequate control of blood {{pressure of the}} patient will lead to good surgical outcome. On the other hand, untreated hypertension after surgery may create complication. Therefore, hypertension control after/before surgery is important. In this paper, postsurgical hypertension control for cardiac patients, without loss of generality, will be focused. From the past experience, elevated blood pressure often occurs {{in the early hours}} following open-heart surgery. Basically, there are several medications such as Sodium Nitroprusside (SNP) and Nitroglycerin, etc., which are commonly used for the treatment of postsurgical hypertension of the cardiac patient. We consider here Sodium Nitroprusside {{in the design of the}} control system. However, due to a wide range of patients’ drug sensitivities to SNP, manual control by clinical personnel could be very tedious, time consuming and inconsistent. An automatic drug <b>delivery</b> <b>controller</b> based on feedback method may quickly reduce the oscillatory change in mean blood pressure through infusion of SNP. In this paper, an adaptive Proportional-Integral (PI) control of mean blood pressure using SNP is presented. A new algorithm updating variations in time delay and sensitivity of the system is proposed and its effectiveness in the treatment of the hypertension patient is discussed. For demonstration, simulations under clinical conditions are carried out...|$|E
