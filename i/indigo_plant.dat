25|$|In the 1670s, English {{planters}} from Bermuda established themselves near {{what is now}} Charleston. Settlers built rice plantations in the South Carolina Lowcountry, east of the Atlantic Seaboard fall line. Settlers {{came from}} all over Europe.

Another cash crop was the <b>Indigo</b> <b>plant,</b> a plant source of blue dye, developed by Eliza Lucas.|$|E
25|$|The species used {{to produce}} dyes include the following: Logwood Haematoxylon campechianum; a large spiny tree that can grow up to 15m tall. Its cork is thin and soft and its wood is hard. The {{heartwood}} is {{used to produce}} dyes that are red and purple. The histological stain called haematoxylin is produced from this species. Brazilwood tree (Caesalpinia echinata) {{is similar to the}} previous tree but smaller and with red or purple flowers. The wood is also used to produce a red or purple dye. The Madras thorn (Pithecallobium dulce) is another spiny tree native to Latin America, it grows up to 4m high and has yellow or green flowers that grow in florets. Its fruit is reddish and is used to produce a yellow dye. Indigo dye is extracted from the True <b>indigo</b> <b>plant</b> Indigofera tinctoria that is native to Asia. In Central and South America dyes are produced from two species related to this species, indigo from Indigofera suffruticosa and Natal indigo from Indigofera arrecta.yellow dye is extracted from Butea monosperma commonly called as flame of the forest.|$|E
60|$|Lower California, {{in length}} about seven hundred miles, forms a great peninsula, which crosses the tropics and terminates in the torrid zone. It is {{separated}} from the mainland by the Gulf of California, sometimes called the Vermilion Sea; into this gulf empties the Colorado of the West, the Seeds-ke-dee, or Green River, as it is also sometimes called. The peninsula is traversed by stern and barren mountains, and has many sandy plains, where {{the only sign of}} vegetation is the cylindrical cactus growing among the clefts of the rocks. Wherever there is water, however, and vegetable mould, the ardent nature of the climate quickens everything into astonishing fertility. There are valleys luxuriant with the rich and beautiful productions of the tropics. There the sugar-cane and <b>indigo</b> <b>plant</b> attain a perfection unequalled in any other part of North America. There flourish the olive, the fig, the date, the orange, the citron, the pomegranate, and other fruits belonging to the voluptuous climates of the south; with grapes in abundance, that yield a generous wine. In the interior are salt plains; silver mines and scanty veins of gold are said, likewise, to exist; and pearls of a beautiful water are to be fished upon the coast.|$|E

50|$|Cause lead to revolt - <b>Indigo</b> <b>planting</b> in Bengal dated back to 1777. Louis Bonard was {{probably}} the first indigo planter. With expansion of British power in the Nawabate of Bengal, <b>indigo</b> <b>planting</b> {{became more and more}} commercially profitable because of the demand for blue dye in Europe. It was introduced in large parts of Burdwan, Bankura, Birbhum, North 24 Parganas, Jessore (present Bangladesh) etc. The indigo planters pursued the peasants to <b>plant</b> <b>indigo</b> instead of food crops. They provided loans, called dadon, at a very high interest. Once a farmer took such loans he remained in debt for whole of his life before passing it to his successors. The price paid by the planters was meagre,only 2.5% of the market price. The farmers could make no profit growing indigo. The farmers were totally unprotected from the indigo planters, who resorted to mortgages or destruction of their property if they were unwilling to obey them. Government rules favoured the planters. By an act in 1833, the planters were granted a free hand in oppression. Even the zamindars, means the landlords money lenders and other influential persons sided with the planters. Out of the severe oppression unleashed on them the farmers resorted to revolt.|$|R
30|$|No dye {{components}} {{could be}} unequivocally identified in most blue samples after mild hydrolysis. Suspecting inefficient extraction, a harsh hydrolysis method {{was performed on}} the same sample (Table  1). XRF did not show any consistent elemental composition across samples. It is possible all elements detected came from vats used by the dyers, since indigo does not require a mordant to dye [32, 33, 48]. The use of <b>indigo</b> <b>plants</b> as a source for blue colouring is consistent with analyses carried out on other eighteenth century European textiles [29, 43, 58].|$|R
40|$|Colors {{ranging from}} blue to purple can be {{obtained}} using fresh leaves of <b>indigo</b> <b>plants</b> such as Polygonum tinctorium Lour, by producing indirubin in addition to indigo. To obtain a variety of color from a single plant, chlorophyll was extracted from {{the remainder of the}} fresh leaves of Polygonum which was used for blue or purple dyeing and was subjected to dyeing to silk fabrics. Similar green shade as reported for other plants was obtained. Various colors could be produced by dyeing green chlorophyll to blue or purple silk fabrics...|$|R

50|$|<b>Indigo,</b> a <b>plant</b> used to dye clothing, {{which could}} make the cloth blue. It has been {{regarded}} as an ingredient of dye for a long time. In Encourage Learning, an article of Xunzi, indigo was mentioned as a metaphor that students will be better than teachers.(Chinese: 青出于蓝而胜于蓝) In 1940-1956, the output of indigo continued to increase. However, after that time, with the importation of foreign dye, the production of indigo has been decreased. Nowadays, {{there are only a}} few people <b>planting</b> <b>indigo.</b>|$|R
30|$|We limited {{our case}} study to 47 out of 685 samples for ethical considerations, {{and used a}} {{combination}} of spectroscopic, microscopic and chromatographic techniques to identify dyes and infer the presence of mordants. In conjunction with archival research, these scientific results were successfully cross-referenced with documentary sources. Weld, young and old fustic, quercitron, cochineal, madder, <b>indigo</b> <b>plants</b> and orchil dyes were all found in the samples (weft) in repetitive combinations that suggested well-defined recipes. In turn, these results advanced {{our knowledge of the}} substances used to produce primary and compound colours. Furthermore, we found scientific evidence that points the presence of a water-soluble glaze material, likely a natural gum.|$|R
50|$|Indigo dye {{could be}} made from two {{different}} types of plants: the <b>indigo</b> <b>plant,</b> which produced the best results, and from the woad plant. The British were producing indigo with woad, a plant that yielded a lesser quality dye, but a plant they could grow. They even tried to hold their monopoly on indigo dye by managing to ban the <b>indigo</b> <b>plant</b> for years, claiming that it was poisonous. But eventually the British began to focus on tea and other crops, and meanwhile, the French started to get their fair share of the market.|$|E

50|$|The Galiara {{community}} {{consist of}} a number of clans, known as ataks. Their main clans are the Chauhan, Makwana, Rathore, Wara and Sarvoia. The Sarvoia are further sub-divided into the Dosani-Sarvoia, Thebani-Sarvoia, and Rupani-Sarvoia. These clans intermarry, although the practice of clan exogamy has declined. There is now marriage within the clan. The Galiara are still involved in their traditional occupation of extracting <b>indigo</b> from <b>indigo</b> <b>plants.</b> The dyeing of blankets and turbans for princely families was their main occupation. However, with the advent of industrialization, the traditional economic structure of the community has been affected. Many Galiara are now petty businessmen, running small grocery shops.

5000|$|Otranto Plantation Indigo Vats are {{historic}} indigo vats {{located near}} Goose Creek, Berkeley County, South Carolina. Indigo vats are where fermentation and settlement processes for production of indigo dyestuff were accomplished. Each vat measures approximately 14 feet square {{and has a}} stuccoed interior. The upper vat, known as the [...] "steeper vat", {{was used for the}} fermentation of <b>indigo</b> <b>plants</b> with the liquor drawn through a small portal into the “beater vat” below. The liquor was agitated, allowed to settle, and the remaining sludge strained, molded into cakes, and dried. The Otranto Plantation Indigo Vats were relocated by the Verona Chemical Company, later Mobay Corporation, from Otranto Plantation to their present site in 1979 to save them from demolition. They are the only such structures know to be in existence in South Carolina.|$|R
30|$|Lichen {{components}} {{related to}} orcein {{were identified in}} all purple-coloured samples except in patterns 374 and 439 where no dye components were detected. Samples from patterns 4, 435, 437, and 446 also contain indigotin, present in <b>indigo</b> <b>plants</b> or woad. In addition, possibly due to cross contamination, the sample from pattern 435 contained traces of morin, present in old fustic. Since we confirmed the presence of morin in numerous green samples, we believe its presence in purple 435 may {{be a result of}} contamination by handling of the pattern book after manufacture (for example, the yellow in pattern 447 on the same page contains morin). Finding indigo and/or lichen components, such as orcein was expected: during the eighteenth century English dyers obtained their purples either by using blue and red dyes like indigo and madder, or from less colourfast lichens.|$|R
40|$|Ordinarily indigo dyeing is {{performed}} {{by reducing the}} dye under basic conditions.

By paste of the powder cotton fabrics was dyed deeper than normal method of indigo dyeing with fresh leaves. However, as the shade was uneven, dyeing of cotton by the mixture of the extract with hot water (indican solution) and the extract with cold water (enzyme solution) under basic conditions and argon atmosphere was examined. As a result basic condition of pH being 12. 5 and condition without oxygen {{were found to be}} preferable to dye cotton.
