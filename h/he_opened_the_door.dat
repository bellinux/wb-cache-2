Chambers noticed that the air conditioning had been left on, something that Williamson was unlikely to have done, and then realised that Williamson's bedroom door had been left ajar. Investigating further, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and discovered Williamson's corpse lying {{face down on the}} floor, with multiple stab wounds to the neck and surrounded by a pool of blood. Williamson's dog, Tessa, was running about in the room and barking.|$|E

25|$|The show's set {{included}} {{a door in}} the background. During the show, Sales would answer {{a knock at the}} door and interact with an actor seen only as an arm. Occasionally, the person at the door was a celebrity, such as Burt Lancaster or Fess Parker. Once, while the show was being broadcast live from Detroit, Sales' studio crew pulled a prank on him: when <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> he saw a topless dancer partially covered with a balloon. Some reports say the gag was furthered by the crew switching the studio monitors so that Sales would think the stripper image was going out over the air. A second, nonbroadcasting, camera captured the uncensored version, while a stagehand moved a balloon back and forth in the doorway, giving at least some indication to the home viewers what was supposed to be behind the door. Sales was forced to try to keep the show going without revealing the risque scene backstage. The prank was recreated when the show originated in Los Angeles. The Los Angeles prank footage survives.|$|E
500|$|Pei's first {{proposed}} design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant {{to represent the}} optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell how tired he was by the way <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.M. to see that so many people didn't want the building." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend also {{expressed}} mixed point of {{views on the}} episode, having different opinions on each storyline. She noted how the scene which sees Torres [...] "desperately trying to escape George's room after three rolls in the hay with the grief-stricken intern" [...] helped the episode reach {{a high level of}} entertainment: [...] "The look, or should I say, looks on Izzie's face as Callie rambled on about legs being bent the wrong way and needing to heal after too much sex were priceless and could only matched by the look she gave to George when <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> clearly ready for Callie once more." [...] She highly praised the scene that concludes Stevens' storyline in the episode, seeing [...] "a heart to heart in which she agrees to back off". Shepherd's characterization was negatively responded to, whose enraged attitude was described as [...] "unhealthy" [...] for the evolution of his [...] "fresh relationship" [...] with Grey. West positively received the storyline involving the race for the title of chief, noting that [...] "it was kind of funny to see like the attendings were the kids in the episode".|$|E

500|$|Valo {{has been}} a regular alcohol user much of his life.

In 2000, Valo nearly fell off the balcony of a hotel while under the influence, but was stopped by friends. During a 2005 US tour, Valo's drink was spiked in Minneapolis. He suffered minor injuries and was robbed of his jacket, asthma medicine, cigarettes, credit cards and cell phone. In February 2006, Valo was reportedly arrested at his home in Finland after allegedly threatening to kill his neighbor and resisting arrest. Valo later elaborated on the incident stating that [...] "It was a guy just talking a lot of bull about me and my fiancée [...] And I got pissed off, I went to his door [...] I kicked the door, <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and I told him that if he was ever gonna talk badly about me and my girl, he was gonna end up being dead, and I punched him in the face, and that's the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Dostoyevsky {{began working}} on Poor Folk in early 1844. He first {{mentioned}} the upcoming work {{in a letter to}} Mikhail on 30 September 1844: [...] "I am finishing up a novel of the size of Eugénie Grandet. It's a rather original work." [...] Dostoyevsky later wrote to his brother on 23 March 1845, [...] "I finished the novel in November, then rewrote it in December, and again in February–March. I am seriously satisfied with my novel. It is a serious and elegant work..." [...] Sometime around April 1845, his friend Dmitry Grigorovich, with whom he had shared an apartment since the autumn of 1844, proposed giving the manuscript to poet Nikolay Nekrasov, who was planning to issue an anthology in 1846. Dostoyevsky took the manuscript to Nekrasov and returned home. Shortly afterwards the doorbell of his house rang, and <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the excited Nekrasov and Grigorovich, both of whom congratulated him on his debut novel, of which they had only read 10 pages. They finished the full 112-page work during the night at Dostoyevsky's apartment. The next morning, the three men went to the critic Vissarion Belinsky; Nekrasov proclaimed Dostoyevsky [...] "the New Gogol" [...] though Belinsky replied sceptically [...] "You find Gogol's springing up like mushrooms". Dostoyevsky himself did not believe his book would receive a positive review from Belinsky, but when Nekrasov visited Belinsky in the evening, the latter wanted to meet Dostoyevsky to congratulate him on his debut. Dostoyevsky proposed to issue Poor Folk in the Fatherland Notes, but it was instead published in the almanac St. Petersburg Collection on January 15, 1846.|$|E
500|$|Presley's rise to {{national}} attention in 1956 transformed {{the field of}} popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for black music." [...] Al Green agreed: [...] "He broke the ice for all of us." [...] President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: [...] "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently {{changed the face of}} American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country." [...] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, {{he was one of the}} most famous people in the world. John Lennon stated that [...] "Before Elvis there was nothing." [...] Lennon also said that [...] "Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been the Beatles." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 20, 1974, while {{recovering}} {{from the effects of}} sodium pentothal administered for the extraction of an impacted wisdom tooth, Dick received a home delivery of Darvon from a young woman. When <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> he was struck by the beauty of the dark-haired girl and was especially drawn to her golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. [...] "This is a sign used by the early Christians," [...] she said, and then left. Dick called the symbol the [...] "vesicle pisces". This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian ichthys symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile) which the woman was wearing, and the vesica piscis.|$|E
2500|$|Discussing Pete's demise, Gillian Taylforth {{who played}} his ex-wife Kathy Beale, {{has stated that}} {{although}} she and actor Peter Dean had problems [...] "now and then", she found it really hard when he left, and that Pete's death was [...] "an {{end of an era}} for EastEnders." [...] The tankard that Pete was often seen drinking from in pub scenes was allegedly so popular that Peter Dean reported it was stolen twice by fans and he had to replace it on both occasions. Dean has suggested that during his time in the soap, the most letters he received were about a storyline that saw him cross-dressing as part of a practical joke: [...] "The episode I got the most letters about was when Pete was going to a Topsy Turvy party, where men dress as women and women as men. But he didn't get the message that the party was cancelled. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the Queen Vic in this dress, singing a song, and then it was the duff, duff, duff ...

2500|$|In 1985 ADC offices {{suffered}} {{a series of}} violent attacks. On August 16, a bomb exploded in the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee office in Boston, severely injuring two police officers. On October 29 an arson fire damaged the ADC office in Washington, D.C. On October 11, {{the day after the}} ending of the Achille Lauro incident where a Jewish American died, [...] Alex Odeh, ADC's west-coast regional director, was killed in a bombing as <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to his office. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) suspected Jewish Defense League and Jewish Defense Organization members. Although Jewish Defense League leader Irv Rubin, who lived in Southern California, made some controversial statements about the bombing, the investigation focused on Robert Manning and his wife Rochelle who fled to Israel. They eventually were prosecuted on another bombing charge and Manning is serving a life sentence on that charge. In 2007, the FBI revealed they had received information from a deceased informant, believed to be former Jewish Defense League member Earl Krugel who had been sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for 2001 plots to bomb a Southern California mosque and office of U.S. Representative Darrell Issa, who is Arab-American. It is believed that Irv Rubin, who committed suicide in 2002 in custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in Los Angeles while awaiting trial on the same charges, revealed to Krugel the names of those responsible for Odeh's death and that Krugel shared those with the FBI before he was murdered in prison in 2005. The bombers are believed to be Manning and two individuals now living in Israel. ADC continues to honor Odeh’s memory and call for prosecution of his killers. The FBI has failed to arrest anyone in the Odeh bombing case.|$|E
2500|$|The whitehead, as a {{messenger}} {{between man and}} the gods, was a very tapu (sacred) bird. This status was reflected in {{its role in the}} tohi rite, a ritual performed over an infant. This entailed a tohunga touching the head of an infant with a live whitehead and reciting a karakia (incantation) firstly to cause the mana (power and prestige) of the gods to descend on the child from the gods and secondly to open the child's eyes and ears to the knowledge of the ancestors. After the karakia was complete the bird was freed to demonstrate that the mana received would return to the gods when the child died. The whitehead also held this role as {{a messenger}} to the gods when a new pā (fortified village) was dedicated. Once the ceremonies were complete a single whitehead was released unharmed, the pā became free of tapu, and could be safely entered. The purpose of this rite was to bring prosperity and vitality to the pā and its people in times of war and peace. When a candidate was applying to a senior tohunga to become a matakite, or seer, he had first to catch a small bird such as a whitehead. After more ritual the applicant was shut in a hut to sleep with the bird for a night. Next morning <b>he</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and if the bird flew away of its own accord, his suitability to be a seer, as indeed the whitehead was regarded to be, was confirmed. In the past, the appearance of a flock of whiteheads was interpreted by Māori from the upper regions of the Whanganui River as a sign that kēhua (ghosts) were nearby ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} the facts that Nat King Cole had the #7 song in 1959, and the #1 song in 1921, and Chuck Berry had a major hit with [...] "Maybellene" [...] in 1955, in the United States in the 1950s legal {{segregation}} and discrimination against African Americans was common, especially in the Deep South. Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little Richard said of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. <b>He</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E
