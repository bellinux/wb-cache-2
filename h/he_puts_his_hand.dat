2500|$|J.T., {{wounded and}} lying beside his dying brother, stays behind to {{detonate}} explosives {{to eliminate the}} remaining zombies while the others flee. The survivors make plans to escape by stealing helicopters but must fight past the remaining zombies. Abby dies, along with hope for a cure, when a ballistic projectile blows his head up. The survivors use the blade tips of their helicopter to kill the rest. However, while saving Cherry from a zombie, El Wray is fatally wounded. In the epilogue, Cherry, now sporting a minigun leg, leads the group and many more survivors to the Caribbean beach at Tulum, where they start a peaceful new society during a world-wide zombie outbreak. It is also revealed that Cherry has given birth to El Wray's daughter (alluded to earlier during El Wray's final scene when <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on her stomach and restates his motto [...] "I never miss").|$|E

6000|$|RAINA (springing up). There still!--for {{my father}} to find the first time <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in his pocket! Oh, {{how could you be}} so stupid? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> to Bill's {{pocket and}} took out a little green snake; then <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> to Bill's trouser-pocket {{and took out}} a frog, while pore Bill's eyes looked as if they was corning out o' their sockets.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> into <b>his</b> breast, {{and took}} out a little purse.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>his</b> {{pockets and}} walked over to the window.|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS (coaxingly). No, no. (<b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> persuasively on Craven's arm, adding) It's {{not good}} for your liver, Craven, to rush about {{immediately}} after lunch.|$|E
6000|$|SERGIUS. Invaluable man! Come along! (Towering over Bluntschli, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on his {{shoulder}} and takes him to the steps, Petkoff following. As Bluntschli puts his foot on the first step, Raina comes out of the house.) ...|$|E
60|$|Ga Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays {{eggs for}} us. When she lays her egg {{she is so}} glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then comes good uncle Leo. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> under black Liz and takes her fresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to <b>his</b> mouth forthwith, and {{uttered a}} {{peculiar}} cry.|$|R
60|$|Allerton's {{face lit}} up with amusement. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on Dick's shoulders.|$|R
60|$|Elsie stooped {{and kissed}} <b>his</b> cheek and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on hers.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} of Timon about him," [...] the Doctor remarked dogmatically. [...] "That {{is the way}} with you young ladies--you think that a man's first {{business}} {{in life is to}} be dancing attendance on you. Bathurst looks at life seriously, and no wonder, going about as he does among the natives and listening to their stories and complaints. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to the plow, and does not turn to the right or left." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{is lying}} in the stern-sheets of the boat; stiff, weak, half blind with blood. He looks up; the moon is still bright overhead: but they are away from the shore now, for the wave-crests are dancing white before the land-breeze, high above the boat's side. The boat seems strangely empty. Two men are pulling instead of six! And what is this lying heavy across his chest? He pushes, and is {{answered}} by a groan. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> down to rise, and is answered by another groan.|$|E
60|$|It is {{the same}} with {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to. Either he does not care for boating at all, or, {{as a matter of}} course, he pulls stroke in the University Boat-race; and then takes the train on to Henley and wins the Diamond Sculls so easily that it hardly seems worth while for the other fellow to have started. Were I living in Novel-land, and had I entered for the Diamond Sculls, I should put it to my opponent before the word was given to us to go.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> into <b>his</b> {{pocket and}} {{produced}} a letter addressed to himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on hers, {{within his}} arm, {{and gave it}} a squeeze.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{to shade}} <b>his</b> seaward eyes, and shouted to people within.|$|R
6000|$|BURGESS (collapsing into {{an abyss}} of wounded feeling). Oh, well, if you're {{determined}} to be unfriendly, I s'pose I'd better go. (He moves reluctantly towards the door. Morell makes no sign. He lingers.) I didn't hexpect to find a hunforgivin' spirit in you, James. (Morell still not responding, he takes a few more reluctant steps doorwards. Then he comes back whining.) We huseter git on well enough, spite of our different opinions. Why are you so changed to me? I give you my word I come here in pyorr (pure) frenliness, not wishin' to be on bad terms with my hown daughrter's 'usban'. Come, James: be a Cherishin and shake 'ands. (<b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> sentimentally on Morell's shoulder.) ...|$|E
6000|$|RICHARD. Stop, stop, stop, I tell you. Don't do that. (Putting {{his hand}} to his breast as if to a wound.) He wrung my heart by being a man. Need you tear it by being a woman? Has he not raised you above my insults, like himself? (She stops crying, and recovers herself somewhat, looking at him with a scared curiosity.) There: that's right. (Sympathetically.) You're better now, aren't you? (<b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> encouragingly on her shoulder. She {{instantly}} rises haughtily, and stares at him defiantly. He at once drops into his usual sardonic tone.) Ah, that's better. You are yourself again: so is Richard. Well, shall we go to tea like a quiet respectable couple, and wait for your husband's return? ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{astonishing}} how careless {{they are in}} the country, in places far removed from large towns, where the thought of burglars never enters their heads. I call it setting temptation in a poor man's way when <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> meaning no harm, upon a door, and finds it swing open before him. In this case it was not so bad as that, but the window was merely fastened with the ordinary catch, which I opened with a push from the blade of my knife. I pulled up the window as quickly as possible, then I thrust the knife through the slit in the shutter and prized it open. They were folding shutters, and I shoved them before me and walked into the room.|$|E
50|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on her, and {{immediately}} she {{straightened up and}} praised God.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> contemptuously in <b>his</b> trouser pocket, {{and pulled}} out some small change.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{through my}} arm and walked with {{me up and down}} the lawn.|$|R
6000|$|Another image {{competes with}} that image in my memory. Beardsley has arrived at Fountain Court {{a little after}} breakfast with {{a young woman who}} belongs to our publisher's circle and {{certainly}} not to ours, and is called [...] "twopence coloured," [...] or is it [...] "penny plain." [...] He is a little drunk and his mind has been running upon his dismissal from The Yellow Book, for <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> upon the wall and stares into a mirror. He mutters, [...] "Yes, yes. I look like a Sodomite," [...] which he certainly did not. [...] "But no, I am not that," [...] and then begins railing, against his ancestors, accusing them of that and this, back to and including the great Pitt, from whom he declares himself descended.|$|E
6000|$|Ashley, without noting her protest: [...] "I had {{forgotten}} that I had a corkscrew in my pocket-knife. Don't trouble yourself to ring for one." [...] He produces {{the knife and}} opens the bottle; then, as Miss Ramsey rises and stands aghast, he pours out a glass and offers it to her, with mock devotion. As {{she shakes her head}} and recoils: [...] "Oh! I thought you liked cocktails. They are very good after cigarettes--very reviving. But if you won't--" [...] He tosses off the cocktail and sets down the glass, smacking his lips. [...] "Tell your brother I commend his taste--in cocktails and"--puffing his cigarette--"tobacco. Poison for poison, let me offer you one of my cigarettes. They're milder than these." [...] <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to his breast pocket.|$|E
6000|$|GRINNIDGE: [...] "Well, {{take off}} your coat, and {{pull up to the}} {{register}}, and warm your poor feet." [...] <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> out over the register. [...] "Confound it! somebody's got the register open in the next room! You see, one pipe comes up from the furnace and branches into a V just under the floor, and professes to heat both rooms. But it don't. There was a fellow in there last winter who used to get all my heat. Used to go out and leave his register open, and I'd come in here just before dinner and find this place as cold as a barn. We had a running fight of it all winter. The man who got his register open first in the morning got all the heat for the day, for it never turned the other way when it started in one direction. Used to almost suffocate--warm, muggy days--maintaining my rights. Some piano-pounder in there this winter, it seems. Hear? And she hasn't lost any time in learning the trick of the register. What kept you so late in the country?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{wondered}} why she said nothing. Did she understand? <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on her arm.|$|R
60|$|And {{with quite}} {{unconscious}} dignity <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on <b>his</b> breast, {{and looked at}} her.|$|R
60|$|He {{stood there}} fidgeting {{about for a}} bit, and then <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> on my shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our tug {{was already}} alongside. Two loafers were {{carrying}} his dunnage behind him. I told the dockman at our moorings {{to keep all}} fast for a minute. The gangway was down already; but he made nothing of it. Up he jumps, one leap, swings his long legs over the rail, {{and there he is}} on board. They pass up his swell dunnage, and <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in his trousers pocket and throws all his small change on the wharf for them chaps to pick up. They were still promenading that wharf on all fours when we cast off. It was only then that he looked at me--quietly, you know; in a slow way. He wasn't so thin then as he is now; but I noticed he wasn't so young as he looked--not by a long chalk. He seemed to touch me inside somewhere. I went away pretty quick from there; I was wanted forward anyhow. I wasn't frightened. What should I be frightened for? I only felt touched--on the very spot. But Jee-miny, if anybody had told me we should be partners before the year was out--well, I would have--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind; he is {{a pioneer}} man, {{and will do}} a'most {{anything}} <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to," [...] his friends in the West still said. [...] "He understands the frontier." [...] Understanding the frontier {{is a great thing}} in Western America, across which the vanguard of civilization continues to march on in advance from year to year. [...] "And it's he that is bound to sweep slavery from off the face of this continent. He's the man, and he's about the only man." [...] I am not qualified to write the life of General Fremont, and can at present only make this slight reference to the details of his romantic career. That it has been full of romance, and that the man himself is endued with a singular energy, and a high, romantic idea of what may be done by power and will, there is no doubt. Five times he has crossed the Continent of North America from Missouri to Oregon and California, enduring great hardships in the service of advancing civilization and knowledge. That he has considerable talent, immense energy, and strong self-confidence, I believe. He is a frontier man--one of those who care nothing for danger, and who would dare anything with the hope of accomplishing a great career. But I have never heard that he has shown any practical knowledge of high military matters. It may be doubted whether a man of this stamp is well fitted to hold the command of a nation's army for great national purposes. May it not even be presumed that a man of this class is of all men the least fitted for such a work? The officer required should be a man with two specialties--a specialty for military tactics and a specialty for national duty. The army in the West was far removed from headquarters in Washington, and it was peculiarly desirable that the general commanding it should be one possessing a strong idea of obedience to the control of his own government. Those frontier capabilities--that self-dependent energy for which his friends gave Fremont, and probably justly gave him, such unlimited credit--are exactly the qualities which are most dangerous in such a position.|$|E
6000|$|Thus far had I written when I {{received}} your last, {{which made}} me {{at the sight of}} the direction caper for despair; but for one thing I am glad that I have been neglectful, and that is, therefrom I have received a proof of your utmost kindness, which at this present I feel very much, and I wish I had a heart always open to such sensations; but there is no altering a man's nature, and mine must be radically wrong, for it will lie dormant a whole month. This leads me to suppose that there are no men thoroughly wicked, so as never to be self-spiritualised into a kind of sublime misery; but, alas! 'tis but for an hour. He is the only Man [...] "who has kept watch on man's mortality," [...] who has philanthropy enough to overcome the disposition to an indolent enjoyment of intellect, who is brave enough to volunteer for uncomfortable hours. You remember in Hazlitt's essay on commonplace people he says, [...] "they read the Edinburgh and Quarterly, and think as they do." [...] Now, with respect to Wordsworth's [...] "Gipsy," [...] I think he is right, and yet I think Hazlitt is right, and yet I think Wordsworth is rightest. If Wordsworth had not been idle, he had not been without his task; nor had the [...] "Gipsies"--they in the visible world had been as picturesque an object as he in the invisible. The smoke of their fire, their attitudes, their voices, were all in harmony with the evenings. It is a bold thing to say--and I would not say it in print--but it seems to me that if Wordsworth had thought a little deeper at that moment, he would not have written the poem at all. I should judge it to have been written in one of the most comfortable moods of his life--it is a kind of sketchy intellectual landscape, not a search after truth, nor is it fair to attack him on such a subject; for it is with the critic as with the poet; had Hazlitt thought a little deeper, and been in a good temper, he would never have spied out imaginary faults there. The Sunday before last I asked Haydon to dine with me, when I thought of settling all matters with him in regard to Cripps, and let you know about it. Now, although I engaged him a fortnight before, he sent illness as an excuse. He never will come. I have not been well enough to stand the chance of a wet night, and so have not seen him, nor been able to expurgatorise more masks for you; but I will not speak--your speakers are never doers. Then Reynolds,--every time I see him and mention you, <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to his head and looks like a son of Niobe's; but he'll write soon.|$|E
60|$|Still {{she did not}} stir. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> out {{and drew}} her into the {{darkness}} again.|$|R
60|$|A noble {{compassion}} {{drew him}} forward, and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> determinedly on the dear old man's shoulder.|$|R
