5|$|In 2001, Ganguli created Connect UK, a Papua New Guinea based organisation, whose {{stated purpose}} was to forge {{cultural}} ties between the South Pacific and Britain. In November 2002, the British <b>High</b> <b>Commission</b> and Connect UK jointly put on the first 'British Week' in that country, 'a celebration of British arts, culture, design, education and science and technology'. Festival participants included Janet Street-Porter and Benjamin Zephaniah.|$|E
5|$|Several British {{government}} departments have been located in buildings on Northumberland Avenue; the Ministry of Defence and the Air Ministry formerly occupied the triangular-shaped Hotel Metropole on the street.

5|$|Additionally {{in early}} May, Charles assented to an {{unprecedented}} Act that forbade {{the dissolution of the}} English Parliament without its consent. In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and <b>High</b> <b>Commission</b> were abolished. All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.|$|E

5|$|Before 1923, Coghlan {{had opposed}} the {{amalgamation}} of Northern and Southern Rhodesia, concerned {{that it would}} make responsible government harder to attain. One outcome of the Jameson Raid in 1895–96 had been to prevent the concentration of the BSAC into one administration. Instead, the <b>High</b> <b>Commission</b> in Bechuanaland was maintained, Northern Rhodesia kept its own administration, and Britain oversaw BSAC affairs more closely. One year into his premiership, Coghlan began to consider territorial expansion and staked a claim to northwestern Bechuanaland. The Dominions Office rejected the claim {{on the grounds that the}} Union of South Africa would respond with its own claim for the southern half of the territory.|$|E
5|$|Caroline Island {{remained}} uninhabited and undisturbed through World War II and afterwards.

5|$|Over {{the course}} of a week, British forces {{evacuated}} approximately 500 entitled persons from Sierra Leone—almost 300 of whom left in the first two days of the operation. The arrival of British soldiers boosted morale in the country, and many foreign citizens opted to stay. The operation took on a slower pace after the first two days, but personnel and aircraft remained ready to evacuate any entitled persons who had been unable to reach Freetown earlier and to evacuate the British <b>High</b> <b>Commission</b> if the security situation deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|South Africans {{living abroad}} could {{register}} to vote at any South African Embassy, <b>High</b> <b>Commission</b> or Consulate-General from 9 January 2014 to 7 February 2014. South Africans living abroad who wished to vote had to notify the IEC of their intention to vote by 12 March 2014. The weekends of 18–19 January and 25–26 January were made registration weekends to accommodate voters who were unable to register during business hours. Over 26,000 voters were registered to vote abroad {{by the time of}} the election.|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} {{the arrival of the}} paras, Director Special Forces (DSF), Brigadier John Holmes, arrived in Freetown with a {{headquarters}} staff which included the commanding officer of 22 SAS and the officer commanding D Squadron, as well as three personnel from the Royal Air Force's Tactical Communications Wing. Holmes based himself at Seaview House, the British military headquarters in Freetown, near the British <b>High</b> <b>Commission.</b> From there, his staff established contact with the SAS observation teams on either side of Rokel Creek and with COBRA, the British government's emergency committee in London. The DSF, who usually attends COBRA meetings during crises which may require the use of special forces, was represented by his chief of staff and by Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins, operations officer at Headquarters Special Forces.|$|E

5|$|Days {{after the}} arrival of the RUF, on 2 June, rebels and {{soldiers}} attacked the Mammy Yoko hotel—where around 800 foreign citizens had gathered under the protection of Nigerian soldiers—in response to a Nigerian naval bombardment of Freetown. Penfold was able to see the firefight from the <b>high</b> <b>commission</b> building, and telephoned the Sierra Leonean defence headquarters to demand an end to the violence, threatening to request the deployment of US Marines from the USS Kearsarge, which was anchored offshore. The defence headquarters promptly ordered an end to the shooting, and the occupants of the hotel were evacuated to another nearby hotel for the night and then to the USS Kearsarge the next morning (3 June). In addition, Penfold and the remaining members of his staff (most of the staff and all their families had already left) were ordered to evacuate on the Kearsarge, despite Penfold's objections. The Kearsarge sailed to Conakry, where Kabbah had been staying {{since the beginning of the}} coup. No country recognised the military junta, and the international community continued to recognise the exiled Kabbah government as the legitimate government of Sierra Leone. Kabbah re-established his government in Conakry, basing it in a former Chinese restaurant leased by the British government through Penfold. There, Penfold advised Kabbah on keeping up the government's presence on the international stage, such as by ensuring that a representative was sent to international meetings. He also continued to run the British diplomatic mission in Freetown; the <b>high</b> <b>commission</b> continued to pay its local staff and began smuggling food and money into Sierra Leone. During the ten months in which the Kabbah government was exiled, Penfold—with funds from the British Department for International Development (DfID)—also assisted in the setting up of a covert radio station, which broadcast on behalf of the exiled government.|$|E
5|$|In April 1869, the U.S. Senate {{overwhelmingly}} {{rejected a}} proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war. Senator Charles Sumner spoke up before congress; publicly denounced Queen Victoria; demanded a huge reparation; {{and opened the}} possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment. The speech angered the British government, and talks {{had to be put}} off until matters cooled down. Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent Sir John Rose to America to meet with Fish. A joint <b>high</b> <b>commission</b> was created on February 9, 1871 in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers. Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8, 1871; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24, 1871.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{opinion of}} the theatre is more generous, with English Heritage {{describing}} the building as both Phipps' finest work {{and one of the}} best planned theatres in London. The building was Grade II* listed in January 1970. Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new <b>High</b> <b>Commission</b> for New Zealand, completed in 1963 by British architects Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the Commonwealth Institute. In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture. The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.|$|E

5|$|On 13 March 1995, {{a pair of}} legs, severed at the knees, {{was found}} in a plastic bag {{floating}} off Clifford Pier. Three days later, a pair of thighs and a torso were found in the same area, also in a plastic bag. Initially, Singapore police could only determine that the body parts belonged to a Caucasian, and they had a possible name after receiving a missing person report for Lowe from the South African <b>High</b> <b>Commission.</b> Vanessa Lowe filed the report because she was distressed that her husband, who used to make daily contact with his family when overseas, had not called home or returned to South Africa by 12 March. Lowe's colleagues at work also tried to determine his whereabouts through personal contacts in Singapore. On 1 April, she confirmed that the body parts were her husband's through visual identification. However, his arms and head were never found.|$|E
5|$|What came to {{be known}} as the Long Parliament also began to voice vague grievances against Charles, many of which were {{religious}} in nature. Parliament had many Puritans and Puritan-sympathizing members, who generally opposed the existing episcopal system, but there was little agreement over what shape the church should take. Later in 1640, the Root and Branch petition was presented to the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. It was signed by about 15,000 Londoners and called for total elimination of the episcopal system. Committees were organized in the House of Commons to enact religious reforms, leading to the imprisonment of Archbishop Laud and his supporters in the Tower of London as retaliation for their repression of Puritans. The Court of <b>High</b> <b>Commission</b> and the Star Chamber, courts which had inflicted severe punishments on Puritan dissenters, were also abolished.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he enjoyed}} the posting as drugs adviser, Penfold was keen {{to go back to}} Africa. He applied for a post as high {{commissioner}} in Namibia, but the post was downgraded and the application fell through. Penfold was then offered a posting to Sierra Leone. Although it was a lower-ranking post than the British Virgin Islands, Penfold was assured that taking the position would not adversely affect his career, so he accepted and, in March 1997, was appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone. He later stated that he believed his previous experience in Africa, particularly in Uganda, stood him in good stead for the events of his posting to Sierra Leone. The country {{was in the middle of}} a bloody civil war in 1997, and on 25 May—six weeks into Penfold's tenure—President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's government was overthrown in a military coup. Although the coup itself did not come as a surprise, the timing caught the international community off-guard. As in Uganda a decade earlier, Penfold gathered all the <b>high</b> <b>commission</b> staff and their families under one roof.|$|E
