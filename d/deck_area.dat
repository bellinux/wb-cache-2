40|$|This study {{assessed}} aspen regeneration on <b>decking</b> <b>areas</b> as {{affected by}} season of log deck building {{and duration of}} log storage; as well as root wounding, soil com- paction, and slash depth. On former <b>decking</b> <b>areas</b> that were built after a summer harvest, aspen regeneration was 50 % lower and root death 35 % greater compared to former <b>decking</b> <b>areas</b> of a fall harvest. Duration of log storage after a fall harvest {{had little effect on}} aspen regeneration; short (1. 5 – 3 months) or long (11 months) storage resulted in similar regeneration. Slash load was greatly increased on <b>decking</b> <b>areas</b> while root wounding and soil bulk density were only slightly increased compared to controls. For best management practices, log storage after summer harvest should be avoided especially when logs are kept over the growing period when suckering occurs. Additionally, removing the inter- woven mat of slash covering <b>decking</b> <b>areas</b> and limiting machine traffic to frozen soil will ensure vigorous suckering...|$|R

25|$|Assessment of {{the damage}} {{incurred}} in the Battle of the Yellow Sea led the NTC to another incorrect conclusion. The NTC tacticians noted that a single artillery hit in the mast of Tsesarevich nearly knocked it down; a fallen mast would, most likely, disable the secondary artillery turrets of its central citadel. Lattice masts, introduced with the American s, {{seemed to be a}} robust solution. However, they required substantial <b>deck</b> <b>area</b> to fit their wide bases. Instead of clearing deck space, the NTC designed the masts too narrow to be stable. Instead of Shukhov's hyperboloid profile, their structural beams were arranged in a weaker conical shape. Their deficiency was evident from the start, but the Navy needed something new to dispel the curse of Tsushima, and eagerly accepted the flawed novelty.|$|E
25|$|As of September 2008, Sanford Stadium {{could grow}} {{by more than}} 9,000 seats if a plan from {{university}} architects is approved. The seating expansion would wrap around {{the east side of}} the stadium and would bring the stadium's capacity to 101,766. University architect Danny Sniff said he considered filling in the endzone by the Sanford Drive bridge, but decided it was important to preserve the view of the Miller Learning Center and Tate Student Center. One alternative considered is to have a raised seating area which connects the upper <b>deck</b> <b>area</b> with the Sky Box section, maintaining the view from the bridge. There are other proposed additions which include increasing the number of concession stands and restrooms, as well as installing a Jumbotron outside the east end of the stadium to provide for the viewing of the game from outside the stadium.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrated}} dual-band infrared (DBIR) {{thermal imaging}} at the Grass Valley Creek Bridges near Redding CA. DBIR thermal imaging is an enabling technology for rapid, reliable, bridge deck inspections while minimizing lane closures. bridge-deck inspections were conducted from a mobile DBIR bridge inspection laboratory during November 2 - 3, 1995. We drove this self-contained unit at limited highway speeds over 0. 4 lane miles of bridge deck. Using two thermal IR bands, we distinguished delaminations from clutter. Clutter, or unwanted thermal detail, occurs from foreign materials or uneven shade {{on the bridge}} deck surface. By mapping the DBIR spectral- response differences at 3 - 5 {mu}m and 8 - 12 {mu}m, we removed foreign material clutter. By mapping the deck diurnal thermal inertia variations, we removed clutter from uneven shade. Thermal inertia is a bulk deck property, the square root of thermal conductivity x density x heat capacity. Delaminated decks have below-average thermal inertias, or above-average day-night temperature excursions. Compared to normal <b>decks</b> <b>areas,</b> delaminated <b>deck</b> <b>areas</b> were typically 2 or 3 {degrees}C warmer at noon, and 0. 5 {degrees}C cooler at night.
