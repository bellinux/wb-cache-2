25|$|The Olympic Torch Relay ends {{on the day}} of {{the opening}} {{ceremony}} in the central stadium of the Games. The <b>final</b> <b>carrier</b> is often kept unannounced until the last moment, and is usually a sports celebrity of the host country. The final bearer of the torch runs towards the cauldron, often placed at the top of a grand staircase, and then uses the torch to start the flame in the arena. It is considered to be a great honor to be asked to light the Olympic flame. After being lit, the flame continues to burn throughout the Games, until the day of the closing ceremony and celebration, when it is finally put out, symbolizing the official end of the Games.|$|E

50|$|DCPIP {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the rate of photosynthesis. It is part of the Hill {{reagents}} family.

As DCPIP is reduced and becomes colorless, the resultant increase in light transmittance can be measured using a spectrophotometer.|$|R

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{activity of}} animals {{can be defined}} by three levels: standard, routine and active metabolism. The first corresponds to the basal metabolism or minimal activity of the animal and the second refers to a pattern in which the animals have restricted movements, but are not completely immobilized, and the third (active metabolism) is related to maximal activity, e. g. flight (Prosser 1968). An interesting example is the active metabolism during the task of cutting in leaf-cutting ant species, whose meta-bolic rate can increase 31 times when compared to their basal metabolism (Roces & Ligthon 1995). According to Pielström & Roces (2013), excavation activity is partitioned among workers into three functionally distinct groups: excavators, that remove soil pellets; short distance carriers, that drop the collected soil pellets after a few centimeters; and long-dis-tance <b>final</b> <b>carriers,</b> that transport the collected soil pellets to the final deposition site. Nest excavation most likely has a high energetic cost to the workers, reflecting the consump-tion of their body reserves. The energy required for activities of high energetic cost comes from body reserves, body fat (lipid reserves) or hemolymph, such as free carbohydrates (Chown & Nicolson 2004). The hemolymph contains free sugars, mostly {{in the form of}} trehalose, a disaccharide com-posed of two glucose molecules (Thompson 2003). It is known that ant workers have a reduction in body reserves during nest excavation, i. e., the soluble carbohydrates are consumed in this activity, while total lipid content re-mains constant (Camargo et al. 2012). This consumption is a direct consequence of metabolism in the organism, and the method used for its determination is through the rate of ex-pelled carbon dioxide and/or oxygen uptake (Chown & Nicolson 2004; Macieira & Proni 2005). Thus, the goal {{of this study was to}} determine the energetic cost of excavation per worker per day, which is readily measured by CO 2 pro-duction during this activity...|$|R
50|$|Frank Knox {{was built}} at Bath, Maine.

During the Battle of Okinawa she acted as a radar picket destroyer giving early warnings of incoming air raids. She was present in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945 and remained in the Far East until early February 1946. The ship made additional deployments to the region during the later 1940s and was reclassified as a radar picket destroyer (DDR) in March 1949.|$|E
5000|$|NAT {{invested}} $10 million {{competing for}} the nighttime Chicago to New York route (CAM 17). NAT started service on September 1, 1927 using Carrier Pigeons from CAM-3.

Early in 1929, NAT acquired seven 625 hp Curtiss Falcons, these replaced the smaller Carrier Pigeons. D. A. Askew flew the <b>final</b> <b>Carrier</b> Pigeon flight. He had flown this same aircraft on the inaugural CAM No. 3 flight. On February 9, 1934, the Post Office cancelled all airmail contracts on suspicion that the mail carrying contracts had been awarded through collusion during the previous administration.|$|E

50|$|Its first wing, the 50th TCW, became {{operational}} on 17 October 1943. A second wing, the 52d Troop Carrier Wing, {{arrived from}} Sicily on 17 February 1944. Its five groups {{had participated in}} the large airborne assault during the Allied invasion of Sicily and had flown combat jumps on a smaller scale in Italy. On 11 March 1944 the <b>final</b> troop <b>carrier</b> wing assigned to the command, the 53rd TCW, arrived from the United States along with five groups that had just completed their operational training. The wings were realigned to provide the 53rd TCW, tasked as the primary unit for glider operations, with the four groups already operational in February 1944 (434th through 437th), while the least experienced groups were assigned to the 50th Wing. The command grew to a total of 14 groups in April 1944 when the 315th TCG was taken off transport duties in the Mediterranean and assigned two additional squadrons to bring it up to full TO&E, and when the newly created 442d TCG arrived from the United States.|$|R
50|$|Despite damaged inflicted upon Yorktown {{during the}} Battle of Coral Sea, she was patched {{up enough to}} join the battle group in defense of Midway Atoll. With three Japanese flattops {{crippled}} on 4 June, search aircraft from Scouting Squadron 5 (re-designated VS-5 after Coral Sea) attempted to locate the <b>final</b> remaining <b>carrier,</b> Hiryū. Lt. Dickson flew wing for Lt. Samuel Adams and the pair spotted a task group consisting of the missing carrier, two battleships, four cruisers, and four destroyers. Despite being forced to fend off an attacking A6M Zeke in their slow Douglas SBDs, Lt. Adams radioed an incredibly accurate report on the Japanese whereabouts and aircraft from USS Enterprise razed the Hiryū. The damage was so severe she was ordered abandoned and eventually scuttled by destroyers. For his actions at the Battle of Midway, Lt. Dickson was awarded a gold star {{in lieu of a}} second Navy Cross. However, Yorktown did not survive long past the battle and Dickson would have to return to the States.|$|R
5000|$|The CVA-01 {{would have}} {{displaced}} 54,500 tons (although {{the ship was}} said to displace 53,000 tons [...] "in average action condition"), with a flight deck length (including the bridle arrester boom) of 963 ft The size of the flight deck, combined with steam catapults and arrester gear would have enabled the carriers to operate the latest jets. The aircraft complement would have included 36 Phantom fighter/ground-attack aircraft and/or Buccaneer low-level strike aircraft, four early-warning aircraft, five anti-submarine helicopters and two search-and-rescue helicopters. The large 'Broomstick' radar dome above the central island on the carrier was planned to be a Type 988 Anglo-Dutch 3D radar, which would subsequently be fitted on the Royal Netherlands Navy Tromp-class frigates, although this {{would not have been}} fitted to the <b>final</b> <b>carrier</b> as Britain pulled out of the project.|$|E

5000|$|... "On {{the morning}} of 4 October, patrols were sent out on their morning routes, and Whittlesey was unsure {{that any of the}} carrier pigeons had {{actually}} made it through. He was unsure if the command actually knew of the desperate situation that was unfolding. Whittlesey believed that his orders to hold this position still applied, because the position was the key to breaking through the German lines. It was the worst day that the battalion would have. There has been much controversy among different historians regarding how it occurred, but Whittlesey and his men were shelled by their own artillery. Some believe that Whittlesey had relayed the wrong coordinates, while others believe that Whittlesey had gotten the coordinates right and the artillery's aim was off. Whittlesey released his <b>final</b> <b>carrier</b> pigeon, named Cher Ami to call off the barrage.
