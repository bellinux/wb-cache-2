40|$|THE STUDY OF THE {{archaeology}} (origin, antiquity, and evolution) of a plantfamily {{calls for}} {{an analysis of the}} historical evolution of the types of vegeta-tion in which the genera and species of the family could have arisen, and those in which they now are to be found. It would have been necessary for environ-ments to have provided, during periods ofgeobotanical and palaeoclimatic prehistory and the early stages of man, appropriate conditions for the growth of types of vegetation, or rather biological ecosystems also incorporating resident fauna, which could have contained primitive forms of the family being studied. The family Gramineae (other than the Bambuseae) has been chosen for study because of its (now) widespread distribution, and because of its great economic significance in providing both the progenitors of the cultivated cereals, and the major source, in a wild or a cultivated form, of grazing and cut fodder for domestic livestock. Specialists in the Bambuseae or in herbaceous plant families may consider whether and to what extent the conclusions reached apply to their material.

Long- and short-term changes in vegetation functioning are a key indicator of ecological processes. We predict net primary production (NPP) at monthly temporal resolution for 16 years (1981 – 1996) at an 8 -km spatial resolution for the approximately 10 6 km 2 area of Ontario, Canada.

40|$|Several {{initiatives}} are currently emerging {{to observe the}} exchange of energy and matter between the earth's surface and atmosphere standardized over larger space and time domains. For example, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Integrated Carbon Observing System (ICOS) are set to provide the ability of unbiased ecological inference across ecoclimatic zones and decades by deploying highly scalable and robust instruments and data processing. In the construction of these observatories, enclosed infrared gas analyzers are widely employed for eddy covariance applications. While these sensors represent a substantial improvement compared to their open- and closed-path predecessors, remaining high-frequency attenuation varies with site properties and gas sampling systems, and requires correction. Here, we show that components of the gas sampling system can substantially contribute to such high-frequency attenuation, but their effects can be significantly reduced by careful system design. From laboratory tests we determine the frequency at which signal attenuation reaches 50  % for individual parts of the gas sampling system. For different models of rain caps and particulate filters, this frequency falls into ranges of 2. 5 – 16. 5  Hz for CO 2, 2. 4 – 14. 3  Hz for H 2 O, and 8. 3 – 21. 8  Hz for CO 2, 1. 4 – 19. 9  Hz for H 2 O, respectively. A short and thin stainless steel intake tube was found to not limit frequency response, with 50  % attenuation occurring at frequencies well above 10  Hz for both H 2 O and CO 2. From field tests we found that heating the intake tube and particulate filter continuously with 4  W was effective, and reduced the occurrence of problematic relative humidity levels (RH [*]>[*] 60  %) by 50  % in the infrared gas analyzer cell. No further improvement of H 2 O frequency response was found for heating in excess of 4  W. These laboratory and field tests were reconciled using resistor–capacitor theory, and NEON's final gas sampling system was developed on this basis. The design consists of the stainless steel intake tube, a pleated mesh particulate filter and a low-volume rain cap in combination with 4  W of heating and insulation. In comparison to the original design, this reduced the high-frequency attenuation for H 2 O by [*]≈[*] 3 ∕ 4, and the remaining cospectral correction did not exceed 3  %, even at high relative humidity (95  %). The standardized design can be used across a wide range of <b>ecoclimates</b> and site layouts, and maximizes practicability due to minimal flow resistance and maintenance needs. Furthermore, due to minimal high-frequency spectral loss, it supports the routine application of adaptive correction procedures, and enables largely automated data processing across sites...|$|R

40|$|Forest loss in {{hotspots}} {{around the}} world impacts not only local climate where loss occurs, but also influences climate and vegetation in remote parts of the globe through <b>ecoclimate</b> teleconnections. The magnitude and mechanism of remote impacts likely depends on the location and distribution of forest loss hotspots, but {{the nature of these}} dependencies has not been investigated. We use global climate model simulations to estimate the distribution of ecologically-relevant climate changes resulting from forest loss in two hotspot regions: western North America (wNA), which is experiencing accelerated dieoff, and the Amazon basin, which is subject to high rates of deforestation. The remote climatic and ecological net effects of simultaneous forest loss in both regions differed from the combined effects of loss from the two regions simulated separately, as evident in three impacted areas. Eastern South American Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) increased due to changes in seasonal rainfall associated with Amazon forest loss and changes in temperature related to wNA forest loss. Eurasia's GPP declined with wNA forest loss due to cooling temperatures increasing soil ice volume. Southeastern North American productivity increased with simultaneous forest loss, but declined with only wNA forest loss due to changes in VPD. Our results illustrate the need {{for a new generation of}} local-to-global scale analyses to identify potential <b>ecoclimate</b> teleconnections, their underlying mechanisms, and most importantly, their synergistic interactions, to predict the responses to increasing forest loss under future land use change and climate change...|$|E

40|$|Ecosystems are an {{integral}} part of climate, interacting with the atmosphere by modifying fluxes of energy, water, momentum, and carbon [...] -processes whose importance varies spatially. This dissertation focuses on the study of <b>ecoclimate</b> [...] unraveling the complex interactions between ecosystems and climate using a variety of tools including simple models, global scale carbon-climate models, and direct analysis of site-level data. Using a global climate model we show that transpired water vapor from expanded vegetation in the Arctic contributes greenhouse warming with a magnitude of forcing larger than that from the associated changes in albedo. This mechanism has not been considered in previous studies and here we suggest that it may negate the negative climate feedbacks expected from the surface latent cooling associated with the expansion of deciduous forest. Additionally we find that large-scale expansion of low albedo mid latitude forests in the model has the ability to increase Northern Hemisphere temperatures, moving the thermal equator northward and thus modifying global circulation patterns. We observe a northward shift of the intertropical convergence zone over Africa suggesting that extratropical vegetation may be partly responsible for the maintenance of precipitation over the Sahara inferred from proxy records of vegetation from ~ 6000 Years Ago. The ability of vegetation to effect remote circulation has implications for the role that plants may play in the current climate as well as in climates of the past and the future. In an analysis of nighttime respiration across the eddy covariance Ameriflux tower network we find a residual signal in respiration resembing seasonal variations in substrate mass after accounting for the effects of temperature and moisture. The prevalence of a mass signal indicates that allowing temperature sensitivity to change over time unphysically attributes variations in mass and moisture to changes in temperature. Using a simple carbon cycle model we show that ecosystems with long turnover times are most sensitive to long period forcing and therefore it will be harder to detect or attribute changes in these systems. This suggests that it may be easier to detect and attribute changes in the Tropics compared to the Boreal forest...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 The natural {{composition}} of terrestrial ecosystems can {{be shaped by}} climate {{to take advantage of}} local environmental conditions. Ecosystem functioning, e. g. interaction between photosynthesis and temperature, can also acclimate to different climatological states. The combination of these two factors thus determines ecological-climate interactions. The ecosystem functioning also {{plays a key role in}} predicting the carbon cycle, hydrological cycle, terrestrial surface energy balance, and the feedbacks in the climate system. Predicting the response of the Earth's biosphere to global warming requires the ability to mechanistically represent the processes controlling ecosystem functioning through photosynthesis, respiration, and water use. The physical environment in a place shapes the vegetation there, but vegetation also has the potential to shape the environment, e. g. increased photosynthesis and transpiration moisten the atmosphere. These two-way <b>ecoclimate</b> interactions create the potential for feedbacks between vegetation at the physical environment that depend on the vegetation and the climate of a place, and can change throughout the year. In Chapter 1, we derive a global empirical map of the sensitivity of vegetation to climate using the response of satellite-observed greenness to interannual variations in temperature and precipitation. We infer mechanisms constraining ecosystem functioning by analyzing how the sensitivity of vegetation to climate varies across climate space. Our analysis yields empirical evidence for multiple physical and biological mediators of the sensitivity of vegetation to climate at large spatial scales. In hot and wet locations, vegetation is greener in warmer years despite temperatures likely exceeding thermally optimum conditions. However, sunlight generally increases during warmer years, suggesting that the increased stress from higher atmospheric water demand is offset by higher rates of photosynthesis. The sensitivity of vegetation transitions in sign (greener when warmer or drier to greener when cooler or wetter) along an emergent line in climate space with a slope of about 59 mm/yr/C, twice as steep as contours of aridity. The mismatch between these slopes is evidence at a global scale of the limitation of both water supply due to inefficiencies in plant access to rainfall, and plant physiological responses to atmospheric water demand. This empirical pattern can provide a functional constraint for process-based models, helping to improve predictions of the global-scale response of vegetation to a changing climate. In Chapter 2, we use observations of vegetation interaction with the physical environment to identify where ecosystem functioning is well simulated in an ensemble of Earth system models. We leverage this data-model comparison to hypothesize which physiological mechanisms - photosynthetic efficiency, respiration, water supply, atmospheric water demand, and sunlight availability - dominate the ecosystem response in places with different climates. The models are generally successful in reproducing the broad sign and shape of ecosystem function across climate space except for simulating generally lower leaf area during warmer years in places with hot wet climates. In addition, simulated ecosystem interaction with temperature is generally larger and changes more rapidly across a gradient of temperature than is observed. We hypothesize that the amplified interaction and change are both due to a lack of adaptation and acclimation in simulations. This discrepancy with observations suggests that simulated responses of vegetation to global warming, and feedbacks between vegetation and climate, are too strong in the models. Finally, models and observations share an abrupt threshold between dry regions and wet regions where strong positive vegetation response to precipitation falls to nearly zero in places receiving around 1000 mm/year. In Chapter 3, we investigate how <b>ecoclimate</b> interactions change across seasons in the Amazon basin. We use observations of solar induced fluorescence from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO 2) to statistically analyze the sensitivity of fluorescence to synoptic variations in temperature and precipitation. In addition to studying the sensitivity of vegetation to climate across seasons, we use OCO 2 measurements of total column water vapor (TCWV) and CO 2 concentration (XCO 2) to investigate the influence of the Amazon basin vegetation on the CO 2 concentration and water vapor of the atmosphere leaving the basin. Our analysis determines the seasonal importance of vegetation activity on the outflow of CO 2 from the Amazon basin, while providing evidence that transpiration is primarily driven by variations in temperature during the dry season, rather than photosynthesis. We establish a statistical relationship between fluorescence (as a proxy for vegetation photosynthesis), temperature, and precipitation, as well as the difference between the outflow of atmospheric water vapor from the inflow water vapor, basin fluorescence, temperature, and precipitation...|$|E
