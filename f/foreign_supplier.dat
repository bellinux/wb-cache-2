It is the main <b>foreign</b> <b>supplier</b> of cannabis and an important entry point of South American cocaine and Asian methamphetamines to the United States.

25|$|Between 2010 and 2012 the UK {{intelligence}} community initiated an investigation aimed at Huawei, the <b>foreign</b> <b>supplier</b> of BT's new fibre infrastructure with increasing urgency after the USA, Canada and Australia prevented {{the company from}} operating in their countries. Although BT had notified the UK government in 2003 of Huawei's interest in their £10b network upgrade contract, they did not raise the security implications as BT failed to explain that the Chinese company would have unfettered access to critical infrastructure. On 16 December 2012 David Cameron was supplied with an in-depth report indicating that the intelligence services had very grave doubts regarding Huawei, and that the UK governmental, military, business community and private citizen's privacy may be under serious threat. Subsequently, BT's Infinity program and other projects are now under urgent review.|$|E
500|$|The Gripen's cost {{has been}} subject to {{frequent}} attention and speculation. In 2008, Saab announced reduced earnings for that year, partly attributing this to increased marketing costs for the aircraft. In 2008, Saab disputed Norway's cost calculations for the Gripen NG as overestimated and in excess of real world performance with existing operators. [...] A 2007 report by the European Union Institute for Security Studies stated the total research and development costs of Gripen were €1.84 billion. [...] According {{to a study by}} Jane's Information Group in 2012, the Gripen's operational cost was the lowest among several modern fighters; it was estimated at $4,700 per flight hour. [...] The Swedish Ministry of Defense estimated the cost of the full system, comprising 60 Gripen E/F, at SEK 90 billion distributed over the period 2013–42. [...] The Swedish Armed Forces estimated that maintaining 100 C/D-model aircraft until 2042 would cost SEK 60 billion, while buying aircraft from a <b>foreign</b> <b>supplier</b> would cost SEK 110 billion.|$|E
40|$|Qualification {{requirements}} for <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> in Public Procurement (PP) {{are quite different}} in each European Union (EU) member state. The most complex {{requirements for}} <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> {{in the context of}} public purchases are included in the Czech PP law. The aim {{of this paper is to}} make an overview of the problem of qualification requirements for <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> in the PP law of the CR. Its sub-objectives are the identification and explanation of solutions to the problem in the PP legislation of neighboring countries of the CR that are also members of the EU. The methodological part of the contribution is based mainly on the analysis and critical evaluation of the current state of legal issues relating to the proof of qualification of <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> in PP orders of the CR; with examples of fairly extensive decision-making practices of the Office for the Protection of Competition and law courts, including the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. The paper highlights the unnecessary complexity of qualification requirements that, on purely formal grounds, inhibits submissions of tenders from potential <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> that would otherwise be able to submit a bid for a public contract without any problems whatsoever. The authors are using and applying a comparative-legal method in the context of the comparison of the PP legislation of neighboring countries of the CR that are also members of the EU. The case study of <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> bidding for above-threshold public tenders in the CR at the minimum legal requirements of the contracting authority (CA) for proof of qualification, the comparation study with selected EU countries or analysis of the development of the proportion of public contracts awarded to <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> in 2010 – 2014 shows that there is legislation uncertainty in EU PP law that should be reduced and simplified on an EC basis...|$|R

40|$|Plant {{locations}} in the U. S. auto industry have been moving southward for some time now. This paper utilizes a comprehensive dataset of the U. S. auto industry and focuses on plant location decisions of auto supplier plants that were opened less than 15 {{years ago in the}} U. S. We find that agglomeration continues to matter: suppliers want to be close to each other as well as to their assembly plant customers. We also find evidence of differences in location factors for domestic and <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers.</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> exhibit a stronger preference to be near highways, other <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> and <b>foreign</b> assembly plants. That helps explain the different location patterns observed for these two groups within the auto region. Automobile industry and trade; Automobiles - Prices; Industrial location...|$|R
2500|$|Since the 1963 Sino-Pakistan Agreement, the {{military}} has had close military relations with China, working jointly to develop the JF-17, the K-8, and other weapons systems. [...] China was the second-largest <b>foreign</b> <b>supplier</b> of military equipment to Pakistan. Both nations also cooperate on development of nuclear and space technology programs. Their armies have a schedule for organizing joint military exercises. The military also maintains close relations with the United States, which gave Pakistan major non-NATO ally status in 2004.

2500|$|Israel is {{the second-largest}} <b>foreign</b> <b>supplier</b> of {{arms to the}} People's Republic of China, only after the Russian Federation. China has {{purchased}} {{a wide array of}} military hardware from Israel, including Unmanned aerial vehicles and communications satellites. China has become an extensive market for Israel's military industries and arms manufacturers, and trade with Israel has allowed it to obtain [...] "dual-use" [...] technology which the United States and European Union were reluctant to provide. In 2010 Yair Golan, head of IDF Home Front Command visited China to strengthen military ties. In 2012, IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz visited China for high-level talks with the Chinese defense establishment.|$|E
2500|$|Israel has {{provided}} China with military assistance, expertise and technology. According {{to a report}} from the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, [...] "Israel ranks second only to Russia as a weapons system provider to China and as a conduit for sophisticated cutting edge military technology, followed by France and Germany." [...] Israel was ready to sell China the Phalcon, an Israeli airborne early-warning radar system (AWACS), until the United States forced it to cancel the deal. Some estimate that Israel sold arms worth US$4 billion to China in this period. China has looked to Israel for the arms and military technology it cannot acquire from the United States and Russia. [...] Israel is now China's second-largest <b>foreign</b> <b>supplier</b> of arms after Russia with China has purchased a wide array of military equipment and technology, including communications satellites. China is a vital market for Israel's aerospace and defense industry. Due to Israel's recognition of China, Israel has also limited its cooperation with Taiwan in order to foster closer ties with Mainland China.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} promote {{international}} trade in services, the WTO-GATS aims at pro-gressively eliminating discriminatory regulations, which apply to <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers,</b> by guaranteeing equal national treatment. This paper looks instead at the trade effect of domestic regulations, which apply to all firms indifferently and {{do not intend to}} exclude <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers.</b> We propose a theory-based empirical test {{to determine whether or not}} these domestic regulations affect <b>foreign</b> <b>suppliers</b> more than local ones. We take this test to the data by using French firm-level exports of professional services to OECD countries. Our econometric results show that domestic regulations in the importing markets matter significantly for trade in services. They reduce both the decision to ex-port and the individual exports. These results tend to prove that domestic regulations are de facto discriminatory even if they are not de jure...|$|R
