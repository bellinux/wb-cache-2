40|$|Duane’s {{retraction}} syndrome (DRS) type I {{is often}} associated with esotropia (ET) and <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> in those with fusion. This study was designed to delineate the quantitative relationship between the angles of eye deviation with that of <b>face</b> <b>turn.</b> Ten patients with DRS type I with ET and <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> toward the deviated eye, who had central fixation, were chosen. Esodeviation was measured by alternate prism-cover test, and the angle of <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> was measured by an orthopedic protractor in degree and then converted to prism diopter. The subtraction of eye deviation from <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> showed 2. 4 prism diopters of <b>face</b> <b>turn</b> underestimation in comparison with esodevition, which is so small that deviations of eye and face may be considered virtually equal...|$|R
