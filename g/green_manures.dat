40|$|In modern {{sustainable}} agriculture, <b>green</b> <b>manuring</b> {{is increasingly}} emphasized for a reasonable land use management. However, {{the expansion of}} <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> is affected by a range of factors, such as soil geophysical properties and human intervention. This paper proposes an approach of spatial modelling to understand the mechanisms that influence <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> expansion and map the future distribution of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> intercropped in the orchards in the Pinggu District, Beijing, China. We firstly classified the orchards into five grades according to a land productivity evaluation, and then considered two strategies for implementing <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> Two scenarios were designed to represent the strategies: prioritizing low-productivity orchards to promote <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> intercropping (scenario 1) and prioritizing high-productivity orchards to promote <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> intercropping (scenario 2). The spatial expansion of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> for 2020 was simulated at a resolution of a 100 × 100 m grid in the CLUE-S (the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at the Small Region Extent) model. The two strategies led to quite different spatial patterns of <b>green</b> <b>manure,</b> although they were applied to the same areas. As a result, the spatial pattern of <b>green</b> <b>manuring</b> of scenario 1 was more concentrated than that of scenario 2. To summarize, the modelled outcomes identified the driving factors that affect <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> expansion at a grid scale, whereas the implementing strategies directly determined the spatial arrangements of <b>green</b> <b>manuring</b> at a regional scale. Therefore, we argue that {{the assessment of the}} driving factors and the prediction of the future distribution of <b>green</b> <b>manuring</b> are crucial for informing an extensive use of <b>green</b> <b>manure...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractGreen manure use in China has {{declined}} rapidly since the 1980 s with the {{extensive use of}} chemical fertilizers. The deterioration of field environments {{and the demand for}} green agricultural products have resulted in more attention to <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> Human intervention and policy-oriented behaviors likely have large impacts on promoting <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> planting. However, little information is available regarding on where, at what rates, and in which ways (i. e., intercropping <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in orchards or rotating <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in cropland) to develop <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and what benefits could be gained by incorporating <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in fields at the county scale. This paper presents the conversion of land use and its effects at small region extent (CLUE-S) model, which is specifically developed for the simulation of land use changes originally, to predict spatial distribution of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in cropland and orchards in 2020 in Pinggu District located in Beijing, China. Four types of land use for planting or not planting <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> were classified and the future land use dynamics (mainly croplands and orchards) were considered in the prediction. Two scenarios were used to predict the spatial distribution of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> based on data from 2011 : The promotion of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> planting in orchards (scenario 1) and the promotion of simultaneous <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> planting in orchards and croplands (scenario 2). The predictions were generally accurate based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kappa indices, which validated the effectiveness of the CLUE-S model in the prediction. In addition, the spatial distribution of the <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> was acquired, which indicated that <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> mainly located in the orchards of the middle and southern regions of Dahuashan, the western and southern regions of Wangxinzhuang, the middle region of Shandongzhuang, the eastern region of Pinggu and the middle region of Xiagezhuang under scenario 1. <b>Green</b> <b>manure</b> planting under scenario 2 occurred in orchards in the middle region of Wangxinzhuang, and croplands in most regions of Daxingzhuang, southern Pinggu, northern Xiagezhuang and most of Mafang. The spatially explicit results allowed for the assessment of the benefits of these changes based on different economic and ecological indicators. The economic and ecological gains of scenarios 1 and 2 were 175 691 900 and 143 000 300 CNY, respectively, which indicated that the first scenario was more beneficial for promoting the same area of <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> These results can facilitate policies of promoting <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and guide the extensive use of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in local agricultural production in suitable ways...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} the rationale of introduction and continuation of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> cropping in large-scale upland farming. First, {{the decision on}} the introduction of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> cropping depends {{on the scale of}} farming in terms of farming area and, if introduced, the acreage of such crops represents around 5 % of the total acreage. Second, although the introduction of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure,</b> which is a non-cash crop, causes decline in direct profitability, overall costs are reduced. Therefore, few differences in income per unit area were found among the cases of continuous, non-continuous, and non-introduction of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> cropping. In other words, there are few grounds for concern over a decline in profitability, for the halting or non continuation of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> cropping because of the availability of crop subsidies. Third, imbalanced crop compositions are observed in the cases of non continuation fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> cropping, indicating the difficulty in establishing a crop rotation.

The aim of the long-term experiment was to evaluate the effect of different localities and different organic fertilizers on crop yield in organic farming. Variants of fertilization included in the experiment are: 1.

The experiment started by sowing of winter wheat so <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> crop was not grown in the first experimental year. The highest yield of winter wheat grain coming from {{the first year of}} the experiment was observed on the variant with renewable external sources (digestate). Average grain yield on this variant was about 7. 12 t/ha (up to 0. 74 t/ha increased than the unfertilized control).

However, the release of nu-trients from the <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> varies and can therefore be difficult to control. Risks for losses of nutrients are also present. Although the area of organic farmland is increasing in Sweden, the use of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> is decreasing. This report contains a literature study which compiles research on the functions of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in a cropping system and also how the crop can be used if harvested, for example to produce biogas. The second part of the report is based on interviews with a number of farmers using <b>green</b> <b>manure.</b> The interviews were made as semi-structured conversations and the method was qualitative. The main objective has been to investigate the farmers’ view on <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and the reasons for them to use it. The advantage of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> according to the interviewees is the supply of several services such as weed control, in-creased biodiversity and an improvement in soil structure. Some mention the disadvantage of the lost opportunity of growing a cash crop, but the greater part of those interviewed believe that including <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> in a crop sequence is a sustainable way of farming. A comparison is made between two regions in Sweden, Eastern Gothia and the region of Mälaren, which both have a lot of crop production without cattle management. In the re-gion of Mälaren the use of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> is frequent on organic farms with crop produc-tion. In Eastern Gothia the situation is the opposite: the method is used only on very few farms. In both regions the replacement of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> with ley for seeds or fodder is in-creasing. The potential of marketing of the harvested ley is higher in Eastern Gothia where the access to alternative organic fertilizers is also better. In the same region the multi ma-chine System Cameleon is used, which enables new crop sequences within organic farm-ing, where weed control is performed by harrowing. The use of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> crops may henceforth {{play an important role in}} organic agri-culture as weed control and soil amendment.

The growth and N accumulation of S. rostrata in stem inoculation treatment was the highest. Therefore, stem inoculation method was used for growing S. rostrata to incorporate into the rice soils for the second experiment. In the second experiment, the effects of S. rostrata <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> application on the growth and yield of rice were studied. <b>Green</b> <b>manure</b> treatments (2 and 4 plants $pot^- 1 $) were compared to urea treatments (40 and 80 kg N $ha^- 1 $) and no application treatment. <b>Green</b> <b>manure</b> treatments increased dry matter weight and grain weight of rice significantly over urea and no application treatments.
