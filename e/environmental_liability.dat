Slagging gasifiers, which are utilized at many of the major coal gasification applications worldwide, have considerable advantage in that ash components are fused into a glassy slag, capturing trace heavy metals in the non-leachable glassy matrix, rendering the material non-toxic. This non-hazardous slag has multiple beneficial uses such as aggregate in concrete, aggregate in asphalt for road construction, grit in abrasive blasting, roofing granules, etc.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Emerald via the DOI in this record. Purpose – Our purpose is to encourage accounting regulators to address diversity in practice in the reporting of <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities.</b> When Canada changed to IFRS in 2011, Canadian regulators asked the IFRS Interpretations Committee to interpret whether the discount rate to value <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> should be a risk-free one. Old Canadian GAAP and current US GAAP allow for a higher discount rate, resulting in commensurately lower <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities.</b> International regulators refused {{to address this issue}} expecting no diversity in practice in Canada. Design/methodology/approach – The focus is on a sample of Canadian oil and gas and mining firms. These domestic industries play a major role internationally and have significant <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities.</b> The method is empirical archival, tracking firm characteristics and discount rate choice on transition to IFRS. Findings – We show that there is significant diversity in practice. About one third of the sample firms choose a higher discount rate, avoiding a major increase in <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> on transition to IFRS. The evidence suggests that these firms had relatively larger <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> and that the discount rate decision is a strategic choice. Research limitations/implications – The sample is based on one country and may only be reflecting local anomalies that have no broader implications. Practical implications – Diversity in practice in accounting for <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> is not acceptable. Accounting regulators should act to create consistent and comparable reporting practice. Social implications – Firms and managers facing larger <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> can choose to minimize <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> under IFRS, while it is the general public and society at large that bear the ultimate risk. Originality/value – The paper pushes forward the debate on whether recognised <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> should reflect the interests of equity investors, or if other investors and stakeholders should be taken into account.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> on risk assessment by investigating whether the markets consider these liabilities a form of corporate debt {{in the assessment of}} the firm's risk. A model developed by Rubinstein (1973) and further expanded and operationalised by Dhaliwal (1986) is used to examine whether the inclusion of <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> relating to Superfund sites has any incremental explanatory power. A positive association between the <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> and measures of firms' risk is expected. Such results should help policy-makers {{decide whether or not to}} require companies to disclose <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> in their financial reports. The empirical results weakly support the hypothesis that <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> relating to Superfund sites are considered corporate liabilities in assessing firm's risk. One possible explanation is that the problems in recognising and determining the exact amount of liabilities for the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) firms make it difficult for the investors to use this information for risk assessment. This paper addresses some important issues such as reporting <b>environmental</b> <b>liabilities</b> in the financial statements, their recognition and their roles in firm risk assessment. environmental liabilities; firm risk; accounting earnings; pension liabilities; financial leverage; risk assessment; Superfund sites; financial reporting. ...|$|R
