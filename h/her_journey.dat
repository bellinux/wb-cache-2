5|$|One {{month after}} her {{attempted}} suicide, Wollstonecraft agreed {{to undertake the}} long and treacherous journey to Scandinavia in order to resolve Imlay's business difficulties. Not only was <b>her</b> <b>journey</b> to Scandinavia fraught with peril (she was a woman travelling alone {{during a time of}} war), it was also laced with sorrow and anger. While Wollstonecraft initially believed that the trip might resurrect their relationship, she eventually recognized that it was doomed, particularly after Imlay failed to meet her in Hamburg. Wollstonecraft's despair increased as <b>her</b> <b>journey</b> progressed.|$|E

5|$|Although the Americans {{had taken}} the vessel, Sterett had no orders to take prizes and so was obliged to release her. Enterprise {{completed}} <b>her</b> <b>journey</b> to Malta, and received honor and praise from the squadron's Commodore on her return to the fleet. The success of the battle boosted morale in the United States, since it was that country's first victory {{in the war against}} the Tripolitans. The opposite occurred in Tripoli, where morale sank heavily upon learning of Tripoli defeat. Despite Enterprise triumph, the war continued indecisively for another four years.|$|E

5|$|Dor makes {{a strong}} feminist {{statement}} without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart.

5|$|After {{some years}} spent in Kent, perhaps in 625, Paulinus was consecrated a bishop.
