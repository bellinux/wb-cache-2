50|$|Steam serves several {{roles in}} this reaction. It {{is the source}} of heat for {{powering}} the endothermic reaction, and it removes coke that tends to form on the iron oxide catalyst through the water gas shift reaction. The potassium promoter enhances this <b>decoking</b> reaction. The steam also dilutes the reactant and products, shifting the position of chemical equilibrium towards products. A typical styrene plant consists of two or three reactors in series, which operate under vacuum to enhance the conversion and selectivity. Typical per-pass conversions are ca. 65% for two reactors and 70-75% for three reactors. Selectivity to styrene is 93-97%. The main byproducts are benzene and toluene. Because styrene and ethylbenzene have similar boiling points (145 and 136 °C, respectively), their separation requires tall distillation towers and high return/reflux ratios. At its distillation temperatures, styrene tends to polymerize. To minimize this problem, early styrene plants added elemental sulfur to inhibit the polymerization. During the 1970s, new free radical inhibitors consisting of nitrated phenol-based retarders were developed. More recently, a number of additives have been developed that exhibit superior inhibition against polymerization. However, the nitrated phenols are still widely used because of their relatively low cost. These reagents are added prior to the distillation.|$|E

40|$|LectureDelayed coking is a {{refining}} process {{that consists of}} the upgrading of petroleum residues into lighter and more valuable hydrocarbon fractions by promoting thermal cracking on the residue stream. Petroleum coke is a by-product of this process and depending on its morphology {{it can be used}} as fuel for steam generation, cement calcination or as feed stock for the manufacturing of aluminum and steel. Delayed cokers are very complex systems and require a considerable amount of hardware such as fired heaters, coke drums, a main fractionator and a hydraulic <b>decoking</b> system. In a typical delayed coker petroleum residues are passed through fired heaters before they are charged, in an alternating fashion, into large drums as boiling product. In the drums some of this effluent thermally cracks into lighter fractions (vapors) and these are removed from the drum overhead and returned to the coker fractionator before they are sent to a gas plant for further refining. The heavier product that stays behind slowly forms into coke and it is allowed to fill the drum over time. This time is takes to do this is usually referred to as the coking cycle. Once the drum is full and the feed is switched to start filling an empty drum, a series of activities such as sludging, quenching and steam-outs are performed on the full drum prior to removing the ocke. Very high pressure water is used to cut this solid coke out and after some preparations this drum is empty and ready for a new coking cycle to begin again. As stated above, delayed coking is thus a combination of a continuous process through the fractionation tower and furnace and a batch process in the drums. As a result of this configuration the high pressure <b>decoking</b> pump only needs to operate a portion of the total cycle time. Regardless of its ?part-time? operation the water jet coke cutting pump is still a very important component of the hydraulic <b>decoking</b> system because it not only provides the required cutting pressure necessary to cut the coke but also contributes to the quality of coke removed and the duration fo the <b>decoking</b> cycle. Recent history shows that the majority of new hydraulic <b>decoking</b> installations use electric motor drived with fixed speed operation. The pump generally requires on operating speed to produce the necessary pressure to cut the coke and its flow, pressurization, and depressurization duties are controlled by a <b>decoking</b> control valve. During noncutting cycles operators typically shut off the motor to minimize power consumption of the system or they keep the motor running (rarely done), depressurize the line and operate this valve on bypass to recirculate the water through a holding tank until the coke cutting is resumed. Both operating alternatives have their disadvantages with regard reliability (the first) and energy consumption (the second). This paper explores the use of a hydrodynamic variable speed drive (HVSD) with an electric motor-driven pump as a way to increase the flexibility and reliability of the hydraulic <b>decoking</b> system. The HVSD or variable speed coupling (VSC) is able to seamlessly vary the speed of the pump and accomplish the following: Keep the motor running and operate the pump at minimum idle speed during noncutting cycles, avoiding periodic motor shutdowns and start ups; Eliminate the need for soft starter or special motor design considerations to handle periodic start ups; Reduce work and extend life of the <b>decoking</b> control valve by helping with depressurization duties during noncutting cycles and cutting tool mode shifting; Efficiently adjust cutting pressures depending on feed stock quality to avoid coke pulverization. This paper also describes the function of the variable speed coupling and how its unique design features are suited for the start up and intermittent operation of the water jet coke cutting pump. Field data and operator experience from two existing installations are collected and evaluated and the advantages of variable speed operation over fixed speed operation of the <b>decoking</b> pump are highlighted...|$|E

The literature on hydrotreating catalyst deactivation by coke and metals deposition, the environmental problems associated with spent catalyst disposal, and its reactivation/rejuvenation process were reviewed. Experimental studies on catalyst deactivation involved problem analysis in industrial hydroprocessing operations, through characterization of the spent catalyst, and laboratory coking studies. A comparison was made between the characteristics of spent catalysts from fixed bed and ebullating bed residue hydroprocessing reactor units and the catalyst deactivation pattern in both types of reactor systems was examined. In the laboratory the nature of initial coke deposited on the catalyst surface and its role on catalyst deactivation were studied. The influence of initial coke on catalyst surface area and porosity was significant. Both catalyst acidity and feedstock quality had a remarkable influence on the amount {{and the nature of}} the initial coke. The hydroenitrogenation function (HDN) of the catalyst was found to be deactivated more rapidly by the initial coke than the hydrodesulphurization function (HDS). In <b>decoking</b> experiments, special attention was paid to the initial conditions of coke combustion, since the early stages of contact between the coke on the spent catalyst surface and the oxygen are crucial in the <b>decoking</b> process. An increase in initial combustion temperature above 440 oC and the oxygen content of the regeneration gas above 5 % vanadium led to considerable sintering of the catalyst. At temperatures above 700 oC there was a substantial loss of molybdenum from the catalyst, and phase transformations in the alumina support. The preferred leaching route (coked vs decoked form of spent catalyst) and a comparison of different reagents (i. e., oxalic acid and tartaric acid) and promoters (i. e., Hydrogen Peroxide and Ferric Nitrate) for better selectivity in removing the major foulant (vanadium), characterization and performance evaluation of the treated catalysts and modelling of the leaching process were addressed in spent catalyst rejuvenation studies.

Cr 25 Ni 35 Nb and Cr 35 Ni 45 Nb {{austenitic}} steel, used as {{furnace tube}} {{material in the}} ethylene pyrolysis furnace, generally suffer from coking during the long operation period.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the coking tendency of nine different materials {{was carried out in}} a quartz electrobalance setup with a jet stirred reactor (JSR) under industrially relevant ethane steam cracking conditions: T-material = 1159 K, P-tot = 0. 1 MPa, chi(ethane) = 73 %, dilution delta = 0. 33 kg(H 2 O) /kg(HC). A strong influence of the composition of the materials on the coking rate as a function of time on-stream was observed. The initial coking rate varied from 5 X 10 (- 4) g. m(- 2). s(- 1) to 27 X 10 (- 4) g. m(- 2). s(- 1), while the asymptotic coking rate changed in the range of 2 X 10 (- 4) g. m(- 2). s(- 1) to 6 X 10 (- 4) g. m(- 2). s(- 1). SEM and EDX analyses of coked and uncoked coupons revealed that the composition of the oxide layer in contact with the cracked gas, formed after the initial preoxidation or <b>decoking,</b> has an important influence on the amount of coke deposited.

Crude oil was the charge in the radiant and convection sections; while saturated stripping steam is present in convection section. After a leak was detected, visual inspection revealed that nine convection tubes had black oil/coke deposits on their external surfaces. The deposits were seen on the first three rows of tubes. When one of the tubes was lightly ground at the black colored area, a circumferential crack was visually observed. The investigation revealed that long-term aging, coupled with localized deposition of salts and coke from the heavy crude led to sensitization of the tube surface layers. This in turn resulted in sulphidation of the internal surface grain boundaries, formation of grooves, and cracking of the material. Thus, cracking was intergranular in nature in the initial stage, but became transgranular at later stages.

Initiation of the formation of filamentous carbon formation on mono-metallic surfaces may take place if the ratio of the partial pressures, pCO/pH 2, is larger than 2 (T 673 K). Once the process starts, the chemical potential of the gas phase may be reduced to lower values without interruption of filament growth.

Unlike pyrolysis, the ring rupture of decalin or tetralin molecule and the <b>decoking</b> ability of system were significantly enhanced due {{to the introduction of}} O- 2 in GOC. For GOC of decalin, both the lower alkenes and the light fuels were obtained. At lower temperatures the light fuels mainly contained alkyl benzene, alkyl cyclohexane and isoparaffins, while it was rich in BTX (benzene, toluene and xylenes) at higher temperatures. A 38. 9 % yield of lower alkenes and 48. 0 % yield of light fuels (BTX mass content: 59. 9 %) at 100 % decalin conversion were obtained under the conditions of 800 degrees C and decalin/O- 2 = 0. 5. For GOC of tetralin, both the dehydrogenation and the cracking reactions dominated the reaction routes, resulting in a high mass content of alkyl naphthalene and alkyl benzene in the light fuels. The estimation of O- 2 distribution in the products demonstrated that O- 2 participated primarily in the oxydehydrogenation reactions at low temperatures, while mainly in the partial oxidation reactions at high temperatures to produce COx (x= 1, 2).

40|$|The {{demand for}} more {{accurate}} measurements is increasing in today’s industry. One {{reason for this is}} to optimize production and thus maximize profits. Another reason is that in some cases government regulations dictate that supervision of certain parameters must be followed. At Preemraff Lysekil there are basically four reasons for measuring skin temperatures inside fired process heaters, namely; because of government regulations, in order to estimate the load of the fired process heater, to estimate the lifetime of the tubes inside the fired process heater and finally, to determine the need of <b>decoking.</b> However, only the first three of these reasons are applied to H 2301 / 2 / 3. The current skin thermocouple design has been in use for many years and now the question of how well it measures surface temperature has risen. Furthermore a new weld-free design is under consideration to replace the old skin thermocouple design. Another question is therefore how well the new design can measure the surface temperature under the same operating conditions as the old one. In order to evaluate this, three–dimensional computer simulations were made of the different designs. As this thesis will show, the differences in calculated skin thermocouple temperature and calculated surface temperature is about the same for the two designs. However, the current design will show a lower temperature than the surface temperature, while the new design will show a higher temperature.

The oxidation kinetics followed a parabolic law in an air-H 2 O atmosphere and a logarithm law in a H 2 -H 20 atmosphere in the steady-state stage. The oxide film grown in the air-H 2 O atmosphere had cracks where the elements Fe and Ni were enriched and the un-cracked area was covered with octahedral-shaped MnCr 2 O 4 spinels and Cr 1, 3 Fe 0.7 O 3 oxide clusters, while the oxide film grown in the H 2 -H 2 O atmosphere was intact and completely covered with dense standing blade MnCr 2 O 4 spinels. In the pyrolysis tests, the anti-coking performance and resistance to carburization of the oxide film grown in the H 2 -H 2 O atmosphere were far better than that in the air-H 20 atmosphere.

40|$|The Combustion Reduction Integrated Pyrolysis System (CRIPS) is a dual {{fluidised}} bed fast pyrolyser {{that was developed}} at the University of Pretoria for the conversion of biomass waste to biofuels. The dual {{fluidised bed}} design allows in situ catalytic upgrading of bio-oil, by providing the conditions required for the regeneration and <b>decoking</b> of catalysts. The first version of the CRIPS process (CRIPS 1) emphasised {{the need for an}} energy balance approach to model the pyrolysis process rather than a mass balance. CRIPS 1 experienced severe energy losses and as a result very poor performance was observed. The energy balance was set up in the enthalpy reference level since no shaft work was produced and the entire process was operated under constant atmospheric conditions. The enthalpy balance approach was set up to analyse the process performance and energy efficiencies of a CRIPS process and possibly the bio-oil energy content and yield that could be expected from such a process. The approach was used to derive the bio-oil properties and energy efficiencies for a number of scenarios based on the CRIPS process. The Higher Heating Value (HHV) of the bio-oil was derived using the total energy balance of the CRIPS process. The validity of the approach was confirmed by comparing the derived bio-oil HHV from CRIPS 1 of 14, 2 MJ/kg with that of similar processes, in the range of 17 - 23 MJ/kg, as well as comparison to the operating data and process yields. The enthalpy balance approach was able to accurately model the operation of CRIPS 1 using energy and mass balances and therefore the approach was used in the design of CRIPS 2 to limit heat losses and improve the process efficiency by recovering heat from the exhaust of the combustor. The heat recovery resulted in significant improvements in the efficiency of CRIPS 2 (74 %) compared to CRIPS 1 (33 %). The final design of the CRIPS 2 process featured an annular design in which the combustion bed is located in a refractory cylinder, with the pyrolysis bed around the refractory. The design allowed for the addition of a heat exchanger inside the combustor which is responsible for the increase in efficiency.

During service, hard deposits of carbon (coke) build up on the inner wall of the tube, reducing heat transfer and restricting the flow of the hydrocarbon feedstocks. About every 20 to 60 days, the reactor must be taken off-line and decoked by burning out the accumulated carbon. This <b>decoking</b> costs on the order of $ 9 million per year per ethylene plant, accelerates tube degradation, and requires that tubes be replaced about every 5 years. The technology developed under this program seeks to reduce the energy and economic cost of coking by creating novel bimetallic tubes offering a combination of improved coking resistance, creep resistance and fabricability not available in current single-alloy tubes. The inner core of this tube consists of Incoloy(R) MA 956, a commercial ferritic Fe-Cr-Al alloy offering a 50 % reduction in coke buildup combined with improved carburization resistance. The outer sheath consists of a new material - oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) Alloy 803 (R) developed under the program. This new alloy retains the good fireside environmental resistance of Alloy 803, a commercial wrought alloy currently used for ethylene production, and provides an austenitic casing to alleviate the inherently-limited fabricability of the ferritic Incoloy(R) MA 956 core. To provide mechanical compatibility between the two alloys and maximize creep resistance of the bimetallic tube, both the inner Incoloy(R) MA 956 and the outer ODS Alloy 803 are oxide dispersion strengthened materials produced using mechanical alloying technology. To minimize cost, the bimetallic tube is produced by direct powder co-extrusion. This technology has potential for domestic energy savings of up to 4. 1 trillion BTU/year (4. 3 x 1015 J/year) and a reduction of 370, 000 tons (340, 000 tonnes) of CO 2 emissions in short-residence-time ethylene furnaces. This represents an energy savings and CO 2 emissions reduction of about 3. 3 %. If the technology is also applied to other types of ethylene pyrolysis furnaces, total energy savings and CO 2 emissions reductions could increase by up to five times. The work involved: Developing powder and consolidation processing protocols to produce an oxide-dispersion strengthened variant of Alloy 803 exhibiting creep strength comparable to Incoloy? Alloy MA 956, Developing a direct powder co-extrusion protocol for fabricating co-extruded bimetallic Incoloy? Alloy MA 956 / ODS Alloy 803 tubes, Characterizing the properties of the ODS Alloy 803 material, the welding characteristics of the bimetallic tubes, and the coking characteristics of the Incoloy? MA 956 alloy, and Documenting the potential energy savings and user requirements for these bimetallic pyrolysis furnace tubes. The project demonstrated that oxide dispersion strengthened Alloy 803 can be produced successfully using conventional mechanical alloying technology. The oxide dispersion strengthened bimetallic radiant coil technology explored under this program has significant potential for energy savings and productivity improvements for domestic ethylene producers. In today's competitive market, however, domestic furnace manufacturers and ethylene producers appear reluctant to pay any cost premium for higher-performance coil materials offering either higher temperature capabilities or longer service life. Interest in oxide dispersion strengthened radiant coils is likely to increase if furnace and ethylene producers begin to focus more on increasing tube wall temperatures to improve productivity...|$|E
