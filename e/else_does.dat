500|$|Beshear {{delivered}} the Democratic {{response to a}} speech to {{a joint session of}} the United States Congress given by President Donald Trump on February 28, 2017. Beshear was chosen due to his successful implementation of the Affordable Care Act in Kentucky and to bring back the white, rural voters that Democrats felt they had lost in the 2016 presidential election. Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat, praised the choice, saying [...] " [...] led the country in the health care exchanges in the Affordable Care Act, knows firsthand about the success of the Affordable Care Act" [...] Other Democrats, however, felt it was a mistake, with Pennsylvania's Bob Brady saying, [...] "I don't know who the former governor of Kentucky is, and I don't think anybody <b>else</b> <b>does,</b> either. Do you?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Here, There and Everywhere" [...] is a ballad that McCartney wrote {{towards the}} end of the Revolver sessions. His {{inspiration}} for the song was the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds track [...] "God Only Knows", which, in turn, Brian Wilson had been inspired to write after listening to Rubber Soul. McCartney's double-tracked vocal was treated with varispeeding, resulting in a higher pitch at playback. The song's opening lines are sung over shifts in time signature from 9/8 to 7/8 to 4/4; according to Everett, [...] "nowhere <b>else</b> <b>does</b> a Beatles introduction so well prepare a listener for the most striking and expressive tonal events that lie ahead." [...] Womack characterises the song as a romantic ballad [...] "about living in the here and now" [...] and [...] "fully experiencing the conscious moment". He notes that, with the preceding track, [...] "Love You To", the album expresses [...] "corresponding examinations of the human experience of physical and romantic love".|$|E
500|$|Although Paul Oscar's family {{encouraged}} {{his musical}} talent, his {{parents did not}} get along with each other, and he was bullied by his schoolmates. Paul Oscar recalled: [...] "My nickname was Little Palli, and Palli was chubby, nerdy, someone who never got jokes right, who was afraid of other men." [...] At age 13, {{he realized that he}} found men attractive, and came out to his [...] family at 16. [...] "For the first day, there was nice talk of acceptance, though my father did raise his voice. On the second day, and the third, and the fourth, there was this terrible silence. They treated me like an alien." [...] However, his mother was supportive. She said: [...] "If Páll has the talent to fall in love, he should nurture that talent. And he has as much a right to sit down at my table with his partner as anybody <b>else</b> <b>does</b> with their partner." ...|$|E

500|$|While his {{performance}} of [...] "Ave Maria" [...] was {{a tradition of}} his holiday television programs, Como refused to sing it at live performances, saying, [...] "It's not the time or place to do it," [...] {{even though it was}} the number-one request of his audiences. Another was his naturalness; the man that viewers saw on television every week was the same person who could be encountered behind a supermarket shopping cart, at a bowling alley, or in a kitchen making breakfast. From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on Como's everyday manner of speaking. Though Como was widely known for his amiability, laid-back and easygoing style, he was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times {{as a result of the}} frustrations of daily life. Mitchell Ayres, his musical director from 1948 to 1963 said, [...] "Perry has a temper like everyone else. And he loses his temper at the normal things everyone <b>else</b> <b>does.</b> When we're driving, for instance, and somebody cuts him off, he really lets the offender have it." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{the text}} is ambiguous, making it {{questionable}} that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero, [...] "the novel undercuts itself. It {{says there is no}} answer to the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite.... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; but no one <b>else</b> <b>does</b> either." [...] Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's [...] "spiritual change" [...] {{by the end of the}} story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry [...] "progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous [...] "romantic notions," [...] "the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception." [...] Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that [...] "in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically." ...|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody <b>else</b> <b>does</b> it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E
