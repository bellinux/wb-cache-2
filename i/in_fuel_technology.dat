30|$|<b>Fuel</b> cell <b>technology</b> {{has gained}} {{widespread}} attention around the world. Fuel cells (FCs) are a promising alternative power generation technology that converts chemical energy to electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction [1, 2]. Moreover, for <b>fuel</b> cell <b>technology,</b> {{the main focus}} <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> cell <b>technology</b> is to generate low-cost production, thus achieving powerful performance of the fuel cell system and discovering durable materials. Nevertheless, the common issues that arise <b>in</b> current <b>fuel</b> cell <b>technology</b> are that the systems involve high intrinsic costs and poor durability [1]. Despite its promise as a fuel cell, direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have challenges and limitations, leading researchers to study methods to improve the DMFC efficiency and performance. Many problems with DMFCs have been identified and remain unsolved, including crossover of methanol fuel from the anode electrode to the cathode electrode [3 – 5] poor performance caused by the slow kinetics rate, instability of the catalyst, and thermal and water management [6 – 8].|$|R

5000|$|A major {{improvement}} <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>technology</b> {{came with}} the advent of gas. The first gas stoves were developed as early as the 1820s, but these remained isolated experiments. James Sharp patented a gas stove in Northampton, England, in 1826 and opened a gas stove factory in 1836. His invention was marketed by the firm Smith & Philips from 1828. An important figure in the early acceptance of this new technology, was Alexis Soyer, the renowned chef at the Reform Club in London. From 1841, he converted his kitchen to consume piped gas, arguing that gas was cheaper overall because the supply could be turned off when the stove was not in use.|$|E

His contributions {{have been reported in}} the development of beehive coke oven, process technologies for the isolation and recovery of useful chemicals from the byproducts of coal, process technologies for the production of resins and other compounds, and active carbon and ion exchangers for determination of water-based coal. He published his research and professional experiences by way of over 500 articles, Reaction of coals under plasma conditions: direct production of acetylene from coal, National Coal Development Corporation A New Approach, and Trekking on the Southern Bhutan Frontier counting among them. During his tenure with CFRI, he proposed the setting up of Central Mining Research Station for overcoming the coal mining issues faced in India and served as the director of the National Coal Development Corporation. In 1954, he proposed energy studies, a pioneering effort in India, and served the Indian Energy Survey Committee of 1965 and the National Fuel Policy Committee of 1974, as a member.|$|E
40|$|A {{strategic}} land-use–transport {{interaction model}} {{is used to}} investigate the impacts of policies in technology, infrastructure, pricing and regulation under different assumptions about energy supply. Six scenarios have been defined, analysing three policy strategies in two different contexts of energy supply—A, generally accepted energy supply forecast and B, worst-case energy supply forecast (scarcity of energy). Policies include: business as usual; investment in infrastructure and technology; and a demand regulation based approach involving changes in taxation and tolls. The paper assesses the impact and robustness of each policy against assumptions about future oil supply/demand. Our results demonstrate three key issues. First, scarcity of oil will accelerate the development and take-up of alternative fuel technologies; second, investment in alternative technologies alone will alleviate the impact of local emissions and reduce energy consumption per kilometre travelled but will only reduce yearly carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions after a time lag of about 15 years; so that, third, some form of regulation of demand {{will be necessary to}} reduce total emissions and externalities caused by congestion. Research is required to define the necessary level of regulation in combination with technology investments. However, we suggest that a policy involving improvements in infrastructure coupled with investments <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>technology</b> and differentiated fuel taxes will be required in the future...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{models of}} the {{innovation}} process frequently distinguish between incremental and radical innovation, suggesting that product, service or process innovation can be categorised {{only in terms of}} these two polarised, relatively artificial classifications. In reality, the complexity of the designed world suggests that the majority of innovations embody elements of both and additionally engage with forms of non-innovation where existing designs are still strategically relevant. This more realistic, flexible view of innovation can be further explored by considering the varied nature of innovation impact, radical or otherwise, for although radical innovation can take many forms, in design terms radicalism can be characterised either by direct, external societal impact or by more covert shifts in the way that underlying internal systems operate. So for example, a radical ‘overt’ change in transport design might have profound implications {{for a wide range of}} users/non-users, providers, designers and decision makers in industry and government. A radical ‘covert’ transport innovation, such as a major shift <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>technology</b> may, or may not, result in a significant direct impact amongst similar interest groups. It can be argued that the more fundamental the change in the technology which underpins a well established infrastructure, the more important it is to minimise disruption. In reality, the gap between ‘overt’ and ‘covert’ innovation is rarely easily defined. Radical shifts in internal system design can have significant external impact, be it cost or performance. Conversely, a paradigm shift in a physical form of transport often demands fundamental change in the design of underlying support systems. The paradigm is a useful tool for investigating the role of design in relation to a mixed model of both radical and incremental innovation. The model is primarily focussed on the definition and application of design-led continuous innovation (DCI) as a means of providing long term support for core R&D linked to staged design outputs. The subtle synergies between overt/covert innovation and incremental/radical innovation in relation to a specific case study – the Microcab, hydrogen fuelled road vehicle being manufactured by Coventry University Enterprises as a collaborative project is explored in relation to the DCI model. This evolutionary project has been running for fifteen years as a long term commitment to ‘life without oil’; Microcab, has involved a complex framework of engineering, design, entrepreneurial and research activities. In particular it has been supported by a combination of public and private sector funding through a business model which uniquely integrates University and SME activities, a model particularly suitable for radical innovations which lie outside mainstream industrial activities. The case study traces the evolution of this complex framework, indentifies its strengths in relation to the interplay between covert and overt design and examines the particular challenges in achieving an appropriate balance between the two. Microcab is used as a model to compare and contrast with the corresponding innovation processes in mainstream commercial industry and concludes that radical and complex innovation is more effectively conducted in SME. In contrast, it is suggested that continuous incremental innovation, refinement of existing products and processes, is more effectively conducted in the mainstream, because the more substantial systems, resources and knowledge available. It is argued that ultimately for a radical innovation to be widely adopted, a form of integrated collaboration between the mainstream and the innovation developer is necessary for mass market rather than niche adoption. Microcab is undergoing its fifth iteration in the process of general adoption. The next stage of the Microcab, project as it moves from niche prototype vehicle to become a fully resolved as part of a major pan-European collaborative project to drive an experimental ‘Hydrogen Super-highway’ through Europe. The implications of this in terms of the CDI agenda are discussed and new research opportunities identified. Finally the long term relationship between incremental and radical innovation is re-examined and a new paradigm established transferable application to other innovative sustainable design/engineering/technology sectors...|$|E
