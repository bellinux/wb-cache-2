2500|$|In 1979, Lee {{accepted}} {{the role of}} Karen Fairgate on Knots Landing, a spin-off of the immensely popular Dallas. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit {{and became one of}} the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993. Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality Joan Rivers commented that Lee was, in theory, the [...] "First Lady of Knots Landing" [...] during her guest appearance on The Late Show, which Rivers hosted at the time. The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: [...] "Karen wanted to be a Pollyanna and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house."

2500|$|Marcus Miller {{produced}} the original {{score for the}} film, while Antonio [...] "L. A." [...] Reid and Kenneth [...] "Babyface" [...] Edmonds worked on the soundtrack. With such a wealth of new material, director Hudlin said, [...] "sometimes we used score, sometimes we'd use a song by L.A. and Face, or sometimes Marcus would {{take some of the}} songs they had written and do score interpolations of it. For example, one of the songs, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", is a great example. That came from a line of dialogue where Halle is furious with Eddie, says 'love should've brought your ass home last night,' slaps him. At that time, L.A. leans over to me and goes 'that's a great song title.' I said, 'great idea.' They write a song, [...] "Love Shoulda Brought You Home". I said, 'well, who we going to get to sing it?' And they said 'well you know, we've got this great young singer who sang the demo, Reggie. If you like the demo then we can use her.' And I said 'great, let's use her.' So that was Toni Braxton's debut. And <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> finally met Toni at Babyface's wedding, L.A. said, 'you owe your career to this guy, he gave you your big break,' which was really sweet." ...|$|E
