5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher {{was considered to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was {{more in touch with}} party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In political terms he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history.|$|E
5|$|Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of {{the signal}} {{transduction}} that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. Jasmonic acid is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to wild type plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of jasmonic acid and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying methyl jasmonate to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression. The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying fusicoccin, which activates the H+ ATPase inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.|$|E

25|$|Although {{much effort}} {{has gone into}} {{restoring}} salt marshes worldwide, further research is needed. There are many setbacks and problems associated with marsh restoration that requires careful long-term monitoring. Information on all components of the salt marsh ecosystem should be understood and monitored from sedimentation, nutrient, and tidal influences, to behaviour patterns and tolerances of both flora and fauna species. Once we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of these processes and not just locally, but over a global scale, we can then suggest more sound and practical management and restoration efforts {{that can be used}} to preserve our valuable marshes and put them back to their original state.|$|E

25|$|These new {{developments}} mark {{a milestone in}} expanding {{the role of the}} government in improving healthcare provisions for the gay and lesbian veterans. The VHA is instituting policies that focus on individualized care. They require healthcare providers to care for gay and lesbian patients in the same respectful and sensitive manner as other patients. Another policy is to redefine the meaning of “family” and allow the gay and lesbian veterans to decide who is regarded as part of their family. As of 2014, there are many discrepancies regarding this information. The information found on medical records is often inaccurate and may not clearly indicate the choice of the veterans. The VHA has also launched educational and training programs so that healthcare providers will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of the psychological and social distresses of the gay and lesbian veterans.|$|E
25|$|On many occasions, Doom’s {{only real}} {{weakness}} {{has been his}} arrogance. Layla Miller once reflected that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be {{the reason for his}} failures. This is most keenly reflected in Doom’s continued refusal to accept responsibility for the accident that fully scarred his face, instead preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is generally unable to accept when others may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of a situation than he does – with the occasional exception of hearing the recommendations of heroes such as Mister Fantastic or the Thing when it is to his advantage. Even when teaming up with others against a greater threat, Doom will often try to subvert the alliance for personal gain. For instance, while allied with Adam Warlock and other heroes against the Titan Thanos, he attempted to steal Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet before its owner had been defeated.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book in The New York Times, Richard F. Shepard called it a [...] "compelling story". He said that Spurr tells this [...] "naval saga", which had {{degenerated}} into a [...] "racial conflict", {{from the point of view}} of the people involved, [...] "people who had little time for moralizing or preachments, anything but getting on with the killing". American author and journalist Charles Kaiser, also writing in The New York Times, said that the book's strength is [...] "its ability to re-create the fear the Japanese engendered with their desperation tactics" [...] and the resulting American perception that they were all prepared to fight to the death. Kaiser added that younger readers may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> from this book of what led to US President Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan, [...] "even if they ... question the morality of that decision".|$|E

500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care {{to be far more}} important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to [...] "show love and affection" [...] to kids. [...] "Safety and protection" [...] came next, followed by [...] "moral guidance," [...] "taking time to play," [...] and [...] "teaching and encouraging." [...] "Financial care" [...] finished last. [...] Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of what life is like for their child growing up in modern society. [...] Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically [...] "manly" [...] attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.|$|E
500|$|In the {{regional}} finals, Kentucky trailed top-seeded Duke by 12 {{in the second}} half, but battled back to force overtime. With 2.1 seconds left in overtime, Sean Woods hit a running bank shot to put Kentucky up one. Then, Duke's Christian Laettner caught a long inbounds pass, faked right, and hit {{a shot at the}} buzzer to give Duke the 104103 victory. The game, which ended Farmer's playing career, is widely {{regarded as one of the}} greatest college basketball games of all time. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski later recalled, [...] "The thing I'll always remember about that game is Richie Farmer's face as the ball went in. That, to me, helped me to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of that game. ... To me, that was the deepest emotion that was on the court, the emotion that was on Richie Farmer's face." [...] Describing the impact of the game, Jerry Tipton wrote, [...] "On one fateful night, the Cats obliterated any lingering association with $1,000 packages and academic fraud. Alluring images of courage, honest effort and heartracing excitement became symbols of UK basketball." [...] Local media gave the seniors the nickname [...] "The Unforgettables". Collectively, they were voted as the Lexington Herald-Leaders 1992 Sportsmen of the Year.|$|E
500|$|Alex Chan, 27 {{years old}} at the time of the civil unrest, was a French-born {{freelance}} industrial designer whose parents were Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong. Although Chan was successful professionally, he felt that there was racial and cultural discrimination in France, based on his own previous attempts to find housing and violence directed towards him. He lived in Seine-Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris, near housing projects where rioting had caused the destruction of cars owned by acquaintances. In the aftermath of the unrest, Chan was dissatisfied, stating that [...] "the media, especially in the United States, ... linked what was happening, the riots, to terrorism and put the blame on the Muslim community". Chan wanted instead to depict [...] "more human" [...] rioters who turned to violence in response to racism. According to Chan, the title The French Democracy is meant to be ironic, in that the youths express themselves by rioting rather than through the political system. He elaborated: a shortcut made with The Movies technology about the recent events concerning riots in French suburbs. This movie is trying to help people <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of the origin of these events, as some reasons that pushed all this youth to have such violent acts. As a matter of fact TFD offers a sincere inside view from a French citizen who lives in one of these neighborhoods where the riots took place. This fictional documentary is strongly inspired by real events and reactions and tries to make the spectator think more about how French society could and should potentially be.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "theory of the mind" [...] {{approach}} {{states that}} people with anger management problems tend to be unsteady mentally and {{are not able to}} internalize any blame for their actions.

2500|$|The {{ability to}} cope and be {{flexible}} was positively associated with improved psychological health. [...] Flexibility reduced depression, anxiety, and stress. [...] An in-depth experiment analyzed the relationship between difficulty identifying and describing feelings (DIDF) and psychological flexibility for men undergoing cancer screenings. [...] Results showed that DIDF and psychological flexibility were reliable predictors of mental health. [...] However, psychological flexibility only predicted mental health when DIDF was involved. [...] Psychological flexibility allowed participants to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of the subtleties of pleasant and unpleasant emotions.

2500|$|RDF {{is being}} used to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>understanding</b> of road traffic patterns.

But {{one of the issues that}} comes up when trying to efficiently study traffic is that to fully understand traffic, [...] concepts related to people, streets, and roads must be well understood. Since these are human [...] concepts, they require the addition of fuzzy logic. This is because values that are useful [...] when describing roads, like slipperiness, are not precise concepts and cannot be measured.
