40|$|The adrenal {{secretion}} of androgens {{was examined}} in 9 women (ages 19 – 39 yr) with postadolescent <b>idiopathic</b> <b>acne</b> and compared to age and sex-matched normal controls. Plasma dehydroepiandrosterone (DHA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHAS), androstenedione (Δ 4 -A), cortisol, 17 -hydroxyprogesterone, 11 -deoxycortisol, and testosterone were measured by radioimmunoassay in the basal state and during a 48 hr ACTH infusion. The mean plasma and time-integrated plasma {{levels of the}} 3 adrenal androgens in patients with acne were 15 – 25 % higher than normal controls, but the groups {{were not significantly different}} (p >. 05). The plasma testosterone values, on the other hand, were similar in both groups. In addition, cortisol, 11 -deoxycortisol and 17 -hydroxyprogesterone basal plasma values and responses to ACTH in patients with acne were similar to the normal control values. These findings suggest that adrenal androgen secretion is at most mildly elevated in patients with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>acne</b> and is unlikely to be the sole cause of acne since many patients without acne have similar hormone levels. Increased sensitivity of the sebaceous gland to androgens or increased local metabolism of androgen hormones in the skin to potent androgen metabolites may offer alternative mechanisms for the pathogenesis of this disorder...|$|E
40|$|The skin, {{especially}} the pilosebaceous unit composed of sebaceous glands and hair follicles, can synthesize androgens de novo from cholesterol or by locally converting circulating weaker androgens to more potent ones. As in other classical steroidogenic organs, the same six major enzyme systems {{are involved in}} cutaneous androgen metabolism, namely steroid sulfatase, 3 β-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase, 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, steroid 5 α-reductase, 3 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and aromatase. Steroid sulfatase, together with P 450 side chain cleavage enzyme and P 450 17 -hydroxylase, was found to reside in the cytoplasm of sebocytes and keratinocytes. Strong steroid sulfatase immunoreacti-vity was observed in the lesional skin but not in unaffected skin of acne patients. 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase has been mainly immunolocalized to sebaceous glands, with the type 1 being the key cutaneous isoenzyme. The type 2 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isoenzyme predominates in sebaceous glands and exhibits greater reductive activity in glands from facial areas compared with acne nonprone areas. In hair follicles, 17 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase was identified mainly in outer root sheath cells. The type 1 5 α-reductase mainly occurs in the sebaceous glands, whereby the type II isoenzyme seems to be localized in the hair follicles. 3 α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase converts dihydrotestosterone to 3 α-androstanediol, {{and the use of}} 3 α-androstanediol glucuronide serum level to reflect the hyperandrogenic state in hirsute women may be a reliable parameter, especially for <b>idiopathic</b> hirsutism. In <b>acne</b> patients it is still controversial if 3 α-androstanediol glucuronide or androsterone glucuronide could serve as suitable serum markers for measuring androgenicity. Aromatase, localized to sebaceous glands and to both outer as well as inner root sheath cells of anagen terminal hair follicles, may play a “detoxifying” role by removing excess androgens. Pharmacologic development of more potent specific isoenzyme antagonists may lead to better clinical treatment or even prevention of androgen-dependent dermatoses...|$|R
