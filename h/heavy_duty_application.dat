40|$|Many of {{the newly}} issued {{corporate}} bonds are finding their way into insurance and pension fund asset portfolios. Modelling these bonds is tricky. Historic return distributions are well behaved and the observed credit spreads exceed all estimates of historic default probabilities. As a result, corporate bonds may appear anomalously attractive. We show {{that some of the}} more widely used models of corporate bonds have some major weaknesses from a theoretical perspective and in particular fail to explain this apparent anomaly convincingly. However, our analysis of the economics of corporate debt early in the paper suggests that credit spreads are option premiums and thus have option-like characteristics. This leads to the Merton Model as a means of capturing these characteristics. The model reveals that the apparent anomaly in credit spreads is another facet of well known apparent anomalies in option prices under the standard Black Scholes Model (such as the existence of skews and smiles in implied volatility). The latter anomalies are not generally regarded as exploitable in asset allocation studies. Armed with the insights from this model, suitable for <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>application</b> in pricing contingent claims based on default, we return to the simpler problem of modelling corporate bond portfolios. We suggest that complexity in these models inevitable, given that a rebalancing investment process must be modelled {{and that there is a}} fundamental arbitrariness in the relevant grade categories on which the process is based. Having considered these issues we suggest that, despite its sledge-hammer appearance the Merton Model provides a solid foundation for alternative approaches to modelling such portfolios that ensures consistency and reduces the risk of anomalies. In particular we reconcile well-known approximations in terms of special cases of this model. ...|$|E

40|$|Modern diesel {{compression}} {{engines are}} known for their increased durability, fuel economy and torque when compared with their spark ignition gasoline counterparts. These are some of the reasons why diesel engines are preferred in <b>heavy</b> <b>duty</b> <b>applications</b> such as trains and semi-trucks. During the <b>Heavy</b> <b>Duty</b> Federal Test Procedure transient drive cycle, or HDFTP, nearly 85 % of the total fuel burned is at speeds greater than 2000 revolutions per minute (RPM) for the studied engine. Therefore, it is desirable to increase the fuel economy at these loads and speeds. It is hypothesized that the use of late intake valve close timing (LIVC) modulation could give an increase in volumetric efficiency from flow momentum. With an increase in volumetric efficiency, the open cycle efficiency (OCE) would increase. This would allow for improvements in the brake thermal efficiency (BTE). With the use of the engine simulator software GT-Power, the effects of IVC variation was explored to serve as a preliminary investigation for a variable valve actuation (VVA) engine in the future. The results from this investigation yielded an increase in volumetric efficiency through late intake valve closure (LIVC). While these findings have not been verified through experimental procedures, there could be a decrease in BSFC because the engine could breathe more efficiently, thereby reducing pumping losses...|$|R

50|$|The {{strength}} and stiffness of pavement layers determines {{the performance of}} highway pavements while aggregate use impacts the cost of duration of installation; therefore alternatives are needed to improve pavement quality using new materials with less aggregate usage (Rajagopal et al 2012).
