25|$|The Delaware Biotechnology Institute, or DBI, was {{organized}} {{as an academic}} unit of the University of Delaware in 1999 and moved into dedicated research facilities in 2001. DBI supports a statewide partnership of higher education, industry, medical, and government communities committed to the discovery and application of interdiscplinary knowledge in biotechnology and the life sciences. With some 180 people resident in the DBI facilities, including 20–25 faculty members representing 12 departments, 140 graduate and post-graduate students, and 20 professional staff members, DBI emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach to life-science research. The core research areas pursued by DBI-affiliated faculty include agriculture, human health, marine environmental genomics, biomaterials, and computational biology/bioinformatics. Research in these and other areas is done in collaboration with faculty at Delaware State University, Delaware Technical and Community College, Wesley College, Christiana Care Health System, and Nemours Hospital for Children. One of the primary objectives of the Institute is to provide state-of-the-art research equipment to facilitate life science research and six core instrumentation centers and specialized facilities, each {{under the direction of}} an <b>experienced</b> <b>researcher</b> or administrator, is supported at DBI and made available to university researchers.|$|E

(±) The level of effectiveness of a drug that indicates a threshold action. If a higher dosage produces a greater response, then the plus/minus (±) was valid.

The chronology can be determined with some accuracy, but {{the nature of the}} drug's effects are not yet apparent.* PLUS TWO, n.

But you still have some choice as to whether you will accept the adventure, or rather just continue with your ordinary day's plans (if you are an <b>experienced</b> <b>researcher,</b> that is). The effects can be allowed a predominant role, or they may be repressible and made secondary to other chosen activities.* PLUS THREE, n.

If a drug (or technique or process) were ever to be discovered which would consistently produce a plus four experience in all human beings, it is conceivable that it would signal the ultimate evolution, and perhaps the end, of the human experiment.
