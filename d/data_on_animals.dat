Material and Methods: An electronic literature search was performed through MEDLINE (PubMed) electronic database. The search was restricted to English language articles published during the last 10 years, from January 2006 to November 2016. Results: In total, 37 literature sources were reviewed, and 11 of the most relevant articles that are suitable to the criteria were selected.

40|$|Patients with {{diabetes}} are {{at greater risk}} of fractures mostly due to not only to extraskeletal factors, such as propensity to fall, but also to bone quality alteration, which reduces bone strength. In people {{with diabetes}}, insulin deficiency and hyperglycaemia seem {{to play a role in}} determining bone formation alteration by advanced glycation end product (AGE) accumulation or AGE/RAGE (receptors for AGE) axis imbalance, which directly influence osteoblast activity. Moreover, hyperglycaemia and oxidative stress are able to negatively influence osteocalcin production and the Wnt signalling pathways with an imbalance of osteoblast/osteoclast activity leading to bone quality reduction as global effect. In addition, other factors such as insulin growth factors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ pathways seem to have an important role in the pathophysiology of osteoporosis in diabetes. Although there are conflicting data in literature, adequate glycaemic control with hypoglycaemic treatment may be an important element in preventing bone tissue alterations in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Attention should be paid to the use of thiazolidinediones, especially in older women, because the direct negative effect on bone could exceed the positive effect of glycaemic control. Finally, preliminary <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> and in humans suggest the hypothesis that incretins and dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors could have a positive effect on bone metabolism by a direct effect on bone cells; however, such issue needs further investigation...|$|E

40|$|The anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are all {{synthetic}} derivates {{of testosterone}} and {{are commonly used}} as sport performance enhancers in athletes. The heart {{is one of the}} organs most frequently affected by administration of anabolic steroids. A direct myocardial injury caused by AAS is supposed to determine marked hypertrophy in myocardial cells, extensive regional fibrosis and necrosis. A number of excellent studies, using animal models, were performed to evaluate the cardiac effects of AAS. It is known that exogenous administration induced cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo, and when combined with exercise, anabolic steroid use has been shown to change exercise-induced physiological cardiac hypertrophy to pathophysiological cardiac hypertrophy. However the molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. It's described that sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarct; ventricular remodelling and cardiomyopathy do to AAS is related to apoptosis and oxidative stress when associated with exercise. Mechanical stimuli and circulating humoral factors (TNF-α, HSP- 70, IL- 1 β) released by the heart and peripheral organs are responsible. Testosterone and derivates can work through genomic (activation of specific androgen receptor, interaction with coactivators and co-repressors transcription factors, gene regulation) and non-genomic mechanism (membrane-receptor-second messenger cascades). Chronic AAS abuse results in different patterns of pathologic alterations, which depend on type, dose, frequency, and mode of use. The difficulty in interpreting experimental <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>animals</b> (mice and rats) lies in the diversity of experiments (the diversity of substances, which show different properties, different mice / rats by sex and age, duration of treatment with AAS, dosages used, type, scope and exercise duration) ...|$|E

However, higher death rates due to malignancies are apparent in employees having 6 or more years exposure to EDB. NIOSH recommends that the exposure limit of EDB be substantially lowered from the current federal standards of 20 ppm for an 8 hour limit, 30 ppm ceiling to a ceiling of 0. 13 ppm for any 15 minute sampling period. At this level an employee would have a maximum of about 686 mg/kg for a 40 year working lifetime, which is substantially below the dose known to cause adverse effects in experimental animals. Medical surveillance should be provided for all employees working with EDB and records involving EDB exposure should be kept for 30 years after termination of employment.

Therefore, on the basis of these assessments, nicotine is assigned a composite skin notation of SK: SYSDIR (IRR) -SEN. Table 3 summarizes the skin hazard designations for nicotine previously issued by NIOSH and other organizations. The equivalent dermal designation for nicotine, according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for the Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, is Acute Toxicity Category 1 (Hazard statement: Fatal in contact with the skin) [European Parliament 2008].

40|$|Understanding animal affiliations has {{important}} implications for determining social interactions; an example is maternal interactions within beef production systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} test whether contact loggers could be used to identify cow–calf pairs. Fifty-two pairs of Belmont Red cows with calves that were between 1 - and 14 -days old, were fitted with contact logging devices for 1 week in groups ranging in size from five to nine pairs of cows and calves. The contact logging devices recorded the duration of contacts that were less than 7 m distance between individual animals in the group. There was a highly significant difference in both contact duration and contact frequency between cows and their own calves and cows and all other calves. It is concluded that contact logging devices have the potential to provide useful <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> affiliations...|$|R
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the ICARUS Initiative is to greatly expand {{available}} <b>data</b> <b>on</b> <b>animal</b> migrations for the sake of conservation, although a variety of other fields of study may be advanced by the project's information gathering. Studying the movements of birds and insects may further scientists' understanding of how natural hazards and human interactions affect animal populations. Another application for the data collected by ICARUS is to investigate a possible link between unusual animal movements and impending earthquakes. It has long been hypothesized that some birds and bats can predict earthquakes because of their ability to detect shifts in magnetic fields, but so far the only evidence to support this has been anecdotal. The project's migratory data may also provide greater insight into the propagation of animal-borne diseases like SARS, bird flu and West Nile virus.|$|R

These values are presented here together with the geographical,hydrological and ecological characteristics of the Buna area,emphasizing the regional importance of this area as a migration corridor and biodiversity reserve. <b>Data</b> <b>on</b> several <b>animal</b> groups (molluscs, amphibians,reptiles,fishes,birds and mammals) are given,focusing on the most significant species of regional importance (migratory,rare,endangered) and their most important habitats...|$|R
