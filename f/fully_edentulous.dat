40|$|Loss {{of teeth}} may not only imply {{impaired}} oral function {{and loss of}} alveolar bone but is also often accompanied by reduced self-confidence. This results in a larger problem with the <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patient. The patient introduced in this study showed multiple missing teeth and mobility of remaining teeth and wanted to have fixed dental prosthesis using implants.

40|$|Aim: To {{provide an}} update on the use of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in the field of implant {{dentistry}} (1); to compare PROMs for prostheses supported by one or more implants to alternative treatment options or a healthy dentition (2). Materials and methods: The dental literature was searched on PubMed until December 31, 2014, using a general search algorithm. An overall quantitative analysis was performed, and a qualitative appraisal was made on the output of the last 6 years. Per type of edentulism and prosthetic treatment, the general search algorithm was refined in order to select controlled studies comparing PROMs for prostheses supported by one or more implants to alternative treatment options or a healthy dentition. Results: With nearly half of the output (300 of 635) published in the last 6 years, there is a growing interest in PROMs by the scientific community. When scrutinizing the 300 most recent publications, only 84 controlled studies could be identified among which 38 RCTs and 31 cohort studies. An "ad hoc" approach is commonly employed using non-standardized questions and different scoring methods, which may compromise validity and reliability. Overall, 39 eligible papers related to <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients treated with an implant overdenture (IOD) and 9 to <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients treated with a fixed implant prosthesis (FIP). There is plenty of evidence from well-controlled studies showing that <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients in the mandible experience higher satisfaction with an IOD when compared to a conventional denture (CD). This may not hold true for <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients in the maxilla. In general, <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients seem to opt for a fixed or removable rehabilitation on implants for specific reasons. Data pertaining to partially edentulous patients were limited (FIP: n = 6; single implants: n = 16). In these patients, the timing of implant placement does not seem to affect patient satisfaction. Patients seem to prefer straightforward implant surgery over complex surgery that includes bone grafting. Conclusion: There is an urgent need for standardized reporting of PROMs in the field of implant dentistry. <b>Fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients in the mandible experience higher satisfaction with an IOD when compared to a CD.

30|$|Dental implant {{treatment}} {{based on}} the concept of osseointegration [1] is now a widely accepted restorative treatment for <b>fully</b> and partially <b>edentulous</b> patients. In the earliest days of the use of osseointegrated implants, two different topographies were applied on the implant surfaces: a machined minimally rough titanium surface such as the Brånemark system and a rough microporous titanium plasma-sprayed surface such as the ITI system [2]. In clinical studies, the long-term (i.e., up to 20  years) survival rate of Brånemark-system implants was in the range of 80 – 99 % [3 – 5] and that with ITI-system implants was 88 – 96 % [6, 7].|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} evaluates the 10 -year survival and incidence of peri-implant disease at implant and patient level of sandblasted, large grid, and acid-etched titanium dental implants (Straumann, soft tissue level, SLA surface) in <b>fully</b> and partially <b>edentulous</b> patients. Material and methods: Patients who had dental implant {{surgery in the}} period between November 1997 and June 2001, with a follow-up of at least 10 years, were investigated for clinical and radiological examination. Among the 506 inserted dental implants in 250 patients, 10 -year data regarding the outcome of implants were available for 374 dental implants in 177 patients. In the current study, peri-implantitis was defined as advanced bone loss (≧ 1. 5 mm. postloading) in combination with bleeding on probing. Results: At 10 -year follow-up, only one implant was lost (0. 3 %) 2 months after implant surgery due to insufficient osseointegration. The average bone loss at 10 year postloading was 0. 52 mm. Advanced bone loss at 10 -year follow-up was present in 35 dental implants (9. 8 %). Seven percent of the observed dental implants showed bleeding on probing in combination with advanced bone loss and 4. 2 % when setting the threshold for advanced bone loss at 2. 0 mm. Advanced bone loss without bleeding on probing was present in 2. 8 % of all implants. Conclusion: In this prospective study, the 10 -year survival rate at implant and patient level was 99. 7 % and 99. 4 %, respectively. Peri-implantitis was present in 7 % of the observed dental implants according to the above-mentioned definition of peri-implantitis.

40|$|Background: Osteoporosis is {{of concern}} in breast cancer {{patients}} who are undergoing chemotherapy. This study compared the bone mineral density (BMD) index of the mandible and hip hinge between patients who were undergoing chemotherapy or breast cancer, and <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> Chinese patients without cancer {{over a period of}} 5 years. Method: 120 <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients with an average age of 69 who had undergone mastectomy for grade two or three non-metastatic invasive breast ductal carcinoma. This was followed by administration of 5 -fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. The 118 <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> cancer-free patients were included as a control group. The first assessment point was 6 months after chemotherapy treatment. The BMD and panoramic and side views of the mandible were measured by γ-ray and the BMD of left hip hinge was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The serum and urine level of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), carboxyterminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), as well as liver and renal function tests were determined. These examinations were performed annually for 5 years. Result: The cancer patients demonstrated a statistically significant (p < 0. 05) increase in bone resorption of mandible and hip, and an increase in BAP and ICTP levels when compared with the control group. Although data were collected annually there was no statistical significance for the first 3 years. Conclusion: Breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy displayed significant resorption of mandibular bones compared with the healthy control, which might result in difficulties in fitting dentures, as it would cause pain and mucosal friction. Thus, concurrent therapy to decrease mandibular bone loss and special considerations in dentures are warranted for these patients. © 2010 Informa UK Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

This aesthetic deterioration linked to aging {{may be associated}} with tooth and alveolar bone loss in <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients. Purpose: To evaluate perioral wrinkles before and after maxillary and mandibular rehabilitation with implant-retained dentures in <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients. Methods: In this prospective cohort, single-center, blinded study, patients requiring maxillary and mandibular rehabilitation with implant-retained dentures were enrolled. The patients were photographed in the same position before and after oral rehabilitation. Wrinkles were evaluated in the photographs by blinded observers using validated rating scales. The following parameters were analyzed: upper and lower radial lip lines, marionette lines, upper and lower lip fullness, nasolabial folds, corner of the mouth lines, and the labiomental crease. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test for paired data, with P< 0. 05 considered significant. Results: Upper and lower implant-retained dentures were applied in 31 patients (15 males; mean ± standard deviation age 62. 13 ± 8. 69 years, range 47 – 77 years). The oral rehabilitation procedures significantly improved (P< 0. 05) the upper and lower radial lip lines, marionette lines, upper and lower lip fullness, the nasolabial folds, and the corner of the mouth lines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most current {{implants}} have {{a moderately}} rough surface (compared with older minimally rough "turned" implants) to facilitate osseointegration. This randomized controlled trial (RCT), with split-mouth design, examined whether this increased surface roughness influenced the initial subgingival plaque formation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> and eight partially edentulous patients, {{all with a}} history of severe periodontitis, received 4 - 6 implants (mandible or maxilla). Per jaw, both minimally (turned) and moderately rough (TiUnite) implants (MKIII; Nobel Biocare) were alternated. Also, the healing and final abutments had similar surface characteristics. Subgingival biofilm formation was followed up for 1  year, and samples were analyzed by culture technique, qPCR and checkerboard RESULTS: Over the entire period, no statistically significant differences could be detected in subgingival microbiota between the minimally and moderately rough surfaces. In partially edentulous patients, the biofilm matured to a higher concentration of pathogens when compared with <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients. The subgingival implant composition and concentration in partially edentulous patients were comparable to the subgingival microbiota along teeth.

40|$|Dental {{implants}} {{have proven}} to be a successful treatment option in <b>fully</b> and partially <b>edentulous</b> patients, rendering long-term functional and esthetic outcomes. Various factors are crucial for predictable long-term peri-implant tissue stability, including the biologic width; the papilla height and the mucosal soft-tissue level; the amounts of soft-tissue volume and keratinized tissue; and the biotype of the mucosa. The biotype of the mucosa is congenitally set, whereas many other parameters can, to some extent, be influenced by the treatment itself. Clinically, the choice of the dental implant and the position in a vertical and horizontal direction can substantially influence the establishment of the biologic width and subsequently the location of the buccal mucosa and the papilla height. Current treatment concepts predominantly focus on providing optimized peri-implant soft-tissue conditions {{before the start of the}} prosthetic phase and insertion of the final reconstruction. These include refined surgical techniques and the use of materials from autogenous and xenogenic origins to augment soft-tissue volume and keratinized tissue around dental implants, thereby mimicking the appearance of natural teeth...|$|R
40|$|The subgingival plaque around both {{teeth and}} {{implants}} was analysed {{by means of}} differential phase-contrast microscopy.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{sought to}} assess the {{efficacy}} of modified pedicle grafting as a noninvasive technique for soft tissue augmentation around maxillary dental implants. Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted on eight patients who met the inclusion criteria. Prior to the second-stage surgery for exposing the implants, the buccal keratinized mucosa width, vestibular depth, and mucosal thickness around the implants were measured. The same parameters were measured {{six months after the}} second-stage surgery and were compared with the baseline values. Also, the color match of the graft with the adjacent gingival and mucosal tissues was evaluated. Results: Forty-seven maxillary implants were evaluated. The minimum and maximum gains of keratinized mucosal width were respectively equal to 0 mm and 7 mm, with a mean of 4. 31 ± 1. 19 mm. The mean vestibular depth around the implants was 9. 47 ± 1. 75 mm (ranging from 5 mm to 12 mm) six months after the surgery. At the beginning of the study, a thin mucosa surrounded the implants, but after six months, the peri-implant keratinized mucosa width increased. The color match of the graft with the adjacent gingival and mucosal tissues was excellent based on the periodontists' opinion. Conclusions: Modified pedicle grafting is a safe and predictable technique for soft tissue augmentation around maxillary implants. This technique is reliable for increasing the width of keratinized mucosa in <b>fully</b> and partially <b>edentulous</b> patients with a shallow vestibular depth. The stability of the pedicle flap is achieved by fixing the flap to the tissue around the healing abutment. </div...|$|R

One hundred and forty patients, with 502 ITI dental implants, who were treated from 1994 to 2000 in two private centers, were investigated. For such patientsT a minimum of one year and a maximum of six years were passed since prosthesis placement over implants, so they were cooperative subjects. There was a significant relation between implant type and bone loss, so was between the presence and absence of BOP and the rate of bone loss.

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} and critically appraise scientific publications evaluating the possible effect of implant design on treatment outcomes in {{the rehabilitation of}} patients with a <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> maxilla. Materials and Methods: Scientific reports were sought in three electronic bibliographic databases, combined with searches for meeting abstracts, and in the grey literature. English, German, or Scandinavian scientific publications on prospective or retrospective longitudinal studies with effects of an implant design or feature on the treatment outcomes were eligible. Minimum requirement for inclusion was at least 10 study participants who were followed up for at least 2 years after implant loading. The PRISMA guidelines were followed for selecting data to extract from the individual studies. These were characteristics of the individual studies, risk of bias within individual studies, {{and the results of}} individual studies. Three editorial teams independently identified and extracted the data. Results: The search resulted in 998 primary studies, of which 525 met the inclusion criteria and were read in full text. Of these, 105 studies were included in qualitative syntheses. Seventeen studies were designed with an objective to assess effects of implant design or feature on outcomes, 23 studies described tilted implants to enable placement of longer implants, 30 studies reported effects of implants placed in zygomatic bone with or without additional alveolar implants, and 9 studies reported effects of implants placed in pterygoid bone or other bony buttresses with or without additional alveolar implants. Sixteen articles reported bone augmentation with simultaneous or delayed implant placement in patients with a predominantly Cawood-Howell bone class V and VI maxilla. Ten papers reported effects of implant design on outcomes, despite the lack of an a priori stated objective to assess a particular implant design or feature.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Implants are {{commonly}} used {{in the treatment of}} <b>fully</b> or partially <b>edentulous</b> patients. Placement of implants requires careful radiographic evaluation of the surgical site so that side effects and neurovascular trauma to the superior wall of the mandibular canal would be avoided. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the accuacy of spiral tomography, panoramic views and parallel periapical radiographic techniques in evaluating the distance between the alveolar crest and the superior border of mandibular canal. Materials and Methods: Three dried human mandibles were used in this descriptive/analytical study. Three metal pieces were glued to the left side and three to the right side of each mandible. Subsequently, a 5 -mm-thick layer of wax was placed on the surface to simulate the soft tissue. Periapical and panoramic radiographs and spiral tomographs were taken from each mandible. Then the mandibles were sectioned and the actual distance between the alveolar crest and the superior border of mandibular canal was measured in each region. Data was analyzed by t-test and repeated measures ANOVA (α = 0. 05). Results: The results showed that of the three techniques evaluated only periapical radiographs did not exhibit any significant differences from the actual measurements (p value < 0. 05). In addition, there were no significant differences between panoramic and tomographic techniques (p value < 0. 05). Conclusion: Based on the results of the present study, parallel periapical technique is recommended for evaluation of implant placement sites and measuring of bone height in the mandible, although tomography can be used to measure bone width.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the tissue level mineralisation density distribution in mandibles from 88 adult humans. Mandibles (19 – 96 y) were sectioned vertically in midline (MID), mental foramen (MF), and third molar (M 3) regions. Surgical fragments from M 3 were obtained from individuals aged 16 – 38 y. All specimens were cleaned, embedded in PMMA, micromilled and examined by digital 20 kV backscattered electron (BSE) stereology. Quantitation was based on rescaling image histograms to the signal range between a monobrominated (0) and a monoiodinated (255) dimethacrylate resin standard. Mineralisation density increased with age (r= 0. 70; P< 0. 0001) : the mean for 39 individuals aged between 16 and 50 y was significantly lower (P< 0. 0001) than for 35 individuals over 51 y (mean (± 					S. E. M.) : 158. 20 (1. 63) and 174. 71 (1. 27) normalised grey level units respectively). There was good correlation in mean mineralisation density between different sites in the same mandible, but MID was significantly less highly mineralised than the other sites: MID 173. 90, MF 177. 34, M 3 177. 11 (P< 0. 002 and 0. 01 for MF and M 3 respectively; paired t test), as was the alveolar bone density {{when compared with the}} bone of the inferior cortex (e. g. MID: 171. 13 (1. 53) and 174. 46 (1. 14) P< 0. 0001). No sex difference was found. Partially dentate mandibles generally had regions of higher mineralisation than <b>fully</b> dentate and <b>edentulous</b> mandibles. The lowest density bone occurred at the alveolar crest anteriorly and superolingually at M 3, matching sites of net resorption following tooth loss. Highest densities were found inferolingually at MID, inferiorly at MF and buccally at M 3, matching the sites thought to experience the highest functional strains. This stresses the importance that local factors may have in the remodelling of the edentulous mandible. Morphology showed that there is a preponderance of highly mineralised cement lines, and of packets containing dead, mineralised, osteocytes...|$|R
40|$|Oral {{implantology}} is {{a common}} procedure in dentistry, especially for <b>fully</b> or partially <b>edentulous</b> patients. The implants must {{be placed in the}} best location from both the aesthetic and functional point of view. Because of this it is increasingly more frequent to resort to regeneration techniques that use substitutes of the bone itself, {{in order to be able}} to insert the implants in the most appropriate location. Material and Methodology: A review was performed on the literature from the last ten years based on the following search limitations: "graft materials', 'allograft', 'xenograft', 'autologous graft" and 'dentistry". Results: 241 works were obtained that after reading their respective summaries, they were reduced to 38, and 9 previous works were included in order to summarize the concepts. Discussion: Autologous grafts are the 'gold standard' of the bone regeneration. They have obvious advantages, but they also have drawbacks. This is why allogeneic and xenogeneic tissues are used. The former because of their clear similarity with the recipient's tissue and the latter due to their wide availability. Given that these grafts also have drawbacks, the industry has developed synthetic materials that have properties similar to those of human bone tissue. However, as of today, the ideal material to substitute human bone has not yet been found. In recent years the tendency has been to combine these synthetic materials with the patient's own bone, which is extracted during drilling in implant placement, with bone marrow aspiration, or with bone morphogenetic proteins. Thus the intention is to equip these substances with the osteogenic capacity. Conclusions: There is currently no ideal graft material, with the exception of those materials that come directly from the patient. We hope that in the coming years we will have products that will allow us to perform rehabilitations with better results and provide a better quality of life for our patients, especially those who have more complex situations to resolve, like the patients that are operated on for head and neck cance...|$|R

The present paper reports a case of interimplant papilla reconstruction in esthetic zone of maxilla during one stage early loading multiple implant procedure using demineralized freeze dried bone allograft block fixed by titanium screw. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: A precise {{placement}} of dental implants {{is a crucial}} step to optimize both prosthetic aspects and functional constraints. In this context, the use of virtual guiding systems has been recognized as a fundamental tool to control the ideal implant position. In particular, complex periodontal surgeries can be performed using preoperative planning based on CT data. The critical point of the procedure relies {{on the lack of}} accuracy in transferring CT planning information to surgical field through custom-made stereo-lithographic surgical guides. Methods: In this work, a novel methodology is proposed for monitoring loss of accuracy in transferring CT dental information into periodontal surgical field. The methodology is based on integrating 3 D data of anatomical (impression and cast) and preoperative (radiographic template) models, obtained by both CT and optical scanning processes. Results: A clinical case, relative to a <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> jaw patient, has been used as test case to assess the accuracy of the various steps concurring in manufacturing surgical guides. In particular, a surgical guide has been designed to place implants in the bone structure of the patient. The analysis of the results has allowed the clinician to monitor all the errors, which have been occurring step by step manufacturing the physical templates. Conclusions: The use of an optical scanner, which has a higher resolution and accuracy than CT scanning, has demonstrated to be a valid support to control the precision of the various physical models adopted and to point out possible error sources. A case study regarding a <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patient has confirmed the feasibility of the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|Today, implant {{dentistry}} {{plays an}} important role in the maintenance of chewing function and oral health. For thirty years now oral implants and methods for implantation have been developed further to assure a lifetime stability of these devices and to optimize function and esthetics. Starting with the treatment of <b>fully</b> <b>edentulous</b> patients, oral implants are now used for the reconstruction of partially edentulous patients as well. Thereby, implants not only replace missing teeth but also help to preserve intact remaining teeth. They are usually incorporated to improve the patient's subjective chewing comfort. The present paper gives an overview of the development and the current state of the art of oral implants, as well as their clinical indications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} multi-center study, non-submerged ITI {{implants}} were prospectively followed {{to evaluate their}} long-term prognosis in <b>fully</b> and partially <b>edentulous</b> patients. In a total of 1003 patients, 2359 implants were consecutively inserted. Following a healing period of 3 - 6 months, the successfully integrated implants were restored with 393 removable and 758 fixed restorations. Subsequently, all consecutive implants were documented annually up to 8 years. At each examination, the clinical status of all implants was evaluated according to predefined criteria of success. Therefore, the data base allowed the evaluation of 8 -year cumulative survival and success rates for 2359 implants. In addition, cumulative success rates were calculated for implant subgroups divided per implant type, implant length, and implant location. Furthermore, the actual 5 -year survival and success rates could be determined for 488 implants. During the healing period, 13 implants did not successfully integrate, whereas 2346 implants fulfilled the predefined criteria of success. This corresponds with an early failure rate of 0. 55 %. During follow-up, 19 implants were classified as failures due to several reasons. In addition, 17 implants (≈ 0. 8 %) demonstrated at the last annual examination a suppurative periimplant infection. Including 127 drop out implants (≈ 5. 4 % drop out rate) into the calculation, the 8 -year cumulative survival and success rates resulted in 96. 7 % and 93. 3 %, respectively. The analysis of implant subgroups showed slightly more favorable cumulative success rates for screw type implants (> 95 %) compared to hollow-cylinder implants (91. 3 %), and clearly better success rates for mandibular implants (≈ 95 %) when compared to maxillary implants (≈ 87 %). The actual 5 -year survival and success rates of 488 implants with 98. 2 % and 97. 3 %, respectively, were slightly better than the estimated 5 -year cumulative survival and success rates of 2359 implants indicating that the applied life table analysis is a reliable statistical method to evaluate the long-term prognosis of dental implants. It can be concluded that non-submerged ITI implants maintain success rates well above 90 % in different clinical centers for observation periods up to 8 years. © Munksgaard 1997. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} 4971 {{implants}} (Brånemark system) installed in 1315 patients, either <b>fully</b> or partially <b>edentulous,</b> and followed from implant installation {{up to the}} last control. A predominance of female patients (61 %) and a nearly equal number of upper and lower jaws characterised the study group. Patients were scheduled each 6 - 12 months for recall. The observation time varied from 0. 5 to 15 years (mean 5. 1). The whole cohort was split up into compromised (n = 59) and non-compromised (n = 1256) patients. The former are defined as grafted (autologous bone) and patients irradiated {{in the head and neck}} area. In the compromised patients 24 out of 59 patients (40. 6 %) showed failures, in whom 59 out of 310 (19 %) implants failed. In the non-compromised patients, implant failures were observed in 11. 6 % of the patients, which corresponds to 5. 9 % of the installed implants, excluding iatrogenic failures. Failures were further divided chronologically into early (up to 1 year after abutment connection) and late failures. There were early implant failures in 12. 5 % of the compromised patients and in 3. 4 % of the others. Late implant failures occurred in 7. 4 and 2 % of the two patients groups, respectively. While gender did not affect the failure rate, implant lengths, corresponding to the available bone height did, since a 21. 5 % failure rate for the 7 -mm implants contrasts with 4. 1 and 3. 8 % for 13 - and 15 -mm implants, respectively. Early as well as annual late failures are more frequently found in the maxilla. Implant fractures only occurred in the fixed (both partial and full) prosthesis group but never surpassed the 0. 2 % annual level. Marginal bone loss, exceeding the third screw thread occurred in 1. 8 % of the implants at the last control. It appears that this type of implant configuration offers a high long-term predictability. Failures occur before, at or during the first year after abutment connection and in very short implants. Marginal bone as a whole is very stable over the years. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Occlusion is a {{predisposing factor}} for Temporomandibular Dysfunctions (TMD) of the joint, whose first sign and/or symptom is usually joint sound. To verify the effect of {{occlusion}} on joint sounds, temporomandibular joints (TMJ) were analyzed in 78 asymptomatic individuals with various dental conditions. Electrosonography {{was used to determine}} the intensity of the vibration in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) on opening and closing the mouth.
