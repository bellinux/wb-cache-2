2500|$|OFDM {{requires}} {{very accurate}} <b>frequency</b> <b>synchronization</b> between {{the receiver and}} the transmitter; with frequency deviation the sub-carriers {{will no longer be}} orthogonal, causing inter-carrier interference (ICI) (i.e., cross-talk between the sub-carriers). Frequency offsets are typically caused by mismatched transmitter and receiver oscillators, or by Doppler shift due to movement. While Doppler shift alone may be compensated for by the receiver, the situation is worsened when combined with multipath, as reflections will appear at various frequency offsets, which is much harder to correct. This effect typically worsens as speed increases, and is an important factor limiting the use of OFDM in high-speed vehicles. In order to mitigate ICI in such scenarios, one can shape each sub-carrier in order to minimize the interference resulting in a non-orthogonal subcarriers overlapping. For example, a low-complexity scheme referred to as WCP-OFDM (...) consists of using short filters at the transmitter output in order to perform a potentially non-rectangular pulse shaping and a near perfect reconstruction using a single-tap per subcarrier equalization. Other ICI suppression techniques usually increase drastically the receiver complexity.|$|E

40|$|In this work, {{we develop}} and {{evaluate}} a theoretical model, which we then use {{to study the}} impact of the <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> on the performance of dynamic self-scheduling algorithms. These algorithms are used to parallelize loops with data dependencies on heterogeneous systems. The proposed model uses a formula to estimate the parallel time {{as a function of the}} <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency.</b> Inter-node communication has been proven to be the dominant factor for the performance degradation of applications containing loops with data dependencies. The synchronization mechanism therefore requires careful fine-tuning in order to give the best possible performance. The proposed model determines the optimal <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> that results in the minimum parallel time. We use this model to study {{the impact of the}} <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> on the parallel execution of a computational kernel from image processing. For this kernel, the <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> giving the minimum parallel time predicted by our theoretical model was very close to the <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> giving the least parallel time in practice. We validate our model by extensive comparisons of the theoretically predicted parallel time and <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> against those obtained from practical experiments. The comparisons show that the proposed model is highly accurate, its predictions for the optimal <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> being within 0. 0250 % of the experimentally optimal <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> in the best case, and within 0. 1750 % of the experimentally optimal <b>synchronization</b> <b>frequency</b> in the worst case.

However, due to the presence of noise, the simultaneous synchronization of all nodes to a common frequency is difficult, therefore an alternative solution for distributed network <b>frequency</b> <b>synchronization</b> using the Kalman filter is studied in this thesis. This thesis will show that existing <b>frequency</b> <b>synchronization</b> techniques in the wireless network fail in a noisy environment, and that the proposed scheme can be effective to suppress updating error noise using the Kalman filter. In particular, the proposed method can reduce the negative effects of updating error noise even if it is of high power (e. g., 50 dB). The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm over the existing algorithm will be verified by simulation results...|$|E
