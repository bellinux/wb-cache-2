40|$|Multi-display environments (MDEs) of {{all kinds}} are used a lot nowadays. A wide variety of devices helps to build a common display space. TVs, monitors, {{projected}} surfaces, phones, tablets, everything that {{has the ability to}} display visual information can be incorporated in multi-display environments. While the main research emphasis so far has been on interaction techniques and user experience within different MDEs, some research topics are dealing with static and dynamic display reconfiguration. In fact, several studies already work with MDEs that are capable of display reconfiguration on-the-fly. Different frameworks can perform splitting, streaming and rendering of visual data on large-scale displays with the ability of dynamic display reconfiguration to calibrate multiple-projectors or to combine different heterogeneous displays into one display wall dynamically. However, all of these frameworks require different approaches for display reconfiguration. Our goal is to create a model for display reconfiguration which will be abstract, transparent, will work in real-time, and will be easily deployable in any MDE. In this work we present an extension to a software framework called Display as a Service (DaaS). This extension is represented as a model for real-time display reconfiguration using DaaS. The DaaS framework allows for generic and transparent management of pixel-transport assuming only a network connection, providing a simple high-level implementation for pixel-producing and pixel-displaying applications. The main limitation of this approach is a certain delay between pixel generation and display. However, the video encoding and network transport are subject of improvements which will solve the problem in the future. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate three usage scenarios: manual dynamic display reconfiguration, automatic <b>display</b> <b>calibration,</b> and real-time display tracking. We also present a new algorithm for precise <b>display</b> <b>calibration</b> using markers and a handheld camera. The calibration results are evaluated using different tracking libraries.

The size, depth, and geometry, {{as well as}} the physical attributes of the virtual object, have to be rendered precisely relative to a physical reference. This paper presents a systematic calibration process to address the registration challenge in a custom-designed AR system, which is based upon recent head-mounted projective display (HMPD) technology. Following a concise review of the HMPD concept and our system configuration, we first present a computational model of the HMPD viewing system and requirements for the system calibration. Then, we describe, in detail, the calibration procedures to obtain estimates of unknown transformations, summarize the application of the estimates in a customized graphics rendering toolkit, and discuss the evaluation experiments and observations. Finally, the implementation of a testbed to demonstrate a successful registration is briefly described, and experimental results are presented.

40|$|The {{technique}} of support vector regression (SVR) {{is applied to}} the color <b>display</b> <b>calibration</b> problem. Given a set of training data, SVR estimates a continuous-valued function encoding the fundamental interrelation between a given input and its corresponding output. This mapping can then be used to find an output value for a given input value not in the training data set. Here, SVR is applied directly to the display’s non-linearized RGB digital input values to predict output CIELAB values. There are several different linear methods for calibrating different display technologies (GOG [1], Masking [2] and Wyble [3]). An advantage of using SVR for color calibration is that the end-user does not need to apply a different calibration model for each different display technology. We show that the same model can be used to calibrate CRT, LCD and DLP displays accurately. We also show that the accuracy of the model is comparable to that of the optimal linear transformation introduced by Funt et al [4]...|$|E
40|$|Color <b>display</b> <b>calibration,</b> in part, {{involves}} mapping input RGB {{values to}} corresponding output values in a standardized color space such as CIE XYZ. A linear model for RGB-to-XYZ mapping {{is based on}} a 3 -by- 3 linear transformation matrix T mapping data from (linearized) RGB to XYZ. Such a mapping is often determined by least squares regression on the difference between predicted and measured XYZ values. However, since displays are calibrated for viewing by human observers, it likely would be better to optimize relative to a perceptually uniform color space. Two new methods are proposed which optimize the total error relative to CIELAB or CIEDE 2000. The first method uses weighted least squares with weights based on the rate of change of CIELAB coordinates as a function of change in XYZ. The second method uses Nedler-Mead nonlinear optimization to minimize directly in CIELAB or CIEDE 200.

40|$|This lecture {{qualification}} thesis investigates relevant {{characteristics of}} the human visual system. These results are used to develop methods to optimize modern visual technologies. Self-luminant displays as well as interior and exterior light sources are considered. For self-luminant <b>displays,</b> <b>calibration</b> and characterization methods are developed to display colour stimuli accurately. New display colour primaries are designed for a large colour gamut. New sub pixel architectures are proposed for an optimum spatial resolution. Modern self-luminant displays often represent large colour stimuli and their colour appearance is modelled. Chromatic afterimages are also modelled to increase the image quality of video sequences. Ergonomic principles are derived to apply colour contrast to enhance visual search performance {{in the presence of}} coloured objects. Cognitive, preferred and emotional colour is also subject of this thesis. Long-term memory colours were found to be important to enhance the perceived colour quality of colour displays. The strength of visually evoked emotions related to cinema motion pictures is computed by a mathematical model based on the technical parameters of the video sequence. The factors of colour image preference (local and global contrast, chroma and hue) are investigated. A new algorithm is shown that enhances the image quality for young and elderly observers separately. To optimize interior light sources, principles to renew the CIE colour rendering index are presented. A concept of a colour harmony rendering index is proposed. An important question of this lecture qualification thesis is the investigation of mesopic visual performance to optimize exterior light sources. To this aim, the processes of mesopic detection are modelled at the detection threshold for different retinal eccentricities. An important finding is the necessity to include the activity of chromatic retinal mechanisms in addition to the achromatic mechanisms of the current models. A new chromatic model (the CHC model) is described. The CHC model does not use the concept of luminance to model mesopic detection at or around the threshold. It models the adaptation of each mechanism of mesopic detection separately and as a function of retinal eccentricity...|$|R
