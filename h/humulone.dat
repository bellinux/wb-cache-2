50|$|Hops are {{the flowers}} of the hops plant Humulus lupulus. These flowers contain over 250 {{essential}} oils, which {{contribute to the}} aroma and non-bitter flavors of beer. However, the distinct bitterness especially characteristic of pale ales comes {{from a family of}} compounds called alpha-acids (also called humulones) and beta-acids (also called lupulones). Generally, brewers believe that α-acids give the beer a pleasant bitterness whereas β-acids are considered less pleasant. α-acids isomerize during the boiling process in the reaction pictured. The six-member ring in the <b>humulone</b> isomerizes to a five-member ring, but it is not commonly discussed how this affects perceived bitterness.|$|E
50|$|Bitterness scales {{attempt to}} rate the {{perceived}} relative bitterness of beer. The bitterness of beer is provided by compounds such as humulones, or alpha acids from hops used during brewing. During the brewing process, <b>humulone</b> undergoes isomerization to form both cis- and trans- isohumulone which {{are responsible for the}} bitter taste of the beer. Likewise, hops contain lupulones, or beta acids. These beta acids are not considered in the initial bittering of the wort as much as their alpha acid counterparts since they do not isomerize through boiling, and therefore do not dissolve in the wort. However, beta acids can undergo oxidation and slowly contribute to the bitterness of the beer. This bitterness is harsher than the bitterness of the alpha acids and this flavor can be undesirable. The oxidation occurs over time through fermentation, storage, and aging. At the same time, isomerized alpha acids undergo degradation and reduce the bitterness of the beer.|$|E
40|$|Hops {{have been}} used in the brewing of {{alcoholic}} beverage for over 3000 years. Due to new consumer preferences towards sweeter drinks or 'Alcopops', beer consumption has taken a drastic decline. This has caused the economic value of hops as a commodity to decline, therefore new applications for this material are required. The hop extracts <b>humulone</b> (8) and lupulone (22) exist in several tautomeric forms. We present unequivocal evidence for the existence of the major tautomer of lupulone, colupulone and a derivative of <b>humulone</b> in polar media. The evidence has been obtained from single X-ray crystallographic data and computer modelling as well as IH and 13 e NMR spectroscopy. The first 2 D INADEQUATE spectrum of the tautomer of lupulone provides unambiguous chemical shift assignments for all of the structural carbon atoms. This project has also involved the investigation into known and novel derivatives of the major constituents of hops, <b>humulone</b> (8) and lupulone (22), as possible bactericides. The main mode of action of these compounds activity against bacterial cells is their ability to chelate metal ions and allow passive diffusion of these complexes out of cells. A number of chemical derivatives have been synthesised and, using a model developed as part of this research, tested for their potential to pass metal ions from aqueous to non-polar organic media.

Previous work focused on investigating the chemistry of the a-acid <b>humulone</b> 2, demonstrating the propensity of this compound to have a cytotoxic effect against the SK-MES lung cancer cell line and the MCF- 7 breast cancer cell line. This thesis documents the recent research concerning the synthesis, the anticancer and antibacterial activity of the ß-acid lupulone 1, its naturally occurring congeners 1 a-d and further, novel, non-naturally occurring compounds. We resumed the group's previous collaboration with the Golston and Pirianov research group at St Georges, where the anticancer studies were performed. The synthesis centred on a Friedel-Crafts acylation of phloroglucinol 32, followed by a C-trialkenylation reaction between the acylphloroglucinol and an allyl bromide. We conducted experiments that focused upon the choice of base and solvent for the trialkenylation reaction, concluding that liquid ammonia as both the base and solvent offered the most efficient route to the ß-acids. It was shown that aliphatic allylic bromides lend themselves to the' reaction,. although some derivatives require purification by column chromatography in addition to recrystallisation. In contrast, aromatic allyl bromides did not participate in the alkenylation reaction. We further investigated an alternate G-alkenylation reaction involving the di¬lithiation of 1, 3, 5 -trimethoxybenzene. We discovered that by including copper (I) iodide in the reaction, prenyl bromide 23 and allyl bromide 41 could be successfully coupled. VVe also discovered that our 2 nd generation ß-acids 42 a-g could participate in a ring-closing metathesis reaction, forming novel spirocyclic compounds 50 a-b. Our antibacterial studies showed that ß-acids are effective against Gram-positive bacteria, but not Gram-negative bacteria in accordance with published observations. We took our investigations further and found that ß-acids are effective against mutlidrug-resistant 'Staphylococcus aureus', even where the commercially available ciprofloxacin 67 was not. Our anticancer studies showed that of the compounds tested, non-natural derivative 1 g featuring a cyclopropyl ring was most effective against the MCF- 7 and MDA-MB- 231 breast cancer cell lines, and non-natural derivative 1 j was most effective against the DU 145 and PC 3 prostate cancer cell lines...|$|E
40|$|An {{introduction}} to hops is presented which includes {{an account of}} the morphology of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus L.), and a brief history of the use of hops in the brewing of beer. The chemistry of the humulinic acids is outlined from the isolation of humulinic acid A to that of humulinic acids C md D. To achieve a rational synthesis of humulinic acid C, which was the main object of the study, it appeared that it would first be necessary to synthesise the tetrahydrofuran, ethyl 2, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -ethoxycarbonyl- 5 -tetrahydro-furylacetate. Two approaches were made to the synthesis of this vital intermediate. One involved incorporation of the 5, 5 -diester group into a reaction scheme before the tetrahydrofuran ring was formed, whilst the other, was to prepare a tetrahydrofuran with the 5 -position suitably disubstituted so that a further reaction would then afford the required intermediate. The former approach was unsuccessful while the latter was partially successful in that a number of 5, 5 -disubstituted 2, 2 -dimethyltetrahydrofurans were prepared. Attempts to convert 2, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -ethoxymethyl- 5 -ethoxy-ethyltetrahydrofuran to the required diester tetrahydrofuran were unsuccessful. Humulinic acid C was prepared by degradation of humulinic acid A which had been obtained from hop-oil <b>humulone.</b> Degradation of humulinic acid C' afforded ethyl 2, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -ethoxycarbonyltetrahydrofurylacetate which was then degraded two steps further to yield 2, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -ethoxyethyl- 5 -ethoxymethyltetrahydrofuran (which had also been prepared by a synthetic route). The p. m. r. spectra of the two compounds were the same confirming that they were identical in structure. Further suggestions for the synthesis of the diester tetrahydrofuran are also made...|$|E

Häufig entziehen sich diese jedoch einer gezielten Untersuchung ihrer Wirkung auf die Aphiden, da sie als Substanzgemisch vorliegen. Beziehungen zwischen Substanzkonzentration und Verhaltensmustern aus Electrical Penetration Graphs (EPG) sind nur mit mäßigem Erfolg über statistische Verfahren darzustellen. Eine Versuchsanordnung zur gezielten Prüfung verhaltensbeeinflussender Substanzen mittels EPG wäre in diesem Falle hilfreich. Ein geeignetes einfaches Testsystem müsste {{mindestens}} folgende Komponenten beinhalten: – eine von den Aphiden akzeptierte Oberfläche, welche die Kutikula / Epidermis eines natürlichen Systems nachbildet – diese Oberfläche sollte evtl. durch den Versuchsansteller manipulierbar sein – eine dem Parenchym entsprechende Schicht, in welche die Testsubstanzen einzubringen wären – eine flüssige Phase, die dem Phloem entspricht und ebenfalls in ihrer Zusammensetzung variiert werden kann.

The results clearly show an influence of the bitter substances on the hop aphid’s feeding behaviour. Depending on concentrations, the animals reacted to bitter substances with differences in probing frequency and -time, sucking activity and other parameters. The probing activity was positively correlated with the resveratrol, a substance foreign to hop, whereas the sucking activity was notedly negatively correlated. So the resveratrol distinctively plays the role of an allomone, the bitter substances from hop, however, more that of kairomones.

40|$|One {{third of}} the world’s {{population}} {{is estimated to be}} infected with M. tuberculosis, a pathogen which causes more human death and misery than any other bacterial disease. Whilst treatment is available, resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is a growing problem. Thus there is an urgent need to identify new compounds that can kill drug resistant isolates and are able to potentiate the activity of currently available antibiotics. The plant kingdom is a rich source of antibacterial compounds and a plant which has attracted particular interest is Humulus lupulus, more commonly known as the hop, which has been used as an antibacterial in beer for hundreds of years. Its antibacterial properties are thought to be due to the combined action of alpha and beta acids and polyphenols such as xanthohumol although the precise nature of their interactions and relative importance has yet to be determined. An optimised agar antimicrobial assay was developed and employed based on Mycobacterium smegmatis, to characterize the antibacterial activity of fifty commercially available hop varieties with a view to identifying novel antibacterial compounds. Surprisingly, no correlation was found between alpha and beta acid content and antibacterial activity. Chemical analysis of the most (Citra) and least (Galena) active hop variants using a combination of bioactivity based thin layer chromatography, mass spectrometry and HPLC revealed differences in the relative amounts of antimicrobial compounds such as <b>humulone</b> (alpha acid), lupulone (beta acid) and xanthohumol but failed to identify the presence of novel antibacterial compounds. Whilst no new antimicrobial compounds were identified, the Citra hop extract was able to potentiate the activity of the antibiotics imipenem and ciprofloxacin against clinical isolates of M. abscessus, a fast growing member of the mycobacterium family which infects individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis. The Citra hop extract also inhibited the growth drug resistant isolates of M. abscessus suggesting that it may have activity against other antibiotic resistant mycobacteria such as M. tuberculosis With regards to the mode of action, scanning electron microscopy revealed distinct changes to the outer cell structure of the bacteria, suggesting that hops contain compounds that interact with the bacterial cell membrane and/or cell wall. These changes were more profound in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of imipenem, a compound which also targets the cell wall. Overall hops were shown to contain compounds which inhibited the growth of mycobacterium and were able to potentate the activity of antibiotics currently used to treat these pathogens. These findings suggest hops may be a fruitful source from which to isolate next generation compounds with which to treat increasingly drug resistant strains of mycobacteria...|$|E
