50|$|Sometimes, circuit {{tolerances}} {{can make}} erratic behaviour difficult to trace; for example, a weak <b>driver</b> <b>transistor,</b> a higher series resistance and the capacitance {{of the gate}} of the subsequent transistor may be within tolerance but can significantly increase signal propagation delay. These can manifest only at specific environmental conditions, high clock speeds, low power supply voltages, and sometimes specific circuit signal states; significant variations can occur on a single die. Overstress-induced damage like ohmic shunts or a reduced transistor output current can increase such delays, leading to erratic behavior. As propagation delays depend heavily on supply voltage, tolerance-bound fluctuations of the latter can trigger such behavior.|$|E

In der Arbeit werden von integrierenden TFA-Bildsensoren die Grenzeigenschaften Empfindlichkeit, Dunkelstrom, temporäres und örtliches Rauschen untersucht. Eine gute Stromempfindlichkeit wird durch optimale Detektorgeometrien erreicht. Parasitäre Kapazitäten der 3 -dimensionalen Anordnung und die gewählte Pixeleingangsschaltung bestimmen die Wandlungs- oder Spannungsempfindlichkeit. Dunkelstromanteile sind durch thermische Effekte bzw. durch Feldeffekte bestimmt. Der Sperrstrom des Detektors, der Leckstrom des Resettransistors und der Leckstrom über das Treibergate sind zu bewerten. Je nach dominierendem Anteil ändert sich die Temperaturabhängigkeit. Bei ohmschen Anteilen ist die Dunkelstromverbesserung durch Kühlung vernachlässigbar. Die Einbindung des Detektorrauschens von Foto- und Dunkelstrom in SPICE ermöglicht die Bestimmung des Signal-Rauschabstands und des Dynamikbereichs der Pixeleingangsstufe. Bei der Detektionsschwelle dominiert i. d. R. das Treiberrauschen. Eine Beschreibung für das Verstärkungs-FPN (PRNU) ist mithilfe der Momentenmethode dargestellt.

This thesis analyses the limiting properties of integrating TFA image sensors, i. e. sensitivity, dark current, temporal and fixed pattern noise. A useful current sensitivity is obtained with optimized detector geometries. Parasitic capacitances of the 3 -dimensional design and the selected pixel input circuit determine the conversion or voltage sensitivity. The dark current is determined by thermal effects or electrical field effects. The reverse current of the detector, the leakage current of the reset transistor and the leakage current of the driver gate have to be considered. The dark current temperature dependence varies with the dominating physical property. Dark current improvements of ohmic components by cooling are negligible. The integration of photo and dark current detector noise into SPICE enables the determination of the signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic range of the pixel input stage. In most cases, the <b>driver</b> <b>transistor</b> noise determines the detection limit. A description of gain FPN (PRNU) depending on the transistor geometry is developed using the moment method.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} novel design methodologies for integrated radiators {{and power}} generation at mm-wave frequencies that are enabled by the continued integration of various electronic and electromagnetic (EM) structures onto the same substrate. Beginning with {{the observation that}} transistors and their connections to EM radiating structures on an integrated substrate are essentially free, the concept of multi-port driven (MPD) radiators is introduced, which opens a vast design space that has been generally ignored due to the cost structure associated with discrete components that favors fewer transistors connected to antennas through a single port. From Maxwell's equations, a new antenna architecture, the radial MPD antennas based {{on the concept of}} MPD radiators, is analyzed to gain intuition as to the important design parameters that explain the wide-band nature of the antenna itself. The radiator is then designed and implemented at 160 GHz in a 0. 13 um SiGe BiCMOS process, and the single element design has a measured effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of + 4. 6 dBm with a total radiated power of 0. 63 mW. Next, the radial MPD radiator is adapted to enable dynamic polarization control (DPC). A DPC antenna is capable of controlling its radiated polarization dynamically, and entirely electronically, with no mechanical reconfiguration required. This can be done by having multiple antennas with different polarizations, or within a single antenna that has multiple drive points, {{as in the case of}} the MPD radiator with DPC. This radiator changes its polarization by adjusting the relative phase and amplitude of its multiple ports to produce polarizations with any polarization angle, and a wide range of axial ratios. A 2 x 1 MPD radiator array with DPC at 105 GHz is presented whose measurements show control of the polarization angle throughout the entire 0 degree through 180 degree range while in the linear polarization mode and maintaining axial ratios above 10 dB in all cases. Control of the axial ratio is also demonstrated with a measured range from 2. 4 dB through 14 dB, while maintaining a fixed polarization angle. The radiator itself has a measured maximum EIRP of + 7. 8 dBm, with a total radiated power of 0. 9 mW, and is capable of beam steering. MPD radiators were also applied in the domain of integrated silicon photonics. For these designs, the <b>driver</b> <b>transistor</b> circuitry was replaced with silicon optical waveguides and photodiodes to produce a 350 GHz signal. Three of these optical MPD radiator designs have been implemented as 2 x 2 arrays at 350 GHz. The first is a beam forming array that has a simulated gain of 12. 1 dBi with a simulated EIRP of - 2 dBm. The second has the same simulated performance, but includes optical phase modulators that enable two-dimensional beam steering. Finally, a third design incorporates multi-antenna DPC by combining the outputs of both left and right handed circularly polarized MPD antennas to produce a linear polarization with controllable polarization angle, and has a simulated gain of 11. 9 dBi and EIRP of - 3 dBm. In simulation, it can tune the polarization from 0 degrees through 180 degrees while maintaining a radiated power that has a 0. 35 dB maximum deviation from the mean. The reliability of mm-wave radiators and power amplifiers was also investigated, and two self-healing systems have been proposed. Self-healing is a global feedback method where integrated sensors detect the performance of the circuit after fabrication and report that data to a digital control algorithm. The algorithm then is capable of setting actuators that can control the performance of the mm-wave circuit and counteract any performance degradation that is observed by the sensors. The first system is for a MPD radiator array with a partially integrated self-healing system. The self-healing MPD radiator senses substrate modes through substrate mode pickup sensors and infers the far-field radiated pattern from those sensors. DC current sensors are also included to determine the DC power consumption of the system. Actuators are implemented in the form of phase and amplitude control of the multiple drive points. The second self-healing system is a fully integrated self-healing power amplifier (PA) at 28 GHz. This system measures the output power, gain and efficiency of the PA using radio frequency (RF) power sensors, DC current sensors and junction temperature sensors. The digital block is synthesized from VHDL code on-chip and it can actuate the output power combining matching network using tunable transmission line stubs, as well as the DC operating point of the amplifying transistors through bias control. Measurements of 20 chips confirm self-healing for two different algorithms for process variation and transistor mismatch, while measurements from 10 chips show healing for load impedance mismatch, and linearity healing. Laser induced partial and total transistor failure show the benefit of self-healing in the case of catastrophic failure, with improvements of up to 3. 9 dB over the default case. An exemplary yield specification shows self-healing improving the yield from 0...|$|E
