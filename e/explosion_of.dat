5|$|Hardcore punk was the {{response}} of American youths to the worldwide punk rock <b>explosion</b> <b>of</b> the late 1970s. Hardcore stripped punk rock and New Wave of its sometimes elitist and artsy tendencies, resulting in short, fast, and intense songs that spoke to disaffected youth.

5|$|Hubble's law has two {{possible}} explanations.
