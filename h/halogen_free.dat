The more porous or “hydrophilic” a polymers is the more flame retardants can be released. However, moulded plates which represent real world plastic products showed much lower leaching levels than extruded polymer granules.

The EU-funded collaborative research project ENFIRO (EU research project FP7: 226563, concluded in 2012) started out from the assumption that not enough environmental and health data were known of alternatives to the established brominated flame retardants. In order to make the evaluation fully comprehensive, it was decided to compare also material and fire performance as well as attempt a life cycle assessment of a reference product containing <b>halogen</b> <b>free</b> versus brominated flame retardants. About a dozen <b>halogen</b> <b>free</b> flame retardants were studied representing a large variety of applications, from engineering plastics, printed circuit boards, encapsulants to textile and intumescent coatings. A large group of the studied flame retardants were found to have a good environmental and health profile: ammonium polyphosphate (APP), Aluminium diethyl phosphinate (Alpi), aluminium hydroxide (ATH), magnesium hydroxide (MDH), melamine polyphosphate (MPP), dihydrooxaphosphaphenanthrene (DOPO), zinc stannate (ZS) and zinc hydroxstannate (ZHS). Overall, they were found to have a much lower tendency to bioaccumulate in fatty tissue than the studied brominated flame retardants.|$|E

50|$|Typically, interhalogen {{bonds are}} more {{reactive}} than diatomic halogen bonds—because interhalogen bonds are weaker than diatomic halogen bonds, except for F2. If interhalogens {{are exposed to}} water, they convert to halide and oxyhalide ions. With BrF5, this reaction can be explosive. If interhalogens are exposed to silicon dioxide, or metal oxides, then silicon or metal respectively bond {{with one of the}} types of <b>halogen,</b> leaving <b>free</b> diatomic <b>halogens</b> and diatomic oxygen. Most interhalogens are halogen fluorides, and all but three (IBr, AtBr, and AtI) of the remainder are halogen chlorides. Chlorine and bromine can each bond to five fluorine atoms, and iodine can bond to seven. AX and AX3 interhalogens can form between two halogens whose electronegativities are relatively close to one another. When interhalogens are exposed to metals, they react to form metal halides of the constituent halogens. The oxidization power of an interhalogen increases with the number of halogens attached to the central atom of the interhalogen, {{as well as with the}} decreasing size of the central atom of the compound.

5000|$|Amongst other useful {{effects of}} using {{high levels of}} Natural Oil Polyols to make foams are the {{improvements}} seen in the long-term performance of the foam under humid conditions and also on the flammability of the foams; compared to equivalent foams made without {{the presence of the}} NOP.People perspire; and so foams used for the construction of matrasses or furniture will, over time, tend to feel softer and give less support. The perspiration gradually softens the foam. Foams made with high levels of NOPs are much less prone to this problem, so that the useful lifetime of the upholstered product can be extended.The use of high levels of NOP also make it possible to manufacture foams with flame retardants which are permanent, and therefore are not later emitted into the household or work place environment. These relatively recently developed materials can be added at very low levels to NOP foams to pass such well known tests as California Technical Bulletin 117, which is a well-known flammability test for furniture. These permanent flame-retardants are <b>halogen</b> <b>free</b> and key into the foam matrix and are therefore fixed there. An additional effect of using these new, highly efficient, permanent flame retardants, is that the smoke seen during these standard fire tests, may be considerably reduced compared to that produced when testing foams made using non-permanent flame retardant materials, which do not key themselves into the foam structure. More recent work during 2014 with this [...] "Green Chemistry" [...] has shown that foams containing about 50 percent by weight of natural oils can be made which produce far less smoke when involved in fire situations. The ability of these low emission foams to reduce smoke emissions by up to 80% is an interesting property which will aid escape from fire situations and also lessen the risks for first responders i.e. emergency services in general and fire department personnel in particular.|$|E

30|$|Generally speaking, it is {{necessary}} to note that the processes of oxidation of aerosol reductant particles can often result in the formation of electrolyte layers on the surface of these particles in the form of electrolyte hydrates, electrolyte melts, or solid electrolyte layers instead of the ordinary dielectric oxide layers.

At the same time, such electrolyte layers can naturally incite the subsequent competitive process of electrochemical oxidation of the core reductant of these particles. The capsules-nanobatteries with such surface electrolyte layers can be spontaneously formed for example, during the oxidation of primary aerosol particles in a damp atmosphere, in an atmosphere containing carbon dioxide, as well as in an atmosphere containing an acid or a <b>free</b> <b>halogen.</b> In similar circumstances, e.g., the alkali or alkali-earth metal aerosol particles will be covered with growing hydroxide, carbonate, or with halogenide electrolyte shells instead of growing oxide layers.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Fire {{safety issues}} are {{becoming}} increasingly important in modern society and cables are one potential fire risk since they can start and/or spread a fire. As a result of environmental and safety issues {{having to do with}} flame retardants based on halogens, much attention has lately been given to finding <b>halogen</b> <b>free</b> alternatives. This work focuses on Casico&# 61668;, a <b>halogen</b> <b>free</b> flame retardant system used primarily for cable applications. It is based on poly(ethylene-co-acrylate), chalk and silicone elastomer. Small scale fire tests, such as oxygen index, cone calorimetry and dripping, analytical studies, such as IR, NMR, ESCA, XRD, SEM and TEM microscopy, and visual observations were used to evaluate materials. An original methodology in which the temperature is measured within cone calorimeter specimens using thermo couples was successfully developed. The flame retardancy of Casico is multifaceted and depends on some simpler factors, such as a volume and dilution effect of inert filler, and other more complex factors, such as the ionomer formation that occurs between acidic groups and calcium ions in the chalk after ester pyrolysis of the acrylate groups, formation and stabilisation of an intumescent structure, and the importance of the surface layer. These factors have successfully been linked to each other and, together with the effect of dispersion and viscosity, the flame retardant properties and behaviour of Casico can be explained satisfactorily...|$|E
40|$|Fire safety standards, {{including}} {{the application of}} flame-retardant chemicals, have been estab-lished in modern societies to reduce deaths and injuries {{as well as economic}} impact of fires. Bromine, like other <b>halogens,</b> quenches <b>free</b> radicals generated in a fire with high efficiency, thereby preventing the propagation of a flame. In Europe and North America, brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are therefore com-monly used in household applications. BFRs were established as the major chemical flame retardant in the 1970 s after the discovery of the adverse effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on human and environ mental health and in experimental studies (for reviews, see Fonnum and Mariussen 2009; Seegal 1996). BFRs are a structurally diverse group of chemi-cals, with polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) (Table 1) being among the formerly most highly produced BFRs (Bromine Science and Environmental Forum 2010). Although PBDEs are globally dispersed throughout the environment (reviewed by Law et al. 2008), human and environmental levels of PBDEs are approximately one order of magnitude higher in North America than in Europe and Asia (reviewed by Frederiksen et al. 2009). Humans are exposed to PBDEs in particular via air and ingestion of house dust, but also through intake of vegetable and ani-mal products (reviewed by Frederiksen et al. 2009). Because of their relatively high food intake, child-specific hand-to-mouth behav-ior, and frequent ground contact (resulting in the ingestion of house dust), children are exposed to larger amounts of PBDEs than are adults (Fischer et al. 2006; Toms et al. 2009). An additional source of exposure for young children is breast milk, in which especially lower brominated PBDEs have been detected (reviewed by Frederiksen et al. 2009).

For the ground state and lowest triplet state, the calculations are performed with the coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triple excitation level of correlation using an augmented triple-zeta basis set. For the (1) Pi state the multireference average quadratic coupled cluster technique was employed.

40|$|In {{previous}} papers, {{we reported}} that {{in the presence of}} Cu 2 + (10 - 4 M) aldopentoses, D-arabinose(1), D-lyxose(2), D-ribose(3), and D-xylose(4), inactivate in vitro tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and bacteriophageφXl 74 and that superoxide and other oxygen radicals generated by the autoxidation of these sugars are responsible for the inactivation of the viruses. Moreover, we suggested that the observed differences in the biological activity and the rate of the autoxidation reactions of the four pentoses are due to their configurational difference, since the order [(3) > (2) > (4) > (1) ] is the same both in rhe activity and in the reaction rate, and the similar effect of configuration on the rate of the oxidation reaction and enolization of aldopentoses was reportedi n the literature. Aldohexoses are in general less reactive than aldopentoses in oxidations (e. g [...] <b>halogen</b> oxidation of <b>free</b> sugars) and have been reported to exhibit very weak nucleic acid-cleaving activity. However, we have recently found that some partially substituted aldohexoses exhibit higher biological activities than the corresponding unsubstituted ones, More recently Bucala et al. reported the possibility of some common reducing hexoses being involved in nucleic acid aging in vivo and age-related dysfunction in gene expression via chemical modification or strand scission. ln view of these developments, we have examined the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium chloride(NBT) and the in vitro inactivation of viruses by four kinds of D‐aldohexoses: D-altrose, D-mannose(8), D-allose(5), and D-glucose(7), which have the same configuration at C- 2 and C‐ 3, respectively, as the above‐mentioned four aldopentoses, {{to see whether or not}} in the term of configuration the order in their reactivity and biological activity is the same as the corresponding aldopentoses. これまでの研究により, D-アラビノース(1) ，D-リキソース(2) ，D-リボソース(3) ，およびD-キシロース(4) が，室温，緩衝液中ニトロブルーテトラゾリウム(NBT) を還元し，またCu 2 +の存在下でウイルスを不活化することがわかったので，これらの糖とC- 2 ，C- 3 位の立体配置が同じであるD-アルトロース(6) ，D-マンノース(8) ，D-ロース(5) およびD-グルコース(2) (いずれも市販品) のNBT還元力，バクテリオファージφX 174 およびタバコモザイクウイルス(TMV) の不活化反応(リン酸緩衝液中，pH 8. 1 ， 37 ℃， 3 時間) を検討した。その結果，NBT還元力は，ペントースと異なった反応性順位(6 > 5 > 7 > 8 >) が得られ，これはIsbell らによって報告されたアルカリ条件下のヘキソースのエノール化速度とほぼ一致した。ウイルス不活化力は，いずれのヘキソースもD-リボースより小さかったが，ヘキソース間では有意差は認められなかった...|$|R
40|$|The {{preparation}} and some reactions of chloride fluorides of tungsten(VI) (of the type WC 1 nF 6 -n) have been studied. Values for {{the heat of}} formation of liquid tungsten chloride pentafluoride and tungsten dichloride tetrafluoride of - 387 + 5 kcals/mole and - 350 + 7 kcals/mole respectively, have been calculated from measured values of the heat of hydrolysis of the compounds and known thermochemical data. These values have led to some discussion as to the relative strength of the W-F bond (and similarly the W-C 1 bond) in tungsten(VI) chloride fluoride compounds. Unsuccessful {{attempts have been made}} to separate the cis and trans isomers of tungsten dichloride tetrafluoride by both physical and chemical means. The 19 F spectrum of WC 12 F 4 consists of two triplets (in the ratio of 1 : 1) and a singlet, which indicates the presence of respectively the cis and trans isomers. In all experiments the 19 F spectrum of the volatile products have shown the ratio of the WC 12 F 4 isomers to still be the same. It has therefore been suggested that the cis and trans isomers of tungsten dichloride tetrafluoride are in dynamic equilibrium and cannot be separated. Preliminary investigations of the low temperature exchange reactions between rhenium hexafluoride and the boron trihalides, BC 13 and BBr 3; both in the presence and absence of <b>free</b> <b>halogen,</b> have resulted in solid products which are believed to be rhenium pentachloride and rhenium tetrabromide respectively. A value for the heat of formation of rhenium pentachloride of - 85 + 5 kcals/mole has been calculated. The heats of formation of XeF 2, SbF 5 and XeF 2. 2 SbF 5 proved difficult to obtain, possibly due to the fact that though the predominant products of hydrolysis were those expected, small quantities of other compounds - obtained by secondary reactions - may also have been present. A melting point of 63 C and a boiling point of 220 + 5 C. were measured for pure XeF 2. 2 SbF 5...|$|R
