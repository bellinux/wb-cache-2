40|$|This article {{describes}} the simultaneous diffusion of a migrant and a solvent in low density polyethylene (LDPE). The migrant (Irganox 1076) moves out of the slab, while the solvent (isooctane, n-heptane or cyclohexane) moves inwards. Solvent absorption was measured separately by following the increase {{of the mass of}} the slab in time. It can be described by the Fick diffusion equation with a diffusivity depending on the solvent concentration, and an interface concentration depending on time. The <b>final</b> <b>absorptions</b> were 12 % for isooctane, 14 % for n-heptane, and 29 % for cyclohexane. Additive concentrations in the slab were determined at different positions by microtoming. Experiments were done for several contacting times. The concentration profiles were strongly affected by the solvent. A larger local solvent concentration increases the diffusivity of the migrant. The Fick equation with a migrant diffusivity depending on the solvent concentration gives a good description for the results with isooctane and n-heptane. The description is less good for the measurements with cyclohexane (when the polymer swells strongly) ...|$|R

60|$|Buddha is {{regarded}} as a manifestation of Vishnu--the Hindoos say, to delude his enemies; the Buddhists, to bring a new revelation. Gautama was the almost deified being who spread the knowledge of Buddhism, about 500 B.C. In different countries the religion has assumed different forms, but it is nearly co-extensive with the Mongolian race, and the general features are the rejection of the Vedas and of most of the Hindoo myths, faith in the divinity of Buddha, and hope that the individual personality will be entirely absorbed in his essence, the human being lost in the Deity. Five laws of virtue must be observed, ten kinds of sin avoided; and the Buddhist expects that transgressions will be punished by the transmigration of his soul into some inferior creature, whence he will rise by successive stages into another trial as a man, and gradually improving by the help of contemplation, and of a sublime state of annihilation of all self-consciousness, may become fit for his <b>final</b> <b>absorption</b> into the Godhead. There is an extensive priesthood, called Lamas, who live in a state of celibacy in dwellings not at all unlike monasteries; and, in effect, so much in their practices seems to parody the ceremonies of Christianity that the Portuguese thought them invented by the devil for the very purpose. However, {{there is no doubt that}} Buddhism inculcates a much purer morality than the religion of Brahma, and far higher aims. In Burmah, however, the idea of the eternity of the Deity had evidently been lost, and Gautama had practically usurped the place that the higher Buddhists gave to Brahma. Indeed, though the true Buddhist system looks to the absorption in the Deity,--Nirvana, as it is called,--the popular notion, as received in Burmah and corrupted by less refined minds, made it into what was either absolute nonentity or could not be distinguished from it, so that the ordinary Burman's best hope for the future was of nothing but annihilation.|$|E

50|$|Although he was 66 {{years old}} as the {{election}} approached, Morris-Jones’ decision to step down from Parliament at the 1950 general election may {{have been influenced by}} more than just advancing years.

This is a slightly surprising number given that only 12 Liberal MPs had been elected in 1945, a drop of nine on the previous election and since then the party had been experiencing defections - Gwilym Lloyd-George was almost completely associated with the Conservatives by 1950 and Tom Horabin had taken the Labour whip. In fact the party continued to decline at the 1950 general election, making a net loss of three seats leaving then with only nine. Perhaps Morris-Jones also foresaw the <b>final</b> <b>absorption</b> of the National Liberals into the Conservative Party. The formal merger of the two parties had already taken place in 1948 and from then on, it was only a matter of time before any remaining genuinely Liberal element was subsumed by the overwhelming numbers and philosophy of the Conservatives, something which given his Liberal past and strong convictions, Morris-Jones may well have regretted.

The plasmon resonance absorptions of bimetallic nanocrystals vary considerably from those of their monometallic NP counterparts since their surface plasmon polaritons are determined by two different dielectric functions [20]. As reported in previous studies [13, 16], the formation of Ag-Au alloy structures can be confirmed by the presence of one absorption band, which would blueshift with an increase in the molar ratio of Ag [21 – 23] contrary to what would be observed in the formation of core-shell nanostructures.|$|E

The model {{takes into account the}} initial proton and <b>final</b> J/Psi <b>absorption,</b> target nucleon binding and Fermi motion, the formation length of J/Psi mesons as well as the effect of their nuclear mean-field potential on these processes. We calculate the A dependences of the absolute and relative (transparency ratio) charmonium yields as well as its excitation function within the different scenarios for the J/PsiN absorption cross section, for the J/Psi formation length and for J/Psi in-medium modification. We demonstrate that the former observables, on the one hand, are not practically affected by the charmonium formation length effects and, on the other hand, they are appreciably sensitive to the genuine J/PsiN absorption cross section at beam energies of interest, which means that these observables can be useful to help determine the above cross section from the comparison of the results of our calculations with the future data from the CBM experiment at FAIR-the upcoming accelerator facility at GSI-Darmstadt, Germany. We also show that the excitation function for J/Psi subthreshold production in pA reactions reveals some sensitivity to adopted its in-medium modification scenarios. Therefore, such observable may be an important tool to get valuable information on the charmonium in-medium properties. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
