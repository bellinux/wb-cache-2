This effort will allow the refinement of technology design tools, accurate estimates of a baseline levelized cost of energy (LCoE), and {{the identification of the}} main cost drivers {{that need to be addressed}} to achieve a competitive LCoE. As part of this effort, Oak Ridge National Laboratory was charged with examining and reporting reference river <b>inflow</b> <b>characteristics</b> for reference model 2 (RM 2). Published turbulent flow data from large rivers, a water supply canal and laboratory flumes, are reviewed to determine the range of velocities, turbulence intensities and turbulent stresses acting on hydrokinetic technologies, and also to evaluate the validity of classical models that describe the depth variation of the time-mean velocity and turbulent normal Reynolds stresses. The classical models are found to generally perform well in describing river <b>inflow</b> <b>characteristics.</b> A potential challenge in river inflow characterization, however, is the high variability of depth and flow over the design life of a hydrokinetic device. This variation can have significant effects on the inflow mean velocity and turbulence intensity experienced by stationary and bottom mounted hydrokinetic energy conversion devices, which requires further investigation, but are expected to have minimal effects on surface mounted devices like the vertical axis turbine device designed for RM 2. A simple methodology for obtaining an approximate inflow characterization for surface deployed devices is developed using the relation umax=(7 / 6) V where V is the bulk velocity and umax is assumed to be the near-surface velocity. The application of this expression is recommended for deriving the local inflow velocity acting on the energy extraction planes of the RM 2 vertical axis rotors, where V=Q/A can be calculated given a USGS gage flow time-series and stage vs. cross-section area rating relationship...|$|E

40|$|Broadband Fan Noise Prediction System (BFaNS) is a {{computer}} program that, as its name indicates, predicts the broadband noise generated by the fan stage of a turbofan engine. This noise {{is the sum of}} (1) turbulent-inflow noise, which is caused by turbulence impinging on leading edges of the fan and the fan exit guide vane and (2) self noise, which is caused by turbulence convecting past the corresponding trailing edges. The user provides input data on the fan-blade, vane, and flow-path geometries and on the mean and turbulent components of the flow field. BFaNS then calculates the turbulent-inflow noise by use of D.

Hanson s program, BBCASCADE, is incorporated into BFaNS, wherein it is applied to the rotor and stator in a stripwise manner. The spectra of upstream and downstream sound powers radiated by each strip are summed to obtain the total upstream and downstream sound-power spectra.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} research {{involving an}} in-service {{failure of a}} “variable pitch in motion” fan’s blade bearing. Variable pitch in motion fans rotate at a constant speed, with the changing blade angle varying the load. A pitch-change mechanism facilitates the change in blade angle. A blade bearing supports each blade enabling it to rotate. The author observed that as the fan aerodynamic stage loading progressively increased, so did the rate of blade-bearing wear. The reported research addressed two separate, but linked, needs. First, the ongoing need to increase fan pressure development capability required an increase in fan loading. This increase was {{within the context of}} an erosive operating regime which systematically reduced fan pressure development capability. The second need was to identify the root cause of blade-bearing failures. The author addressed the linked needs using a computational analysis, improving the rotor <b>inflow</b> aerodynamic <b>characteristics</b> through an analysis of the inlet box and design of inlet guide vanes to control flow nonuniformities at the fan inlet.

For these types of vessels, special attention has {{to be paid to}} the design of the stern region, the occurrence of a good flow towards the propeller and rudder being necessary to avoid separation and unsteady loads on the propeller blades and, thus, to minimize fuel consumption and the risk for cavitation erosion and vibrations.

The chosen benchmark case is a wind tunnel measurement, where stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry was employed to obtain the velocity field and turbulence statistics in the near wake of a two-bladed wind turbine model and of a porous disc, which mimics the numerical actuator used in the simulations. Researchers have been invited to simulate the experimental case based on the disc drag coefficient and the <b>inflow</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Four large eddy simulation (LES) codes from different institutions and a vortex model are part of the comparison. The purpose of this benchmark is to validate the numerical predictions of the flow field statistics in the near wake of an actuator disc, a case that is highly relevant for full wind farm applications. The comparison has shown that, despite its extreme simplicity, the vortex model is capable of reproducing the wake expansion and the centreline velocity with very high accuracy.

A flow hydrograph was decomposed into two segments, rising and falling limbs, and the individual segments were modeled using statistical techniques. In addition, a conceptual rainfall–runoff model, namely the Public Works Research Institute (PWRI) -distributed hydrological model, and statistical models were compared. The study area was the Tsengwen Reservoir watershed in Southern Taiwan. The data {{used in this study}} comprised the observed watershed rainfalls, reservoir <b>inflows,</b> typhoon <b>characteristics,</b> and ground weather data. The forecast horizons ranged from 1 to 12  h. A series of assessments, including statistical analyses and simulations, was conducted.

However, the pace regression was the most favorable according to an evaluation of model complexity and accuracy. To examine the robustness of the results for forecast horizons varying from 1 to 12  h, statistical significance tests were performed for the single- and two-segment models. The prediction ability of the two-segment models was superior to that of the single-segment models.

40|$|The {{ice shelf}} caverns around Antarctica are sources of cold and fresh water which {{contributes}} {{to the formation of}} Antarctic bottom water and thus to the ventilation of the deep basins of the World Ocean. While a realistic simulation of the cavern circulation requires high resolution, because of the complicated bottom topography and ice shelf morphology, the physics of melting and freezing at the ice shelf base is relatively simple. We have developed an analytically solvable box model of the cavern thermohaline state, using the formulation of melting and freezing as in Olbers and Hellmer (2010). There is high resolution along the cavern's path of the overturning circulation whereas the cross-path resolution is fairly coarse. The circulation in the cavern is prescribed and used as a tuning parameter to constrain the solution by attempting to match observed ranges for outflow temperature and salinity at the ice shelf front {{as well as of the}} mean basal melt rate. The method, tested for six Antarctic ice shelves, can be used for a quick estimate of melt/freeze rates and the overturning rate in particular caverns, given the temperature and salinity of the inflow and the above mentioned constrains for outflow and melting. In turn, the model can also be used for testing the compatibility of remotely sensed basal mass loss with observed cavern <b>inflow</b> <b>characteristics.</b> ...|$|E

Only few studies applied this methodology to control continuous flow plants, as {{it is much more}} difficult to identify operating conditions because of continually variable <b>inflow</b> <b>characteristics.</b> This work applied indirect signal analysis to control pre-denitrification in continuous-flow activated sludge processes: (i) a laboratory-scale plant, fed with synthetic wastewater, simulating real municipal wastewater and (ii) a pilot-scale plant, fed with real sewage. Three different ranges of ORP values identify three operational conditions of the denitrification process. (1) ORP > 0 mV means that nitrates and/or nitrites are present, possibly due to a low C/N ratio. (2) – 50 < ORP < – 200 mV is typical of normal operating conditions, that is with a balanced C/N ratio. (3) ORP < – 350 mV means that oxidized nitrogen load is too low or that C/N exceeds the stoichiometric ratio. The trend of pH, instead, points out if and how the process is evolving from one to another operating condition. The correlation between pH and ORP signals (as well as their derivatives) allows to restore normal operating conditions by acting on the internal recycle flow-rate. Improved denitrification process ensures lower effluent nitrate concentration, and reduce external carbon dosage to achieve stricter nitrogen limits...|$|E

Radar-derived precipitation fields indicate that the studied system consists of two subsystems, S 1 and S 2, characterized by distinct internal dynamics and morphological structures. The retrieved kinematic and thermodynamic structures are compared in detail with the synoptic-scale characteristics described in Part I of this paper, so as to evaluate the scale interactions involved in the internal organization of this convective system. It is shown essentially that the synoptic-scale circulation governs the mesoscale and convective-scale motions and, therefore, determines the internal organization of the selected system. In particular, this study highlights the major {{role played by the}} synoptic-scale vertical wind shear in the internal structure of this tropical mesoscale system. Momentum flux calculations show that upward transport of horizontal momentum on the mesoscale is large and mostly carried out at a scale of motion larger than the mesoscale (i. e., by the mean component of the total momentum flux). The westerly rear <b>inflow</b> exhibits <b>characteristics</b> consistent with the density current theory. However, specific mesoscale and convective-scale processes linked to the presence of precipitation modulate this dominant synoptic-scale forcing.

40|$|Warm and saline waters {{enter the}} Nordic Seas {{from the south}} {{as part of the}} warm-to-cold water {{transformation}} of the thermohaline circulation of the northern North Atlantic. One explanation for the origin of the Nordic Seas Inflow is a “shallow source hypothesis ” under which the Inflow waters are a modification of upper ocean subtropical waters. Warm waters from the subtropical gyre are carried to the eastern North Atlantic by the North Atlantic Current and branch northwards, joined by poleward upper thermocline flow along the upper continental slope, to provide the Nordic Seas Inflow. Along this pathway the upper water column is progressively cooled and freshened by winter convection, the subpolar mode water transformation process, and this sets the <b>Inflow</b> <b>characteristics.</b> A “deep source hypothesis ” provides an alternative explanation for the characteristics of the Nordic Seas Inflow and the pathway delivering the waters to the Inflow.

Using an innovative technique in which we represent the changing spacetime in the region occupied by the orbiting matter with a 2. 5 PN approximation and the binary orbital evolution with 3. 5 PN, we have simulated the MHD evolution of a circumbinary disk surrounding an equal-mass non-spinning binary. Prior {{to the beginning of the}} inspiral, the structure of the circumbinary disk is predicted well by extrapolation from Newtonian results.

BackgroundDefinitive diagnosis of CP requires identification of constrictive hemodynamics with or without pericardial thickening. CMR to date has primarily provided morphological assessment of the pericardium. MethodsSixteen patients (age 57 ± 13 years) undergoing CMR to assess known or suspected CP and 10 controls underwent RT-PC that acquired simultaneous mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflow velocities over 10 s of unrestricted breathing. The diagnosis of CP was confirmed via clinical history, diagnostic imaging, cardiac catheterization, intraoperative findings, and histopathology. ResultsTen patients had CP, all with increased pericardial thickness (6. 2 ± 1. 0 mm). RT-PC imaging demonstrated discordant respirophasic changes in atrioventricular valve inflow velocities in all CP patients, with mean ± SD mitral valve and tricuspid valve inflow velocity variation of 46 ± 20 % and 60 ± 15 %, respectively, compared with 16 ± 8 % and 24 ± 11 % in patients without CP (p 0. 3 for both). Respiratory variation exceeding 25 % across the mitral valve yielded a sensitivity of 100 %, a specificity of 100 %, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 1. 0 to detect CP physiology. Using a cutoff of 45 %, variation of transtricuspid valve velocity had a sensitivity of 90 %, a specificity of 88 %, and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0. 98.

Patients with myocardial infarction were subdivided into four groups, focusing on the involvement of right ventricular and septal branches of the coronary arteries. Group I consisted of 11 patients with anterior infarction who showed an obstructive lesion of the proximal left anterior descending branch involving the first septal perforator with a patent right coronary artery. Group II consisted of 10 patients with inferior infarction who showed an obstructive lesion of the proximal right coronary artery involving the right ventricular branch. Group III consisted of 12 patients with both anterior and inferior infarction who showed obstructive lesions of both the proximal left anterior descending branch and the right coronary artery involving the right ventricular branch. Group IV consisted of seven patients with lateral infarction who showed an obstructive lesion of the diagonal branch or branches of the circumflex coronary artery with a patent left anterior descending branch and right coronary artery. Three measurements were performed from the trans-mitral and transtricuspidal inflow velocity patterns to assess the {{left and right}} ventricular diastolic behaviors. These measurements were: 1) acceleration half-time, 2) deceleration half-time of early diastolic rapid inflow, and 3) the ratio of the peak velocity of early diastolic rapid inflow to that of the late diastolic inflow due to the atrial contraction. Impaired diastolic filling of the left ventricle compensated by enhanced left atrial contraction was observed in patients with myocardial infarction from groups I, II, III and IV. Impaired diastolic filling of the right ventricle compensated by enhanced right atrial contraction was revealed in groups I, II and III. It is supposed that myocardial damage of the interventricular septum and a part of the right ventricular anterior wall perfused from the left anterior descending branch might be one of the causes for mildly impaired diastolic filling of the right ventricle in group I patients with a patent right coronary artery...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a model study of the interannual variability of High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) properties in the Ross Sea. Salinity, potential temperature and volume of HSSW formed in the western Ross Sea show oscillatory behaviour at periods of 5 - 6 and 9 years superimposed on long-term fluctuations. While the shorter oscillations are induced by wind variability, variability {{on the scale of}} decades appears to be related to air temperature fluctuations. At least part of the strong decrease of HSSW salinities deduced from observations for the period 1963 - 2000 is shown to be an aliasing artefact due to an undersampling of the periodic signal. While sea ice formation is responsible for the yearly salinity increase that triggers the formation of High Salinity Shelf Water, interannual variability of net freezing rates hardly affects changes in the properties of the resulting water mass. Instead, results from model experiments indicate that the interannual variability of dense water characteristics is predominantly controlled by variations in the shelf inflow through a sub-surface salinity and a deep temperature signal. The origin of the variability of <b>inflow</b> <b>characteristics</b> to the Ross Sea continental shelf can be traced into the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. The temperature anomalies are induced at the continental shelf break in the western Bellingshausen Sea by fluctuations of the meridional transport of Circumpolar Deep Water with the eastern cell of the Ross Gyre. Upwelling in the centre of this gyre carries the signal into the surface layer where it causes anomalies of brine release near the sea ice edge in the Amundsen Sea, which results in a sub-surface salinity anomaly. With the westward flowing coastal current, both the sub-surface salinity and deep temperature signals are advected onto the Ross Sea continental shelf. Convection carries the signal of salinity variability into the deep ocean, where it interacts with Modified Circumpolar Deep Water upwelled onto the continental shelf as the second source water mass of HSSW. Sea ice formation on the Ross Sea continental shelf thus drives the vertical propagation of the signal rather than determining the signal itself...|$|E
40|$|Lakes play an {{important}} role in biosphere carbon dynamics. Though proportionally they constitute a small surface feature on the planet, in many cases lakes are subject to significant subsidies of organic material from their catchments. This input of allochthonous organic material, in addition to autochthonous organic material, has shown that lakes, particularly in temperate and boreal zones, can be heterotrophic systems and as such are net producers of CO 2. Thus, understanding the magnitude of fluxes of carbon through these limnetic systems is important if their contribution to ecosystem / global carbon dynamics is to be elucidated. In this research two separate field campaigns were undertaken with the goal of understanding if, and exactly how significant secondary (bacterial) production utilising allochthonous carbon is to overall pelagic production in Loch Lomond, Scotland. Stable isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), along with their respective concentrations, were measured in a temporal and spatial survey. Range in [DIC] and δ 13 CDIC was consistent with that predicted by the shifting balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic pathways. [DIC] peaked in the summer / autumn (0. 27 ± 0. 09 and 0. 17 ± 0. 05 mM, south and north basins respectively), reflecting a period when bacterial processing of allochthonous material is high, and thus so is CO 2 production. This effect was more pronounced in the mesotrophic south basin of the lake, compared to the oligotrophic north. Surface waters in the south, middle and north basins were generally saturated in CO 2 beyond atmospheric equilibrium and thus sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere. δ 13 CDIC and δ 18 ODO exhibited seasonal and spatial variability, probably also a result of changing metabolic balance and <b>inflow</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Spring / summer peaks in δ 13 CDIC (- 5. 1 ‰ epilimnion maximum) are indicative of photosynthetic incorporation, and vice versa in the autumn / winter (- 13 ‰ hypolimnion minimum) points towards respiratory dominance. δ 18 ODO is enriched during respiratory utilisation and peaks in the autumn / winter months. Depletion in δ 13 CDIC coupled to concurrent enrichment in δ 18 ODO observed with increasing depth (particularly during lake stratification) is assumed to again be a result of a shift in metabolic process dominance from autotrophic to heterotrophic (Myrbo and Shapley 2006). Spatial variability was consistent with the varying trophic states between basins, e. g., most enriched δ 13 CDIC was recorded in the more productive south basin compared to the middle or north. Dissolved organic carbon concentration also changed with position in the lake. Highest concentrations in the south basin were linked to a shallow gradient catchment, draining base rich soils and agricultural land, compared to the steep sloped, base-poor catchment in the north. The greater quantities of dissolved organic carbon in the south suggested that if bacterial processing of allochthonous material was significant it would likely be most prevalent in the south. During the spatial survey consistent and significant heterogeneity in DIC, DO and DOC was recorded. Although the same degree of variability may not be associated with other, more mophometrically / hydrologically simple lakes, this work has shown consideration of this possibility is advisable. The second field campaign used direct measurements of algal and bacterial productivity, using labelled stable isotope incorporation methods, to elucidate the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes. Primary production (PP) followed a predictable seasonal pattern, peaking in the spring and remaining relatively high until autumn. During this period primary production generally exceeded bacterial production (BP) per litre. During the winter this pattern was reversed. Using integrated estimates of both PP and BP this work showed that BP exceeded PP in the pelagic zone for the majority of the year, and over much of the lake’s extent. Even in the epilimnion BP was regularly the more significant process through the water column, and thus it is concluded Loch Lomond is a heterotrophic system and a likely source of CO 2 to the atmosphere. The PP: BP ratio ranged from 0. 6 – 0. 8 in the north basin, and 0. 4 to 0. 6 in the south. On average for the whole lake, bacterial production exceeded primary production by between 2, 700 and 4, 400 kg C day- 1. In total it was estimated that PP processes approximately 970 tonnes of carbon per year and BP between 2, 300 and 2, 800 tonnes of carbon per year. The proportion of total pelagic production fuelled by bacterial utilisation of allochthonous carbon changed throughout the year. During peaks of PP in the spring and summer much of the bacterial carbon demand was met by autochthonous supply. During the autumn / winter allochthonous carbon utilisation dominated pelagic production and regularly contributed over 90 % of total pelagic production. Combining estimated quantities of allochthonous carbon utilised in the north and south basins per m 2 (the middle basin taken as an intermediate between the two) and combining it with GIS data on lake volume, the total quantity of terrestrially derived carbon processed in Loch Lomond was estimated at approximately 3, 300 ± 2, 100 kg Callo day- 1. Both spatial and temporal surveys of natural abundance stable isotope ratios, along with concurrent measurements of algal and bacterial production, have provided substantial evidence for the importance of allochthonous carbon in Loch Lomond. Even minimum estimates imply a system dominated by bacterial production, fuelled by a proportionally high quantity of terrestrial material, thus producing excess CO 2, and potentially fluxing CO 2 to the atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} complex terrain wind {{conditions}} on the loading of wind turbines is examined using state-of-art computational means. The analysis is two folded. The first part considers variations of all the wind defining parameters: the turbulence intensities of the wind inflow, the corresponding length scales, the coherence decay factors, the vertical and lateral mean shears, the yaw misalignment and the mean velocity at the hub height. Running several wind turbines {{it is found that}} the main driving fatigue mechanism is, as expected, the turbulence intensity. Small length scales and strong three-dimensionality of the <b>inflow,</b> which are <b>characteristic</b> of complex terrains, are secondary factors of increase of the fatigue loads but still in some cases significant. The significance of yaw misalignment is confirmed. In {{the second part of the}} work different design concepts are compared in terms of fatigue loads. Four designs at the class of 0. 5 MW machines are considered: a classical stall and a classical pitch regulated machine, a "structurally soft" stall machine and a fixed pitch variable speed machine. As regards the significance of the control strategy, it is found that there are no merits for any of them. The "soft" design however seems to have reduced loads. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{passage of}} an extreme storm over {{an urban area}} {{can lead to the}} {{flooding}} of the streets if the rainfall intensity exceeds the design value and/or the drainage system is not functional. The study of flow distribution in street networks thus is important for the design of flood protection measures. The flow distribution is affected by the junction flow <b>characteristics,</b> <b>inflow</b> discharges and downstream water depths. To reduce the degree of empiricism, a 3 D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations model has been implemented in this study to investigate the flow phenomena in a cross junction. The Spalart- Allmaras model is used for turbulence closure. The numerical model utilizes the split-operator approach, in which the advection, diffusion and pressure propagations are solved separately. The numerical model predicts accurately the flow distribution in a channel crossing under different subcritical flow conditions, for which experimental data are available. Recirculation zones exist at both the downstream channels and the associated contraction coefficient varies linearly with the ratio of the discharges at the two inlets. Secondary currents are apparent for the flow with strong asymmetric outlet conditions. Under supercritical inflow conditions, the model reproduces the hydraulic jump and hydraulic drop phenomena and predicts accurately the relationship between the input power ratio and the outflow discharge ratio of the street crossing.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of data from an energy-conserving 3 D general {{relativistic}} MHD simulation, we predict the statistical character of variability in the coronal luminosity from accreting black holes. When the inner boundary of the corona is defined to be the electron scattering photosphere, its location depends only on the mass accretion rate in Eddington units (Ṁ). Nearly independent of viewing angle and Ṁ, the power spectrum over the range of frequencies from approximately the orbital frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) to 100 times lower is well approximated by a power-law with index - 2, crudely consistent with the observed power spectra of hard X-ray fluctuations in AGN and the hard states of Galactic binary black holes. The underlying physical driver for variability in the light curve is variations in the accretion rate caused by the chaotic character of MHD turbulence, but the power spectrum of the coronal light output is significantly steeper. Part of this contrast {{is due to the}} fact that the mass accretion rate can be significantly modulated by radial epicyclic motions that do not result in dissipation, and therefore do not drive luminosity fluctuations. The other part of this contrast is due to the inward decrease of the <b>characteristic</b> <b>inflow</b> time, which leads to decreasing radial coherence length with increasing fluctuation frequency.
