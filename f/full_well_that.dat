25|$|People who {{consent to}} a search, knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> they possess contraband, {{generally}} consent {{because they are}} ignorant {{of the fact that}} they have the right to decline permission to search. Under the laws of most U.S. states, police are not required to disclose to suspects that they have the right to decline a search. Even when a suspect does not give permission to search, police are often known to state in arrest affidavits and even provide sworn testimony that the suspect consented to the search, secure in the knowledge that a judge will normally weigh all questions of credibility in favour of law enforcement and against the accused.|$|E

[...] Beacham, {{a mother of two}} infant children, agreed to appear in the film to support her family: [...] "I had to choose between a play that I really, really wanted to do, which would have paid me £65 a week, and this script for a film called Inseminoid.

500|$|Although Sitting Bull did {{not attack}} Custer's {{expedition}} in 1874, the US government was increasingly pressured by citizens {{to open the}} Black Hills to mining and settlement. Failing {{in an attempt to}} negotiate a purchase or lease of the Hills, the government in Washington {{had to find a way}} around the promise to protect the Sioux in their land, as specified in the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. It was alarmed at reports of Sioux depredations (encouraged by Sitting Bull). In November 1875, President Grant ordered all Sioux bands outside the Great Sioux Reservation to move onto the reservation, knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> not all would comply. As of February 1, 1876, the Interior Department certified as [...] "hostile" [...] those bands who continued to live off the reservation. This certification allowed the military to pursue Sitting Bull and other Lakota bands as [...] "hostiles".|$|E
500|$|In 1871, Clayton {{was accused}} of {{deliberately}} tampering {{with the results of}} the U.S. house election between Thomas Boles and John Edwards in the third congressional district. According to Arkansas law, the results were to be certified and given to the secretary of state, then Robert J.T. White. After that, the governor and secretary of state would [...] "take up and arrange" [...] the results and the governor would issue a proclamation declaring the winner and deliver the seal of the state to him. Clayton {{was accused of}} adding around a hundred votes to the final count for Edwards, and declaring him the winner. Boles successfully contested the election and Clayton was indicted by the federal Circuit Court. Although the court found that Clayton did in fact falsify his proclamation and delivered the seal to Edwards knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> he had not won, this was not illegal. His actions were in no way binding to the Congress and under federal law of the time, state governors were not considered election officials. Boles became a congressman.|$|E
500|$|In January 2000, {{three months}} after the system's North American launch, Electronic Gaming Monthly offered praise for the game library, stating, [...] "...with triple-A stuff like Soul Calibur, NBA 2K, and soon Crazy Taxi to kick around, we figure you're happy you took the 128-bit plunge." [...] In a retrospective, PC Magazines Jeffrey L. Wilson {{referred}} to Dreamcast's [...] "killer library" [...] and emphasized Sega's creative influence and visual innovation as being at its peak during the lifetime of the system. The staff of Edge agreed with this assessment on Dreamcast's original titles, as well as Sega's arcade conversions, stating that the system [...] "delivered the first games that could meaningfully be described as arcade perfect." [...] GamePro writer Blake Snow referred to the library as being [...] "much celebrated". Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer praised Dreamcast's NAOMI arcade ports, opining [...] "The thrill of playing Crazy Taxi in the arcade knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> a pixel-perfect conversion (and not some cut-down port) was set to arrive on the Dreamcast is an experience gamers are unlikely to witness again." [...] Nick Montfort and Mia Consalvo, writing in Loading... The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association, argued that [...] "the Dreamcast hosted a remarkable amount of videogame development that went beyond the odd and unusual and is interesting when considered as avant-garde... {{it is hard to imagine}} a commercial console game expressing strong resistance to the commodity perspective and to the view that game production is commerce. But even when it comes to resisting commercialization, it is arguable that Dreamcast games came closer to expressing this attitude than any other console games have." [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish favorably compared Sega's Dreamcast output, which included some of [...] "the most varied, creative, and fun [...] the company had ever produced", with its [...] "enervated" [...] status as a third-party. Fahs noted [...] "The Dreamcast's life was fleeting, but it was saturated with memorable titles, most of which were completely new properties." [...] According to author Steven L. Kent, [...] "From Sonic Adventure and Shenmue to Space Channel 5 and Seaman, Dreamcast delivered and delivered and delivered." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} after the bombing, INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey {{said that the}} Droppin Well's owner had been warned six times to stop offering [...] "entertainment" [...] to British soldiers. McGlinchey added that the owner, and those who socialised with the soldiers, [...] "knew <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> the warnings had been given and that the place {{was going to be}} bombed at some stage". It later emerged that the INLA may also have targeted Ballykelly because it believed that the military base was part of NATO's radar and communications network.|$|E
2500|$|Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, {{not knowing}} {{what else to do}} with such an unusual and {{unexpected}} [...] "army", quickly ferried all 30,000 [...] across the Bosporus by 6 August. It has since been debated whether he sent them away without Byzantine guides knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> they could be slaughtered by the Turks, or whether they insisted on continuing into Asia Minor despite his warnings. In any case, it is known that Alexius warned Peter not to engage the Turks, whom he believed to be superior to Peter's motley army, and to wait for the main body of crusaders, which was still on the way.|$|E

2500|$|Scientology {{spokesman}} Gerard Ryan {{spoke with}} Irish Mail on Sunday {{prior to the}} book's publication, and commented on the claims made in the book: [...] "It's absolute baloney.

[...] Ryan said he thought Duignan was [...] "associating with fundamentalist Christians and he knows <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> these claims are not true".

2500|$|New York Times {{columnist}} Joe Nocera continued this argument. He {{also took}} issue with how the book was promoted by the 'Murdoch Empire' as a [...] "newly discovered" [...] novel, attesting that {{the other people in}} the Sothebys meeting insisted that Lee's attorney was present in 2011, when Lee's former agent (who was subsequently fired) and the Sotheby's specialist found the manuscript. They said she knew <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> it was the same one submitted to Tay Hohoff in the 1950s that was reworked into Mockingbird, and that Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter had been sitting on the discovery, waiting for the moment when she, and not Alice, would be in charge of Harper Lee's affairs.|$|E
2500|$|Trump {{called the}} book [...] "terribly written" [...] and said, [...] "Rather than sitting back and letting false {{statements}} be published without challenge, I {{believe it is}} important to expose irresponsible, malicious and false reporting. The writer and publisher of this book knew <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> their statements were false and malicious, but in hopes of generating book sales, they did not care. In so doing, they exposed themselves to this lawsuit." [...] Trump's attorneys stated: [...] "The obvious purpose of that malicious scheme and those vile statements is to embarrass Trump, to damage him in his business and professional dealings and to create publicity in order to increase sales of O'Brien's newly released book." [...] Trump's attorneys also alleged that O'Brien spent a three-hour visit at Trump's office attempting to pressure one of Trump's lawyers into going on a date with him, rather than researching Trump's finances.|$|E

2500|$|The Archbishop of Munster, August von Galen, had {{rallied to}} the {{nationalist}} cause at {{the outbreak of}} war in 1939, but by 1941, his leadership of Catholic opposition to Nazi euthanasia had led to [...] "the strongest, most explicit and most widespread protest movement against any policy {{since the beginning of}} the Third Reich." [...] The speeches angered Hitler. In a 1942 Table Talk he said: [...] "The fact that I remain silent in public over Church affairs is not in the least misunderstood by the sly foxes of the Catholic Church, and I am quite sure that a man like Bishop von Galen knows <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> after the war I shall extract retribution to the last farthing". Hitler wanted to have Galen removed, but Goebbels told him this would result in the loss of the loyalty of Westphalia. The regional Nazi leader, and Hitler's deputy Martin Bormann called for Galen to be hanged, but Hitler and Goebbels urged a delay in retribution till war's end.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to {{criticism}} of Keck's {{involvement in the}} campaign, Brownback spokesman Paul Milburn commented that it was legal to use taxpayer-paid staff to campaign, responding directly [...] to the controversy, saying, [...] "Paul Davis must have {{spent too much time}} in VIP rooms at strip clubs back in law school...", because he [...] "... should know <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> the law allows personal staff of the governor’s office to work on campaign issues." [...] In Kansas, however, getting records about crimes that law enforcement has investigated is typically difficult. The Legislature closed those records to the public over three decades earlier: If members of the public desire incident reports and investigative files, they normally have to sue to obtain them, cases sometimes costing $25,000 or more. Media law experts were amazed after learning Montgomery County's sheriff released non-public investigative files from 1998 with just a records request. “That is unusual,” said Mike Merriam, media lawyer for the Kansas Press Association. “They have denied releasing records routinely {{over and over and over}} again.” Brownback's campaign capitalized on the 16-year-old incident.|$|E
2500|$|Sites such as Facebook are {{becoming}} increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is {{being used as a}} tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing <b>full</b> <b>well</b> <b>that</b> their significant other will see it shortly. The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, {{especially when it comes to}} breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed [...] "single" [...] relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.|$|E

But Burley did not inform Morton of a fact which he himself knew <b>full</b> <b>well,</b> namely, <b>that</b> most of these provisions never reached the garrison, owing to the rapacity of the dragoons sent to collect them, who readily sold to one man what they took from another, and abused the Major's press for stores, pretty much as Sir John Falstaff did that of the King for men.|$|R
