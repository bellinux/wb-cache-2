They provide useful information {{for a better}} understanding of evaporation and transpiration processes as well as water vapour transport within soils. To better evaluate those potentialities and to identify possible lack of knowledge, a coupled heat, water and stable <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> model, called SiSPAT-Isotope was developed for bare soil. This paper presents the theoretical basis of the model, revisiting existing formulations encountered in the literature. An emphasis was put on the formulation of the kinetic fractionation factor, conditioning the resistance to <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> between the soil surface and the atmosphere, for which no agreement exists in the literature. The paper also presents first validation tests, showing the consistency of the model by comparison with existing analytical solutions. Sensitivity tests showed that the isotope concentration was very sensitive to the formulation of the resistance to <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> between the soil surface and the atmosphere, especially under saturated soil conditions. Only a comparison with existing data sets and further laboratory and field experiments, can help decide which formulation has to be used and in which conditions.

40|$|The present work {{intend to}} be a first step towards the {{understanding}} and quantification of the hydrogen isotope complex phenomena in liquid metals for nuclear technology. Liquid metals under nuclear irradiation in,e. g., breeding blankets of a nuclear fusion reactor would generate tritium {{which is to be}} extracted and recirculated as fuel. At the same time that tritium is bred, helium is also generated and may precipitate in the form of nano bubbles. Other liquid metal systems of a nuclear reactor involve hydrogen isotope absorption processes, e. g., tritium extraction system. Hence, hydrogen isotope absorption into gas bubbles modelling and control may have a capital importance regarding design, operation and safety. Here general models for hydrogen isotopes transport in liquid metal and absorption into gas phase, that do not depend on the mass transfer limiting regime, are exposed and implemented in OpenFOAMR CFD tool for 0 D to 3 D simulations. Results for a 0 D case show the impact of a He dispersed phase of nano bubbles on hydrogen isotopes inventory at different temperatures as well as the inventory evolution during a He nucleation event. In addition, 1 D and 2 D axisymmetric cases are exposed showing the effect of a He dispersed gas phase on hydrogen isotope permeation through a lithium lead eutectic alloy and the effect of vortical structures on hydrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> at a backward facing step. Exposed results give a valuable insight on current nuclear technology regarding the importance of controlling hydrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> and its interactions with nucleation event through gas absorption processes.

In both sets of animals, the profiles were in agreement with those expected for <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> by diffusion. This agreement indicates that fluid "pumping" during movement has an insignificant effect on transport of nutrients into the disc. Small solutes, e. g., O 2, glucose, and sulphate, are transported into the disc chiefly by diffusion.

40|$|Natural {{processes}} {{driven by}} heat flow {{can be understood}} using quantitative reconstruction of the thermal history of accessory and common minerals that were formed or modified in these processes. Thermochronology assumes that isotopes are lost from minerals by thermally-activated volume diffusion, and forms the basis of many studies of the thermal evolution of the crust. However, some studies challenge this assumption and suggest that the mechanisms controlling <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> in minerals over geological time-scales are dominated by aqueous fluid flow within mineral pathways. Here, we test these contrasting hypotheses by inverse modelling apatite uranium–lead (U–Pb) dates to produce theoretical t–T solutions assuming Pb was lost by volume diffusion. These solutions are compared with independent geological constraints and intra-grain apatite U–Pb dates, which demonstrate that volume diffusion governed the displacement of Pb. This confirmation, combined with an inverse-modeling procedure that permits reheating and cooling paths to be distinguished between ∼ 375 and 570 °C, provides geologists with a unique tool for investigating the high-temperature thermal evolution of accessory minerals using the U–Pb method...|$|E
40|$|International audienceStable water {{isotopes}} are tracers {{of water}} movement within the soil–vegetation–atmosphere system. They {{have the potential}} for a better understanding of water vapour transport within soils, evaporation and transpiration processes. To better understand those potentialities and possible lack of knowledge, a coupled heat-water and stable <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> model, called SiSPATIsotope was developed for bare soil. We presented the theoretical basis of the model {{in the first part of}} the paper, including a first validation of the likelihood of model results and a comparison with existing analytical solutions. In this companion paper, we go a step further by comparing the model results with two data sets collected on laboratory columns. In both cases, five soil columns were saturated and let drying during 173 and 253 days, respectively. At selected dates, one of the column was cut into slices and analysed to determine the volumetric water content, the deuterium and oxygen 18 concentrations profiles. The first data set was acquired on disturbed soil columns. The second one was collected on non-disturbed soil columns and it included a complete monitoring of atmospheric variables. It was not the case for the first one and a sensitivity analysis of model results to the air humidity was performed, showing its large influence on surface isotope concentrations. For both data sets, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to the formulation of the kinetic fractionation factor, conditioning the resistance to <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> between the soil surface and the atmosphere, and to the value of soil tortuosity. The results showed that the model was able to reproduce the behaviour of the observed concentration profiles. A fair agreement between measured and calculated values was obtained for all profiles for the disturbed soil. Near surface concentrations were in general overestimated for the undisturbed soil, raising the question of possible influence of immobile water on concentrations values. We showed that soil tortuosity was mostly influential on the depth of the peak isotope concentration, which opens perspectives for its retrieval from the measurement of isotope concentration profiles. When only molecular diffusion was considered, the model was not able to reproduce the liquid slopes of the deuterium/oxygen 18 relationships at the beginning of the drying process. Results were more in agreement with the data when molecular diffusion combined with turbulent transfer were considered. Further laboratory and field experiments are, however, still required to derive a formulation of the kinetic fractionation factor adapted to drying soils and non-saturated conditions...|$|E

In the discussed scheme the nuclear reactor is used as an intensive neutron source for (n,g) -activation. The created 8 Li <b>isotopes</b> are <b>transported</b> in the channels with a high speed to the remote neutrino detector and removed back for the next activation. The antineutrino source operates in the continuous cycle in the closed loop. Use of 8 Li hard antineutrino spectrum in the source scheme ensures significantly harder total antineutrino spectrum (compare to the reactor one) {{in the position of}} the detector. The analyses of errors of the total antineutrino spectrum (from reactor antineutrinos plus from lithium ones) confirmed that owing to the lithium the errors of the total antineutrino spectrum can be diminished in two times and more.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of Ar release from K-feldspar samples in laboratory experiments and during their geological history are assessed here. Modern petrology clearly {{established that the}} chemical and isotopic record of minerals is normally dominated by aqueous recrystallization. The laboratory critique is trickier, which explains why so many conflicting approaches {{have been able to}} survive long past their expiration date. Current models are evaluated for self-consistency; especially Arrhenian non-linearity leads to paradoxes. The models’ testable geological predictions suggest that temperature-based downslope extrapolations often overestimate observed geological Ar mobility substantially. An updated interpretation is based on the unrelatedness of geological behaviour to laboratory experiments. The isotopic record of K-feldspar in geological samples is not a unique function of temperature, as recrystallisation promoted by aqueous fluids is the predominant mechanism controlling <b>isotope</b> <b>transport.</b> K-feldspar should therefore be viewed as a hygrochronometer. Laboratory degassing proceeds from structural rearrangements and phase transitions such as are observed in situ at high temperature in Na and Pb feldspars. These effects violate the mathematics of an inert Fick’s Law matrix and preclude downslope extrapolation. The similar upward-concave, non-linear shapes of Arrhenius trajectories of many silicates, hydrous and anhydrous, are likely common manifestations of structural rearrangements in silicate structures...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{particles}} for U <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> {{was investigated in}} the Kalix River watershed, a particle-poor, Fe/Mn-rich river in northern Sweden, and in the Baltic Sea estuary. Particles > 0. 45 μm are strongly enriched in U and contain 20 - 50 % of the total riverine uranium budget and < 1 % of the total U in brackish waters (3 - 7 PSU). The particles have high δ 234 U which is close to that of dissolved U in the associated water, indicating that U on particles is dominantly nondetrital and isotopically exchanges rapidly with the ambient dissolved U. Particles at the river mouth are dominated by nondetrital Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides. Uranium and Fe are strongly correlated, clearly demonstrating that secondary Fe-oxyhydroxide is the major carrier of U in river water. There is no evidence for significant association of U with Mn-oxyhydroxide. Apparent U distribution coefficients (K̂Fed) were calculated for U between the authigenic Fe on particles and the solution. These values appear to be relatively constant throughout the year. This suggests an equilibrium between Fe in solution and authigenic Fe-oxyhydroxides on detrital particles. High values of K̂Fed calculated for one summer as well as high U concentrations in brackish waters {{can be explained by}} U scavenging by biogenic phases with low authigenic Fe content.

The lack of knowledge is even larger when referring to the partition of evapotranspiration between its components: bare soil evaporation and plant transpiration. Isotopic biogeochemistry can provide useful information to progress in a better quantification of this partition. Assuming specific hypotheses of stationarity, it is possible to identify and quantify the different sources of the atmospheric water vapour (local and regional, vegetation and soil) Analysis of the heavy stable isotopic ratios of water in both the liquid and vapour phases : 18 O and 2 H can allow to determine the « history » of the water in the soil since the last rainfall event (infiltration, re-evaporation) or the root extraction depths.. The presentation will provide a synthesis of the theoretical basis for the interpretation of the isotopic composition of the various reservoir water (soil, plant, atmosphere) and an illustration of recent advances obtained within the framework of the PIETE (Isotopic partition of evapotranspiration between evaporation and transpiration) project. The project combines laboratory and field experiments with a modelling work in order to progress in the understanding of the coupled water, heat and isotopic transfer within the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum. Four types of experiments were conducted : (i) Laboratory Characterization of the water vapour released during plants transpiration, focusing on transient regimes and especially water stress; (ii) laboratory characterization of the isotopic signature of the water vapour released by soil evaporation; (iii) determination of the partition between evaporation and transpiration under controlled conditions using a soil monolith which was sawn with grass.; (iv) determination of the partition of evapotranspiration under field conditions, with an experiment conducted in Lusignan (France) during the whole growing cycle of a maize field in 2004. The experiments were complemented with a modelling of the experimental conditions using the SiSPAT_Isotope SVAT model (Braud et al., J. Hydrology, 2005) which couples water, heat and <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> within the soil vegetation atmosphere continuum. The modelling of the bare soil columns allowed some progress in the understanding of evaporation under dry conditions, and especially about the formation and evolution of the evaporation front. Isotope measures were also useful to better quantify the hydrodynamic behaviour of the soil. The modelling of the field and laboratory experiments with vegetation was more complicated and required simplifying hypotheses about <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> within the plants. Data and model were used to determine the conditions when these hypotheses can be considered as valid. All the conducted experiments allowed some progress in the understanding of the partition of evapotranspiration between bare soil evaporation and plant transpiration. They open perspectives for the improvement of root extraction modules and showed that isotopic data were providing additional information for a better understanding of surface processes, but also to evaluate existing SVAT models...|$|E

For this reason, the calculation of the distribution of components inside the rotor of a centrifuge is a topical problem. In general, the separation factor of a binary mixture with arbitrary mass of the components in a single gas centrifuge can be calculated using the equations of motion of a continuous medium and diffusion.

We used a laboratory kinetic cell technique to quantify isotope fractionation due to respiration and a numerical model to quantify both consumptive and diffusive fractionation of O 2 isotopes at a field site comprised of unsaturated lacustrine sandy materials. The combined use of laboratory-based kinetic cell experiments and field-based <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> modeling provided an effective tool to characterize microbial respiration in unsaturated media.

At the field site, the modeled depth profiles for O 2 and δ 18 O matched the measured in situ data and confirmed that the consumption of O 2 was via the alternative respiration pathway. If the cyanide-resistant respiration pathway is indeed widespread in soils, its high oxygen isotope enrichment factor could help to explain the discrepancy between the predicted present-day Dole effect (+ 20. 8 ‰) and the observed Dole effect (+ 23. 5 ‰).

40|$|Plant root {{water uptake}} (RWU) and release (i. e., {{hydraulic}} redistribution – HR, and its particular case hydraulic lift – HL) {{have been documented}} {{for the past five}} decades from water stable isotopic analysis. By comparing the (hydrogen or oxygen) stable isotopic composition of plant xylem water to those of potential contributive water sources (e. g., water from different soil layers, groundwater, water from recent precipitation or from a nearby stream) authors could determine the relative contributions of these water sources to RWU. Other authors have confirmed the existence of HR and HL from the isotopic analysis of the plant xylem water following a labelling pulse. In this paper, the different methods used for locating / quantifying relative contributions of water sources to RWU (i. e., graphical inference, statistical (e. g., Bayesian) multi-source linear mixing models) are reviewed with emphasis on their respective advantages and drawbacks. The graphical and statistical methods are tested against a physically based analytical RWU model during a series of virtual experiments differing in the depth of the groundwater table, the soil surface water status, and the plant transpiration rate value. The benchmarking of these methods illustrates the limitations of the graphical and statistical methods (e. g., their inability to locate or quantify HR) while it underlines the performance of one Bayesian mixing model, but only when the number of considered water sources in the soil is the highest to closely reflect the vertical distribution of the soil water isotopic composition. The simplest two end-member mixing model is also successfully tested when all possible sources in the soil can be identified to define the two end-members and compute their isotopic compositions. Finally, future challenges in studying RWU with stable isotopic analysis are evocated with focus on new isotopic monitoring methods and sampling strategies, and on the implementation of <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> in physically based RWU models...|$|E

The power of the model to quantify degradation is illustrated for situations where mixed sources degrade and for situations where daughter products are removed by oxidative processes.

40|$|University of Minnesota. Ph. D. dissertation. July 2012. Major: Geology. Advisors: Christian Teyssier, Donna L. Whitney. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 263 pages, appendices 1 - 5. The Raft River-Grouse Creek-Albion metamorphic core complex (NW Utah) {{is bound to}} the east by the Miocene Raft River detachment shear zone that is localized in a 100 m thick quartzite mylonite. By performing combined structural, microstructural, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology, and oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope geochemistry of the well-exposed quartzite mylonite, we are provided with insight on the thermomechanical evolution of the continental crust during extension associated with the exhumation of metamorphic core complex. Microstructural, electron backscattered diffraction, strain, and vorticity results show an increase in intensity of the rock fabrics from west to east, along the transport direction, compatible with observed finite strain markers (Compton, 1980; Wells, 2001; Sullivan 2008). The results fit in a model of "necking" of the shear zone proposed by Wells (2001) and Sullivan (2008). Microstructural evidences (quartz microstructures and deformation lamellae) suggest that the detachment shear zone evolved at its peak strength, close to the dislocation creep/exponential creep transition, where meteoric fluids {{played an important role}} on strain hardening, embrittlement and eventually seismic failure. Two empirically calibrated paleopiezometers, the quartz recrystallized grain size paleopiezometer of Hirth et al. (2001), and a deformation lamellae spacing based paleopeizometer of Koch and Christie (1981), show very similar results, indicating that the shear zone in question developed under stress ranging from 40 MPa to 60 MPa. Application of a quartzite dislocation creep flow law (Hirth et al., 2001) reveals that the detachment shear zone quartzite mylonite developed at a strain rate between 10 E- 12 and 10 E- 14 s- 1. We suggest that compressed geothermal gradient (Gottardi et al., 2011), produced by a combination of ductile shearing, heat advection and enhanced cooling by meteoric fluids, can trigger significant mechanical instabilities, and strongly influences the rheology of the detachment shear zone. Combined geochronological and stable isotope data of quartz/muscovite pairs from the quartzite mylonite reveal that ductile deformation, and infiltration of meteoric fluids in the detachment shear zone, occurred between 26 and 20 Ma. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar release spectra are complex, but plateau ages decrease systematically from 31. 1 +/- 0. 8 Ma at the top to 20. 2 +/- 0. 6 Ma {{at the bottom of the}} quartzite mylonite. Throughout the studied area, hydrogen stable isotope values of syn-kinematic muscovite are low, ranging from - 123 permil to 88 permil suggesting that meteoric fluids were infiltrating the detachment shear zone over the time scale of mylonite formation. Hydrogen stable isotope analyses from both muscovite and fluid inclusions show that the fluid infiltrating the detachment shear zone was meteoric in origin, with a low D/H and low 18 O/ 16 O composition. Quartz and muscovite oxygen isotope analyses show different degree of oxygen isotope depletion, suggesting different time-integrated interaction of the minerals with meteoric fluid; these fluids would be channelized in preferential layers, or shear zones, within the deforming system. The variability in oxygen stable isotope of both quartz and muscovite can be explained by variations in permeability in the basement units (confined versus diffuse flow), and strain variations along the transport direction of detachment shear zone (from flattening to constriction), resulting in different fluid-rock exchange patterns. Based on our geochemical analyses and other published data, we conduct continuum - scale (i. e., large-scale, partial-bounceback) lattice-Boltzman fluid, heat, and oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>transport</b> simulations of an idealized cross-section of a metamorphic core complex. The simulations investigate the effects of crustal and fault permeability and buoyancy driven flow on two-way coupled fluid and heat transfer and resultant exchange of oxygen isotopes between fluid and rock. The results show that fluid migration to mid- to lower-crustal levels has to be fault controlled and depends primarily on the permeability contrast between the fault zone and the crustal rock. High fault/crust permeability contrasts lead to channelized flow in the fault and shear zones, while lower contrasts allow leakage of the fluids from the fault into the crust. Channelized fluid flow in the shear zone leads to strong vertical and horizontal thermal gradients, comparable to field observations. The oxygen isotope results show profound oxygen depletion (starting value of &delta 18 O = + 13 permil down to 4 permil concentrated along the faults and shear zone, similar to field data...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the concentration of}} I- 129 in the water of 26 rivers covering most of the runoff from Sweden, {{with the aim of}} assessing current contamination levels, distribution patterns and potential sources in freshwater systems of northern Europe. The results show relatively high values (up to 1. 4 x 10 (9) atoms 1 (- 1)), steeply decreasing levels with increasing latitude and a positive correlation with Cl concentration and other chemical parameters. The I- 129 concentrations observed in south Sweden are probably the highest ever recorded in rivers without any direct discharge from a nuclear installation. The strong latitudinal dependence suggests a northward dilution and possibly depletion of the <b>isotope</b> and a <b>transport</b> from a source located to the south. The most plausible source of the I- 129 in the studied rivers is atmospheric fallout of I- 129 emitted either by atmospheric discharges from the nuclear reprocessing facilities at Sellafield (England) and La Hague (France) or by volatilization from seawater contaminated by the same sources. The question is now whether and at what rate the I- 129 concentration in Nordic watersheds will increase further if discharges from nuclear reprocessing continue. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{significance}} of radiohalos, particularly the 218 Po, 214 Po, and 210 Po radiohalos, have been debated for almost a century, perhaps largely because their geological distribution has been poorly understood. In this study samples from three granitic plutons were scanned under microscopes for radiohalos {{as part of a}} larger project to investigate the geological occurrence and global distribution of all types of radiohalos. These three granitic plutons were all demonstrated to have formed during the Flood, but all contained 210 Po, 214 Po, and 238 U radiohalos, usually with 210 Po>> 214 Po and 238 U; 218 Po radiohalos were rare, and 232 Th radiohalos were abundant in one granitic pluton. Thus neither the Po radiohalos nor the granitic rocks could have been formed by fiat creation. Instead, a model is proposed in which hydrothermal fluids separated 222 Rn and the Po isotopes from their parent 238 U in zircons and transported them very short distances along cleavage planes in the host, and adjacent, biotites until the 222 Rn decayed and the Po isotopes were chemically concentrated into radiocenters, there to subsequently produce the Po radiohalos. Furthermore, the very short half-lives of these <b>isotopes</b> require this <b>transport</b> process to be rapid (within days), and the observed fullyforme...|$|R

The AVDF is characterized by probing the plasma above the centre of the target racetrack along the magnetron cathode axis in an argon-helium (Ar-He) mixture. Quantitative absorption measurements corroborated by deposition on silicon substrates are used to calibrate the TD-LIF relative measurements. Density, flux, temperature, AVDF and the flux velocity distribution function are derived from fitting the TD-LIF signals with four Gaussians (thermalized atoms) and four (energetic atom) functions (Stepanova and Dew 2004 Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. B 215 357) taking into account the natural abundance and resonance wavelength shifts of the four main <b>isotopes.</b> Measurements show <b>transport</b> improvement for W atoms and an increase of the ratio of Ar ions to Ar neutrals with the increase of the percentage of He. All measurements are performed at 0. 4 Pa and 100 W. The mean velocity of energetic W atoms typically ranges from 1900 to 2200 m s(- 1). The densities of thermalized and energetic atoms are in the same order of magnitude (similar to 10 (9) cm(- 3)) and their corresponding fluxes are several tens of times higher for energetic atoms (similar to 10 (15) cm(- 2) s(- 1)) ...|$|R
40|$|A unique {{feature of}} the {{upcoming}} FAIR facility will be the availability of high energy, high intensity beams of ions and rare <b>isotopes.</b> Nevertheless, the <b>transport</b> of slow extracted beams in the HEBT sections demands for nonintercepting online detection of nA-beam currents. To this end an improved LTS SQUID based cryogenic current comparator (CCC) is presently developed in collaboration with FSU Jena and MPI-K Heidelberg [1]. Measurement Principle and Improvements The measurement principle of a CCC {{is based on the}} effect that for an ideal superconductor the magnetic flux is expelled from the bulk material through shielding currents on the materials surface. The magnetic field of a passing ion beam is measured by a superconducting toroid including a single winding pick-up coil with a ferromagnetic core. The coil signal is coupled into a DC SQUID and digitized [2]. In order to achieve a high current resolution in the nA-range both, the SQUID and the pick-up coil, have to be effectively shielded against external magnetic fields. A detailed investigation on noise contributions of the magnetic core material was carried out. The theoretical calculations have shown that, apart from a good attenuation of external fields, the CCC resolution strongly depends on the choice for the core material [3]. The use of a ferromagnetic core leads to a possible optimization for better noise performance (Is: measured current, In: noise current) using materials with a high µr, as I s B, L ∝...|$|R

Impurity confinement is studied showing an isotopic dependence of impurity confinement time, asymmetries in parallel impurity flows in TJ-II ion-root plasmas and impurity density asymmetries within a flux surface. In addition, first observations of electrostatic potential variations within the same magnetic flux surface {{are presented}}. Evidence {{of the impact of}} three-dimensional magnetic structures on plasma confinement and L-H transitions is also presented. The leading role of the plasma turbulence is emphasized by the observed temporal ordering of the limit cycle oscillations at the L-I-H transition. Comparative studies between tokamaks and stellarators have provided direct experimental evidence for the importance of multi-scale physics to unravel the impact of the <b>isotope</b> effect on <b>transport.</b> Novel solutions for plasma facing components based on the recently installed Li-liquid limiters (LLLs) have been developed on TJ-II, showing the self-screening effect of evaporating liquid lithium, protecting plasma-facing components against heat loads, and tritium inventory control. Regarding plasma stability, magnetic well scan experiments show that traditional stability criteria, on which the optimization of stellarator configurations is based, may miss some stabilization mechanisms. Further effects of ECRH on Alfvénic instabilities are investigated, showing that moderate off-axis ECH power deposition modifies the continuous nature of the Alfvén eigenmodes, and frequency chirping sets in. This result shows that ECH can be a tool for AE control that might be ITER and reactor-relevant. © 2015 EURATOM...|$|R
40|$|Variations in barium (Ba) {{stable isotope}} abundances {{measured}} in {{low and high}} temperature environments have recently received increasing attention. The actual processes controlling Ba isotope fractionation, however, remain mostly elusive. In this study, we present the first experimental approach to quantify the contribution of diffusion and adsorption on mass- dependent Ba <b>isotope</b> fractionation during <b>transport</b> of aqueous Ba 2 + ions through a porous medium. Experiments {{have been carried out}} in which a BaCl 2 solution of known isotopic composition diffused through u-shaped glass tubes filled with silica hydrogel at 10 C and 25 C for up to 201 days. The diffused Ba was highly fractionated by up to - 2. 15 ‰ in d 137 / 134 Ba, despite the low relative difference in atomic mass. The time-dependent isotope fractionation can be successfully reproduced by a diffusive transport model accounting for mass-dependent differences in the effective diffusivities of the Ba isotope species (D 137 Ba/D 134 Ba = (m 134 /m 137) ^b). Values of b extracted from the transport model were in the range of 0. 010 – 0. 011. Independently conducted batch experiments revealed that adsorption of Ba onto the surface of silica hydrogel favoured the heavier Ba isotopes (a = 1. 00015 ± 0. 00008). The contribution of adsorption on the overall isotope fractionation in the diffusion experiments, however, was found to be small. Our results contribute to the understanding of Ba isotope fractionation pro- cesses, which is crucial for interpreting natural isotope variations and the assessment of Ba isotope ratios as geochemical proxies...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade the use of stable <b>isotopes</b> to {{investigate}} <b>transport</b> pathways of nutrients in aquatic ecosystems has contributed new understanding and knowledge to many aspects of ecology; from the trophic structure of food webs to the spatial extent of nutrient discharges. At the same time aquatic monitoring programs {{around the world have}} become more interested in quantifying ecosystem health rather than simply measuring the physical and chemical properties of water (nutrients, pH, temperature and turbidity). A novel technique was initiated in 1998 as part of the development of the Ecosystem Health Monitoring Program in S. E. Queensland Australia (EHMP) using changes in the 15 N value of the red macroalgae Catenella nipae, to indicate regions impacted by sewage nitrogen. Sewage plume mapping, using the 15 N of C. nipae, has demonstrated that over the past 5 years there has been a large reduction in the magnitude and spatial extent of 15 N enrichment at sites close to sewage treatment plants (STPs) discharging into Moreton Bay. This presentation will discuss how the 15 N signatures of the C. nipae in the plume {{at the mouth of the}} Brisbane River have declined since it was first sampled in 1998 and will evaluate causes that may be responsible for these variations. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate how environmental conditions influence the 15 N signature of C, nipae over the incubation period. These data will be used to discuss the observed in situ decline in 15 N in an attempt to determine if the reduction can be attributed solely to improvements in the wastewater discharge...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn operon {{encoding}} {{a member}} of the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) divalent metal ion transporters, homologous to Salmonella enterica SitABCD, has been identified in the avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strain chi 7122. The sitABCD genes were located on the virulence plasmid pAPEC- 1, and were highly similar at the nucleotide level to the chromosomally encoded sitABCD genes present in Shigella spp. A cloned copy of sitABCD conferred increased growth upon a siderophore-deficient E. coli strain grown in nutrient broth supplemented with the chelator 2, 2 '-dipyridyl. Ion rescue demonstrated that Sit-mediated growth promotion of this strain was due to the transport of iron. SitABCD mediated increased transport of both iron and manganese as demonstrated by uptake of 55 Fe, 59 Fe or 54 Mn in E. coli K- 12 strains deficient for the transport of iron (aroB feoB) and manganese (mntH) respectively. <b>Isotope</b> uptake and <b>transport</b> inhibition studies showed that in the iron transport deficient strain, SitABCD demonstrated a greater affinity for iron than for manganese, and SitABCD-mediated transport was higher for ferrous iron, whereas in the manganese transport deficient strain, SitABCD demonstrated greater affinity for manganese than for iron. Introduction of the APEC sitABCD genes into an E. coli K- 12 mntH mutant also conferred increased resistance to the bactericidal effects of hydrogen peroxide. APEC strain chi 7122 derivatives lacking either a functional SitABCD or a functional MntH transport system were as resistant to hydrogen peroxide as the wild-type strain, whereas a Deltasit DeltamntH double mutant was more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. Overall, the results demonstrate that in E. coli SitABCD represents a manganese and iron transporter that, in combination with other ion transport systems, may contribute to acquisition of iron and manganese, and resistance to oxidative stress...|$|R

While essential {{progress has been}} achieved in both measurements and modeling of the cosmogenic proxy, uncertainties still remain in {{the determination of the}} geomagnetic dipole moment evolution. Here we improve the reconstruction of solar activity over the past nine millennia using a multi-proxy approach. We used records of the 14 C and 10 Be cosmogenic isotopes, current numerical models of the <b>isotope</b> production and <b>transport</b> in Earth's atmosphere, and available geomagnetic field reconstructions, including a new reconstruction relying on an updated archeo-/paleointensity database. The obtained series were analyzed using the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) method to study the millennial-scale trends. A new reconstruction of the geomagnetic dipole field moment, GMAG. 9 k, is built for the last nine millennia. New reconstructions of solar activity covering the last nine millennia, quantified in sunspot numbers, are presented and analyzed. A conservative list of grand minima and maxima is provided. The primary components of the reconstructed solar activity, as determined using the SSA method, are different for the series based on 14 C and 10 Be. These primary components can only be ascribed to long-term changes in the terrestrial system and not to the Sun. They have been removed from the reconstructed series. In contrast, the secondary SSA components of the reconstructed solar activity are found to be dominated by a common ~ 2400 -yr quasi-periodicity, the so-called Hallstatt cycle, in both the 14 C and 10 Be based series. This Hallstatt cycle thus appears to be related to solar activity. Finally, we show that the grand minima and maxima occurred intermittently over the studied period, with clustering near highs and lows of the Hallstatt cycle, respectively.

40|$|The {{variation}} of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) transport along Lupinus albus L. hypocotyls was studied using decapitated seedlings and excised sections. To {{confirm that the}} mobile species was IAA and not IAA metabolites, dual isotope-labeled IAAs, [5 - 3 H]IAA + [1 - 14 C]IAA, were used. After apical application to decapitated seedlings, the longitudinal distribution of both <b>isotopes</b> at different <b>transport</b> periods showed that the velocity of IAA transport was higher in the apical, elongating region than in the basal, non-growing region. This variation in velocity was not a traumatic consequence of decapitation because after application of IAA to the basal region of decapitated seedlings, both the velocity and intensity of IAA transport were lower than in the apical treatment. The variation in IAA transport down the hypocotyl was confirmed when it was measured in excised sections located at different positions along the hypocotyl. The velocity and, to a greater extent, the intensity of IAA transport decreased from the apical to the basal sections. Consequently, if the amount of IAA reaching the apical zones of lupin hypocotyl were higher than the IAA transport capacity in the basal zones, accumulation of mobile IAA might be expected in zones located above the basal region. In fact, an IAA accumulation occurred in the elongating region during the first 4 -h period of transport after apical treatment with IAA. It is proposed that the fall in IAA transport along the hypocotyl might {{be responsible for the}} IAA distribution and, consequently, for the growth distribution reported in this organ. An indirect proof of this was obtained from experiments that showed that the excision of the slowly transporting basal zones strongly reduced the growth in the remaining part of the organ, whereas excision of the root caused no significant modification in growth during a 20 -h period...|$|R
40|$|The Amazon {{hydrological}} cycle has intensified since approximately 1990, and yet long-term meteorological {{data from the}} region are limited, {{making it difficult to}} determine the cause of current variability. Proxy records can be used to reconstruct past climate, thus providing useful historical context for recent changes. This thesis focuses on the climate insights that can be gained from oxygen isotopes in tree rings (δ 18 OTR). The consistency of annual ring formation was tested first, as this is an important prerequisite for constructing a well-dated proxy record. Cedrela trees were found to form annual rings across most of the species’ natural range, but biannual rings in Suriname (Chapter 3). Next, new δ 18 OTR records were developed from Cedrela and seven other tree species from northern Bolivia. δ 18 OTR signals were shown to correlate between different species, and between sites large distances apart (< 1000 km), indicating a large-scale environmental control on δ 18 OTR (Chapter 4). Following this, atmospheric back-trajectory modelling and basin-scale vapour transport analysis were used to confirm that rainout of heavy <b>isotopes</b> during moisture <b>transport</b> across the continent is the primary control on interannual δ 18 OTR signals in the western Amazon (Chapter 5). Finally, new Cedrela δ 18 OTR chronologies from Ecuador and Bolivia were developed. These records show an increase in δ 18 OTR from the early 1800 s until approximately 1950, indicating a change in hydrological functioning over this period, with a reversal in the trend over the last 1 – 2 decades. The increase is most likely driven by a reduction in the fraction of incoming water vapour that rains out over the Amazon, which could be caused by a reduction in precipitation, or an increase in the volume of imported vapour. Overall, these results provide evidence for long-term changes in Amazon hydrology over the past 200 years, and make an important contribution to the field of tropical dendroclimatology...|$|R
