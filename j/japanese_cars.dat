After years of steadily declining sales, the Oldsmobile Toronado was discontinued after 1992, the Lincoln Mark series after 1998, the Buick Riviera after 1999, and the Cadillac Eldorado after 2002.

Now it's {{the turn of}} the European Community to experience <b>Japanese</b> <b>car</b> transplantation. Jonathan Morris argues persuasively that this is a natural development of the trend to the internationalization of business. The implications are serious: overcapacity in the late 1990 s, and increasing Japanese market share at the expense of indigenous and US car producers. The author explains the reasons for these likely outcomes and also forecasts probable winners and losers of the intensified competition brought about by the <b>Japanese</b> <b>car</b> transplants. ...|$|R

Sales of the 2.5 TL began in spring 1995, but the 3.2 TL was delayed until fall because of a U.S.-Japan trade dispute. The U.S. government had threatened to impose 100% tariffs on higher-priced <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars</b> in response a growing U.S.-Japan trade deficit. Ultimately a deal was reached which avoided the tariffs.|$|E
25|$|Styling {{tended to}} mimic larger American cars. A {{very small number}} did {{make it to the}} United States. This {{generation}} of Bluebird {{became one of the first}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars</b> to be sold in significant numbers in Europe, after Finland fully opened its doors to automobile imports in mid-1962. 700 were brought in, and by the time the 410-series had arrived, Datsun had passed SAAB and Triumph in registrations. Although not very fast, the sturdy Datsun was well-suited to the rugged Finnish roads of the time.|$|E
25|$|The GT-EX {{replaced}} the discontinued GT-R with a turbocharged engine, the L20ET. As {{installed in the}} recently renewed Nissan Cedric/Gloria, this {{had been the first}} turbo engine to power a Japanese production vehicle. One notable aspect of the turbo versions was that they were not intercooled and there was no form of blowoff valve, only an emergency pressure release valve. As usual with <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars</b> of this period, there were four- or five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatic, with a column-shifted three-speed manual available on lower end cars and vans.|$|E

25|$|In late 2008, the Russian {{government}} introduced protectionist measures, worth $5billion, {{to improve}} {{the situation in the}} industry. This included $2billion of bailouts for troubled companies and $3billion of credits for buyers of Russian cars. Prime minister Vladimir Putin described the move as vital in order to save jobs. The tariffs for imported foreign cars and trucks were increased to a minimum of 50% and go up to 100%. The tariffs are linked to the engine size of the vehicle. The increased duties led to protests in Russian cities, most notably in Vladivostok, where the importation of <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars</b> is an important sector of the city's economy. To compensate for the losses of the Vladivostok businesses, Prime Minister Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It was planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Deming's {{teachings and}} {{philosophy}} are clearly illustrated {{by examining the}} results they produced after they were adopted by Japanese industry, as the following example shows. Ford Motor Company was simultaneously manufacturing a car model with transmissions made in Japan and the United States. Soon after the car model was on the market, Ford customers were requesting the model with Japanese transmission over the US-made transmission, and {{they were willing to}} wait for the Japanese model. As both transmissions were made to the same specifications, Ford engineers could not understand the customer preference for the model with Japanese transmission. Finally, Ford engineers decided to take apart the two different transmissions. The American-made car parts were all within specified tolerance levels. On the other hand, the Japanese car parts were virtually identical to each other, and much closer to the nominal values for the parts—e.g., if a part was supposed to be one foot long, plus or minus 1/8 of an inch—then the Japanese parts were all within 1/16 of an inch, less variation. This made the <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars</b> run more smoothly and customers experienced fewer problems.|$|E
25|$|The Series III {{continued}} {{this success}} in the early 1970s, but {{from the middle of}} the decade sales declined. A large coal export deal to Japan relied on the subsequent import of <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars</b> and other goods, a combination of this increasing competition and increasingly poor quality of the components being shipped from Britain meant that Land Rover's dominance slipped. A problem specific to Australia was the always-limited supply of new Land Rovers. Leyland's factory never had the capacity to meet possible demand and the need to import almost the entire vehicle in kit form from Britain restricted the supply and manufacturing process further. This led to a long waiting list developing for the Leyland product whilst commercial operators could receive large fleets of Japanese vehicles very quickly. The other problems faced by Land Rover were the same throughout its export markets- compared to the Japanese competition, the Land Rover was underpowered, unreliable and slow with a poor ride quality, despite their superior off-road ability. Poor rust-proofing and low-quality steel used in comparison to the Japanese vehicles turned the buyers away in large numbers and by 1983, with the introduction of the One Ten, the Toyota Land Cruiser became the best-selling 4×4 in Australia.|$|E

To begin with, the rear opening was a single unit, hinged at the top. The engine was the air-cooled 356cc LC10 two-cycle three-cylinder unit, here detuned to [...] for a top speed of 105km/h. The Van (and its subsequent siblings) has MacPherson struts in front and semi-elliptic leaf springs in rear. Unusually for <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars,</b> the spare wheel was mounted in the engine compartment - something more commonly seen in French cars - to help free up more space for luggage.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1986, Mitsubishi {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} appearance of its top-level flagship sedan Debonair, as its previous version was seen as extremely rare and not a sales leader or image maker of Mitsubishi vehicles. The all-new Debonair adopted a front-wheel drive format, a cost-effective way to increase interior space without investing money on engineering in an executive sedan. It also came with Mitsubishi's first V6 engines, the 6G71 2.0L and the 6G72 3.0L under the [...] "Cyclone" [...] moniker, which were shared with the Galant model line later. So as to comply with Japanese government regulations concerning exterior dimensions and engine displacement, vehicles installed with the 2.0 L engine were installed in a shorter and narrower car - accomplished simply by fitting smaller bumpers.

2500|$|The {{success of}} the Japanese {{automakers}} contributed to their American counterparts falling into a recession in the late 1970s. Unions and lobbyists in both North America and Europe put pressure on their government to restrict imports. In 1981, Japan agreed to Voluntary Export Restraints in order to preempt protectionism measures that the US may have taken, where it be tariffs or import quotas. Consequently, Japanese companies responded by investing heavily in US production facilities, as they were {{not subject to the}} VER. Unlike the plants of domestic automakers, Japanese plants are non-unionized (save for NUMMI), so they have lower wage expenses and do not face the risk of strikes. [...] The VER was lifted in 1994 upon agreement of all members of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). [...] Establishing US production facilities was also a significant step in improving public relations, along with philanthropy, lobbying efforts, and sharing technology. Europe has still largely maintained its protectionism policies against <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars,</b> though their varies considerably.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced in showrooms on 28 February 1975, the Pacer was {{designed}} to attract buyers of traditional large cars to a smaller package {{during a time when}} gasoline prices were projected to rise dramatically. In its first year of production, the Pacer sold well, with 145,528 units. [...] There was little competition from other American manufacturers, most of whom had been blindsided by the oil crisis. The increased demand for compact, economy vehicles was growing rapidly. However, Pacer sales fell after the first two years, though the car continued to be built through the 1980 model year. Similar to its mid-year introduction, on 3 December 1979, production of the Pacer ended at the Kenosha, Wisconsin assembly plant where it had begun five years earlier. A total of 280,000 cars were built. Increasing competition from the Big Three U.S. automakers and the rapid consumer shift to imported cars during the late 1970s are cited as the reasons for this outcome. Automobile buyers in the U.S. became adjusted to smaller and lighter cars, particularly the imports that offered better gas mileage presented, the AMC Pacer could not match the German and <b>Japanese</b> <b>cars.</b> Also the large glass areas increased the car's weight. With 22 miles per gallon the Pacer was unattractive for customers in the 1979 energy crisis. AMCs partnership with Renault brought the Renault 5 named [...] "Le Car" [...] to the AMC dealers. The design of the Pacer gave a little touch to the restyling of the Renault 5 to meet wishes and requirements of the American Market.|$|E
