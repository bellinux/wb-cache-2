5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|Nyuserre Ini (also Niuserre Ini or Neuserre Ini; in Greek {{known as}} Rathurês, ´Ραθούρης) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the sixth {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. He is {{credited}} with a reign of 24 to 35 years depending on the scholar, and likely lived {{in the second half}} of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre was the younger son of Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II, and the brother of the short-lived king Neferefre. He may have succeeded his brother directly, as indicated by much later historical sources. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have reigned between the two as advocated by Miroslav Verner, albeit only for a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months at the most. The relation of Shepseskare with Neferefre and Nyuserre remains highly uncertain. Nyuserre was in turn succeeded by Menkauhor Kaiu, who could have been his nephew and a son of Neferefre.|$|E

5|$|A Folding@home {{participant}} installs {{a client}} program {{on their personal}} computer. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the background at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home server and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to uniprocessor and multi-core processor systems, and graphics processing units. The diversity and power of each hardware architecture provides Folding@home {{with the ability to}} efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.|$|E
25|$|Data {{from the}} 1996 NSHAPC show that about 50% {{of people who}} were {{homeless}} were experiencing their first or second episode of homelessness, which typically lasted a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months to one year.|$|E
25|$|The account {{suggests}} that the siege lasted for a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> possibly some months. The rulers mentioned in the source confirm that the siege took place sometime between 255 and 257 AH (between 868 and 871 AD).|$|E

50|$|Cyanopsia is {{a medical}} term for seeing {{everything}} tinted with blue. It is {{also referred to as}} blue vision. Cyanopsia often occurs for a <b>few</b> days, <b>weeks,</b> <b>or</b> months after removal of a cataract from the eye. Cyanopsia also sometimes occurs as a side effect of taking sildenafil (Viagra), Cialis, or Levitra.|$|R

25|$|Therapies are {{sometimes}} classified {{according to their}} duration; {{a small number of}} sessions over a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months may be classed as brief therapy (or short-term therapy), others where regular sessions take place for years may be classed as long-term.|$|E
25|$|A {{performance}} of The17's SURROUND, originally {{planned to take}} place in Damascus, Syria, will take place in London on 18 March 2012. Drummond explains in his essay for Treuchet Magazine: 'it would best for all concerned if the Syrian leg of the tri-nation festival was postponed for a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> maybe months, when things would have undoubtedly settled down'.|$|E
25|$|A {{formerly}} popular treatment, {{phase delay}} chronotherapy, {{is intended to}} reset the circadian clock by manipulating bedtimes. It consists of going to bed two or more hours later each day for several days until the desired bedtime is reached, and it often must be repeated every <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months to maintain results. Its safety is uncertain, notably because {{it has led to}} the development of non-24-hour sleep-wake rhythm disorder, a much more severe disorder.|$|E
50|$|Intersession is a {{short break}} or mini-term between the traditional, {{standard}} academic terms.

25|$|Toxoplasmosis is a {{parasitic}} disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Infections with toxoplasmosis usually cause no obvious symptoms in adults. Occasionally {{there may be}} a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months of mild flu-like illness such as muscle aches and tender lymph nodes. In a small number of people, eye problems may develop. In those with a weak immune system, severe symptoms such as seizures and poor coordination may occur. If infected during pregnancy, a condition known as congenital toxoplasmosis may affect the child.|$|E
25|$|Thousands {{were killed}} during the conflict, and {{hundreds}} of thousands more fled from the province {{to other parts of the}} country and to the surrounding countries. Most of the Albanian refugees returned home within a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months. However, much of the non-Albanian population again fled to other parts of Serbia or to protected enclaves within Kosovo following the operation. Albanian guerrilla activity spread into other parts of Serbia and to neighbouring Republic of Macedonia, but subsided in 2001. The non-Albanian population has since diminished further following fresh outbreaks of inter-communal conflict and harassment.|$|E
25|$|When the war began, the 13 colonies {{lacked a}} {{professional}} army or navy. Each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually {{did not have}} uniforms. Their units served for only a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home and thus were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of Concord, Bennington and Saratoga, and the siege of Boston. Both sides used partisan warfare but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars {{were not in the}} area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{events are}} {{described}} in the Nevi'im and Ketuvim sections of the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible, {{also known as the}} Old Testament). The first deportation is the start of the Jewish Diaspora (or exile). (...) Nebuchadnezzar installed Jeconiah's uncle, Zedekiah as puppet-king of Judah, and Jeconiah was compelled to remain in Babylon. The start of Zedekiah's reign has been variously dated within a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> before, <b>or</b> after the start of Nisan 597 BC.|$|R
50|$|Volcanic dams {{generally}} occur worldwide, {{in association}} with former and active volcanic provinces, and {{are known to have}} existed in the geologic record, in historic times and occur in the present day. Their removal or failure is similarly recorded. The longevity, and extent varies widely, having periods ranging from a <b>few</b> days, <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> years to several hundred thousand years or more, and dimensions ranging from a few meters to hundreds, to several thousand.|$|R
50|$|Acute pain has {{an obvious}} cause and is {{expected}} only to last for a <b>few</b> days <b>or</b> <b>weeks.</b> It is usually managed with medication and then with non-pharmacological treats to provide comfort.|$|R
25|$|After {{the grapes}} destined for Vin Santo are {{harvested}} in September or October, they {{are laid out}} on straw mats, often under rafters or staircases. They are kept in warm, well ventilated rooms that allow the moisture in the grape to evaporate. This process of desiccation allows the sugars in the grape to be more concentrated. The longer the grapes are allowed to dry and desiccate, the higher the resulting residual sugar levels {{will be in the}} wine. Depending on the style of wine desired, the grapes may be crushed and the fermentation process started after a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> not till late March. Producers may use a starter culture of yeast known as a madre that includes a small amount of finished Vin Santo from previous years production. It is believed that this older wine can help jump start the fermentation process and also add complexity to the wine.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} process, {{triggered}} primarily by UVB, {{there is an}} increase in production of melanin (melanogenesis), which is the body's reaction to direct DNA photodamage (formation of pyrimidine dimers) from UV radiation. Melanogenesis leads to delayed tanning, and typically becomes visible two or three days after exposure. The tan that is created by increased melanogenesis typically lasts for a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months, much longer than the tan that is caused by oxidation of existing melanin, and is also actually protective against UV skin damage and sunburn, rather than simply cosmetic. Typically, it can provide a modest Sun Protection Factor (SPF) of 3, meaning that tanned skin would tolerate up to 3 times the UV exposure as pale skin. However, in order to cause true melanogenesis-tanning by means of UV exposure, some direct DNA photodamage must first be produced, and this requires UVB exposure (as present in natural sunlight, or sunlamps that produce UVB).|$|E
25|$|While in {{the process}} of {{adopting}} the itinerant lifestyle of a musician, Irvine developed a taste for travel, initially within Ireland. The first time he witnessed Willie Clancy playing his uilleann pipes was at a fleadh in Miltown Malbay in the summer of 1963, and he followed the festival trail in Ireland during the summers of 1964, 1965 and 1966. Irvine also returned regularly to London for short stays of a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months, and ventured further afield across Europe, hitch-hiking to Munich, Vienna and Rome in the autumn of 1965. In early 1966, he was playing the clubs in Denmark with Éamonn O'Doherty. In June 1966, Irvine and Dolan played five nights a week as a duo at the Enda Hotel in Galway and Moynihan would join them at weekends, since he was still working as a draughtsman in Roscommon. It was at this time that Dolan suggested the band's name, after reading Flann O'Brien's comic novel At Swim-Two-Birds, which depicts the mad, anti-religious, tree-leaping pagan King Sweeney of Antrim.|$|E
25|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting and defrosting of {{the southern}} ice cap results {{in the formation of}} spider-like radial channels carved on 1 meter thick ice by sunlight. Then, sublimed CO2 – and probably water – increase pressure in their interior producing geyser-like eruptions of cold fluids often mixed with dark basaltic sand or mud. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} <b>few</b> days, <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars.|$|R

50|$|Recommended feeding {{includes}} {{four to six}} live crickets every <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> Gut loading, <b>or</b> providing prey with vitamins and other nutrients, provides tarantulas with a healthy meal. Uneaten prey should be removed after one day. Fasting, or not eating, for days <b>or</b> <b>weeks</b> at a time is sometimes an indication of an upcoming moult. A water dish should be supplied and maintained, shallow enough for the tarantula to drink from.|$|R
500|$|An {{unfinished}} pyramid {{located in}} north Abusir, between the sun temple of Userkaf and the Pyramid of Sahure, {{is believed to}} belong to Shepseskare. The structure was discovered in 1980 by a Czechoslovakian archaeological team led by Miroslav Verner and {{seems to have been}} abandoned after no more than a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months of work. A square area of roughly [...] was leveled and the digging of a T-shaped ditch was just started in its center. This ditch was to be left open during the pyramid construction to allow for simultaneous works on the pyramid filling and its substructures. This construction technique is common to all pyramids of the Fifth Dynasty and can directly be seen {{in the case of the}} Pyramid of Neferefre, which was also left unfinished. This technique as well as the location of the unfinished pyramid in the royal necropolis of the Fifth Dynasty indicates that it belonged in all likeliness to Shepseskare, the pyramids of the other kings of the dynasty being already known. If finished according to the established pattern, the pyramid would have reached [...] high, similar to the Pyramid of Neferirkare.|$|E
2500|$|The {{goal is to}} {{regulate}} the pet's blood glucose using insulin and some probable diet and daily routine changes. The process may take a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> many months.

The commonly recommended dosing method is by [...] "starting low and going slow" [...] as indicated for people with diabetes.|$|E
2500|$|At an EU {{summit in}} December 2016, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Russia and Iran were {{responsible}} [...] "for crimes committed against the Syrian population" [...] by the Assad government {{and that these}} should not go unpunished.

50|$|If sawyer beetles infect freshly cut pine logs, {{they can}} cause a 30-40% loss in value due to the tunnels their larvae bore. It's {{important}} to process logs within a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> of cutting <b>or</b> store them in water to minimize damage. Some species are known to transport phoretic Bursaphelenchus nematodes, including B. xylophilus which causes pine wilt disease.|$|R
50|$|Correspondence chess {{allows people}} or clubs who are {{geographically}} distant {{to play one}} another without meeting in person. These distant relationships are {{just one of the}} many distinct appeals of correspondence chess. The length of a game played by correspondence can vary depending on the method used to transmit the moves: a game played via server or by email might last no more than a <b>few</b> days, <b>weeks,</b> <b>or</b> months, but a game played by post between players in different countries might last several years.|$|R
50|$|DMUs {{currently}} {{provide the}} backbone of Wyvern-rail services, though more recently {{there has been some}} steam and mainline diesel workings. The operational units based at EVR undergo regular maintenance; the type of work can range from mechanical servicing through to whole engine replacement, bodywork and repainting as well as the reconditioning of the interiors. The turnaround of each vehicle varies depending on the degree of work undertaken. This can be a <b>few</b> days, <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months but most are not usually withdrawn for lengthily periods.|$|R
