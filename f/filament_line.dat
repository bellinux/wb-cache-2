40|$|Using the {{unprecedented}} spectral {{resolution of the}} reflection grating spectrometer (RGS) onboard XMM-Newton, we reveal dynamics of X-ray [...] emitting ejecta in the oxygen-rich supernova remnant Puppis A. The RGS spectrum shows prominent K-shell lines, including O VII He_alpha forbidden and resonance, O VIII Ly_alpha, O VIII Ly_beta, and Ne IX He_alpha resonance, from an ejecta knot positionally coincident with an optical oxygen-rich filament (the so-called Omega filament in the northeast of the remnant). We find that the line centroids are blueshifted by 1480 +/- 140 +/- 60 km/s (the first and second term errors are measurement and calibration uncertainties, respectively), which is fully consistent {{with that of the}} optical Omega <b>filament.</b> <b>Line</b> broadening at 654 eV (corresponding to O VIII Ly_alpha) is obtained to be less than ~ 0. 9 eV, indicating an oxygen temperature of less than ~ 30 keV. Analysis of XMM-Newton MOS spectra shows an electron temperature of ~ 0. 8 keV and an ionization timescale of ~ 2 e 10 cm^- 3 s. We show that the oxygen and electron temperatures as well as the ionization timescale can be reconciled if the ejecta knot was heated by a collisionless shock whose velocity is ~ 600 - 1200 km/s and was subsequently equilibrated due to Coulomb interactions. The RGS spectrum also shows relatively weak K-shell lines of another ejecta feature located near the northeastern edge of the remnant, from which we measure redward Doppler velocities of 650 +/- 70 +/- 60 km/s.

Agardh, Pseudoscinaia Setchell and Pseudogloiophloea Levring – has shown that both Pseudogloiophloea and Pseudoscinaia lack features that warrant independent generic status. Scinaia, Gloiophloea and Pseudogloiophloea have been separated from one another solely on cortical differences. Scinaia produces a cortex composed of either a mixture of inflated utricles and smaller cells (Scinaia forcellata Bivona-Bernardi) or of inflated utricles only (all other present species). In contrast, the cortex of Gloiophloea completely lacks utricles. Pseudogloiophloea supposedly differs from Scinaia in that its cortex is composed of a mixture of inflated utricles and conspicuously smaller (often pigmented) cells. This kind of cortex, however, is essentially identical to that found in S. forcellata, the type of the genus Scinaia. Pseudoscinaia was separated from Scinaia because its cystocarp supposedly has gonimoblast <b>filaments</b> <b>lining</b> {{the walls of the}} cystocarp cavity, rather than projecting centrally into the cavity. A re-examination of the type specimen, however, has shown that the cystocarp is essentially identical to that of Scinaia.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, we give {{a study of}} the purely {{rotational}} motion of general stationary states in the two-dimensional local induction approximation (2 D-LIA) governing superfluid turbulence in the low-temperature limit [B. Svistunov, "Superfluid turbulence in the low-temperature limit," Phys. Rev. B 52, 3647 (1995) ]. Such results demonstrated that variety of stationary configurations are possible from vortex filaments exhibiting purely rotational motion in addition to commonly discussed configurations such as helical or planar states. However, the filaments (or, more properly, waves along these filaments) can also exhibit translational motion along the axis of orientation. In contrast to the study on vortex configurations for purely rotational stationary states, the present paper considers non-stationary states which exhibit a combination of rotation and translational motions. These solutions can essentially be described as waves or disturbances which ride along straight vortex <b>filament</b> <b>lines.</b> As expected from our previous work, {{there are a number of}} types of structures that can be obtained under the 2 D-LIA. We focus on non-stationary states, as stationary states exhibiting translation will essentially take the form of solutions studied in [R. A. Van Gorder, "General rotating quantum vortex filaments in the low-temperature Svistunov model of the local induction approximation," Phys. Fluids 26, 065105 (2014) ], with the difference being translation along the reference axis, so that qualitative appearance of the solution geometry will be the same (even if there are quantitative differences). We discuss a wide variety of general properties of these non-stationary solutions and derive cases in which they reduce to known stationary states. We obtain various routes to Kelvin waves along vortex filaments and demonstrate that if the phase and amplitude of a disturbance both propagate with the same wave speed, then Kelvin waves will result. We also consider the self-similar solutions to the model and demonstrate that these types of solutions can model vortex kinks that gradually smooth and radiate Kelvin waves as time increases. Such solutions qualitatively agree with what one might expect from post-reconnection events...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{structure}} of magnetic field lines in and around filaments in simulations of molecular clouds undergoing global, multi-scale gravitational collapse. In these simulations, filaments {{are not in a}} static equilibrium, but are long-lived flow structures that accrete gas from their environment and direct it toward clumps embedded in the filament or at the nodes at the conjunction with other filaments. In this context, the magnetic field is dragged by the collapsing gas, so its structure must reflect the flow that generates the filament. Around the filament, the gas is accreted onto it, and the magnetic lines must then be perpendicular to the filament. As the gas density increases, the gas flow changes direction, becoming almost parallel to the <b>filament,</b> and magnetic <b>lines</b> also tend to align with it. At the spine of the <b>filament,</b> however, magnetic <b>lines</b> become perpendicular again since they must connect to lines {{on the opposite side of}} the filament, resulting in "U"-shaped magnetic structures, which tend to be stretched by the longitudinal flow along the filament. Magnetic diffusive processes, however, allow the gas to continue to flow. Assuming a stationary state in which the ram pressure of the flow balances the magnetic tension, the curvature of the field lines is determined by the diffusion rate. We derive an expression relating the curvature of the field lines to the diffusive coefficient, which may be used to observationally determine the nature of the diffusive process.

Lamins are intermediate <b>filaments,</b> which <b>line</b> the inner membrane of nuclear envelope. Lamins maintain the nuclear shape and regulate gene expression through interactions with chromatin. Heterozygous mutations LMNA, which result in single amino acid substitutions within the C-terminal Ig-fold domain, were identified in patients with muscular dystrophy.

Using Nuclear Magentic Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dischroism (CD) we determined that the amino acid substitutions cause perturbations of the tertiary, but not secondary, structure of the Ig-fold. Microarray analysis of RNA isolated from muscle revealed that mutant lamins cause cause mis-regulation of genes involved oxidative stress and neuromuscular junction function.

All these cavities are roughly of ellipsoidal shapes and show a decrement in the surface brightness of several tens of percent.

The Hα emission <b>line</b> <b>filaments</b> are perpendicular to the X- ray cavities. Spectroscopic analysis of the hot gas in the filaments and cavities reveal that the X-ray filaments are cooler than the gas contained in the cavities. The emission line ratios and the extended, asymmetric nature of the Hα emission <b>line</b> <b>filaments</b> seen in this system require a harder ionizing source than that produced by star formation and/or young, massive stars.

LamC is nested within an intron of the essential gene ttv. We demonstrate that null mutations in LamC are lethal, and expression of a wild-type LamC transgene rescues lethality of LamC but not ttv mutants. Mutations in the human A-type lamin gene lead to diseases called laminopathies. To determine if Drosophila might serve as a useful model to study lamin biology and disease mechanisms, we generated transgenic flies expressing mutant LamC proteins modeled after human disease-causing lamins. These transgenic animals display a nuclear lamin aggregation phenotype remarkably similar to that observed when human mutant A-type lamins are expressed in mammalian cells. LamC aggregates also cause disorganization of lamin Dm 0, indicating interdependence of both lamin types for proper lamina assembly. Taken together, these data provide the first detailed genetic analysis of the LamC gene and support using Drosophila as a model to study the role of lamins in disease...|$|R

We have {{obtained}} deep spectra from 1640 to 10100 Å with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) of the Strontium Filament, a largely neutral emission nebulosity lying {{close to the}} very luminous star Eta Carinae and showing an uncommon spectrum. Over 600 emission lines, both permitted and forbidden, have been identified. The majority originates from neutral or singly-ionized iron group elements (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). Sr is the only neutron capture element detected. The presence of Sr II, numerous strong Tiii and Vii lines and the dominance of Fei over Feii are notable discoveries. While emission lines of hydrogen, helium, and nitrogen are associable with other spatial structures at other velocities within the Homunculus, no emission lines from these elements correspond to the spatial structure or velocity of the Sr Filament. Moreover, no identified Sr <b>Filament</b> emission <b>line</b> requires an ionization or excitation energy above approximately 8 eV.

Diseased branchial tissues had a large and diffusely distributed monomorphic population of filamentous bacteria which were strictly epicellular. Although bacterial colonization was restricted to the branchial cavity, it was neither site nor cell specific: epithelial and chloride cells of the lamellae, <b>filaments</b> and <b>lining</b> tissues of the branchial cavity were all uniformly affected. The bacteria possessed an extensive glycocalyx which appeared to facilitate adhesion to the apices of the microridged sub-unit modification of the cell surface. Sites of colonization were accompanied by a diffuse pattern of cellular degeneration and necrosis that was generally restricted to the outer layers of epithelium. The polarity and nature of these changes suggest that the mechanism of interaction between the bacteria and host cells includes progressive hydropic changes as a sequel to primary membrane damage and consequent increased cell permeability. These cellular changes were accompanied by the range of stereotypical responses of the gill to damage frequently reported for BGD including lamellar fusion, epithelial hyperplasia, and squamous and mucous cell metaplasia, in addition to lamellar spongiosis. ...|$|R
