25|$|During Laurel's {{tenure as}} President, hunger {{was the main}} worry. Prices of {{essential}} commodities rose to unprecedented heights. The government exerted every effort to increase production and bring consumers' goods under control. However, Japanese rapacity had the better of <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, guerrilla activities and Japanese retaliatory measures brought the peace and order situation to a difficult point. Resorting to district-zoning and domiciliary searches, coupled with arbitrary arrests, the Japanese made the mission of Laurel's administration incalculably exasperating and perilous.|$|E
25|$|Jacob Rosenzweig (September 1876 – October 4, 1947) was an American gambler and underworld {{figure in}} New York City. He {{was one of}} several star {{witnesses}} in the Becker-Rosenthal trial, among these being fellow gamblers Bridgie Webber, Harry Vallon, and Sam Schepps. Rose's testimony was the most damaging because he directly implicated Becker in arranging the murder of Herman Rosenthal. As Becker's debt collector, Rose confessed to hiring the Lenox Avenue Gang, providing the getaway car. He testified he did <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> orders of Charles Becker.|$|E

Noted for using synthesizers, electric pianos, samplers, and drum machines in his music, musician and frequent OutKast-collaborator Sleepy Brown contributed with production as a member of Organized Noize and with vocals to several tracks. Big Boi has {{said that he}} incorporated various musical elements to the album, with [...] "something from every genre, every funk, beat, loop, horn, whistle. We got <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record". He has described Sir Lucious Left Foot as [...] "a funk-filled extravaganza!

[...] "A Shortstop in China" [...] premiered on the Mid-Atlantic Sports Network on May 8, 2009, chronicling Ripken's trip to China to share the game of baseball with youth and coaches while nurturing American-Chinese diplomacy. The documentary included footage from the 11 clinics Cal and former Oriole B.J. Surhoff held from Beijing to Guangzhou. The documentary also showed Ripken accepting his appointment from Rice and featured a variety of interviews, from Ripken's wife Kelly to former Undersecretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs, Karen Hughes.|$|E
500|$|Contributing to psychedelia's {{emergence}} {{into the}} pop mainstream was {{the release of}} Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (May 1966) and the Beatles' Revolver (August 1966). Often {{considered one of the}} earliest albums in the canon of psychedelic rock, Pet Sounds contained many elements that would be incorporated into psychedelia, with its artful experiments, psychedelic lyrics based on emotional longings and self-doubts, elaborate sound effects and new sounds on both conventional and unconventional instruments. The album track [...] "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times" [...] contained the first use of theremin sounds on a rock record. Scholar Philip Auslander says that even though psychedelic music is not normally associated with the Beach Boys, the [...] "odd directions" [...] and experiments in Pet Sounds [...] "put <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> map. ... basically that sort of opened the door — not for groups to be formed or to start to make music, but certainly to become as visible as say Jefferson Airplane or somebody like that." [...] Like Pet Sounds, Revolver explored musical soundscapes that could not be replicated in concert, even with the addition of an orchestra. The Beatles' May 1966 B-side [...] "Rain", recorded during the Revolver sessions, was the first pop recording to include reversed sounds. It makes full use of an assortment of studio tricks such as varispeed and backwards taping, combining them with a droning melody that further highlights a growing interest in non-Western musical form. Author Simon Philo believes the song to be [...] "the birth of British psychedelic rock". [...] Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles' success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on Revolver, particularly on [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", as having [...] "opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Raynor was generally well received by critics and fans alike. Gaming's Edge described Raynor as an [...] "almost prototypical action movie figure" [...] with a [...] "healthy dose of arrogance" [...] who despite always {{attempting to do}} the morally right thing invariably ends up with [...] "the worst end of the deal" [...] due to circumstances beyond his control. The article also puts forward the case that [...] "it would be difficult not to admire Raynor, {{if for no other}} reason than his persistence" [...] in the face of abandonment, isolation and betrayal. In the review of StarCraft for the magazine GamePro, the reviewer stated that he felt that the portrayal of characters was so good that he felt they [...] "were actually talking to me" [...] and expressed that he began to feel an emotional attachment to the plights of Raynor, commenting [...] "When was the last time you could say that about a character in a strategy game?" [...] A reader's poll for GameSpot voted Raynor one of video gaming's top ten heroes, complimenting Raynor's character on his humanity, his resilience in the face of consistent loss, as well as his progression from backwater marshal to galactic hero. GameSpot also gave additional praise to the quality of Robert Clotworthy's voice acting. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 80th [...] "most memorable, influential, and badass" [...] protagonist in games, commenting: [...] "He embodies the concept of the greater good and is willing to put <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line to protect others. If you’re ever stuck in a sticky situation, whether it’s against a swarm of Zerg or a Protoss fleet, he’s the man you want to be fighting side by side with."

This, however, was due to his all-out style of play. Jimmy Keenan of the Society for American Baseball Research wrote, [...] "Infielder Billy Ripken attacked the game of baseball with reckless abandon and paid the price, sustaining an inordinate number of injuries during his career.

2500|$|After scoring 65 not {{out in the}} drawn Second Test at Antigua, Waugh {{defied the}} Caribbean pacemen on a green pitch at Trinidad suited to their hostile bowling during the Third Test.

An angry Ambrose had to be physically dragged away by his captain: a photograph of this moment {{has become one of the}} iconic images of cricket in the 1990s.

2500|$|The album {{informed}} the developments of genres such as rock, hip hop, jazz, electronic, experimental, punk, pop, {{and is often}} cited {{as one of the}} earliest entries in the canon of psychedelic rock.

[...] Decider wrote that the album [...] "almost single-handedly created the idea of 'baroque pop'." [...] Many Los Angeles record producers imitated the album's orchestral style, which became a component to the sunshine pop acts that followed. Chicago Reader Noah Berlatsky argued that the Beach Boys helped develop smooth soul, bridging a gap between the polished pop harmonizing of the Drifters and the experimentation of the Chi-Lites, particularly with [...] "Sloop John B", whose [...] "fussy" [...] arrangements, [...] "pure" [...] harmonies, and [...] "childish vulnerability" [...] he says [...] "come out of a tradition of pop R". Wilson also became a [...] "godfather" [...] to an era of indie musicians who were inspired by his melodic sensibilities, studio experimentation, and chamber pop orchestrations. Chamber pop itself was based on the template provided by Pet Sounds. Treblezines Ernest Simpson and Wild Nothing's Jack Tatum characterize it as the first emo album.|$|E
