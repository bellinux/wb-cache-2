40|$|Three 54 ha "farmlets" were {{established}} in 2000 near Uralla, NSW to trial high input, moderate input and intensive rotational grazing systems. A representative farm approach was used to interpret the profitability results of the trial from July 2000 to June 2005 at a commercial scale level to make research results more relevant to farmers. At the gross margin level, the high input farmlet had the highest annual gross margins, but this farmlet had the worst whole farm performance. These contrasting results support the claim that annual activity gross margins cannot alone indicate the profitability of an investment. This demonstrates that whole <b>farm</b> <b>analysis</b> is the most suitable method to assess different grazing systems. sheep, grazing systems, pastures, whole <b>farm</b> <b>analysis,</b> Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a management information system to evaluate the tactical management of a breeder flock using individual <b>farm</b> <b>analysis</b> with a deterministic simulation model (IFAS). Individual <b>farm</b> <b>analysis</b> is a method that evaluates the performance of individual farms by comparing them with standards. In the first step of IFAS, a farm accounting system is used to compare performance indicators of a flock with the same performance indicators of the average of a group of flocks that produced in the same time period. In the next step, a deterministic simulation model is used to determine the factors causing the traced deviations in performances. Then, relevant deviations are determined based on the economic and statistical importance of each traced deviation. Finally, the deviations are identified by relevance to give farmers an indication of their strong and weak management practices...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the micro-siting wind resource assessment and near shore wind <b>farm</b> <b>analysis</b> in Pakpanang district, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, southern Thailand. One year of observed wind speed and wind direction {{data from a}} 120 m met tower installed near the shoreline are analyzed in order to investigate the monthly mean wind speeds and dominant wind directions at the site. The observed wind data is used to develop a 20 m resolution microscale map {{of the study area}} in order to analyze several configurations of near shore wind farms in the range of 10 to 90 MW. To this end, annual energy productions (AEP), wake effects, and theoretical capacity factors (TCF) are estimated using WAsP. Results show that the monthly mean wind speeds at 120 m above ground level are in the range of 3. 3 to 5. 3 m/s. The dominant wind at the site are from the NEE and SSW directions. In terms of the near shore wind <b>farm</b> <b>analysis,</b> the maximum net AEP is approximately 170 GWh/year (90 MW wind farm scenario), while the corresponding wind farm's wake loss is 3. 65 %, which corresponds to a 21. 3 % wind farm TCF...|$|E
