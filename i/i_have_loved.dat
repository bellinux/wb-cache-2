5|$|Konkani {{pop music}} became popular after Indian Independence in 1947. Henry D'Souza and Helen D'Cruz {{are known for}} the Konkani love duet Kathrina in 1971 and the love Ballad Garacho Divo (Lamp of the House) in the 1970s, while Wilfy Rebimbus' sonnet Mog Tuzo Kithlo Axelom (How <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Loved</b> Thee) from 1977 is popular. Konkani plays, {{especially}} religious ones, were written and staged in Mangalore in the 20th century by prominent playwrights such as Pedru John D'Souza, Pascal Sequeira and Bonaventure Tauro. The Ghumat was a popular musical instrument played especially during weddings. The instrument has {{the form of an}} earthen pot but is open at both sides. One end is covered with the skin of some wild animal, and the other is left open. The traditional theatre form is called Gumat, and is performed {{on the eve of the}} marriage or in connection with the marriage celebrations in the decorated pandal (stage). The play is conducted by males belonging to both the brides' and bridegrooms' parties, and usually takes place for two or three nights. The plays performed are usually those of Biblical stories, and their morals are presented with the purpose of educating the bride and bridegroom. This tradition has almost completely died out among the present generation.|$|E

500|$|Before the Paris studios {{were fully}} sound-equipped—a process that {{stretched}} well into 1930—a {{number of other}} early French talkies were shot in Germany. The first all-talking German feature, Atlantik, had premiered in Berlin on October 28. Yet another Elstree-made movie, it was rather less German at heart than Les Trois masques and La Route est belle were French; a BIP production with a British scenarist and German director, it was also shot in English as Atlantic. The entirely German Aafa-Film production It's You <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Loved</b> (Dich hab ich geliebt) opened three-and-a-half weeks later.

Her {{father was}} a home builder and later {{successful}} real estate developer, while her mother worked as the bookkeeper for her father's business.

500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge I want him {{to be the one to}} oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So this is the end of an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E
500|$|Professional {{television}} critics deemed Martin Keamy {{a welcome}} {{addition to the}} cast. [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly commented that Kevin Durand [...] "is emerging as a real find this season; he plays that mercenary part with a scene-stealing mix of menace and damaged vulnerability." [...] After Jensen posted what he thought were the fifteen best moments of the season, the New York Posts Jarett Wieselman [...] "ha to complain about one glaring omission from EWs list: Martin Keamy. [...] <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>loved</b> this character all season long—and not just solely for [...] physical attributes ... although those certainly don't hurt." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger reflected, [...] "He was only on the show for a season and not featured all that much in that season, but Kevin Durand always made an impression as Keamy. [...] Lots of actors might have his sheer physical size, but there's a sense of danger (insanity?) that you can't build at the gym, you know?" [...] IGN's Chris Carabott wrote that [...] "Keamy {{is one of the}} more striking new additions to Lost [...] season ... and is a welcome addition to the Lost universe." [...] Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune stated that Keamy has [...] "so much charisma" [...] and she would [...] "rather find out more about [...] than most of the old-school Lost characters". [...] TV Guides Bruce Fretts agreed with a reader's reaction to Durand's [...] "chilling portrayal" [...] of Keamy and posted it in his weekly column. [...] The reader, nicknamed [...] "huntress", wrote [...] "love him or hate him, nobody is neutral when it comes to Keamy, which is the hallmark of a well-played villain. [...] Even the camera seems to linger on Durand, who conveys malice with just a look or tilt of his head. [...] This role should give Durand's career a well-deserved boost".s Secret Weapon]", TV Guide. [...] Retrieved on June 28, 2008.

2500|$|With {{his wife}} Jane's consent, Wells had affairs {{with a number}} of women, {{including}} the American birth control activist Margaret Sanger, adventurer and writer Odette Keun, Soviet spy Moura Budberg and novelist Elizabeth von Arnim. In 1909, he had a daughter, Anna-Jane, with the writer Amber Reeves, whose parents, William and Maud Pember Reeves, he had met through the Fabian Society; and in 1914, a son, Anthony West (1914–1987), by the novelist and feminist Rebecca West, 26 years his junior. After Beatrice Webb voiced disapproval of Wells' [...] "sordid intrigue" [...] with the daughter of veteran Fabian Sidney Olivier, he responded by lampooning Beatrice Webb and her husband Sidney Webb in his 1911 novel The New Machiavelli as 'Altiora and Oscar Bailey', a pair of short-sighted, bourgeois manipulators.
