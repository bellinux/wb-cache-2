40|$|<b>Deletion</b> <b>from</b> open-address {{hash table}} {{is not so}} easy as <b>deletion</b> <b>from</b> chained hash table, because in open-address table we can't simply mark a slot {{containing}} deleted key as empty. Search for keys may become incorrect. The classical method to implement deletion is to mark slots in hash table by three values: "free", "busy", "deleted". That method is easy to implement, but there are some disadvantages. In this article we consider alternative method of deletion keys, where we avoid using the mark "deleted". The article contains the implementation of the method in Java. Comment: 6 page...|$|R

40|$|Several recent {{articles}} have provided new {{evidence for the}} existence of price pressures by examining the price and volume effects associated with changes in the S&P 500. The present study extends this work by examining actual changes in institutional holdings following both additions to, and <b>deletions</b> <b>from,</b> the S&P 500. The results show that changes in institutional holdings in response to additions to, or <b>deletions</b> <b>from,</b> the S&P 500 are positively correlated. In addition to providing further evidence {{for the existence of}} price pressure effects, the results also provide evidence of the very large institutional elasticities of demand for stock.

These findings are {{in sharp contrast to the}} positive relation between liquidity and investment opportunities reported in US equity markets. This unique result in the London Stock Exchange suggests that <b>deletion</b> <b>from</b> a major stock index does not influence corporate investment decisions because there is no significant change in the cost of capital.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{short-term}} {{effects on the}} price of the ethically screened stocks of the Dow Jones Islamic Market World Index (DJIMWI) quarterly revisions. Using a sample of 8, 250 stocks from May 1999 through June 2012, we find a significant price reaction of the ethically screened stocks following additions and deletions. The results show that additions (<b>deletions)</b> <b>from</b> emerging stock markets tend to experience a greater and significantly positive (negative) price response than additions (<b>deletions)</b> <b>from</b> the developed markets. Further tests reveal that the price reactions following DJIMWI revisions are likely to be driven by shifts in investor sentiment rather than changes in firm fundamentals...|$|R

40|$|A {{dominant}} allele of the INO 1 locus, INO 1 - 100, {{does not require}} the positive regulators encoded by INO 2 and INO 4 for expression. Sequence analysis showed that INO 1 - 100 had a 239 bp deletion in the INO 1 promoter. INO 1 - 100 suppressed the inositol auxotrophy of ino 2, ino 4, swi 1, swi 2 and swi 3 mutants. Transcription of INO 1 - 100 was constitutive and independent of these regulators. A 20 bp <b>deletion</b> <b>from</b> - 247 to - 228 caused a similar phenotype. A 38 bp <b>deletion</b> <b>from</b> - 245 to - 208 suppressed the inositol auxotrophy of an ino 2 mutant, but not an ino 4 mutant, indicating that Ino 2 p and Ino 4 p may function alone as well as in a complex. A 40 bp <b>deletion</b> <b>from</b> - 287 to - 248 that removed a URS 1 site caused constitutive transcription that required INO 2 and INO 4. A <b>deletion</b> <b>from</b> - 167 to - 128 suppressed the inositol auxotrophy of swi, ino 2 and ino 4 mutants, indicating the presence of a previously unidentified URS 1. Mutation of the specific negative regulator of phospholipid synthesis encoded by OPI 1 suppressed the inositol auxotrophy of swi 2 mutants. This study indicates that negative regulation of INO 1 is chromatin mediated and provides in vivo information on the interaction of both general and specific regulatory factors that function to accomplish negative and positive regulation of the INO 1 promoter in response to inositol...|$|R
