5000|$|The Torino was {{developed}} by IKA as an Argentine hybrid of AMC's 1964-'65 Rambler American and Classic with exclusively designed front and rear body panels, bumpers and interior. The central body section is from the Classic, and the engine and trunk compartments are derived from the American. Rooflines came from the American as well, and some later Torino sedans featured the attractive [...] "C" [...] pillar {{that was used in}} 1968-69 U.S. American sedans. The rear coil suspension was borrowed from the Classic, albeit with a four link setup rather than a torque tube. One unique feature is the Torino's front unibody [...] "frame rails" [...] borrowed from the Classic convertible (also used in the 1965-'66 Marlin). They are longer than the American, extending all the way back under the car {{to the front of the}} rear rails. This made for a stiffer chassis, better adapting the car to the rougher road conditions of Argentina at the time. The Torino rode on a slightly longer wheelbase (than the American) by one inch - 2723 mm (107-inch). Although the engines were not obtained from American Motors, the vehicle's basic AMC platform continued throughout its lifetime. As upgrades were incorporated over the years, such as AMC's <b>flush</b> <b>door</b> handles, the Torino became mostly a product of Argentina with few imported parts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{present the}} {{development}} of composite <b>flush</b> <b>door</b> shutter for ecological purpose (eco-composite) using natural fibre like bamboo, jute and their basic mechanical properties. Here, 100 percent indigenous technologies were applied to make <b>flush</b> <b>door</b> shutter of solid core type. Different thermosetting resin adhesives were used as matrix at different stage. The experimental results [as per IS: 2202 (Part I) ] of the physico-mechanical properties like surface finishing, tensile strength, internal bond strength, density, screw withdrawal and glue shear strength etc. of the <b>flush</b> <b>door</b> had a sufficient specific strength (influenced by the dilution of resin matrix) which is equivalent {{to that of the}} conventional wooden <b>flush</b> <b>door.</b> This technique for the production of <b>flush</b> <b>door</b> using fast growing natural fibre is cost effective and could be an ideal solution with ever depleting forest reserves...|$|E
