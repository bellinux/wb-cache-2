Under von Horn, U-43 patrolled off Cattaro, having to crash dive at least once to escape attack from enemy torpedo boats. On 17 March, while {{returning}} to Cattaro from patrol, the crew of the Austro-Hungarian destroyer [...] mistook U-43 for an enemy submarine and rammed her, damaging the diving planes. U-43 sailed for Fiume for three months of repairs.|$|E
500|$|SM U-16 was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 6 October {{under the command}} of Linienschiffsleutnant Eugen <b>Hornyák</b> Edler von Horn. Over the next month U-16 patrolled off Rimini and the Po estuary before heading to Kotor. There, U-16s second commander, Linienschiffsleutnant Orest Ritter von Zopa, assumed command on 18 November. The U-boat departed the next day to patrol off Albania. Near Cape Rodoni, von Zopa stopped and boarded Fiore Albania, an Albanian sailing ship. Finding nothing amiss, the commander sent Fiore Albania on her way. Three days later, von Zopa and U-16 scored their first success, when they sank the [...] Italian sailing vessel Unione in the Gulf of Drin. Later the same day, a torpedo attack on two cargo ships in the harbor at Shëngjin netted no results. With her supply of torpedoes expended, U-16 returned to Kotor on 24 November.|$|E

5000|$|By 1991, <b>Hornyak's</b> {{work had}} been {{reviewed}} in the prestigious journals ARTnews, Art Auction, Art in America, Beaux-Arts (France) and Mizue (China), but continued to evolve. Increasingly introspective, in 1994 art reviewer Bernard Théoret noted that her [...] "'appeal to the unconscious was impressionistic like {{an invitation to the}} garden of the soul". Flowers soon became her symbol of [...] "universality" [...] and dominant subject. Influenced by the graphic still lifes of Giorgio Morandi, her signature style, of [...] "semi-figurative, almost abstract, works... built up through a complex technique of richly coloured glazes", was evident by 2003.|$|R
500|$|Evangelion {{has had a}} {{significant}} impact on Japanese popular culture. The series also had a strong influence on anime, at a time when the anime industry and televised anime series in particular were in a slump period. CNET reviewer Tim <b>Hornyak</b> credits the series with revitalizing and transforming the giant mecha genre. In the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese animation knew a period of crisis and decreased production that coincided with the economic crisis in Japan. This was followed by a crisis of ideas in the years to come. Against this background, Evangelion imposed new standards for the animated serial, ushering in the era of the [...] "new Japanese animation serial", characterized by innovations that allowed a technical and artistic revival of the industry. The production of anime serials began to reflect greater author control, the concentration of resources in fewer but higher quality episodes (typically ranging from 13 to 26), a directorial approach similar to live film, and greater freedom from the constraints of merchandising.|$|E
