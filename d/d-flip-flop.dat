Assuming a ring-oscillator structure, the outputs of a VCO toggle between two discrete levels (V DD and GND) like a CMOS digital gate, enabling simple multibit quantization using <b>D-flip-flops.</b> Since only one VCO output phase transitions at a given sampling instant while all others saturate to the positive/negative supply, quantization is robust to flip-flop voltage offsets and metastability, and has guaranteed monotonicity.

As long as it oscillates, the VCO output phase accumulates endlessly, implying that it is also an integrator with infinite DC gain. However, the nonlinearity in the VCO’s voltage-to-frequency (K v) transfer characteristic seriously limits the resolution of VCO-based ADCs (Fig. 9. 5. 1, top).

The only global net in the self-timed netlist is a reset signal. The PL netlist is a micropipelined system with two-phase control.

The fine-grain approach uses a one-to-one mapping of gates in the clocked system to PL gates that use a 4 -input Lookup-Table (LUT 4) as the logic element with delay-insensitive dual-rail routing between gates. This technology could form the basis for the implementation of a self-timed FGPA.

The design of high-performance and low-power clocked storage elements is essential and critical to achieving maximum levels of performance and reliability in modern VLSI systems such as Systems on Chips (SoCs). In this thesis, a pulse-clocked double edge-triggered <b>D-flip-flop</b> (PDET) is proposed. PDET uses a new split-output true single-phase clocked (TSPC) latch and when clocked by a short pulse train acts like a double edge-triggered flip-flop. The P-type version of the new TSPC split-output latch is compared with existing TSPC split-output latches in terms of robustness, area, and power efficiency at high-speeds. It is shown that the new split-output latch is more area-power efficient, and significantly more robust, than the existing split-output CMOS latches. The novel double edge-triggered flip-flop uses only eight transistors with only one N-type transistor being clocked. Compared to other double edge-triggered flip-flops, PDET offers advantages in terms of speed, power, and area.

A Single-Edge-Triggering (SET) & Double-Edge-Triggering (DET) one-dimensional pipeline gating scheme is proposed to improve the speed, the power awareness and area in designs. In one-dimensional pipeline, clock the registers (D-FF) at both edges i. e. positive as well negative (data flow in pipeline) and horizontal direction (within each pipeline stage). This technique only needs very little additional area and the overhead is hardly noticeable. A set of Hybrid Multiplier were designed and tested. Results show that the new 32 -bit Hybrid Multiplier using this technique has low power and high speed at lower clock frequency as compare to other designs. With increasing clock frequencies and silicon integration, power aware computing has become a critical concern {{in the design of}} embedded processors and systems-on-chip. One of the more effective and widely used methods for power aware computing is Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS). In order to obtain the maximum power savings from DVS, it is essential to scale the supply voltage as low as possible while ensuring correct operation of the processor. The critical voltage is chosen such that under a worst case scenario of process and environmental variations, the processor always operates correctly. However, this approach leads to a very conservative supply voltage since such a worst case combination of different variability will be very rare.

30|$|A {{reversible}} one-bit comparator {{is realized}} using the existing reversible gates such as Fredkin, Peres, Toffoli, R, URG, TR {{and the newly}} proposed gate BJN (Nagamani et al. 2011). The drawback of their work is {{that the number of}} reversible gates required for each implementation is more. Also it produces more number of garbage outputs and the circuit uses more number of constant inputs. Another work on reversible one – bit comparator is designed using a single SCG gate (Digantha et al. 2011). The number of garbage outputs produced is 1. It uses 2 constant inputs. The transistor representation of their circuit is not given. Since the logical expressions involved in SCG is complex, definitely it requires more number of transistors to implement. To minimize the transistor count, we have proposed two new 3 × 3 reversible gates which can be combined for its use as a reversible 1 -bit comparator. Few works were reported on reversible half subtractors. A reversible half subtractor is realized by Murali (Murali et al. 2002). The drawback of this work is that the critical path delay of a single reversible gate is 4. A work on reversible binary subtractors is carried out using new reversible TR gate (Thapliyal 2011). The number of reversible gates required is one and the critical path delay associated with this circuit is 4. Hence, we have designed a reversible full subtractor using two TR gates. Only few works were reported on reversible sequential elements. A work on reversible D – flip-flop contains four New gates and one Feynman gate, a total of 7 reversible gates and produces 8 garbage outputs (Sivakumar et al. 2006). Another work on reversible master–slave <b>D-flip-flop</b> is reported by Noor Muhammed Nayeem, Lafifa Jamal and Hafiz Md. Hasan Babu (Noor Muhammed et al. 2009). The number of reversible gates required is 5 and the number of garbage outputs produced by this circuit is 2. The circuit is minimized in terms of gate count and garbage outputs.|$|E
40|$|CLB is {{composed}} by a 16 X 1 SRAM storing the programming {{bits of the}} LUT and by a 16 X 1 multiplexer to select the output implementing the function F(ll,I 2, 13,l 4). The output of MUX 16 (combinatorial function) can be directly Connected to the interconnect network, or {{can be stored in}} the <b>D-Flip-Flop.</b> The 2 input multiplexer MUX 2 selects which output is given as the CLB output. The 4 -input multiplexers MUX 4 are used to select the interconnections between the various CLBs. The programming bits used as select bits of the multiplexer are stored in another SRAM. Since routing is not in the scope of this paper, in Fig. 1 we have just introduced the minimum resources for covering this aspect. Modifying the number of the multiplexers or the number of select bits, major routing resources can be supported. The resources of this CLB are of two types: the memoly elements @-FF and SRAM) and multiplexers. In this work we propose two different modalities to check the presence of faults of those components. For the memory elements we use a Built In Current Sensor (BICS) similar to that proposed in [7]. The Gnd and the Vcc nodes of the memory elements are connected to the nodes of the BICS sensor to detect anomalous dissipated current. Although various BlCS sensors have been proposed in the literature (e. g. [a], [9]), we use the conservative scheme proposed in [7] because it uses a limited number of transistors. For the multiplexers in the CLB we use the scheme described in paper [IO]. Fig. 2 shows how to check a 4 input multiplexer by adding two inverters (M 17 M 18 and M 19 M 20) to its output(out). The transistors used in the inverter are characterized by different aspect ratios to achieve different voltage thresholds. In the following, we call VT, and Vn the two different thresholds. If the out node is at an intermediate voltage the outputs el and e 2 present different voltage levels values, othenvise el and e 2 are at the same level. GND<V,,<Vr, vTl<V*"t<v...|$|E
