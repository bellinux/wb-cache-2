She said of the song: [...] "I wrote this song as I was travelling around the world... They say 'a Gypsy doesn't have a home.' But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> home. I have a home with you always." [...] Seated atop a piano wearing a bra and short blond hair, Gaga performed an acoustic version of the song, singing with a heavy German accent while sporting a moustache. Brenna Ehlrich of MTV noted that: [...] "Throughout the performance, fans looked on with tears in their eyes, watching as Gaga unfurled the simple love story with nothing but her voice and piano." [...] Malene Arpe, entertainment contributor to the Toronto Star, said her performance was goosebump-inducing and caused viewers {{to forget about the}} moustache [...] "right {{in the middle of her}} face." ...|$|E

500|$|City of Death {{is one of}} five Doctor Who serials {{from the}} series' {{original}} run (1963–1989) not to have been novelised by Target Books; the others are The Pirate Planet, Shada, Resurrection of the Daleks, and Revelation of the Daleks. Target approached Douglas Adams {{on a number of occasions}} with a view to commissioning a novelisation, offering their standard advance of £600; Adams replied saying, [...] "I don't want to be embarrassing but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tendency to be a best-selling author". Target, concerned that their regular authors would seek better terms, refused to change their offer. Several years later, Target editor Nigel Robinson offered an advance of £4,000– double what was the standard advance at the time– but Adams again declined. Adams was unwilling to allow another author to write the novelisation. However, after Adams' death his estate allowed Gareth Roberts to write an adaptation of the unfinished serial Shada, which was published by BBC Books in 2012. In 2013, Roberts announced that he was working on a novelisation of City of Death, to be published on 21 May 2015. Roberts later announced that James Goss was working on the book instead.|$|E
2500|$|ABC news {{consultant}} and retired army Major General William Nash was quoted by ABC news {{as saying he}} had [...] "no problem" [...] with organizations providing Bibles and other religious tracts to United States troops. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem," [...] said Nash, [...] "with military equipment being labeled in a way where it seems like it's our god against their god." [...] Military Religious Freedom Foundation (MRFF) president Mikey Weinstein said that a private company can do whatever it wants to, but when a company becomes a defense contractor, responsibilities change. MRFF, one of the lead organizations in publicizing the problem—helping to break the stories on ABC news and Nightline—was initially criticized by Trijicon as a [...] "non-Christian" [...] group, but criticism of the verses on military weapons was quickly leveled by numerous secular and religious groups, including Christian and interfaith organizations.

2500|$|His {{experiences}} in Manchuria were also deeply influential on his writing, imprinting terrors and fever dreams {{which are now}} surrealist hallmarks of his works. In his recollections of Mukden, these markers are evident: [...] "The fact is, {{it may not have}} been trash in the center of the marsh at all; it may have been crows. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> memory of thousands of crows flying up from the swamp at dusk, as if the surface of the swamp were being lifted up into the air." [...] The trash of the marsh was a truth of life, as were the crows, yet Abe's recollections of them tie them distinctly. Further experiences with the swamp centered around its use as a staking ground for condemned criminals with [...] " [...] heads--now food for crows-- appearing suddenly out of the darkness and disappearing again, terrified and attracted to us."

2500|$|The British press have widely publicised various {{statements}} made by UKIP activists and candidates which have been regarded as racist, sexist or otherwise bigoted. Among the [...] "countless examples" [...] of UKIP representatives and supporters embarrassing the party have been an MEP who called for {{a ban on the}} construction of mosques and for all British Muslims to sign a code of conduct, a councillor who suggested that shops should be allowed to refuse service to women and homosexuals, and a candidate councillor who compared Islam to Nazism and told black comedian Lenny Henry to leave Britain after the latter called for greater ethnic diversity within the UK's creative industries. In 2015, a documentary called Meet the Ukippers filmed activists making racist statements; one stated [...] "the only people <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> problem with are negroes". For many years such individuals were internally tolerated within the party, although as part of Farage's push to professionalise the party a number of its members—such as MEP Godfrey Bloom—were expelled for making comments that brought UKIP into disrepute.|$|E

2500|$|The police dashcam video {{shows that}} 40 seconds elapsed between when Yanez first {{started talking to}} Castile through the car window and when Yanez began {{shooting}} at him. According to the dashcam, after Yanez asked for Castile's driver's license and proof of insurance, Castile gave him his proof of insurance card, which Yanez appeared to glance at and tuck in his outer pocket. Castile then calmly informed Yanez: [...] "Sir, I {{have to tell you}} that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> firearm on me." [...] Quoting the Star Tribune description of the next 13 seconds of the audio/video: Before Castile completed the sentence, Yanez interrupted and calmly replied, “OK,” and placed his right hand on the holster of his own holstered weapon. Yanez said, “Okay, don't reach for it, then ... don't pull it out.” Castile responded, “I'm not pulling it out,” and Reynolds also said, “He's not pulling it out.” Yanez repeated, raising his voice, “Don't pull it out!" [...] as he quickly pulled his own gun with his right hand and reached inside the driver's window with his left hand. Reynolds screamed, [...] "No!" [...] Yanez removed his left arm from the car and fired seven shots in the direction of Castile in rapid succession. [...] Reynolds yelled, “You just killed my boyfriend!” [...] Castile moaned and said, “I wasn't reaching for it." [...] Reynolds loudly said, “He wasn't reaching for it.” Before she completed her sentence, Yanez again screamed, “Don't pull it out!” Reynolds responded, “He wasn't.” Yanez yelled, “Don't move!

[...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Wang and Wei served their master faithfully, and that was why I retained them. [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. [...] Why?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me in my presence and make secret speeches against what I do.' [...] If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss it with Your Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in your presence. [...] That is not how Houji [...] and Ziqi [...] served Emperor Shun."

2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse.

That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E
2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time I was living in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, I was living in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E

Penalties, forsooth! as if I hadn't been punished enough already by the harassing curtain-lectures of my over-scrupulous wife, ever since the unlucky day when the baubles were found, not to mention the uneasy probings of my own conscience, which, to say truth, I had feared was dead altogether owing to the villainous moral atmosphere of this smuggling place, but which I find quite lively and strong yet--a matter of some consolation too, for although <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> weakness for cheap 'baccy and brandy, being of an economical turn of mind, I don't like the notion of getting rid of my conscience altogether.
